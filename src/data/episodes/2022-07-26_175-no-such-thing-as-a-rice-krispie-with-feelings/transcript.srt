00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,500
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

2
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,620
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

3
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,460
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anichezinski and Andrew

4
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,100
 Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:39,880
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with you

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
 Andy.

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:49,480
 My fact is that it takes 10 years to learn how to make artificial sushi to make it well

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,100
 to make it well sorry any mug can just wait.

9
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,260
 My one could get some plasticine and make some fake sushi right?

10
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,020
 Not toy sushi as in Japan there's this amazing tradition where basically all restaurants

11
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:11,740
 have their whole menu reproduced in plastic outside the restaurant to lure you in to say

12
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,740
 how good this looks.

13
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,900
 Like when people, there's a place around the corner from us that is a restaurant and

14
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,460
 they cook one meal every day and they put it on a table outside and it's just a display

15
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,460
 meal.

16
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,300
 Oh yes it's a display meal I always wanted to take that display meal because they put

17
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,120
 a whole pizza outside and you think why doesn't someone just come along and have this?

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
 I don't get it.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
 I'm so close.

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
 How has someone not got that?

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,520
 They must be poisoned right?

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
 And there's a glass of wine.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
 They must be.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,080
 There's a glass of white wine just sitting there.

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,020
 We're going to take it guys you know who you are.

26
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,920
 Have any of you ever eaten in that restaurant?

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
 No.

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
 Oh yes I have.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
 I have.

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
 It's great.

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,760
 It's kind of just society isn't it?

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,120
 You just don't steal things?

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,120
 Yeah.

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,360
 I'm not saying it's a bad thing that people don't steal things in general.

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
 Right.

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
 It's a trust exercise.

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
 Yeah.

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,960
 I don't know what a waste won't it?

39
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,900
 It's like taking something out of a bin.

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,900
 And we all do that.

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,900
 I guess.

42
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,840
 So this is kind of like the equivalent of high street shops having mannequins in the window

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
 completely.

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
 Displaying their clothes.

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
 Apart from all the clothes are fake.

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
 Yes.

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,880
 And there's an actual industry devoted to making fake clothes which no one will ever wear.

48
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,920
 Yeah but you might make the clothes out of say toilet paper or something instead.

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
 Yes.

50
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,480
 Because it's cheaper and it shows them off.

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
 Yeah.

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,320
 Or is it not cheaper?

53
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
 Why?

54
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,720
 But there was an economist article all about this and then it turns out this is a massive

55
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
 thing.

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,280
 And I was in Japan about five years ago and it is true.

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,240
 It's basically every restaurant has this stuff outside it.

58
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,560
 And the thing is buying these things is really expensive.

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,880
 As in, the sale price is about 20 times the price of the actual piece of sushi to buy a plastic

60
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
 piece of sushi.

61
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
 Yeah.

62
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
 But then it lasts a lot longer.

63
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
 It's the good thing.

64
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
 And you're only buying one.

65
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
 And you're only buying one.

66
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
 And you're only buying one.

67
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,680
 You can rent a burger for a month for a thousand yen and have it outside it because getting

68
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,320
 a whole menu done is costs thousands of pounds.

69
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
 Yeah.

70
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
 The equivalent of.

71
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,400
 I was reading that actually a lot of the companies that make these things don't do very

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
 well in business because they are so long lasting these things.

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,200
 So once you've sold it to someone then that bit of sushi last 10 years and so they're giving

74
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
 you our business.

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,120
 And so they're trying to sell them to China and to Europe now because everyone's got

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
 them in Japan.

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,480
 They should do what Apple do and make them break after two years.

78
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
 That's a very yes.

79
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
 Intentional obsolescence.

80
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
 So whatever they call it.

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
 Yes.

82
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,600
 Or like football kits, they should make new ones every year, new kind of sushi.

83
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,080
 So you always have to have the most trendy sushi outside your restaurant.

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
 That's what I was thinking.

85
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,000
 I wonder if there's a plastic sushi chef who's innovating new meals and releasing them

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 and they're going, "God, we got to replicate this now."

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,240
 Well, they don't really do that because the way they make these plastic imitations is

88
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
 so precise.

89
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
 So get this.

90
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,200
 They will send a designer to the restaurant where the food is made who will observe it.

91
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,760
 They've got some photos of the food, he'll make an architect sketch and then he goes back

92
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,800
 to the factory and he says, "We have to make it precisely like this."

93
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,240
 And that every individual piece is made with a mould.

94
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
 Okay.

95
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,160
 So he makes the mould first and then he...

96
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,640
 No, he visits the restaurant, sees the food, designs the mould, builds the mould and then

97
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,360
 presses a single, amazing piece.

98
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
 Nice.

99
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,920
 So the mould for making a bit of tuna is actually made by pushing a bit of tuna into the

100
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
 machine.

101
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
 Oh really?

102
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
 They use the fish to make the mould.

103
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
 I believe so.

104
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
 The fish would get squash.

105
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
 Yeah.

106
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
 That's not going to retain its shape.

107
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
 This is what I agree.

108
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
 I agree.

109
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
 I have had sushi once.

110
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
 And...

111
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,920
 One more time than you've had before, sorry.

112
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
 Yes.

113
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
 But no, it's incredibly precise.

114
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,640
 And 80% of the industry is one set of factories, it's one company, basically.

115
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
 Okay.

116
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,600
 And all the rest is little cottage industries and workshops and artisans around that.

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,880
 So why is it take 10 years to learn how to be a plastic sushi chef?

118
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,200
 It's very precise and it's a very artistic thing.

119
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,760
 To make it really good, you know, to be a master, which is about as long as it takes to become

120
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
 a master sushi chef.

121
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
 Trust it.

122
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,640
 There are people out there who have both spent 10 years of their life.

123
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,640
 I wonder if at a certain time, at culinary school, you have to decide if you're going to

124
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,880
 go into plastics or...

125
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
 Yeah.

126
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
 And must be a time.

127
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,880
 And do you reckon it's the best ones who go into plastics or the slightly rubbish ones

128
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,600
 who don't get very good grades?

129
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,880
 The thing is, they make these plastic vegetables and then they do cut them with real knives.

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,040
 So it's like, it's a bizarre, proper, sheffing mixed with plastic sheffing.

131
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,800
 And they've been doing it for ages, haven't they?

132
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
 Yeah.

133
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,840
 So I think it started in about the 1920s and it was because they didn't have menus.

134
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,160
 And so instead of a menu, you'd have this display of apparently that was easier.

135
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,160
 I would have thought drawing something on a menu was easier.

136
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
 Yeah, crazy that that came first.

137
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
 Yeah.

138
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,400
 They were getting new foods from the West as well.

139
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,040
 So to explain what these are to your customers, it's easier to have it on display outside.

140
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,600
 Because you can see, like, on a menu, it could be any size, for example.

141
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,640
 Or if you've had it molded.

142
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,760
 You can put something next to it for perspective.

143
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
 Next to every meal, you could put like a little dog.

144
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,720
 And then you would know how big it was.

145
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,040
 But that's the thing James, dogs are very in size, famously.

146
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,240
 All right, I should have chosen something more standard.

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,760
 Well, a plastic bit of sushi, just put that next to it.

148
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,120
 And then that'll show you next to your tuna sashimi.

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
 Which is a good idea.

150
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
 Which is a good idea.

151
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,480
 The best thing putting plastic sushi next to real sushi to give an impression of the size.

152
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,880
 No, next to a real Western, like...

153
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,320
 Sit your elbows and stuff like that.

154
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
 That would be a good idea, yes.

155
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,040
 Have we ever said that about salmon sashimi?

156
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
 No.

157
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,680
 The weird thing about it is that it's just not at all Japanese, and that it was brought to Japan

158
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
 by Norway.

159
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
 Oh, really?

160
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,840
 So people didn't eat salmon sashimi in Japan until the 1980s.

161
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,920
 And then Norway had a shed load of fish that it couldn't sell and it had to offload.

162
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,160
 Really wanted to sew out its fishing industry.

163
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,520
 And they had a meeting with the Japanese and thought, "Well, this is a country that loves

164
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
 eating fish."

165
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,280
 And so they started offloading all their fish and selling it to Japan and trying to market

166
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
 it as sushi.

167
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,160
 Even then, so it was in about 1985 that they started eating salmon in Japan.

168
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,160
 Even then, it took about 10 years before they started eating it without cooking it.

169
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
 Wow, what was that?

170
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,360
 Yeah, do we know what brought the country to sort of shift the attitude?

171
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,720
 Norway just kept forcing it down there for a minute.

172
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
 That is true.

173
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,200
 I think they just had loads of it to sell, didn't they?

174
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
 Yeah.

175
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 And they just needed a new market for it.

176
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
 Yeah, okay.

177
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
 That is amazing.

178
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
 It was 1995.

179
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,320
 But I guess, even if you're used to eating raw tuna, it doesn't follow that you should

180
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
 eat raw salmon.

181
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,240
 There's some people eat raw beef, don't they?

182
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
 Yeah.

183
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
 When you had a steak or chopped up.

184
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,760
 But if you were to give someone raw chicken, or raw pork, or chopped up, it's not a natural

185
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
 thing.

186
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
 Yeah, it's a mad idea, actually.

187
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
 Well, isn't it?

188
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
 You crack a raw egg on top of that?

189
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
 I'd probably give it a try.

190
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
 Raw chicken.

191
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
 Yeah.

192
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
 Yeah.

193
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
 Probably just the ones.

194
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:31,480
 Actually, sushi isn't quite as old as you might think, modern sushi, anyway.

195
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,160
 The first kind of sushi was Nare sushi, which is from the third century BC.

196
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,600
 But that was basically just pickled fish.

197
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,440
 So you put fish in a barrel with some rice and with some vinegar and leave it there for

198
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,040
 like a year.

199
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,240
 And then when it came out, it was pickled and it was edible.

200
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,920
 But actually, they would also scrape all the rice off.

201
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,240
 So unlike this kind of sushi that we eat today, they would deliberately get rid of all

202
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,120
 the rice and only eat the fish part.

203
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
 That's amazing.

204
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,520
 So did the rice help pickle it?

205
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,320
 It helps their fermentation, yeah, because if you ferment something, you need a carbohydrates

206
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
 to do that.

207
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,760
 So we're sort of eating the packaging when we eat sushi and rice.

208
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
 Yeah.

209
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,120
 Did they eventually just get tired of scraping off the rice and a couple of grains of rice

210
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
 stayed on?

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,560
 And then there are a few more grains of rice and that eventually is a massive lump of

212
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
 rice.

213
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,240
 I think what happened was the next one that came was Han Nare sushi.

214
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,920
 And that was, they didn't leave it in the barrel for nearly as long.

215
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,240
 I think they probably got a bit bored of waiting for the sushi.

216
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,600
 And so they would open the barrel a bit earlier and then they would eat the fish with the rice.

217
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,000
 And my guess is, and this is just a guess, maybe it was a bit more sour, a bit more pickly,

218
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,760
 so that kind of took the edge off a bit.

219
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
 I don't know.

220
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
 OK.

221
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,320
 I'm guessing as well that they were always eating sashimi with a bowl of rice next to them.

222
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,880
 They just hadn't combined the two as a single meal.

223
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,320
 And have they, someone dropped one bit into the other and magic happened?

224
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,320
 Yeah.

225
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,040
 I think they would have combined it as in they would have dropped sushi on top of their

226
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
 bowl of rice.

227
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,960
 They would have eaten the two together like we do cornflakes into a bowl and then put milk

228
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,880
 in it, but you don't sell milk and cornflakes together.

229
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
 They should.

230
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
 Yeah.

231
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
 Exactly.

232
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
 Why don't they?

233
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
 Because it goes soggy.

234
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,080
 Oh my god, it's such a bad idea.

235
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,560
 It's, don't do that.

236
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
 What an about-face.

237
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,160
 I mean, just a second or two.

238
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
 Quickest switcher room.

239
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
 I never heard.

240
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,000
 You'd be great on Dragon's Day, though, because I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 No.

242
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 OK.

243
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Yeah.

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,160
 While we're on milk and cereal, so I was reading and asking, this is kind of related to how

245
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
 food is represented.

246
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,240
 There's an amazing guardian article about the secrets of food photographers, because in

247
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,400
 the west we basically do this, we basically make artificial food in order to make it look

248
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
 good.

249
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
 Yeah.

250
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
 But we're doing it with real food sometimes.

251
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
 Like an advertising, you mean, or stuff?

252
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
 Yes.

253
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
 Exactly like that.

254
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,640
 So strawberries get covered in lipstick, this is all from individual photographers.

255
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,920
 It's not like it's industry standards, but everyone has their own secret box of tricks.

256
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,120
 It's a converted sometimes prey with WD40.

257
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,520
 The milk is almost never real milk, when you see a bowl of milk and cereal on a cereal

258
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
 packet.

259
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,880
 It's, it can be hair cream.

260
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
 It can be white glue.

261
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
 Oh.

262
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
 That's a big thing.

263
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,880
 And then you just shove the corn flakes into the top of it to make it look delicious.

264
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,400
 That makes sense.

265
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,160
 Sometimes, if you need steam, if you've got a pasta dish and you're steaming in a bowl,

266
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,040
 one photographer puts incense in there and lets it smoke away and then just remove the

267
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
 incense in post-production.

268
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,200
 And one photographer said she, her method, was to microwave wet tampons and then put them

269
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
 behind the pasta.

270
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
 So they were steaming.

271
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
 Wow.

272
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,840
 It's steam, particularly on photogenic on its own when it's naturally just hot.

273
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
 Yes, yes it is.

274
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
 It must be.

275
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
 There must be a sign.

276
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
 It must be a photogenic.

277
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,360
 Well, they, I mean, this is, I mean, I think it's quite well known that they do use different

278
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
 things in adverts.

279
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
 Yeah.

280
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,760
 I didn't know any of those examples, but I think that is quite well known.

281
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,240
 John Lloyd, for people listening, he's a guy who created QI, he used to do a lot of adverts

282
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,600
 and he used to say that whenever he did a food product, like a cereal or something, that

283
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,920
 in between takes, there was someone who would come and sort of move a rice crispy into a

284
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,040
 better spot of the bowl and like, you know, as if you were doing someone's make-up between

285
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
 takes.

286
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,960
 Do you remember when China hosted the Olympics and there was that girl who sung the solo,

287
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,000
 but they put another more attractive girl on the TV for it.

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Oh no.

289
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,560
 I don't get it like that, but then it's more serious to do that than to change your rice

290
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
 crispy, I think.

291
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
 I guess the rice crispy doesn't mind as much.

292
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,800
 No one is pretending that this is a photo of a real bowl of rice crispy.

293
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
 Yeah, they are.

294
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
 They are.

295
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,280
 Actually, James, I can't see any difference except that rice crispy can't be.

296
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
 They don't have feelings.

297
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
 They don't have feelings.

298
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
 And they can't be upset.

299
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,800
 They don't have those faces and those costumes.

300
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,920
 If you think they don't have feelings, yeah, then the advertising hasn't worked on you.

301
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
 I don't think.

302
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,440
 Well, they try to do because if I thought the rice crispy's had feelings, I probably won't

303
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
 want to eat them.

304
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,960
 I think I would enjoy it more.

305
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
 As they screamed.

306
00:11:51,960 --> 00:12:00,760
 So, on sushi, sushi obviously depends on that seaweed that wraps around it to be maize.

307
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,400
 And so, you know, basically, the person who brought sushi to Japan, who made it a viable

308
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
 commercial product in Japan?

309
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
 No, is it Mr. Nori?

310
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
 Because I saw it's called it.

311
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
 It wasn't Mr. Nori.

312
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,360
 It wasn't Jack O'Nouri, the Irish.

313
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,040
 It wasn't that, though, very good suggestion.

314
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,440
 It was a woman, actually, who was from Lancashire.

315
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,800
 It was a woman called Kathleen Mary Drew Baker.

316
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,600
 And she was studying the Welsh equivalent of Nori, which is the Japanese seaweed that wraps

317
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,920
 around sushi.

318
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,040
 And in 1949, she discovered that this tiny algae was actually the lava of Nori.

319
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,200
 And before that, no one in Japan had known our department commercially because they hadn't

320
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,400
 been able to work out how to get it to propagate successfully.

321
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,640
 So, in Japan, they loved it.

322
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,880
 They loved sushi, but they couldn't sell it ever because they would eat little bits of it,

323
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
 but they couldn't farm it.

324
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,040
 And this woman just figured out this random thing, I think she was studying at Manchester

325
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,520
 at the time, about Welsh seaweed.

326
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
 And they picked up on it.

327
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,760
 And suddenly, a revolutionized sushi, and it meant they had a sushi industry.

328
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,200
 And they now celebrate her.

329
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,640
 So, she's this woman who no one in this country has heard of, and who never visited Japan,

330
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
 is celebrated there.

331
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,960
 She's known as Mother of the Sea.

332
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,920
 There's a festival held in her honour every year in Osaka on April the 14th.

333
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,920
 And people go and they pray to her and they give offerings.

334
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,160
 They sing these special songs that they think of the Drew monument, which is a monument to

335
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
 her.

336
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
 So, it's like, it should be a monument to you, Drew.

337
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
 No.

338
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
 Well, that's not my name.

339
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
 My name is Laying.

340
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,640
 So, I don't know why we're friends.

341
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,040
 Japanese restaurants still don't hire women sushi restaurants.

342
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,440
 I think most of them don't hire women.

343
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,240
 This is in, we're talking in Japan.

344
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
 In Japan.

345
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
 Yeah.

346
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
 That's right.

347
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
 One time.

348
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
 When I went to itsy, that one time.

349
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
 Because what?

350
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
 The woman was buying the counter.

351
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
 Yeah.

352
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
 Why don't they hire women?

353
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
 The chefs.

354
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
 As the chefs, yes.

355
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
 Sorry.

356
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,480
 So, I think there's a superstition in Japan that women's body temperature is too high.

357
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
 Or there was a really...

358
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,480
 We don't want to cook that raw fish.

359
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
 Fine.

360
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,480
 To be by your touch.

361
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,480
 Good luck running your raw chicken restaurant tonight, because that chicken is going to be

362
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
 fried.

363
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:06,440
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

364
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,680
 And that is Anna.

365
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:16,680
 My fact is that when Mount Vesuvius erupted, it created many volcanoes in some people's heads.

366
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
 Oh, look.

367
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
 This is really...

368
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,560
 OK, so first of all, it's not, when you say in their heads, you don't mean they're thinking

369
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,600
 about it and it didn't really happen.

370
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 No, no.

371
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
 It was very much real.

372
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,240
 This is, I'm talking about the famous eruption in, oh God, 49.

373
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
 79.

374
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
 Thank you.

375
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
 That's good together, right now.

376
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
 1979?

377
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
 Yeah, yeah.

378
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,160
 It was glossed over by that, as election went, but it didn't happen.

379
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,320
 So this is the eruption of Vesuvius in '79, '80.

380
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,080
 And it's the fact that I read about this in a review of a book called Caesar's Last Breath,

381
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,480
 which has just come out, it's by someone called Sam Kean.

382
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,280
 And it's about the history and the science of air.

383
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
 Yes.

384
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
 Sorry.

385
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
 I think we all paused, because I think that's a familiar name.

386
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,280
 He wrote the written book that we've got called the Disappearing Spoon, actually.

387
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
 That's it.

388
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
 Yeah, really good about chemistry.

389
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
 He's a great author, yeah.

390
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,800
 Well, this sounds incredible, and I've ordered it, and so he was wrote about this, and he

391
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,120
 said that when Vesuvius erupted, the heat made a hole in some people's skulls.

392
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,320
 And then because of the pressure and the heat, the water in people's brains started to boil,

393
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,040
 and then all the chemicals and substances in their brain started to boil, and they turned

394
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,880
 into a gas, and then they were ejected out of the little holes in their skulls.

395
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,760
 So they had these holes in their skulls that were ejecting steams and other chemicals.

396
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,680
 And it's really gruesome, but it was 2000 years ago, guys.

397
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,920
 So I think we can laugh about it now.

398
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
 It's amazing.

399
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
 It's really grim.

400
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
 It's really grim.

401
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,640
 I know, but it's extraordinary, right?

402
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,320
 Because what did it do?

403
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:47,680
 The heat burnt through the air, just through the skull, boiled and created a mini volcano,

404
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,640
 a rutting out of the people who were being killed by the volcano.

405
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
 That's insane.

406
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
 Yes.

407
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,280
 It sounds like, you know, in a cartoon, when someone gets really mad.

408
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
 Yes.

409
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
 Yes.

410
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,480
 And smoke comes out of there, ears usually, but if they got really mad, maybe it would

411
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
 just burst out with this guy.

412
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,720
 Well, it sounds like someone's microwave to tampon and put it in their ears.

413
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,720
 But yeah, that's it.

414
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,680
 I've never heard anything remotely like that happening.

415
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
 It's weird.

416
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,200
 And I just love the fact that he's obviously made that.

417
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,760
 So it was all Sam Keen saying, it created mini volcano.

418
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,440
 Because it's not a real volcano, because it's not magma.

419
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
 It's not magma.

420
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
 No.

421
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,200
 And they're not large geological formations.

422
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,440
 But it did make people's heads steam when the...

423
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
 Yeah.

424
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
 It made them explode, didn't it?

425
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
 It made them explode.

426
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,600
 Sorry, because there are lots of different stages, aren't there, of the explosion?

427
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
 So there was...

428
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,440
 Part of it, people were being buried in ash, and then part of it, is this when the pyroclastic

429
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
 flow hit?

430
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,720
 This will be when it was at its hottest.

431
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
 So yes.

432
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,240
 I think it was a combination of that sudden heat and sudden pressure.

433
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
 Okay.

434
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
 Friends.

435
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
 Yeah.

436
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
 Crazy.

437
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,440
 And so this year, interestingly, scientists have pieced together bits of a skull that was

438
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,680
 blown up in this way, and they've got all the bits together, and they've put it through

439
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,440
 a computer system, and they've managed to get a picture of the guy what he would have

440
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
 looked like.

441
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,560
 And he just looks like a Mediterranean person who lived around that time.

442
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,840
 But it's amazing that they can get all the bits of skull that have exploded from the volcano

443
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,920
 in someone's head, and then see what they look like.

444
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
 That's incredible.

445
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,880
 Because presumably with the explosion, it would have gone off into various places, so you'd

446
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
 have to be...

447
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
 Yeah.

448
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
 Mix matching.

449
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
 Yeah, jigsawing.

450
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,400
 It's like funny bones, that children's book, it's like the adult version of that children's

451
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
 book.

452
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
 Yeah.

453
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,600
 And how they defended themselves in the initial stages?

454
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
 What do you mean?

455
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,240
 In the initial stages of the eruption.

456
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
 Oh, yeah.

457
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,960
 So we're talking about, are we talking about rocks falling from the sky, or are we talking

458
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
 about...

459
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,320
 Yeah, there have been earthquakes for a few days, and then there was a huge explosion in

460
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,680
 the mountain, and mushroom cloud went up, something like 20,000 metres, so there were little

461
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,400
 stones rattling around onto the ground, and people tied pillows onto their heads and walked

462
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
 around like that.

463
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
 No way.

464
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
 Yeah.

465
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
 That was how they defended themselves.

466
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,200
 You know what, that big mushroom cloud, those big plumes, are called volcanologists.

467
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
 What?

468
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,680
 They are called plinions.

469
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
 Oh, really?

470
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
 After pliny?

471
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
 Yeah.

472
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,480
 Which pliny though?

473
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
 The elder.

474
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,000
 No, so the elder famously died when he was so curious he got into about the younger.

475
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Yeah.

476
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,480
 There was only one of the older...

477
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,960
 The older older.

478
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
 Pliny the younger.

479
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,180
 So he described the eruption when he was watching it as well, so it wasn't even just

480
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,300
 pliny the elder who was trying to describe it.

481
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,300
 Pliny the younger.

482
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,220
 It was back on land going, "I'm going to describe this as well."

483
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,060
 He saw the giant plumes of smoke that were erupting around it.

484
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,940
 He called them umbrella pines, and that's been lost, but as a tribute to him naming it,

485
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
 it's been plinion.

486
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,940
 No way.

487
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,940
 Yeah, it's amazing.

488
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,700
 Isn't it amazing that 2,000 years later he's still pliny the younger, he's not graduated.

489
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,260
 But younger, doesn't matter how old you are, you're still younger, doesn't mean you're

490
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,740
 young just because you're younger.

491
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
 That's true.

492
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,380
 He's like kid rock, isn't it?

493
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,460
 Oh, look, he's knocking on a bit now.

494
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,460
 He should change his name to dad rock now, shouldn't he?

495
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,700
 Did you know what the clouds are called, that form the clouds of kind of pollution that

496
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
 form around volcanoes?

497
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,020
 So obviously a lot of sulfur dioxide and lots of other gases come out of it, and they

498
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,660
 react with the moisture in the air and with the oxygen and the debris.

499
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,100
 And they form this, if it's daylight, they form this big cloud that you can't really see

500
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
 through.

501
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
 And it's called a Vogue.

502
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,100
 Vogue, Vogue.

503
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,100
 A Vogue.

504
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
 Was that a Vogue?

505
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
 Yeah, a Vogue.

506
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,940
 Well, as Wikipedia says, it's a portmanteau of volcano fog and smog, so I don't know which one

507
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
 is the O-Hog.

508
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
 The O-Hog.

509
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,940
 The O-Hog.

510
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,940
 Is the O-Hog.

511
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,940
 So the G is from smog?

512
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,940
 Yeah.

513
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,940
 Okay.

514
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,140
 Yeah, they call it that in Hawaii, I think.

515
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,140
 Oh, okay.

516
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,660
 Yeah, as in they'll say, there's a lot of Vogue out there because it happens relatively regularly.

517
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,660
 Really?

518
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,660
 Yeah, I think so.

519
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,660
 It's a bit of a Voguey day.

520
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,660
 Have you got your fog lights on?

521
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,860
 They think that Pompeii had a one-way traffic system.

522
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,860
 Oh, really?

523
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,780
 Yeah, based on the wheelbruts and the arrangement of it.

524
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,340
 I just think it's amazing that you can know that there was a one-way traffic system 2,000

525
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,340
 years ago.

526
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,340
 Yeah.

527
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,340
 So I've been to Pompeii.

528
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,580
 I went last year.

529
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,580
 Have you been to Pompeii, James?

530
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,580
 You, okay.

531
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,900
 I went to a sushi restaurant once, but I'm not going to go on about it.

532
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,580
 If you've not been to Pompeii and you were listening to the podcast right now, definitely

533
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,580
 go.

534
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,900
 It is genuinely the most exciting archaeological thing I've ever seen in my life.

535
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,660
 It feels like time travel because everything is still there, including the people, which

536
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,820
 is mad.

537
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,980
 You just walk around and there's this body of a person who was there on the day that it

538
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
 happened.

539
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,340
 You don't see that anywhere else.

540
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,340
 So it's pretty amazing.

541
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:41,140
 The day that we went, I went with my wife, Finella, and she was really ill.

542
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,620
 So she took a lot of lemsip and she had a lot of coffee and it was boiling hot.

543
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,820
 And she started hallucinating.

544
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
 Here's another tip.

545
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,340
 You want a hallucinate, you can't afford LSD, lemsip and coffee and heat.

546
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
 That's what you need to do.

547
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,780
 And it was crazy because there was all these dead bodies around, obviously.

548
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,900
 And so she was going nuts over it.

549
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,740
 You don't see the actual bodies, though, do you?

550
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
 You do.

551
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,060
 Yeah, they're in the pottery section.

552
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,260
 That's the cast of the bodies, I think.

553
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,260
 Yeah.

554
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,540
 So what's happened is the people get buried, okay?

555
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,300
 And then they rot away.

556
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,540
 And then there's a hole where the body used to be.

557
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,860
 And then the way that they get them is they pour kind of concrete or something into

558
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,580
 it, and then they pull it out as a cast of a person.

559
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,420
 Oh, I thought that was them.

560
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,620
 You should have really read some of the information, so that's what you're in for.

561
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,900
 I tell you what, I tell you what, I did read an information plaque, I was stuck on it

562
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,060
 for ages, and then I realised Pompey doesn't have information plaques.

563
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:38,500
 And what I was reading was three different translations for how to use the recycling bin.

564
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,380
 So there are really few household objects left behind, and it's partly because people

565
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,700
 had 18 hours between eruption and the arrival of the huge hot cloud.

566
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,740
 So most people had left, and taking whatever they could carry with them.

567
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,460
 But also the reason there's nothing there is that people returned, as soon as it was all

568
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,220
 over, dug down into the ruins and nicked what they could.

569
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,220
 Right.

570
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,300
 And some of them fell in and died, so some of the bodies are those of looters whose tunnels

571
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
 collapsed.

572
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
 Wow.

573
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:15,580
 There's a German prince who made replica of Vesuvius in, so this is in the 80th century.

574
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:21,620
 It was in 1794, and there was this guy called Prince Leopold III Friedrich Franz, and

575
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,620
 he--

576
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,620
 Charles German.

577
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,220
 Charles German name you could have.

578
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,340
 And Prince Leopold went traveling around Europe, and he visited Vesuvius and thought, well,

579
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,340
 that's very impressive.

580
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,700
 This map of this volcano they've got, I'm going to build one when I get back home.

581
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,880
 And he got back home, and he built something that he called the Stone Island of Virlits

582
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,540
 in the countryside near Berlin, and it was a five-story high brick and stone building

583
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,620
 that he covered in all these boulders, so it looked like a volcano.

584
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,820
 And then he built a cone, the peak of it, and he put three fireplaces inside this hollowed

585
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,540
 out cone.

586
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,020
 And then he made this crater, and he filled it with water.

587
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,660
 And he erected some red lamps.

588
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,780
 And then when he set the fires and tipped out the water, the red lamps illuminated the

589
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,500
 water, so it looked like lava running down his fake mountain, and him and his mates used

590
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,180
 to get together with some booze of an evening.

591
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,300
 And then they used to light the fires and set off the volcano and watch Vesuvius erupts.

592
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,300
 Wow.

593
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
 That's quite cool.

594
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,620
 I got one last thing, which is from Pompeii, it's just to give a bit of insight into the

595
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,660
 type of people that live there, because it's hard to kind of picture their day-to-day

596
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
 activities.

597
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,300
 They discovered in the ruins graffiti that's just remained on walls of various places.

598
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,140
 So they've translated a bunch of them that they could still manage to make out the full

599
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,660
 sentences of.

600
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,820
 One reads, "If you're going to fight, get out."

601
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,900
 And that's written on the side of a tavern wall that they had.

602
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,780
 Another reads, "I don't care about your pregnancy, Silvilla.

603
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,780
 I despise it."

604
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,940
 And that's a private message.

605
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,660
 I don't know how, because it would have been on the wall.

606
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,660
 That's a PM.

607
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,660
 That's a PM.

608
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,660
 A PM.

609
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,660
 A PM.

610
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,660
 A PM.

611
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,660
 Wall.

612
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,660
 I'm amazed you haven't fallen into ruins since you bear the tedious scribblings of so many

613
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,700
 writers, and that was found at four different walls there.

614
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,700
 That's funny.

615
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,580
 That's like you get where people write on toilet walls, isn't it?

616
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,580
 They write stuff like that.

617
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,820
 Well, the final one is a bit of a toilet wall.

618
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
 It's Brotus.

619
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,820
 Brotus.

620
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
 Brotus.

621
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,820
 Brotus.

622
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,820
 Brotus.

623
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,820
 Brotus.

624
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,820
 Brotus.

625
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,820
 Brotus.

626
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,820
 Brotus.

627
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,820
 Brotus.

628
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
 Brotus.

629
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
 Brotus.

630
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
 Brotus.

631
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
 Brotus.

632
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,820
 You suck well, and that was founded a brothel.

633
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:36,300
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

634
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,380
 OK, my fact this week is that the first bendy straws were used by people in hospital.

635
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,380
 And why?

636
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,100
 Well, I mean, there's more convenient way to drink a drink, I guess, but why just in hospital?

637
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,500
 You've just answered your own question, isn't it?

638
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
 It's that, isn't it?

639
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
 It is.

640
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,020
 It's just kind of like this, because I associate bendy straws more with fun times, and parties

641
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
 and stuff.

642
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:05,300
 But the guy who invented them, the first place that he managed to sell them was to a hospital.

643
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,780
 And like you say, it's so that people who are kind of lying down or not quite vertical

644
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:14,340
 can drink more easily, because before that they would always drink out of glass straws.

645
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,340
 Glass.

646
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,340
 Oh, wow.

647
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
 Yeah.

648
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,180
 And that, it comes with a risk.

649
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,980
 Yeah, but you're in a hospital, so.

650
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,980
 That's true.

651
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,980
 You can't think of a better place to sell them.

652
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,980
 He's a straw.

653
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,980
 It doesn't matter.

654
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,460
 It only comes with a risk to the extent that drinking out of a glass comes with a risk.

655
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,460
 I think it also comes with a risk.

656
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,460
 Oh, yeah.

657
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,780
 And you have a drink out of beakers, don't you?

658
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,780
 Yeah, I have tippy cups.

659
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,780
 I don't know what a tippy cup is.

660
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
 I don't know.

661
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,460
 That's one of those things that a kid has with two handles on either side, and they kind

662
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,460
 of suck.

663
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,460
 Oh, yeah.

664
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,460
 It's got two handles, and it's got a little spout.

665
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,060
 And also, it's amazing, because you can sort it upside down, and none of it falls out, even

666
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,300
 through the little spout.

667
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,540
 It's like suckling on a breast.

668
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:55,780
 That's why my kitchen cabinets follow them, James.

669
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,780
 So I've been reading about the plastic straw apocalypse.

670
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,780
 Yes.

671
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,820
 So that's kind of why I wanted to talk about straws, because we should all stop bloody

672
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,820
 using them.

673
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,820
 Right.

674
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,820
 And our grandchildren won't have heard of them.

675
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,820
 Why?

676
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
 What happened?

677
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,820
 What happened?

678
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
 They made a plastic mate.

679
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,820
 Well, so is sushi.

680
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,820
 I know sushi.

681
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
 I know sushi.

682
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,980
 But plastic can damage the environment.

683
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,620
 And the thing with straws is usually if you're in a bar or whatever, you get a straw,

684
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,620
 you kind of throw it away.

685
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,900
 It's mixed in with all the detritus and glass and whatever, and it's really hard to kind

686
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,140
 of try and take it out so you can recycle it.

687
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140
 So no one recycles.

688
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,140
 Oh, OK.

689
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,780
 So the problem is they're not being recycled.

690
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,780
 And what do you do?

691
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:37,980
 You have it for like, what, 30 seconds, and how long does it take to drink a gin and tonic?

692
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,380
 But you have it only for like 10 minutes or whatever.

693
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
 Yeah.

694
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,380
 It's usually when I strawpido them.

695
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,820
 So 80% of the time it takes about a second, yeah.

696
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,780
 And sometimes they give you two straws.

697
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,780
 Yeah.

698
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,860
 Do you want a stat, Dan?

699
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,860
 Yeah.

700
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,860
 And can I just also just quickly say I do know that plastic is bad for the planet.

701
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,860
 Why not?

702
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
 It's more, I was trying to work out why.

703
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,860
 And that makes sense.

704
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,860
 Because what do we do?

705
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,860
 I always throw straws just into, anywhere.

706
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,860
 Pigeons.

707
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,700
 You're always buying packets of straws and chucking them about.

708
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
 Yeah.

709
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,220
 And that's, please Andy.

710
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,700
 Americans use 500 million straws a day.

711
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,700
 Wow.

712
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,220
 There's only about 300 million Americans.

713
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,220
 So some people are having a couple of straws.

714
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
 More than one each.

715
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,220
 There's more than one each.

716
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:24,420
 And the total number used a day, there was an article about this which gave an amazing comparison.

717
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:30,580
 It would fill 125 yellow American school buses each day full of straws.

718
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,660
 That's more than a mile long queue of American yellow school buses.

719
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,380
 And there's no children in them.

720
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,380
 They're all for the straws.

721
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,380
 Just straws.

722
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,380
 Just straws.

723
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,380
 And they?

724
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,380
 Each day.

725
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,380
 It's a complete waste of buses.

726
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,380
 That's the way it should be.

727
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,380
 Yeah.

728
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,380
 You have to go through to make the buses to keep the straws.

729
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,380
 Exactly.

730
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,380
 Now there's kids getting to school.

731
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
 Yeah.

732
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,380
 We can't carry on like this.

733
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,980
 I mean, the thing is, if we recycle them, maybe it won't be so bad, but no one ever does.

734
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,620
 And they're just completely piled up.

735
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,660
 Although I said this to you the other day, Anna, and you said you quite like a straw with

736
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,660
 a gin and toilet.

737
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,660
 I need straws.

738
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,260
 And I always ask for them if they don't give them to me in my gin and tonic.

739
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,340
 Otherwise, the ice gets in the way of the liquid.

740
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,260
 And so I push it too hard towards my mouth.

741
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,300
 And the liquid goes all down my front.

742
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
 So I do actually need straws.

743
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,860
 But I'm not a verse to, like, glass or metal or something.

744
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,940
 Would you be happy to have your own personal straw?

745
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,940
 I'd love that.

746
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,340
 I could get my initial engraved on it.

747
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,340
 Yeah.

748
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,340
 I think that's a good idea.

749
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,340
 I think we'll have our own personal straws in the future.

750
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,340
 Yeah.

751
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,340
 I think that's a really good call.

752
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,340
 Yeah.

753
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,180
 You could kind of hang it off your belt.

754
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,980
 Like people used to have with a knife.

755
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,980
 Yeah.

756
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
 No one used to have a knife draw.

757
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,500
 You'd just have a knife, which you hung by your side, and you just for dinner or like cropped

758
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
 dandy style.

759
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 For dinner.

760
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 Right.

761
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
 You're not the one that you're carrying around.

762
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
 Would it be metal or would it be made of plastic?

763
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 It'll be a metal one.

764
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
 Yeah.

765
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
 Otherwise, you can't really engrave in plastic.

766
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
 That's a great story.

767
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,340
 And then you can use it for an emergency tracheotomy.

768
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
 Yeah.

769
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,340
 Because everyone will always have one.

770
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
 Yeah.

771
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
 Yeah.

772
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,340
 Perfect.

773
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,580
 So in other plastic news, plastic recycling news, so the bad thing about a lot of plastic is

774
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,580
 they end up in the ocean, right?

775
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,300
 We should say, and they choke various animals.

776
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,460
 I think you were saying that straws specifically go up turtles and noses, don't they?

777
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,860
 Well, when Dan's around, they do.

778
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,860
 Yeah.

779
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,300
 And they can't fight any pigeons.

780
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,220
 That does happen a couple of years ago.

781
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,100
 There was a video of one being extricated from a turtle's nose, and that was kind of the

782
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,660
 impetus that started this whole kind of, we need to stop having straws.

783
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660
 Yeah.

784
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,740
 If you're in a bar, by the way, not if you're in a bar, but if you run a bar, get rid of your

785
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,740
 straws.

786
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
 Yeah.

787
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,740
 And if you're listening to this podcast in a bar, a, talk to someone.

788
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,900
 But more importantly, throw away your straw.

789
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,900
 Yeah.

790
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,540
 Actually, all bar one are banning them, aren't they?

791
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,540
 Yes.

792
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,540
 Good for them.

793
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,540
 Yeah.

794
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,660
 So I think you won't be able to get plastic straws in all bar one very shortly because of

795
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,660
 this very reason.

796
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,940
 So, I know they're going to have no replacement.

797
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,860
 Yeah, people are just expected to drink stuff straight from the glass, which I agree is a

798
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
 travesty.

799
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,860
 Yeah.

800
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,860
 That's what I'm talking about.

801
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,860
 What are your feelings on crazy straws?

802
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,060
 Oh, they're the funny, windy ones you get for birthday presents.

803
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,060
 Yeah.

804
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060
 They're kind of cute.

805
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
 Yeah, love them.

806
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,060
 Yeah.

807
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,460
 Well, because you don't usually throw those away.

808
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,460
 Those are keepers.

809
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,460
 No, you'd be mad to throw those away.

810
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,460
 Yeah.

811
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
 They're solid.

812
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,460
 They're a hard plastic.

813
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,780
 I was reading about crazy straws online because they believe deeply that it's more than

814
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,700
 just a straw that it's a philosophy.

815
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,700
 What?

816
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,700
 Yeah.

817
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,140
 I read an interview by the guy who invented the crazy straw glasses.

818
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,140
 You know, the one where you--

819
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,140
 Oh, yeah.

820
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,140
 Classic.

821
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,140
 Yeah, classic.

822
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,180
 He said that we say it's a metaphor for life.

823
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,700
 Take extra time to go on a winding country road as opposed to the highway.

824
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,780
 That's how he sees the crazy straw industry.

825
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:36,500
 It's not only are you buying something more long term, but you are experiencing the drink

826
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,100
 in a more philosophical fashion.

827
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,540
 It's taking the scenic route.

828
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
 Yeah.

829
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,540
 It's the Buddha of straws.

830
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,540
 It reminds me a bit of, you know that magazine that you get under delayed gratification.

831
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
 Yes.

832
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,540
 Which you get the news like three months later.

833
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
 Yeah.

834
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,180
 It's a bit like that because you're drinking your Coca-Cola or whatever.

835
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,180
 Yeah.

836
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,300
 And there's a few seconds when it's not quite got to your mouth yet.

837
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
 Yeah, that's true.

838
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,780
 That you can kind of imagine what you're going to taste.

839
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
 Yeah.

840
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,780
 It's that--

841
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,740
 We did it as a quote on QI in the very early episodes.

842
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:09,660
 Stephen Fry quotes from James Bond saying the best martini of the day was the one just

843
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,660
 before the first one.

844
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,660
 It's the anticipation.

845
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,660
 Oh, yeah.

846
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,260
 It's the taste just for-- by the way, mentioning delayed gratification.

847
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,860
 Andy got his latest coffee the other day.

848
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,860
 Can you quickly mention this?

849
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,860
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

850
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,460
 It came with a letter saying, we're really sorry.

851
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,260
 You've probably noticed this issue of, like, identification has got to you a bit late.

852
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,260
 Sorry.

853
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,740
 None of the news is from before, I think, March.

854
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
 Clay.

855
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,740
 You think the letter would be apologised if it came early?

856
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,140
 Yes, that's true.

857
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,940
 And so, do you know, Dan, how--

858
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,940
 Probably not.

859
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,100
 What's the longest length of straw that you could drink out of?

860
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
 Ooh.

861
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,340
 If I put, say, a can of beer on the floor.

862
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,340
 Yeah.

863
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,900
 And I gave you as long a straw as you wanted, but you had to suck from the top of it.

864
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,700
 What is the tallest it could be?

865
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,180
 I'm going to say two floors.

866
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,660
 That's a lot.

867
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,060
 Two floors, so how many metres are you saying?

868
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,060
 So that door is two metres.

869
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,060
 Oh, OK.

870
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:12,260
 I'll say 16 metres.

871
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,060
 The floors I'm talking about have a very high ceiling.

872
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,060
 Yeah.

873
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,060
 Oh, yeah, because you live in Versailles, don't you?

874
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,060
 Yeah.

875
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,860
 [LAUGHTER]

876
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,260
 Guys, do you think it's less or more than 16 metres?

877
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,260
 I think--

878
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,660
 Or maybe there's an infinite amount, maybe.

879
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,260
 I think it's going to be less than that.

880
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,460
 So I guess you need to have enough to be making a vacuum in the straw.

881
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,740
 The water fills up to fill.

882
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,420
 So it's just how long can I breathe in?

883
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,420
 I think I can breathe in long enough to suck in three metres worth of air towards me.

884
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
 Oh, no.

885
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
 No, I can go up.

886
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,820
 Yeah, but the difference is with a straw, you can pause.

887
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,820
 You can take breaks.

888
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,060
 As in, if I were sucking on a straw, I could put my thumb over the straw and it'll hang there.

889
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,060
 That's not going to lose it.

890
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,060
 Oh.

891
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,060
 I can then re-suck.

892
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:58,460
 Yeah, but once you've got all the air out of the straw, surely, there's no-- you can't

893
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,900
 remove more if there's a complete vacuum in the straw, right?

894
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:06,300
 No, Andy is well on the route here, so if you had a perfect vacuum sucking up, that's the

895
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
 best sucking you can do.

896
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,140
 You can't do any better than that.

897
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:16,020
 And to get, if you're on earth, so you have to pull it up against the atmospheric pressure,

898
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,860
 the highest is about 10 metres.

899
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,060
 If you had a vacuum, a perfect one, so obviously humans couldn't do any more than that.

900
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,060
 10 metres is cool.

901
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,060
 That's still high enough that I could be on the second floor of a building and get someone

902
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,620
 to deliver a drink to my door and pour my straw out.

903
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,620
 You drink it.

904
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,060
 The reason that that's kind of interesting or kind of important is because if you're trying

905
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,260
 to-- if you've got a mine and you want to suck the water out of the mine so people can go

906
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,160
 down and dig for rocks or whatever, you can only suck it up to 10 metres.

907
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,260
 So anything lower than that, you need to do some pushing as well as sucking, which means

908
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,780
 you need an engine, which is why in the industrial revolution you had all these people who were

909
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,740
 inventing engines like Water and Newcoma and people like that because they needed to

910
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,740
 get this stuff up there without--

911
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,740
 So no matter how wide the straw doesn't matter.

912
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,740
 10 metres is the limit.

913
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,740
 Yeah.

914
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
 That is really interesting.

915
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,740
 Wow.

916
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,740
 Yeah.

917
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,620
 I'm so, you think, here's the next question that you were just about to ask Dan, how do trees

918
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,700
 suck up water from the roots to the top of a tree?

919
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
 Oh, yeah.

920
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,380
 I was just thinking about-- I was just saying a xylem in a plant must work like this.

921
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,380
 Oh, can we work it out?

922
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,380
 Is it possible to be worked out?

923
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,380
 No.

924
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,700
 Well, it's in this kind of thing, it's always the same answer.

925
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
 The partner didn't.

926
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
 It's capillary action.

927
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,700
 Oh, OK.

928
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:34,780
 So if you get a really, really, really, really thin straw kind of thing, then there's another

929
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,620
 force that kind of sucks it up there.

930
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,940
 And there's also the cohesion of water, which means water molecules kind of pull on each

931
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,460
 other because they have surface tension.

932
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,460
 Yes, because they're hydro--

933
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,460
 That is amazing.

934
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,140
 So if the straw is thin enough, it can be longer than 10 metres is what we're saying.

935
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,140
 If it's super, super thin.

936
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,780
 So like one of those tiny ones that you do get in a bar?

937
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,860
 It's already hard to suck liquid out of those tiny ones, I think.

938
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,260
 Which is why they give you two?

939
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
 Yes.

940
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,900
 I always thought they were just for show, like offer staring, which is why I think they should

941
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
 get bloody rid of them.

942
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,500
 I'm very excited that we might launch an anti-straw revolution.

943
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
 Yeah.

944
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,020
 Big straws going to come after us.

945
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,620
 But the big straw can't be bothered in 10 metres.

946
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:20,020
 Oh, we need to just go on to the third floor of a building.

947
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,260
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

948
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,580
 And that is my fact.

949
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,060
 My fact this week is that bomb detectors in America work 16 times better when they are

950
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,260
 fitted with a fake dog nose on the end.

951
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,020
 This is such a silly fact.

952
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,020
 But it's real.

953
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,020
 I know.

954
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,020
 It's astonishing, isn't it?

955
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,020
 It's amazing.

956
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,860
 Yeah, so they basically tested this out in America.

957
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:49,900
 They 3D printed out the nostril of a dog and they stuck it onto the end of a bomb detector

958
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:55,220
 and they use the methods by which bomb detecting dogs use when they're sniffing for bombs.

959
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:00,860
 So a usual bomb detector will sort of take in a bunch of air and it will analyse it.

960
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,220
 Dogs do quick sniffs.

961
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,020
 So they did that with this fake nose as well.

962
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,620
 They did these quick sniffs.

963
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,780
 And as a result, they found that it produced results that were 16 times better by having

964
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,580
 the weird nasal structure of a dog on the end of their bomb detectors.

965
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,780
 Yeah, because dogs, I didn't quite realise this about how dogs sniff and how they

966
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,780
 take in air, that they exhale in a completely different place to where they inhale, don't

967
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
 they?

968
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,780
 What?

969
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
 What?

970
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,780
 Yeah.

971
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,780
 So they could probably play really long notes on a trumpet.

972
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,780
 Oh yeah.

973
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,780
 Or a surgery do.

974
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,780
 Yeah.

975
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,580
 They'd be amazing at surgery do's.

976
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,700
 The way dogs breathe is that they inhale through their nostrils on the front of their

977
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,700
 nose.

978
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,500
 But if you look at any dogs nose, you would have seen, if you've got a dog, they've got

979
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,060
 these slits down the side of their nose.

980
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,540
 And that's where they exhale.

981
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,340
 So if you looked at a picture of a dog now.

982
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,340
 What?

983
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,420
 They've got like a, I'm actually just going to show you.

984
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,420
 No way.

985
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,420
 Just super quickly.

986
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,420
 You would have seen it on every dog.

987
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,420
 I've never seen a dog.

988
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,420
 All dogs have different noses.

989
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,420
 Oh no.

990
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,220
 Like a, they've all got this same nose.

991
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,460
 Like a pug has a different nose to a side view.

992
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,460
 I do.

993
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,460
 They've all got dog noses that have a, do they?

994
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,460
 Do they?

995
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,460
 I've none of them have like a human nose.

996
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,020
 I'm going to look for a variety of dog noses.

997
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
 Okay, okay.

998
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
 Right.

999
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,020
 So here you go.

1000
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,020
 Yeah, yeah.

1001
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,020
 Look at that.

1002
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,020
 Oh wow.

1003
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,020
 And then that's lip then.

1004
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,020
 Yes, yeah.

1005
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,020
 Okay.

1006
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,020
 Anna is not lying.

1007
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,020
 We can confirm.

1008
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,020
 I'm not lying.

1009
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,020
 All dog noses have this slit.

1010
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,140
 And they've got this thing called an A-lar fold or an a-lar fold in their nose.

1011
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,140
 And they inhale air and then they pull the fold down so the air can't come back out the way

1012
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,140
 it went in.

1013
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,140
 Right.

1014
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,140
 And they exhale it out of the slit.

1015
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,980
 And that makes their sense of smell much better because it kind of stops the air from

1016
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,820
 being exhale down the same channel that they're trying to breathe in more sense.

1017
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,220
 So it stops at all getting mixed up together.

1018
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,220
 Oh.

1019
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,340
 And it means they can smell all the incoming air more intensely and in a more concentrated

1020
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,340
 way.

1021
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,780
 So that explains why this bomb detects a kind of stuff works, right?

1022
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,460
 Because it means that they're just passing loads and loads of air over it rather than bringing

1023
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,140
 the same stuff in and blowing it out.

1024
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,140
 Exactly.

1025
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,060
 That is the most surprising thing I've learned today.

1026
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,060
 I know.

1027
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,740
 I was really surprised I didn't ever think about that.

1028
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,740
 Or even noticed that slit.

1029
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,740
 A secret slit.

1030
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,740
 That we've not noticed.

1031
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,740
 Yeah.

1032
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,740
 A secret slit.

1033
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:11,020
 I was reading in Australia they have dogs that sniff out koalas.

1034
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:15,940
 So there's like, for example, there's one dog who in 2014 I think it was called Maya was

1035
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:21,060
 trained specifically to cover a 480 hectare bit of land in order to map out where all the

1036
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,060
 koalas were.

1037
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,380
 However, she was not trained to smell out koalas themselves.

1038
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,740
 She was trained to smell out their feces.

1039
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:33,940
 So she would not disrupt the koalas and get into, I guess, any fights or scare them or whatever.

1040
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,100
 She was just looking for the poo.

1041
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:40,060
 So her nostrils were trained specifically just for the feces as opposed to the koala.

1042
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:45,180
 This year there's another dog in Australia that's been put into the same kind of role.

1043
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,300
 And he is a dog called bear.

1044
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,500
 And so bear is also sniffing out koalas.

1045
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,740
 Who does a dog bear?

1046
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,740
 Yeah, I know.

1047
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,740
 It's confusing.

1048
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,740
 What's the one that's looking for bears as well?

1049
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,740
 Oh, yeah, and he's looking for bears.

1050
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,740
 Yeah, it's very confusing.

1051
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,740
 Yeah.

1052
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,740
 So you've got a dog called panda.

1053
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,740
 Do you object to that?

1054
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,740
 I do.

1055
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,740
 Yeah, okay.

1056
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,780
 I mean, you're sat right here, so it's hard to say it to your face.

1057
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,940
 It's just stupid name.

1058
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,940
 He went for it.

1059
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,700
 No, she didn't even feel like he found it that hard.

1060
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:19,660
 Yeah, but you can't just say that all dogs should be called dog, if that's the all.

1061
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,620
 I don't think I was saying that with the way of venting.

1062
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,660
 That's why we have names is to differentiate things.

1063
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,660
 Yeah.

1064
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,660
 James isn't saying we call dogs dog.

1065
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,420
 Yeah, I think there's a bit of a straw in that argument going on here.

1066
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,500
 I'm just saying that you should give it a name, which is not another animal.

1067
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,500
 But what do you object to them being given human names like Fred?

1068
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,740
 Because I do object to that.

1069
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,700
 I think it's lying about the fact that this is a dog.

1070
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,700
 It's not lying.

1071
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,700
 It's not lying.

1072
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,700
 I don't think it is a lie.

1073
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:53,180
 First of all, the first of all, the secret slits, and now it turns like an even a user.

1074
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:58,460
 I think there should be an approved list of dog names called Rover and Fido, and that's

1075
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,460
 more or less it.

1076
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,460
 Yeah.

1077
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,460
 That's, yeah.

1078
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,460
 I think you should be able to pick from list of 10 dog names.

1079
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,460
 Yeah.

1080
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,460
 I haven't got them all worked out yet.

1081
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,460
 You don't need that then, do you?

1082
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,460
 No.

1083
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,740
 So humans need lots of names because you're going to lots of different social situations

1084
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,700
 where you need to know someone's name.

1085
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,500
 Most dogs are with their owner, the whole time.

1086
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,300
 I know, but if you're in a park and you go Rover and the entire park's with their dogs.

1087
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,900
 But that could be a maximum of what in ten of the dogs in the park.

1088
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,100
 That's not how probability works.

1089
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,180
 It wouldn't be a maximum of what in ten dogs in the park.

1090
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:36,180
 It would be a maximum of all of them, obviously, but the odds would be all of them very slim.

1091
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,060
 There is a chance of it being none of them in the past, but that relies on your dog having

1092
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:48,620
 left the park and having no other dog in the park or Rover, which is also a possibility.

1093
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:54,820
 So anyway, bear has the civility, right?

1094
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,460
 So check out the slits on bear.

1095
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:04,100
 He can sniff out not only a koala, so he's been trained not to sniff out the feces.

1096
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:09,660
 He's been trained to sniff out the hair of a koala bear, but the molted hair of a koala

1097
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,940
 bear and fresh-multed hair.

1098
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:17,420
 So he's specifically going for hair that is not attached to a koala just so he's still

1099
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,420
 here.

1100
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,420
 Isn't that amazing?

1101
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,580
 I didn't know that hair smelled different when it wasn't attached to you.

1102
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,620
 When it was attached to you.

1103
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,620
 What this might be is another thing that dogs are really good at doing is separating smells

1104
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,900
 and they've got a smell-filing system in their noses.

1105
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,700
 So what they might be doing is smelling that there's hair, but without the smell of

1106
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,980
 the flesh of a koala.

1107
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,980
 Oh, yes.

1108
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,980
 Yeah, yeah.

1109
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,260
 So we've got this mucus in their nose, and the reason their nose is the wet, what it helps

1110
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,540
 them do is like file away the smells into different parts of their nose.

1111
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,300
 So certain molecules travel through the mucus faster than others.

1112
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,300
 So it knows that the first molecule that gets to it, the bit that actually smells, is likely

1113
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,740
 to be poo, whereas the second molecule that gets through a site to be beef, and if a molecule

1114
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,940
 takes ages, you know, it might be grass or something.

1115
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,380
 So if you have pooey beef, it knows that it's pooey beef, because it's gone through both

1116
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,380
 of them.

1117
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,380
 Precisely.

1118
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,260
 So it only gets the first smell that hits, it's just pooey.

1119
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,420
 It's like an and/or decision gait in a kind of a computer, right?

1120
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,420
 Yeah.

1121
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:18,020
 So you're saying that it can get the hair and then gets a live koala.

1122
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,020
 Yeah.

1123
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:23,340
 But if it only gets one of those two, it knows that it's just the hair or just the shaved

1124
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,340
 koala.

1125
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
 Exactly.

1126
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,340
 Yeah.

1127
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,900
 Did you know that blood hounds, who have an amazing sense of smell, smell what there is?

1128
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
 No.

1129
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
 Who's just talking?

1130
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
 Yeah.

1131
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:38,620
 My dog has, oh no, how does he smell with his lips?

1132
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,620
 Yep.

1133
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,820
 That's how the joke should be told.

1134
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,820
 It's not a joke, but it's the truth.

1135
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,140
 This is actually a bit of a stretch, but...

1136
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:52,420
 This is the old Tushinsky special, so it's something ridiculous and they're backtracked

1137
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
 severely.

1138
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,100
 Well, what they do is, they've got these really long ears blood hounds, and you'll notice

1139
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,300
 that there is a place further down their heads than most dogs, and they also have really,

1140
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,260
 really droopy jaws and really lots of wrinkles.

1141
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:10,060
 And what these all do is they trap sense, and there is a supposed to drag along the ground,

1142
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:14,580
 so there is scoop up lots of smells, and then they get flicked and carried in the wrinkles

1143
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:19,100
 of their skin because they're so flabby and up to their nose, so there is there to drag

1144
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,660
 along the ground and pick up smells for them.

1145
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,260
 Yeah, and I think that's not far off, is it?

1146
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,260
 That is so close.

1147
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,260
 Yeah.

1148
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,260
 Okay, right.

1149
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,660
 But how long does it take for them to smell something, then?

1150
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,780
 I guess sometimes it would take a while, and then you've lost where there's a lot.

1151
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,780
 You've lost where it was.

1152
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,780
 Yeah.

1153
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,780
 I have one thing about bomb disposal, yeah, it's just a headline from a local news paper,

1154
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,180
 this is the Bristol Post, this is within the last month, and the headline is, "Bomb Disposal

1155
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,980
 Squad called to Western Superma Beach, only to find a really big plate."

1156
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:50,580
 There's a bloke who found something metal on the beach who started digging it up, and

1157
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,100
 it was huge, and he thought, "Oh God, okay, this might be something really serious."

1158
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,540
 And so he re-barried it, found the bomb disposal squad, and they arrived, as a plate.

1159
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,540
 Who's taking such a huge plate to the beach?

1160
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,260
 It's like a platter for sandwiches, maybe.

1161
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1162
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,260
 And it would look like the top of a mine.

1163
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,060
 Completely, yeah, yeah, it's not a crazy decision to make, but with hindsight, it turns out

1164
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,860
 to have been funny.

1165
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:24,500
 Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts, thank you so much for listening.

1166
