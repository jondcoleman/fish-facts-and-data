00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.500
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.620
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.460
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anichezinski and Andrew

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.100
 Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.880
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with you

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.880
 Andy.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:49.480
 My fact is that it takes 10 years to learn how to make artificial sushi to make it well

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.100
 to make it well sorry any mug can just wait.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.260
 My one could get some plasticine and make some fake sushi right?

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.020
 Not toy sushi as in Japan there's this amazing tradition where basically all restaurants

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.740
 have their whole menu reproduced in plastic outside the restaurant to lure you in to say

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.740
 how good this looks.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.900
 Like when people, there's a place around the corner from us that is a restaurant and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.460
 they cook one meal every day and they put it on a table outside and it's just a display

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.460
 meal.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.300
 Oh yes it's a display meal I always wanted to take that display meal because they put

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.120
 a whole pizza outside and you think why doesn't someone just come along and have this?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.120
 I don't get it.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.120
 I'm so close.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.120
 How has someone not got that?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.520
 They must be poisoned right?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 And there's a glass of wine.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.520
 They must be.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.080
 There's a glass of white wine just sitting there.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.020
 We're going to take it guys you know who you are.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.920
 Have any of you ever eaten in that restaurant?

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 No.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.920
 Oh yes I have.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.920
 I have.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 It's great.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.760
 It's kind of just society isn't it?

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.120
 You just don't steal things?

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.120
 Yeah.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.360
 I'm not saying it's a bad thing that people don't steal things in general.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.360
 Right.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 It's a trust exercise.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 Yeah.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.960
 I don't know what a waste won't it?

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.900
 It's like taking something out of a bin.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.900
 And we all do that.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.900
 I guess.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.840
 So this is kind of like the equivalent of high street shops having mannequins in the window

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.840
 completely.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 Displaying their clothes.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.840
 Apart from all the clothes are fake.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 Yes.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.880
 And there's an actual industry devoted to making fake clothes which no one will ever wear.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.920
 Yeah but you might make the clothes out of say toilet paper or something instead.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920
 Yes.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.480
 Because it's cheaper and it shows them off.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.480
 Yeah.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.320
 Or is it not cheaper?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.320
 Why?

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.720
 But there was an economist article all about this and then it turns out this is a massive

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.720
 thing.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.280
 And I was in Japan about five years ago and it is true.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.240
 It's basically every restaurant has this stuff outside it.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.560
 And the thing is buying these things is really expensive.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.880
 As in, the sale price is about 20 times the price of the actual piece of sushi to buy a plastic

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.880
 piece of sushi.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.880
 Yeah.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880
 But then it lasts a lot longer.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.880
 It's the good thing.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.880
 And you're only buying one.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880
 And you're only buying one.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.880
 And you're only buying one.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.680
 You can rent a burger for a month for a thousand yen and have it outside it because getting

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.320
 a whole menu done is costs thousands of pounds.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.320
 Yeah.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320
 The equivalent of.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.400
 I was reading that actually a lot of the companies that make these things don't do very

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.400
 well in business because they are so long lasting these things.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.200
 So once you've sold it to someone then that bit of sushi last 10 years and so they're giving

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200
 you our business.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.120
 And so they're trying to sell them to China and to Europe now because everyone's got

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120
 them in Japan.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.480
 They should do what Apple do and make them break after two years.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.480
 That's a very yes.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.480
 Intentional obsolescence.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.480
 So whatever they call it.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480
 Yes.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.600
 Or like football kits, they should make new ones every year, new kind of sushi.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.080
 So you always have to have the most trendy sushi outside your restaurant.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.080
 That's what I was thinking.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.000
 I wonder if there's a plastic sushi chef who's innovating new meals and releasing them

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 and they're going, "God, we got to replicate this now."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.240
 Well, they don't really do that because the way they make these plastic imitations is

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.240
 so precise.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.240
 So get this.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.200
 They will send a designer to the restaurant where the food is made who will observe it.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.760
 They've got some photos of the food, he'll make an architect sketch and then he goes back

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.800
 to the factory and he says, "We have to make it precisely like this."

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.240
 And that every individual piece is made with a mould.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240
 Okay.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.160
 So he makes the mould first and then he...

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.640
 No, he visits the restaurant, sees the food, designs the mould, builds the mould and then

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.360
 presses a single, amazing piece.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.360
 Nice.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.920
 So the mould for making a bit of tuna is actually made by pushing a bit of tuna into the

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.920
 machine.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920
 Oh really?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.920
 They use the fish to make the mould.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920
 I believe so.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.920
 The fish would get squash.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.920
 Yeah.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.920
 That's not going to retain its shape.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.920
 This is what I agree.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.920
 I agree.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.920
 I have had sushi once.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.920
 And...

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.920
 One more time than you've had before, sorry.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.920
 Yes.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.240
 But no, it's incredibly precise.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.640
 And 80% of the industry is one set of factories, it's one company, basically.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.640
 Okay.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.600
 And all the rest is little cottage industries and workshops and artisans around that.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.880
 So why is it take 10 years to learn how to be a plastic sushi chef?

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.200
 It's very precise and it's a very artistic thing.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.760
 To make it really good, you know, to be a master, which is about as long as it takes to become

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.760
 a master sushi chef.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.760
 Trust it.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.640
 There are people out there who have both spent 10 years of their life.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.640
 I wonder if at a certain time, at culinary school, you have to decide if you're going to

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.880
 go into plastics or...

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.880
 Yeah.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.880
 And must be a time.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.880
 And do you reckon it's the best ones who go into plastics or the slightly rubbish ones

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.600
 who don't get very good grades?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.880
 The thing is, they make these plastic vegetables and then they do cut them with real knives.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.040
 So it's like, it's a bizarre, proper, sheffing mixed with plastic sheffing.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.800
 And they've been doing it for ages, haven't they?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.800
 Yeah.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.840
 So I think it started in about the 1920s and it was because they didn't have menus.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.160
 And so instead of a menu, you'd have this display of apparently that was easier.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.160
 I would have thought drawing something on a menu was easier.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.600
 Yeah, crazy that that came first.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600
 Yeah.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.400
 They were getting new foods from the West as well.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.040
 So to explain what these are to your customers, it's easier to have it on display outside.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.600
 Because you can see, like, on a menu, it could be any size, for example.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.640
 Or if you've had it molded.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.760
 You can put something next to it for perspective.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.760
 Next to every meal, you could put like a little dog.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.720
 And then you would know how big it was.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.040
 But that's the thing James, dogs are very in size, famously.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.240
 All right, I should have chosen something more standard.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.760
 Well, a plastic bit of sushi, just put that next to it.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.120
 And then that'll show you next to your tuna sashimi.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.120
 Which is a good idea.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.120
 Which is a good idea.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.480
 The best thing putting plastic sushi next to real sushi to give an impression of the size.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.880
 No, next to a real Western, like...

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.320
 Sit your elbows and stuff like that.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.320
 That would be a good idea, yes.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.040
 Have we ever said that about salmon sashimi?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.040
 No.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.680
 The weird thing about it is that it's just not at all Japanese, and that it was brought to Japan

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.680
 by Norway.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.680
 Oh, really?

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.840
 So people didn't eat salmon sashimi in Japan until the 1980s.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.920
 And then Norway had a shed load of fish that it couldn't sell and it had to offload.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.160
 Really wanted to sew out its fishing industry.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.520
 And they had a meeting with the Japanese and thought, "Well, this is a country that loves

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.520
 eating fish."

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.280
 And so they started offloading all their fish and selling it to Japan and trying to market

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.280
 it as sushi.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.160
 Even then, so it was in about 1985 that they started eating salmon in Japan.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160
 Even then, it took about 10 years before they started eating it without cooking it.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.160
 Wow, what was that?

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.360
 Yeah, do we know what brought the country to sort of shift the attitude?

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.720
 Norway just kept forcing it down there for a minute.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720
 That is true.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.200
 I think they just had loads of it to sell, didn't they?

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.200
 Yeah.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200
 And they just needed a new market for it.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200
 Yeah, okay.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.200
 That is amazing.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.200
 It was 1995.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.320
 But I guess, even if you're used to eating raw tuna, it doesn't follow that you should

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.320
 eat raw salmon.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.240
 There's some people eat raw beef, don't they?

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240
 Yeah.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.240
 When you had a steak or chopped up.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.760
 But if you were to give someone raw chicken, or raw pork, or chopped up, it's not a natural

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.760
 thing.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.760
 Yeah, it's a mad idea, actually.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.760
 Well, isn't it?

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.760
 You crack a raw egg on top of that?

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.760
 I'd probably give it a try.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.760
 Raw chicken.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.760
 Yeah.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.760
 Yeah.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.760
 Probably just the ones.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:31.480
 Actually, sushi isn't quite as old as you might think, modern sushi, anyway.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.160
 The first kind of sushi was Nare sushi, which is from the third century BC.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.600
 But that was basically just pickled fish.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.440
 So you put fish in a barrel with some rice and with some vinegar and leave it there for

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.040
 like a year.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.240
 And then when it came out, it was pickled and it was edible.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.920
 But actually, they would also scrape all the rice off.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.240
 So unlike this kind of sushi that we eat today, they would deliberately get rid of all

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.120
 the rice and only eat the fish part.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.120
 That's amazing.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.520
 So did the rice help pickle it?

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.320
 It helps their fermentation, yeah, because if you ferment something, you need a carbohydrates

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.320
 to do that.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.760
 So we're sort of eating the packaging when we eat sushi and rice.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760
 Yeah.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.120
 Did they eventually just get tired of scraping off the rice and a couple of grains of rice

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.120
 stayed on?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.560
 And then there are a few more grains of rice and that eventually is a massive lump of

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.560
 rice.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.240
 I think what happened was the next one that came was Han Nare sushi.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.920
 And that was, they didn't leave it in the barrel for nearly as long.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.240
 I think they probably got a bit bored of waiting for the sushi.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.600
 And so they would open the barrel a bit earlier and then they would eat the fish with the rice.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.000
 And my guess is, and this is just a guess, maybe it was a bit more sour, a bit more pickly,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.760
 so that kind of took the edge off a bit.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.760
 I don't know.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.760
 OK.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.320
 I'm guessing as well that they were always eating sashimi with a bowl of rice next to them.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.880
 They just hadn't combined the two as a single meal.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.320
 And have they, someone dropped one bit into the other and magic happened?

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.320
 Yeah.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.040
 I think they would have combined it as in they would have dropped sushi on top of their

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.040
 bowl of rice.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.960
 They would have eaten the two together like we do cornflakes into a bowl and then put milk

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.880
 in it, but you don't sell milk and cornflakes together.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.880
 They should.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.880
 Yeah.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.880
 Exactly.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.880
 Why don't they?

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.880
 Because it goes soggy.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.080
 Oh my god, it's such a bad idea.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.560
 It's, don't do that.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560
 What an about-face.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.160
 I mean, just a second or two.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.160
 Quickest switcher room.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.160
 I never heard.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.000
 You'd be great on Dragon's Day, though, because I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 No.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 OK.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 Yeah.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.160
 While we're on milk and cereal, so I was reading and asking, this is kind of related to how

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.160
 food is represented.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.240
 There's an amazing guardian article about the secrets of food photographers, because in

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.400
 the west we basically do this, we basically make artificial food in order to make it look

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400
 good.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.400
 Yeah.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.400
 But we're doing it with real food sometimes.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.400
 Like an advertising, you mean, or stuff?

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.400
 Yes.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.400
 Exactly like that.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.640
 So strawberries get covered in lipstick, this is all from individual photographers.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.920
 It's not like it's industry standards, but everyone has their own secret box of tricks.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.120
 It's a converted sometimes prey with WD40.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.520
 The milk is almost never real milk, when you see a bowl of milk and cereal on a cereal

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520
 packet.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.880
 It's, it can be hair cream.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.880
 It can be white glue.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.880
 Oh.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.880
 That's a big thing.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.880
 And then you just shove the corn flakes into the top of it to make it look delicious.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.400
 That makes sense.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:17.160
 Sometimes, if you need steam, if you've got a pasta dish and you're steaming in a bowl,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.040
 one photographer puts incense in there and lets it smoke away and then just remove the

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.040
 incense in post-production.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:30.200
 And one photographer said she, her method, was to microwave wet tampons and then put them

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.200
 behind the pasta.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.040
 So they were steaming.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.040
 Wow.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.840
 It's steam, particularly on photogenic on its own when it's naturally just hot.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.840
 Yes, yes it is.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.840
 It must be.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.840
 There must be a sign.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.840
 It must be a photogenic.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.360
 Well, they, I mean, this is, I mean, I think it's quite well known that they do use different

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360
 things in adverts.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.360
 Yeah.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.760
 I didn't know any of those examples, but I think that is quite well known.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.240
 John Lloyd, for people listening, he's a guy who created QI, he used to do a lot of adverts

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.600
 and he used to say that whenever he did a food product, like a cereal or something, that

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.920
 in between takes, there was someone who would come and sort of move a rice crispy into a

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.040
 better spot of the bowl and like, you know, as if you were doing someone's make-up between

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.040
 takes.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.960
 Do you remember when China hosted the Olympics and there was that girl who sung the solo,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.000
 but they put another more attractive girl on the TV for it.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Oh no.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.560
 I don't get it like that, but then it's more serious to do that than to change your rice

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.560
 crispy, I think.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.560
 I guess the rice crispy doesn't mind as much.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.800
 No one is pretending that this is a photo of a real bowl of rice crispy.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.800
 Yeah, they are.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800
 They are.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.280
 Actually, James, I can't see any difference except that rice crispy can't be.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.280
 They don't have feelings.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.280
 They don't have feelings.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.280
 And they can't be upset.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.800
 They don't have those faces and those costumes.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.920
 If you think they don't have feelings, yeah, then the advertising hasn't worked on you.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.920
 I don't think.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.440
 Well, they try to do because if I thought the rice crispy's had feelings, I probably won't

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.440
 want to eat them.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.960
 I think I would enjoy it more.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.960
 As they screamed.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:12:00.760
 So, on sushi, sushi obviously depends on that seaweed that wraps around it to be maize.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.400
 And so, you know, basically, the person who brought sushi to Japan, who made it a viable

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.400
 commercial product in Japan?

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.400
 No, is it Mr. Nori?

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.400
 Because I saw it's called it.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.400
 It wasn't Mr. Nori.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.360
 It wasn't Jack O'Nouri, the Irish.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.040
 It wasn't that, though, very good suggestion.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.440
 It was a woman, actually, who was from Lancashire.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.800
 It was a woman called Kathleen Mary Drew Baker.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.600
 And she was studying the Welsh equivalent of Nori, which is the Japanese seaweed that wraps

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.920
 around sushi.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:34.040
 And in 1949, she discovered that this tiny algae was actually the lava of Nori.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.200
 And before that, no one in Japan had known our department commercially because they hadn't

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.400
 been able to work out how to get it to propagate successfully.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.640
 So, in Japan, they loved it.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.880
 They loved sushi, but they couldn't sell it ever because they would eat little bits of it,

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.880
 but they couldn't farm it.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.040
 And this woman just figured out this random thing, I think she was studying at Manchester

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.520
 at the time, about Welsh seaweed.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.520
 And they picked up on it.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.760
 And suddenly, a revolutionized sushi, and it meant they had a sushi industry.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.200
 And they now celebrate her.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.640
 So, she's this woman who no one in this country has heard of, and who never visited Japan,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.640
 is celebrated there.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.960
 She's known as Mother of the Sea.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.920
 There's a festival held in her honour every year in Osaka on April the 14th.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.920
 And people go and they pray to her and they give offerings.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.160
 They sing these special songs that they think of the Drew monument, which is a monument to

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.160
 her.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160
 So, it's like, it should be a monument to you, Drew.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.160
 No.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160
 Well, that's not my name.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160
 My name is Laying.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.640
 So, I don't know why we're friends.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.040
 Japanese restaurants still don't hire women sushi restaurants.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.440
 I think most of them don't hire women.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.240
 This is in, we're talking in Japan.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.240
 In Japan.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.240
 Yeah.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.240
 That's right.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.240
 One time.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.240
 When I went to itsy, that one time.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.240
 Because what?

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.240
 The woman was buying the counter.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.240
 Yeah.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240
 Why don't they hire women?

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.240
 The chefs.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.240
 As the chefs, yes.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.240
 Sorry.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.480
 So, I think there's a superstition in Japan that women's body temperature is too high.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.480
 Or there was a really...

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.480
 We don't want to cook that raw fish.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.480
 Fine.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.480
 To be by your touch.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:57.480
 Good luck running your raw chicken restaurant tonight, because that chicken is going to be

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.480
 fried.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:06.440
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.680
 And that is Anna.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:16.680
 My fact is that when Mount Vesuvius erupted, it created many volcanoes in some people's heads.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.680
 Oh, look.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.680
 This is really...

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.560
 OK, so first of all, it's not, when you say in their heads, you don't mean they're thinking

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.600
 about it and it didn't really happen.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600
 No, no.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.600
 It was very much real.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.240
 This is, I'm talking about the famous eruption in, oh God, 49.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.240
 79.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.240
 Thank you.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.240
 That's good together, right now.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.240
 1979?

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.160
 It was glossed over by that, as election went, but it didn't happen.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.320
 So this is the eruption of Vesuvius in '79, '80.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.080
 And it's the fact that I read about this in a review of a book called Caesar's Last Breath,

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.480
 which has just come out, it's by someone called Sam Kean.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.280
 And it's about the history and the science of air.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.280
 Yes.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.280
 Sorry.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.280
 I think we all paused, because I think that's a familiar name.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.280
 He wrote the written book that we've got called the Disappearing Spoon, actually.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.280
 That's it.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.280
 Yeah, really good about chemistry.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.280
 He's a great author, yeah.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.800
 Well, this sounds incredible, and I've ordered it, and so he was wrote about this, and he

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:15.120
 said that when Vesuvius erupted, the heat made a hole in some people's skulls.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.320
 And then because of the pressure and the heat, the water in people's brains started to boil,

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.040
 and then all the chemicals and substances in their brain started to boil, and they turned

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.880
 into a gas, and then they were ejected out of the little holes in their skulls.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.760
 So they had these holes in their skulls that were ejecting steams and other chemicals.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.680
 And it's really gruesome, but it was 2000 years ago, guys.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.920
 So I think we can laugh about it now.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.920
 It's amazing.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.920
 It's really grim.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.920
 It's really grim.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.640
 I know, but it's extraordinary, right?

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.320
 Because what did it do?

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:47.680
 The heat burnt through the air, just through the skull, boiled and created a mini volcano,

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.640
 a rutting out of the people who were being killed by the volcano.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.640
 That's insane.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.640
 Yes.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.280
 It sounds like, you know, in a cartoon, when someone gets really mad.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.280
 Yes.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.280
 Yes.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.480
 And smoke comes out of there, ears usually, but if they got really mad, maybe it would

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.480
 just burst out with this guy.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.720
 Well, it sounds like someone's microwave to tampon and put it in their ears.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.720
 But yeah, that's it.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.680
 I've never heard anything remotely like that happening.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.680
 It's weird.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.200
 And I just love the fact that he's obviously made that.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.760
 So it was all Sam Keen saying, it created mini volcano.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.440
 Because it's not a real volcano, because it's not magma.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.440
 It's not magma.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440
 No.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.200
 And they're not large geological formations.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.440
 But it did make people's heads steam when the...

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.440
 Yeah.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.440
 It made them explode, didn't it?

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.440
 It made them explode.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.600
 Sorry, because there are lots of different stages, aren't there, of the explosion?

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.600
 So there was...

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.440
 Part of it, people were being buried in ash, and then part of it, is this when the pyroclastic

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.440
 flow hit?

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.720
 This will be when it was at its hottest.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.720
 So yes.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.240
 I think it was a combination of that sudden heat and sudden pressure.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.240
 Okay.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.240
 Friends.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.240
 Yeah.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.240
 Crazy.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.440
 And so this year, interestingly, scientists have pieced together bits of a skull that was

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.680
 blown up in this way, and they've got all the bits together, and they've put it through

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.440
 a computer system, and they've managed to get a picture of the guy what he would have

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.440
 looked like.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.560
 And he just looks like a Mediterranean person who lived around that time.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.840
 But it's amazing that they can get all the bits of skull that have exploded from the volcano

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.920
 in someone's head, and then see what they look like.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.920
 That's incredible.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.880
 Because presumably with the explosion, it would have gone off into various places, so you'd

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.880
 have to be...

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.880
 Yeah.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880
 Mix matching.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880
 Yeah, jigsawing.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.400
 It's like funny bones, that children's book, it's like the adult version of that children's

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.400
 book.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.400
 Yeah.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.600
 And how they defended themselves in the initial stages?

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.600
 What do you mean?

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.240
 In the initial stages of the eruption.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.960
 So we're talking about, are we talking about rocks falling from the sky, or are we talking

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.960
 about...

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.320
 Yeah, there have been earthquakes for a few days, and then there was a huge explosion in

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.680
 the mountain, and mushroom cloud went up, something like 20,000 metres, so there were little

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.400
 stones rattling around onto the ground, and people tied pillows onto their heads and walked

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.400
 around like that.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400
 No way.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.400
 Yeah.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.400
 That was how they defended themselves.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.200
 You know what, that big mushroom cloud, those big plumes, are called volcanologists.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.200
 What?

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.680
 They are called plinions.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.680
 Oh, really?

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.680
 After pliny?

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.680
 Yeah.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.480
 Which pliny though?

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.480
 The elder.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.000
 No, so the elder famously died when he was so curious he got into about the younger.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Yeah.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.480
 There was only one of the older...

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.960
 The older older.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.960
 Pliny the younger.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.180
 So he described the eruption when he was watching it as well, so it wasn't even just

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.300
 pliny the elder who was trying to describe it.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.300
 Pliny the younger.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.220
 It was back on land going, "I'm going to describe this as well."

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.060
 He saw the giant plumes of smoke that were erupting around it.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:39.940
 He called them umbrella pines, and that's been lost, but as a tribute to him naming it,

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:40.940
 it's been plinion.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:41.940
 No way.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.940
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.700
 Isn't it amazing that 2,000 years later he's still pliny the younger, he's not graduated.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.260
 But younger, doesn't matter how old you are, you're still younger, doesn't mean you're

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.740
 young just because you're younger.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:53.740
 That's true.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.380
 He's like kid rock, isn't it?

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.460
 Oh, look, he's knocking on a bit now.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:02.460
 He should change his name to dad rock now, shouldn't he?

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:07.700
 Did you know what the clouds are called, that form the clouds of kind of pollution that

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.700
 form around volcanoes?

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.020
 So obviously a lot of sulfur dioxide and lots of other gases come out of it, and they

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.660
 react with the moisture in the air and with the oxygen and the debris.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.100
 And they form this, if it's daylight, they form this big cloud that you can't really see

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.100
 through.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.100
 And it's called a Vogue.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.100
 Vogue, Vogue.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.100
 A Vogue.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.100
 Was that a Vogue?

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.100
 Yeah, a Vogue.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.940
 Well, as Wikipedia says, it's a portmanteau of volcano fog and smog, so I don't know which one

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:30.940
 is the O-Hog.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.940
 The O-Hog.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.940
 The O-Hog.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:33.940
 Is the O-Hog.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.940
 So the G is from smog?

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:35.940
 Yeah.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:36.940
 Okay.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.140
 Yeah, they call it that in Hawaii, I think.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.140
 Oh, okay.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:44.660
 Yeah, as in they'll say, there's a lot of Vogue out there because it happens relatively regularly.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.660
 Really?

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.660
 Yeah, I think so.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.660
 It's a bit of a Voguey day.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.660
 Have you got your fog lights on?

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.860
 They think that Pompeii had a one-way traffic system.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.860
 Oh, really?

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.780
 Yeah, based on the wheelbruts and the arrangement of it.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.340
 I just think it's amazing that you can know that there was a one-way traffic system 2,000

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.340
 years ago.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.340
 Yeah.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.340
 So I've been to Pompeii.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.580
 I went last year.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.580
 Have you been to Pompeii, James?

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.580
 You, okay.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.900
 I went to a sushi restaurant once, but I'm not going to go on about it.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.580
 If you've not been to Pompeii and you were listening to the podcast right now, definitely

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.580
 go.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.900
 It is genuinely the most exciting archaeological thing I've ever seen in my life.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.660
 It feels like time travel because everything is still there, including the people, which

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.820
 is mad.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.980
 You just walk around and there's this body of a person who was there on the day that it

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:33.980
 happened.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.340
 You don't see that anywhere else.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.340
 So it's pretty amazing.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:41.140
 The day that we went, I went with my wife, Finella, and she was really ill.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.620
 So she took a lot of lemsip and she had a lot of coffee and it was boiling hot.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.820
 And she started hallucinating.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.820
 Here's another tip.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.340
 You want a hallucinate, you can't afford LSD, lemsip and coffee and heat.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.340
 That's what you need to do.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.780
 And it was crazy because there was all these dead bodies around, obviously.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.900
 And so she was going nuts over it.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.740
 You don't see the actual bodies, though, do you?

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.740
 You do.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.060
 Yeah, they're in the pottery section.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.260
 That's the cast of the bodies, I think.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.260
 Yeah.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.540
 So what's happened is the people get buried, okay?

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.300
 And then they rot away.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.540
 And then there's a hole where the body used to be.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.860
 And then the way that they get them is they pour kind of concrete or something into

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.580
 it, and then they pull it out as a cast of a person.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.420
 Oh, I thought that was them.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.620
 You should have really read some of the information, so that's what you're in for.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.900
 I tell you what, I tell you what, I did read an information plaque, I was stuck on it

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.060
 for ages, and then I realised Pompey doesn't have information plaques.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:38.500
 And what I was reading was three different translations for how to use the recycling bin.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.380
 So there are really few household objects left behind, and it's partly because people

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.700
 had 18 hours between eruption and the arrival of the huge hot cloud.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.740
 So most people had left, and taking whatever they could carry with them.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.460
 But also the reason there's nothing there is that people returned, as soon as it was all

00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:00.220
 over, dug down into the ruins and nicked what they could.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.220
 Right.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.300
 And some of them fell in and died, so some of the bodies are those of looters whose tunnels

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.300
 collapsed.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.300
 Wow.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:15.580
 There's a German prince who made replica of Vesuvius in, so this is in the 80th century.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:21.620
 It was in 1794, and there was this guy called Prince Leopold III Friedrich Franz, and

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.620
 he--

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.620
 Charles German.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.220
 Charles German name you could have.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:31.340
 And Prince Leopold went traveling around Europe, and he visited Vesuvius and thought, well,

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.340
 that's very impressive.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.700
 This map of this volcano they've got, I'm going to build one when I get back home.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.880
 And he got back home, and he built something that he called the Stone Island of Virlits

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.540
 in the countryside near Berlin, and it was a five-story high brick and stone building

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.620
 that he covered in all these boulders, so it looked like a volcano.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:55.820
 And then he built a cone, the peak of it, and he put three fireplaces inside this hollowed

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.540
 out cone.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.020
 And then he made this crater, and he filled it with water.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.660
 And he erected some red lamps.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.780
 And then when he set the fires and tipped out the water, the red lamps illuminated the

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.500
 water, so it looked like lava running down his fake mountain, and him and his mates used

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.180
 to get together with some booze of an evening.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.300
 And then they used to light the fires and set off the volcano and watch Vesuvius erupts.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.300
 Wow.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.300
 That's quite cool.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.620
 I got one last thing, which is from Pompeii, it's just to give a bit of insight into the

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:27.660
 type of people that live there, because it's hard to kind of picture their day-to-day

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.660
 activities.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.300
 They discovered in the ruins graffiti that's just remained on walls of various places.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.140
 So they've translated a bunch of them that they could still manage to make out the full

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.660
 sentences of.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.820
 One reads, "If you're going to fight, get out."

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.900
 And that's written on the side of a tavern wall that they had.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.780
 Another reads, "I don't care about your pregnancy, Silvilla.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:47.780
 I despise it."

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:48.940
 And that's a private message.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.660
 I don't know how, because it would have been on the wall.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.660
 That's a PM.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.660
 That's a PM.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:54.660
 A PM.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.660
 A PM.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.660
 A PM.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.660
 Wall.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.660
 I'm amazed you haven't fallen into ruins since you bear the tedious scribblings of so many

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.700
 writers, and that was found at four different walls there.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:05.700
 That's funny.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.580
 That's like you get where people write on toilet walls, isn't it?

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.580
 They write stuff like that.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:11.820
 Well, the final one is a bit of a toilet wall.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.820
 It's Brotus.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.820
 Brotus.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.820
 Brotus.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.820
 Brotus.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.820
 Brotus.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:17.820
 Brotus.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.820
 Brotus.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.820
 Brotus.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.820
 Brotus.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:21.820
 Brotus.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.820
 Brotus.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.820
 Brotus.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:24.820
 Brotus.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.820
 Brotus.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:26.820
 You suck well, and that was founded a brothel.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:36.300
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:42.380
 OK, my fact this week is that the first bendy straws were used by people in hospital.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.380
 And why?

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:49.100
 Well, I mean, there's more convenient way to drink a drink, I guess, but why just in hospital?

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.500
 You've just answered your own question, isn't it?

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.500
 It's that, isn't it?

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.500
 It is.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:59.020
 It's just kind of like this, because I associate bendy straws more with fun times, and parties

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.020
 and stuff.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:05.300
 But the guy who invented them, the first place that he managed to sell them was to a hospital.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.780
 And like you say, it's so that people who are kind of lying down or not quite vertical

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.340
 can drink more easily, because before that they would always drink out of glass straws.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.340
 Glass.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.340
 Oh, wow.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.340
 Yeah.

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.180
 And that, it comes with a risk.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.980
 Yeah, but you're in a hospital, so.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.980
 That's true.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.980
 You can't think of a better place to sell them.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:24.980
 He's a straw.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.980
 It doesn't matter.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.460
 It only comes with a risk to the extent that drinking out of a glass comes with a risk.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.460
 I think it also comes with a risk.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.460
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.780
 And you have a drink out of beakers, don't you?

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.780
 Yeah, I have tippy cups.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.780
 I don't know what a tippy cup is.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.780
 I don't know.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.460
 That's one of those things that a kid has with two handles on either side, and they kind

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.460
 of suck.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.460
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.460
 It's got two handles, and it's got a little spout.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.060
 And also, it's amazing, because you can sort it upside down, and none of it falls out, even

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.300
 through the little spout.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.540
 It's like suckling on a breast.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:55.780
 That's why my kitchen cabinets follow them, James.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.780
 So I've been reading about the plastic straw apocalypse.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:25:59.780
 Yes.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.820
 So that's kind of why I wanted to talk about straws, because we should all stop bloody

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:03.820
 using them.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:04.820
 Right.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.820
 And our grandchildren won't have heard of them.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.820
 Why?

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.820
 What happened?

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.820
 What happened?

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.820
 They made a plastic mate.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:10.820
 Well, so is sushi.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:11.820
 I know sushi.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.820
 I know sushi.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.980
 But plastic can damage the environment.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.620
 And the thing with straws is usually if you're in a bar or whatever, you get a straw,

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.620
 you kind of throw it away.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.900
 It's mixed in with all the detritus and glass and whatever, and it's really hard to kind

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.140
 of try and take it out so you can recycle it.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.140
 So no one recycles.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.140
 Oh, OK.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.780
 So the problem is they're not being recycled.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:32.780
 And what do you do?

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:37.980
 You have it for like, what, 30 seconds, and how long does it take to drink a gin and tonic?

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.380
 But you have it only for like 10 minutes or whatever.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.380
 Yeah.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.380
 It's usually when I strawpido them.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.820
 So 80% of the time it takes about a second, yeah.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.780
 And sometimes they give you two straws.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.780
 Yeah.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.860
 Do you want a stat, Dan?

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.860
 Yeah.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.860
 And can I just also just quickly say I do know that plastic is bad for the planet.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:55.860
 Why not?

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.860
 It's more, I was trying to work out why.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.860
 And that makes sense.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.860
 Because what do we do?

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.860
 I always throw straws just into, anywhere.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:01.860
 Pigeons.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.700
 You're always buying packets of straws and chucking them about.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.700
 Yeah.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.220
 And that's, please Andy.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.700
 Americans use 500 million straws a day.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.700
 Wow.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.220
 There's only about 300 million Americans.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.220
 So some people are having a couple of straws.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.220
 More than one each.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.220
 There's more than one each.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:24.420
 And the total number used a day, there was an article about this which gave an amazing comparison.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:30.580
 It would fill 125 yellow American school buses each day full of straws.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.660
 That's more than a mile long queue of American yellow school buses.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.380
 And there's no children in them.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.380
 They're all for the straws.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.380
 Just straws.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.380
 Just straws.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.380
 And they?

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.380
 Each day.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.380
 It's a complete waste of buses.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.380
 That's the way it should be.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.380
 Yeah.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.380
 You have to go through to make the buses to keep the straws.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.380
 Exactly.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.380
 Now there's kids getting to school.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.380
 Yeah.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.380
 We can't carry on like this.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.980
 I mean, the thing is, if we recycle them, maybe it won't be so bad, but no one ever does.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.620
 And they're just completely piled up.

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.660
 Although I said this to you the other day, Anna, and you said you quite like a straw with

00:27:58.660 --> 00:27:59.660
 a gin and toilet.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.660
 I need straws.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.260
 And I always ask for them if they don't give them to me in my gin and tonic.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.340
 Otherwise, the ice gets in the way of the liquid.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.260
 And so I push it too hard towards my mouth.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.300
 And the liquid goes all down my front.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.300
 So I do actually need straws.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.860
 But I'm not a verse to, like, glass or metal or something.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.940
 Would you be happy to have your own personal straw?

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.940
 I'd love that.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.340
 I could get my initial engraved on it.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.340
 Yeah.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.340
 I think that's a good idea.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.340
 I think we'll have our own personal straws in the future.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.340
 Yeah.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.340
 I think that's a really good call.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.340
 Yeah.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.180
 You could kind of hang it off your belt.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.980
 Like people used to have with a knife.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:27.980
 Yeah.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.980
 No one used to have a knife draw.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.500
 You'd just have a knife, which you hung by your side, and you just for dinner or like cropped

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.500
 dandy style.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.500
 For dinner.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.500
 Right.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.500
 You're not the one that you're carrying around.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.500
 Would it be metal or would it be made of plastic?

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.500
 It'll be a metal one.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.500
 Yeah.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.500
 Otherwise, you can't really engrave in plastic.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.500
 That's a great story.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.340
 And then you can use it for an emergency tracheotomy.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.340
 Yeah.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.340
 Because everyone will always have one.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.340
 Yeah.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.340
 Yeah.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.340
 Perfect.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:55.580
 So in other plastic news, plastic recycling news, so the bad thing about a lot of plastic is

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:56.580
 they end up in the ocean, right?

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.300
 We should say, and they choke various animals.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.460
 I think you were saying that straws specifically go up turtles and noses, don't they?

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.860
 Well, when Dan's around, they do.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:04.860
 Yeah.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.300
 And they can't fight any pigeons.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.220
 That does happen a couple of years ago.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.100
 There was a video of one being extricated from a turtle's nose, and that was kind of the

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.660
 impetus that started this whole kind of, we need to stop having straws.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.660
 Yeah.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:23.740
 If you're in a bar, by the way, not if you're in a bar, but if you run a bar, get rid of your

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.740
 straws.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.740
 Yeah.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.740
 And if you're listening to this podcast in a bar, a, talk to someone.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.900
 But more importantly, throw away your straw.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.900
 Yeah.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.540
 Actually, all bar one are banning them, aren't they?

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.540
 Yes.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.540
 Good for them.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.540
 Yeah.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.660
 So I think you won't be able to get plastic straws in all bar one very shortly because of

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.660
 this very reason.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.940
 So, I know they're going to have no replacement.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:46.860
 Yeah, people are just expected to drink stuff straight from the glass, which I agree is a

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.860
 travesty.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.860
 Yeah.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:49.860
 That's what I'm talking about.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.860
 What are your feelings on crazy straws?

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:54.060
 Oh, they're the funny, windy ones you get for birthday presents.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.060
 Yeah.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.060
 They're kind of cute.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.060
 Yeah, love them.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.060
 Yeah.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.460
 Well, because you don't usually throw those away.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:00.460
 Those are keepers.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.460
 No, you'd be mad to throw those away.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:02.460
 Yeah.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.460
 They're solid.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.460
 They're a hard plastic.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.780
 I was reading about crazy straws online because they believe deeply that it's more than

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.700
 just a straw that it's a philosophy.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:11.700
 What?

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.700
 Yeah.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.140
 I read an interview by the guy who invented the crazy straw glasses.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.140
 You know, the one where you--

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.140
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.140
 Classic.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.140
 Yeah, classic.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.180
 He said that we say it's a metaphor for life.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.700
 Take extra time to go on a winding country road as opposed to the highway.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.780
 That's how he sees the crazy straw industry.

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:36.500
 It's not only are you buying something more long term, but you are experiencing the drink

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.100
 in a more philosophical fashion.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.540
 It's taking the scenic route.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.540
 Yeah.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.540
 It's the Buddha of straws.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:45.540
 It reminds me a bit of, you know that magazine that you get under delayed gratification.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.540
 Yes.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.540
 Which you get the news like three months later.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.540
 Yeah.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.180
 It's a bit like that because you're drinking your Coca-Cola or whatever.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.180
 Yeah.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.300
 And there's a few seconds when it's not quite got to your mouth yet.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.300
 Yeah, that's true.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.780
 That you can kind of imagine what you're going to taste.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.780
 Yeah.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:00.780
 It's that--

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.740
 We did it as a quote on QI in the very early episodes.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:09.660
 Stephen Fry quotes from James Bond saying the best martini of the day was the one just

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.660
 before the first one.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.660
 It's the anticipation.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.260
 It's the taste just for-- by the way, mentioning delayed gratification.

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.860
 Andy got his latest coffee the other day.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.860
 Can you quickly mention this?

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:19.860
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.460
 It came with a letter saying, we're really sorry.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:26.260
 You've probably noticed this issue of, like, identification has got to you a bit late.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.260
 Sorry.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.740
 None of the news is from before, I think, March.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:31.740
 Clay.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.740
 You think the letter would be apologised if it came early?

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:39.140
 Yes, that's true.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.940
 And so, do you know, Dan, how--

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.940
 Probably not.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:47.100
 What's the longest length of straw that you could drink out of?

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.100
 Ooh.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.340
 If I put, say, a can of beer on the floor.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.340
 Yeah.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:55.900
 And I gave you as long a straw as you wanted, but you had to suck from the top of it.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.700
 What is the tallest it could be?

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.180
 I'm going to say two floors.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.660
 That's a lot.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.060
 Two floors, so how many metres are you saying?

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.060
 So that door is two metres.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.060
 Oh, OK.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:12.260
 I'll say 16 metres.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.060
 The floors I'm talking about have a very high ceiling.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.060
 Yeah.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.060
 Oh, yeah, because you live in Versailles, don't you?

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.060
 Yeah.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.860
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.260
 Guys, do you think it's less or more than 16 metres?

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.260
 I think--

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.660
 Or maybe there's an infinite amount, maybe.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.260
 I think it's going to be less than that.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.460
 So I guess you need to have enough to be making a vacuum in the straw.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.740
 The water fills up to fill.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.420
 So it's just how long can I breathe in?

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.420
 I think I can breathe in long enough to suck in three metres worth of air towards me.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.420
 Oh, no.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.420
 No, I can go up.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.820
 Yeah, but the difference is with a straw, you can pause.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.820
 You can take breaks.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:50.060
 As in, if I were sucking on a straw, I could put my thumb over the straw and it'll hang there.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.060
 That's not going to lose it.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.060
 Oh.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.060
 I can then re-suck.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:58.460
 Yeah, but once you've got all the air out of the straw, surely, there's no-- you can't

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.900
 remove more if there's a complete vacuum in the straw, right?

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:06.300
 No, Andy is well on the route here, so if you had a perfect vacuum sucking up, that's the

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.300
 best sucking you can do.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.140
 You can't do any better than that.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:16.020
 And to get, if you're on earth, so you have to pull it up against the atmospheric pressure,

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.860
 the highest is about 10 metres.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:22.060
 If you had a vacuum, a perfect one, so obviously humans couldn't do any more than that.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.060
 10 metres is cool.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.060
 That's still high enough that I could be on the second floor of a building and get someone

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.620
 to deliver a drink to my door and pour my straw out.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.620
 You drink it.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:36.060
 The reason that that's kind of interesting or kind of important is because if you're trying

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:40.260
 to-- if you've got a mine and you want to suck the water out of the mine so people can go

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.160
 down and dig for rocks or whatever, you can only suck it up to 10 metres.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.260
 So anything lower than that, you need to do some pushing as well as sucking, which means

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.780
 you need an engine, which is why in the industrial revolution you had all these people who were

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.740
 inventing engines like Water and Newcoma and people like that because they needed to

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.740
 get this stuff up there without--

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.740
 So no matter how wide the straw doesn't matter.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.740
 10 metres is the limit.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:03.740
 Yeah.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:04.740
 That is really interesting.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.740
 Wow.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.740
 Yeah.

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.620
 I'm so, you think, here's the next question that you were just about to ask Dan, how do trees

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.700
 suck up water from the roots to the top of a tree?

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:13.700
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:17.380
 I was just thinking about-- I was just saying a xylem in a plant must work like this.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.380
 Oh, can we work it out?

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.380
 Is it possible to be worked out?

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.380
 No.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.700
 Well, it's in this kind of thing, it's always the same answer.

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:25.700
 The partner didn't.

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.700
 It's capillary action.

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.700
 Oh, OK.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:34.780
 So if you get a really, really, really, really thin straw kind of thing, then there's another

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.620
 force that kind of sucks it up there.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:40.940
 And there's also the cohesion of water, which means water molecules kind of pull on each

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.460
 other because they have surface tension.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.460
 Yes, because they're hydro--

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.460
 That is amazing.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:49.140
 So if the straw is thin enough, it can be longer than 10 metres is what we're saying.

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.140
 If it's super, super thin.

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.780
 So like one of those tiny ones that you do get in a bar?

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.860
 It's already hard to suck liquid out of those tiny ones, I think.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.260
 Which is why they give you two?

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.260
 Yes.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.900
 I always thought they were just for show, like offer staring, which is why I think they should

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.900
 get bloody rid of them.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.500
 I'm very excited that we might launch an anti-straw revolution.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.500
 Yeah.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.020
 Big straws going to come after us.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.620
 But the big straw can't be bothered in 10 metres.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:20.020
 Oh, we need to just go on to the third floor of a building.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:24.260
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.580
 And that is my fact.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:31.060
 My fact this week is that bomb detectors in America work 16 times better when they are

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.260
 fitted with a fake dog nose on the end.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.020
 This is such a silly fact.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.020
 But it's real.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.020
 I know.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.020
 It's astonishing, isn't it?

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.020
 It's amazing.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.860
 Yeah, so they basically tested this out in America.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:49.900
 They 3D printed out the nostril of a dog and they stuck it onto the end of a bomb detector

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:55.220
 and they use the methods by which bomb detecting dogs use when they're sniffing for bombs.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:36:00.860
 So a usual bomb detector will sort of take in a bunch of air and it will analyse it.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.220
 Dogs do quick sniffs.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.020
 So they did that with this fake nose as well.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.620
 They did these quick sniffs.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:10.780
 And as a result, they found that it produced results that were 16 times better by having

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:15.580
 the weird nasal structure of a dog on the end of their bomb detectors.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.780
 Yeah, because dogs, I didn't quite realise this about how dogs sniff and how they

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:24.780
 take in air, that they exhale in a completely different place to where they inhale, don't

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.780
 they?

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:26.780
 What?

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.780
 What?

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.780
 Yeah.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:29.780
 So they could probably play really long notes on a trumpet.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.780
 Oh yeah.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:31.780
 Or a surgery do.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.780
 Yeah.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.580
 They'd be amazing at surgery do's.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.700
 The way dogs breathe is that they inhale through their nostrils on the front of their

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.700
 nose.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.500
 But if you look at any dogs nose, you would have seen, if you've got a dog, they've got

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.060
 these slits down the side of their nose.

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.540
 And that's where they exhale.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.340
 So if you looked at a picture of a dog now.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.340
 What?

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.420
 They've got like a, I'm actually just going to show you.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.420
 No way.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.420
 Just super quickly.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.420
 You would have seen it on every dog.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.420
 I've never seen a dog.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.420
 All dogs have different noses.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.420
 Oh no.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.220
 Like a, they've all got this same nose.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.460
 Like a pug has a different nose to a side view.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.460
 I do.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.460
 They've all got dog noses that have a, do they?

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.460
 Do they?

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.460
 I've none of them have like a human nose.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:11.020
 I'm going to look for a variety of dog noses.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.020
 Okay, okay.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.020
 Right.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.020
 So here you go.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.020
 Yeah, yeah.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.020
 Look at that.

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.020
 Oh wow.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.020
 And then that's lip then.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.020
 Yes, yeah.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.020
 Okay.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.020
 Anna is not lying.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.020
 We can confirm.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.020
 I'm not lying.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.020
 All dog noses have this slit.

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.140
 And they've got this thing called an A-lar fold or an a-lar fold in their nose.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.140
 And they inhale air and then they pull the fold down so the air can't come back out the way

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.140
 it went in.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.140
 Right.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.140
 And they exhale it out of the slit.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.980
 And that makes their sense of smell much better because it kind of stops the air from

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.820
 being exhale down the same channel that they're trying to breathe in more sense.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.220
 So it stops at all getting mixed up together.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.220
 Oh.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:45.340
 And it means they can smell all the incoming air more intensely and in a more concentrated

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:46.340
 way.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.780
 So that explains why this bomb detects a kind of stuff works, right?

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.460
 Because it means that they're just passing loads and loads of air over it rather than bringing

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.140
 the same stuff in and blowing it out.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.140
 Exactly.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.060
 That is the most surprising thing I've learned today.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.060
 I know.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.740
 I was really surprised I didn't ever think about that.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:00.740
 Or even noticed that slit.

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:01.740
 A secret slit.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.740
 That we've not noticed.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:03.740
 Yeah.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.740
 A secret slit.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:11.020
 I was reading in Australia they have dogs that sniff out koalas.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.940
 So there's like, for example, there's one dog who in 2014 I think it was called Maya was

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:21.060
 trained specifically to cover a 480 hectare bit of land in order to map out where all the

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.060
 koalas were.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:26.380
 However, she was not trained to smell out koalas themselves.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.740
 She was trained to smell out their feces.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:33.940
 So she would not disrupt the koalas and get into, I guess, any fights or scare them or whatever.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.100
 She was just looking for the poo.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:40.060
 So her nostrils were trained specifically just for the feces as opposed to the koala.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:45.180
 This year there's another dog in Australia that's been put into the same kind of role.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.300
 And he is a dog called bear.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.500
 And so bear is also sniffing out koalas.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.740
 Who does a dog bear?

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.740
 Yeah, I know.

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:52.740
 It's confusing.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.740
 What's the one that's looking for bears as well?

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.740
 Oh, yeah, and he's looking for bears.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.740
 Yeah, it's very confusing.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.740
 Yeah.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:58.740
 So you've got a dog called panda.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.740
 Do you object to that?

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:00.740
 I do.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.740
 Yeah, okay.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:06.780
 I mean, you're sat right here, so it's hard to say it to your face.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.940
 It's just stupid name.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:08.940
 He went for it.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.700
 No, she didn't even feel like he found it that hard.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:19.660
 Yeah, but you can't just say that all dogs should be called dog, if that's the all.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.620
 I don't think I was saying that with the way of venting.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.660
 That's why we have names is to differentiate things.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.660
 Yeah.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.660
 James isn't saying we call dogs dog.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:33.420
 Yeah, I think there's a bit of a straw in that argument going on here.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.500
 I'm just saying that you should give it a name, which is not another animal.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.500
 But what do you object to them being given human names like Fred?

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.740
 Because I do object to that.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.700
 I think it's lying about the fact that this is a dog.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.700
 It's not lying.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.700
 It's not lying.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:47.700
 I don't think it is a lie.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:53.180
 First of all, the first of all, the secret slits, and now it turns like an even a user.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:58.460
 I think there should be an approved list of dog names called Rover and Fido, and that's

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.460
 more or less it.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.460
 Yeah.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.460
 That's, yeah.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.460
 I think you should be able to pick from list of 10 dog names.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.460
 Yeah.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.460
 I haven't got them all worked out yet.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.460
 You don't need that then, do you?

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.460
 No.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.740
 So humans need lots of names because you're going to lots of different social situations

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.700
 where you need to know someone's name.

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.500
 Most dogs are with their owner, the whole time.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:19.300
 I know, but if you're in a park and you go Rover and the entire park's with their dogs.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:23.900
 But that could be a maximum of what in ten of the dogs in the park.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.100
 That's not how probability works.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:30.180
 It wouldn't be a maximum of what in ten dogs in the park.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:36.180
 It would be a maximum of all of them, obviously, but the odds would be all of them very slim.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.060
 There is a chance of it being none of them in the past, but that relies on your dog having

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:48.620
 left the park and having no other dog in the park or Rover, which is also a possibility.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:54.820
 So anyway, bear has the civility, right?

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.460
 So check out the slits on bear.

00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:04.100
 He can sniff out not only a koala, so he's been trained not to sniff out the feces.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:09.660
 He's been trained to sniff out the hair of a koala bear, but the molted hair of a koala

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.940
 bear and fresh-multed hair.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:17.420
 So he's specifically going for hair that is not attached to a koala just so he's still

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.420
 here.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.420
 Isn't that amazing?

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.580
 I didn't know that hair smelled different when it wasn't attached to you.

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.620
 When it was attached to you.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:27.620
 What this might be is another thing that dogs are really good at doing is separating smells

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.900
 and they've got a smell-filing system in their noses.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.700
 So what they might be doing is smelling that there's hair, but without the smell of

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.980
 the flesh of a koala.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.980
 Oh, yes.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:37.980
 Yeah, yeah.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.260
 So we've got this mucus in their nose, and the reason their nose is the wet, what it helps

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:46.540
 them do is like file away the smells into different parts of their nose.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.300
 So certain molecules travel through the mucus faster than others.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:53.300
 So it knows that the first molecule that gets to it, the bit that actually smells, is likely

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.740
 to be poo, whereas the second molecule that gets through a site to be beef, and if a molecule

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.940
 takes ages, you know, it might be grass or something.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.380
 So if you have pooey beef, it knows that it's pooey beef, because it's gone through both

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.380
 of them.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.380
 Precisely.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.260
 So it only gets the first smell that hits, it's just pooey.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:12.420
 It's like an and/or decision gait in a kind of a computer, right?

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.420
 Yeah.

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:18.020
 So you're saying that it can get the hair and then gets a live koala.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.020
 Yeah.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:23.340
 But if it only gets one of those two, it knows that it's just the hair or just the shaved

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.340
 koala.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.340
 Exactly.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:26.340
 Yeah.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:29.900
 Did you know that blood hounds, who have an amazing sense of smell, smell what there is?

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.900
 No.

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:31.900
 Who's just talking?

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:32.900
 Yeah.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:38.620
 My dog has, oh no, how does he smell with his lips?

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.620
 Yep.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.820
 That's how the joke should be told.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.820
 It's not a joke, but it's the truth.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:47.140
 This is actually a bit of a stretch, but...

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:52.420
 This is the old Tushinsky special, so it's something ridiculous and they're backtracked

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.420
 severely.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:58.100
 Well, what they do is, they've got these really long ears blood hounds, and you'll notice

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:02.300
 that there is a place further down their heads than most dogs, and they also have really,

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.260
 really droopy jaws and really lots of wrinkles.

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:10.060
 And what these all do is they trap sense, and there is a supposed to drag along the ground,

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:14.580
 so there is scoop up lots of smells, and then they get flicked and carried in the wrinkles

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:19.100
 of their skin because they're so flabby and up to their nose, so there is there to drag

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.660
 along the ground and pick up smells for them.

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.260
 Yeah, and I think that's not far off, is it?

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.260
 That is so close.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.260
 Yeah.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.260
 Okay, right.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.660
 But how long does it take for them to smell something, then?

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.780
 I guess sometimes it would take a while, and then you've lost where there's a lot.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:29.780
 You've lost where it was.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:30.780
 Yeah.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:35.780
 I have one thing about bomb disposal, yeah, it's just a headline from a local news paper,

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:40.180
 this is the Bristol Post, this is within the last month, and the headline is, "Bomb Disposal

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.980
 Squad called to Western Superma Beach, only to find a really big plate."

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:50.580
 There's a bloke who found something metal on the beach who started digging it up, and

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:54.100
 it was huge, and he thought, "Oh God, okay, this might be something really serious."

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:58.540
 And so he re-barried it, found the bomb disposal squad, and they arrived, as a plate.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.540
 Who's taking such a huge plate to the beach?

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.260
 It's like a platter for sandwiches, maybe.

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.260
 And it would look like the top of a mine.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:12.060
 Completely, yeah, yeah, it's not a crazy decision to make, but with hindsight, it turns out

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.860
 to have been funny.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:24.500
 Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts, thank you so much for listening.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.620
