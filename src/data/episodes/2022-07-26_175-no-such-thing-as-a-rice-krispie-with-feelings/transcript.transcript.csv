00:00:00,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:23,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anichezinski and Andrew"
00:00:28,00:00:33,Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:33,00:00:39,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go starting with you
00:00:39,00:00:40,Andy.
00:00:40,00:00:49,My fact is that it takes 10 years to learn how to make artificial sushi to make it well
00:00:49,00:00:54,to make it well sorry any mug can just wait.
00:00:54,00:00:59,My one could get some plasticine and make some fake sushi right?
00:00:59,00:01:05,Not toy sushi as in Japan there's this amazing tradition where basically all restaurants
00:01:05,00:01:11,have their whole menu reproduced in plastic outside the restaurant to lure you in to say
00:01:11,00:01:12,how good this looks.
00:01:12,00:01:15,"Like when people, there's a place around the corner from us that is a restaurant and"
00:01:15,00:01:19,they cook one meal every day and they put it on a table outside and it's just a display
00:01:19,00:01:20,meal.
00:01:20,00:01:23,Oh yes it's a display meal I always wanted to take that display meal because they put
00:01:23,00:01:27,a whole pizza outside and you think why doesn't someone just come along and have this?
00:01:27,00:01:28,I don't get it.
00:01:28,00:01:29,I'm so close.
00:01:29,00:01:30,How has someone not got that?
00:01:30,00:01:31,They must be poisoned right?
00:01:31,00:01:32,And there's a glass of wine.
00:01:32,00:01:33,They must be.
00:01:33,00:01:36,There's a glass of white wine just sitting there.
00:01:36,00:01:38,We're going to take it guys you know who you are.
00:01:38,00:01:39,Have any of you ever eaten in that restaurant?
00:01:39,00:01:40,No.
00:01:40,00:01:41,Oh yes I have.
00:01:41,00:01:42,I have.
00:01:42,00:01:43,It's great.
00:01:43,00:01:44,It's kind of just society isn't it?
00:01:44,00:01:46,You just don't steal things?
00:01:46,00:01:47,Yeah.
00:01:47,00:01:49,I'm not saying it's a bad thing that people don't steal things in general.
00:01:49,00:01:50,Right.
00:01:50,00:01:51,It's a trust exercise.
00:01:51,00:01:52,Yeah.
00:01:52,00:01:53,I don't know what a waste won't it?
00:01:53,00:01:55,It's like taking something out of a bin.
00:01:55,00:01:56,And we all do that.
00:01:56,00:01:57,I guess.
00:01:57,00:02:03,So this is kind of like the equivalent of high street shops having mannequins in the window
00:02:03,00:02:04,completely.
00:02:04,00:02:05,Displaying their clothes.
00:02:05,00:02:07,Apart from all the clothes are fake.
00:02:07,00:02:08,Yes.
00:02:08,00:02:13,And there's an actual industry devoted to making fake clothes which no one will ever wear.
00:02:13,00:02:17,Yeah but you might make the clothes out of say toilet paper or something instead.
00:02:17,00:02:18,Yes.
00:02:18,00:02:20,Because it's cheaper and it shows them off.
00:02:20,00:02:21,Yeah.
00:02:21,00:02:22,Or is it not cheaper?
00:02:22,00:02:23,Why?
00:02:23,00:02:25,But there was an economist article all about this and then it turns out this is a massive
00:02:25,00:02:26,thing.
00:02:26,00:02:29,And I was in Japan about five years ago and it is true.
00:02:29,00:02:32,It's basically every restaurant has this stuff outside it.
00:02:32,00:02:36,And the thing is buying these things is really expensive.
00:02:36,00:02:41,"As in, the sale price is about 20 times the price of the actual piece of sushi to buy a plastic"
00:02:41,00:02:42,piece of sushi.
00:02:42,00:02:43,Yeah.
00:02:43,00:02:44,But then it lasts a lot longer.
00:02:44,00:02:45,It's the good thing.
00:02:45,00:02:46,And you're only buying one.
00:02:46,00:02:47,And you're only buying one.
00:02:47,00:02:48,And you're only buying one.
00:02:48,00:02:53,You can rent a burger for a month for a thousand yen and have it outside it because getting
00:02:53,00:02:56,a whole menu done is costs thousands of pounds.
00:02:56,00:02:57,Yeah.
00:02:57,00:02:58,The equivalent of.
00:02:58,00:03:00,I was reading that actually a lot of the companies that make these things don't do very
00:03:00,00:03:04,well in business because they are so long lasting these things.
00:03:04,00:03:08,So once you've sold it to someone then that bit of sushi last 10 years and so they're giving
00:03:08,00:03:09,you our business.
00:03:09,00:03:12,And so they're trying to sell them to China and to Europe now because everyone's got
00:03:12,00:03:13,them in Japan.
00:03:13,00:03:15,They should do what Apple do and make them break after two years.
00:03:15,00:03:16,That's a very yes.
00:03:16,00:03:17,Intentional obsolescence.
00:03:17,00:03:18,So whatever they call it.
00:03:18,00:03:19,Yes.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"Or like football kits, they should make new ones every year, new kind of sushi."
00:03:22,00:03:26,So you always have to have the most trendy sushi outside your restaurant.
00:03:26,00:03:27,That's what I was thinking.
00:03:27,00:03:32,I wonder if there's a plastic sushi chef who's innovating new meals and releasing them
00:03:32,00:03:34,"and they're going, ""God, we got to replicate this now."""
00:03:34,00:03:39,"Well, they don't really do that because the way they make these plastic imitations is"
00:03:39,00:03:40,so precise.
00:03:40,00:03:41,So get this.
00:03:41,00:03:46,They will send a designer to the restaurant where the food is made who will observe it.
00:03:46,00:03:49,"They've got some photos of the food, he'll make an architect sketch and then he goes back"
00:03:49,00:03:52,"to the factory and he says, ""We have to make it precisely like this."""
00:03:52,00:03:56,And that every individual piece is made with a mould.
00:03:56,00:03:57,Okay.
00:03:57,00:04:00,So he makes the mould first and then he...
00:04:00,00:04:04,"No, he visits the restaurant, sees the food, designs the mould, builds the mould and then"
00:04:04,00:04:07,"presses a single, amazing piece."
00:04:07,00:04:08,Nice.
00:04:08,00:04:11,So the mould for making a bit of tuna is actually made by pushing a bit of tuna into the
00:04:11,00:04:12,machine.
00:04:12,00:04:13,Oh really?
00:04:13,00:04:14,They use the fish to make the mould.
00:04:14,00:04:15,I believe so.
00:04:15,00:04:16,The fish would get squash.
00:04:16,00:04:17,Yeah.
00:04:17,00:04:18,That's not going to retain its shape.
00:04:18,00:04:19,This is what I agree.
00:04:19,00:04:20,I agree.
00:04:20,00:04:21,I have had sushi once.
00:04:21,00:04:22,And...
00:04:22,00:04:26,"One more time than you've had before, sorry."
00:04:26,00:04:27,Yes.
00:04:27,00:04:29,"But no, it's incredibly precise."
00:04:29,00:04:33,"And 80% of the industry is one set of factories, it's one company, basically."
00:04:33,00:04:34,Okay.
00:04:34,00:04:37,And all the rest is little cottage industries and workshops and artisans around that.
00:04:37,00:04:41,So why is it take 10 years to learn how to be a plastic sushi chef?
00:04:41,00:04:45,It's very precise and it's a very artistic thing.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"To make it really good, you know, to be a master, which is about as long as it takes to become"
00:04:48,00:04:49,a master sushi chef.
00:04:49,00:04:50,Trust it.
00:04:50,00:04:53,There are people out there who have both spent 10 years of their life.
00:04:53,00:04:57,"I wonder if at a certain time, at culinary school, you have to decide if you're going to"
00:04:57,00:04:58,go into plastics or...
00:04:58,00:04:59,Yeah.
00:04:59,00:05:00,And must be a time.
00:05:00,00:05:03,And do you reckon it's the best ones who go into plastics or the slightly rubbish ones
00:05:03,00:05:05,who don't get very good grades?
00:05:05,00:05:08,"The thing is, they make these plastic vegetables and then they do cut them with real knives."
00:05:08,00:05:13,"So it's like, it's a bizarre, proper, sheffing mixed with plastic sheffing."
00:05:13,00:05:14,"And they've been doing it for ages, haven't they?"
00:05:14,00:05:15,Yeah.
00:05:15,00:05:19,So I think it started in about the 1920s and it was because they didn't have menus.
00:05:19,00:05:24,"And so instead of a menu, you'd have this display of apparently that was easier."
00:05:24,00:05:26,I would have thought drawing something on a menu was easier.
00:05:26,00:05:27,"Yeah, crazy that that came first."
00:05:27,00:05:28,Yeah.
00:05:28,00:05:30,They were getting new foods from the West as well.
00:05:30,00:05:36,"So to explain what these are to your customers, it's easier to have it on display outside."
00:05:36,00:05:39,"Because you can see, like, on a menu, it could be any size, for example."
00:05:39,00:05:42,Or if you've had it molded.
00:05:42,00:05:45,You can put something next to it for perspective.
00:05:45,00:05:47,"Next to every meal, you could put like a little dog."
00:05:47,00:05:49,And then you would know how big it was.
00:05:49,00:05:52,"But that's the thing James, dogs are very in size, famously."
00:05:52,00:05:54,"All right, I should have chosen something more standard."
00:05:54,00:05:56,"Well, a plastic bit of sushi, just put that next to it."
00:05:56,00:05:59,And then that'll show you next to your tuna sashimi.
00:05:59,00:06:00,Which is a good idea.
00:06:00,00:06:01,Which is a good idea.
00:06:01,00:06:04,The best thing putting plastic sushi next to real sushi to give an impression of the size.
00:06:04,00:06:05,"No, next to a real Western, like..."
00:06:05,00:06:07,Sit your elbows and stuff like that.
00:06:07,00:06:09,"That would be a good idea, yes."
00:06:09,00:06:12,Have we ever said that about salmon sashimi?
00:06:12,00:06:13,No.
00:06:13,00:06:16,"The weird thing about it is that it's just not at all Japanese, and that it was brought to Japan"
00:06:16,00:06:17,by Norway.
00:06:17,00:06:18,"Oh, really?"
00:06:18,00:06:22,So people didn't eat salmon sashimi in Japan until the 1980s.
00:06:22,00:06:26,And then Norway had a shed load of fish that it couldn't sell and it had to offload.
00:06:26,00:06:29,Really wanted to sew out its fishing industry.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"And they had a meeting with the Japanese and thought, ""Well, this is a country that loves"
00:06:31,00:06:32,"eating fish."""
00:06:32,00:06:36,And so they started offloading all their fish and selling it to Japan and trying to market
00:06:36,00:06:37,it as sushi.
00:06:37,00:06:41,"Even then, so it was in about 1985 that they started eating salmon in Japan."
00:06:41,00:06:44,"Even then, it took about 10 years before they started eating it without cooking it."
00:06:44,00:06:45,"Wow, what was that?"
00:06:45,00:06:49,"Yeah, do we know what brought the country to sort of shift the attitude?"
00:06:49,00:06:51,Norway just kept forcing it down there for a minute.
00:06:51,00:06:52,That is true.
00:06:52,00:06:54,"I think they just had loads of it to sell, didn't they?"
00:06:54,00:06:55,Yeah.
00:06:55,00:06:56,And they just needed a new market for it.
00:06:56,00:06:57,"Yeah, okay."
00:06:57,00:06:58,That is amazing.
00:06:58,00:06:59,It was 1995.
00:06:59,00:07:04,"But I guess, even if you're used to eating raw tuna, it doesn't follow that you should"
00:07:04,00:07:05,eat raw salmon.
00:07:05,00:07:07,"There's some people eat raw beef, don't they?"
00:07:07,00:07:08,Yeah.
00:07:08,00:07:09,When you had a steak or chopped up.
00:07:09,00:07:15,"But if you were to give someone raw chicken, or raw pork, or chopped up, it's not a natural"
00:07:15,00:07:16,thing.
00:07:16,00:07:17,"Yeah, it's a mad idea, actually."
00:07:17,00:07:18,"Well, isn't it?"
00:07:18,00:07:19,You crack a raw egg on top of that?
00:07:19,00:07:20,I'd probably give it a try.
00:07:20,00:07:21,Raw chicken.
00:07:21,00:07:22,Yeah.
00:07:22,00:07:23,Yeah.
00:07:23,00:07:24,Probably just the ones.
00:07:24,00:07:31,"Actually, sushi isn't quite as old as you might think, modern sushi, anyway."
00:07:31,00:07:36,"The first kind of sushi was Nare sushi, which is from the third century BC."
00:07:36,00:07:38,But that was basically just pickled fish.
00:07:38,00:07:42,So you put fish in a barrel with some rice and with some vinegar and leave it there for
00:07:42,00:07:44,like a year.
00:07:44,00:07:48,"And then when it came out, it was pickled and it was edible."
00:07:48,00:07:51,"But actually, they would also scrape all the rice off."
00:07:51,00:07:55,"So unlike this kind of sushi that we eat today, they would deliberately get rid of all"
00:07:55,00:07:57,the rice and only eat the fish part.
00:07:57,00:07:58,That's amazing.
00:07:58,00:08:00,So did the rice help pickle it?
00:08:00,00:08:05,"It helps their fermentation, yeah, because if you ferment something, you need a carbohydrates"
00:08:05,00:08:06,to do that.
00:08:06,00:08:09,So we're sort of eating the packaging when we eat sushi and rice.
00:08:09,00:08:10,Yeah.
00:08:10,00:08:14,Did they eventually just get tired of scraping off the rice and a couple of grains of rice
00:08:14,00:08:15,stayed on?
00:08:15,00:08:17,And then there are a few more grains of rice and that eventually is a massive lump of
00:08:17,00:08:18,rice.
00:08:18,00:08:22,I think what happened was the next one that came was Han Nare sushi.
00:08:22,00:08:25,"And that was, they didn't leave it in the barrel for nearly as long."
00:08:25,00:08:29,I think they probably got a bit bored of waiting for the sushi.
00:08:29,00:08:34,And so they would open the barrel a bit earlier and then they would eat the fish with the rice.
00:08:34,00:08:39,"And my guess is, and this is just a guess, maybe it was a bit more sour, a bit more pickly,"
00:08:39,00:08:40,so that kind of took the edge off a bit.
00:08:40,00:08:41,I don't know.
00:08:41,00:08:42,OK.
00:08:42,00:08:46,I'm guessing as well that they were always eating sashimi with a bowl of rice next to them.
00:08:46,00:08:48,They just hadn't combined the two as a single meal.
00:08:48,00:08:53,"And have they, someone dropped one bit into the other and magic happened?"
00:08:53,00:08:54,Yeah.
00:08:54,00:08:58,I think they would have combined it as in they would have dropped sushi on top of their
00:08:58,00:08:59,bowl of rice.
00:08:59,00:09:02,They would have eaten the two together like we do cornflakes into a bowl and then put milk
00:09:02,00:09:06,"in it, but you don't sell milk and cornflakes together."
00:09:06,00:09:07,They should.
00:09:07,00:09:08,Yeah.
00:09:08,00:09:09,Exactly.
00:09:09,00:09:10,Why don't they?
00:09:10,00:09:11,Because it goes soggy.
00:09:11,00:09:13,"Oh my god, it's such a bad idea."
00:09:13,00:09:14,"It's, don't do that."
00:09:14,00:09:15,What an about-face.
00:09:15,00:09:18,"I mean, just a second or two."
00:09:18,00:09:19,Quickest switcher room.
00:09:19,00:09:20,I never heard.
00:09:20,00:09:24,"You'd be great on Dragon's Day, though, because I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in."
00:09:24,00:09:25,No.
00:09:25,00:09:26,OK.
00:09:26,00:09:27,Yeah.
00:09:27,00:09:30,"While we're on milk and cereal, so I was reading and asking, this is kind of related to how"
00:09:30,00:09:31,food is represented.
00:09:31,00:09:35,"There's an amazing guardian article about the secrets of food photographers, because in"
00:09:35,00:09:39,"the west we basically do this, we basically make artificial food in order to make it look"
00:09:39,00:09:40,good.
00:09:40,00:09:41,Yeah.
00:09:41,00:09:42,But we're doing it with real food sometimes.
00:09:42,00:09:43,"Like an advertising, you mean, or stuff?"
00:09:43,00:09:44,Yes.
00:09:44,00:09:45,Exactly like that.
00:09:45,00:09:49,"So strawberries get covered in lipstick, this is all from individual photographers."
00:09:49,00:09:53,"It's not like it's industry standards, but everyone has their own secret box of tricks."
00:09:53,00:09:57,It's a converted sometimes prey with WD40.
00:09:57,00:10:01,"The milk is almost never real milk, when you see a bowl of milk and cereal on a cereal"
00:10:01,00:10:02,packet.
00:10:02,00:10:03,"It's, it can be hair cream."
00:10:03,00:10:04,It can be white glue.
00:10:04,00:10:05,Oh.
00:10:05,00:10:06,That's a big thing.
00:10:06,00:10:09,And then you just shove the corn flakes into the top of it to make it look delicious.
00:10:09,00:10:11,That makes sense.
00:10:11,00:10:17,"Sometimes, if you need steam, if you've got a pasta dish and you're steaming in a bowl,"
00:10:17,00:10:22,one photographer puts incense in there and lets it smoke away and then just remove the
00:10:22,00:10:24,incense in post-production.
00:10:24,00:10:30,"And one photographer said she, her method, was to microwave wet tampons and then put them"
00:10:30,00:10:31,behind the pasta.
00:10:31,00:10:33,So they were steaming.
00:10:33,00:10:34,Wow.
00:10:34,00:10:37,"It's steam, particularly on photogenic on its own when it's naturally just hot."
00:10:37,00:10:38,"Yes, yes it is."
00:10:38,00:10:39,It must be.
00:10:39,00:10:40,There must be a sign.
00:10:40,00:10:41,It must be a photogenic.
00:10:41,00:10:45,"Well, they, I mean, this is, I mean, I think it's quite well known that they do use different"
00:10:45,00:10:46,things in adverts.
00:10:46,00:10:47,Yeah.
00:10:47,00:10:49,"I didn't know any of those examples, but I think that is quite well known."
00:10:49,00:10:55,"John Lloyd, for people listening, he's a guy who created QI, he used to do a lot of adverts"
00:10:55,00:10:59,"and he used to say that whenever he did a food product, like a cereal or something, that"
00:10:59,00:11:03,"in between takes, there was someone who would come and sort of move a rice crispy into a"
00:11:03,00:11:08,"better spot of the bowl and like, you know, as if you were doing someone's make-up between"
00:11:08,00:11:09,takes.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"Do you remember when China hosted the Olympics and there was that girl who sung the solo,"
00:11:12,00:11:16,but they put another more attractive girl on the TV for it.
00:11:16,00:11:17,Oh no.
00:11:17,00:11:20,"I don't get it like that, but then it's more serious to do that than to change your rice"
00:11:20,00:11:21,"crispy, I think."
00:11:21,00:11:23,I guess the rice crispy doesn't mind as much.
00:11:23,00:11:28,No one is pretending that this is a photo of a real bowl of rice crispy.
00:11:28,00:11:29,"Yeah, they are."
00:11:29,00:11:30,They are.
00:11:30,00:11:34,"Actually, James, I can't see any difference except that rice crispy can't be."
00:11:34,00:11:35,They don't have feelings.
00:11:35,00:11:36,They don't have feelings.
00:11:36,00:11:37,And they can't be upset.
00:11:37,00:11:38,They don't have those faces and those costumes.
00:11:38,00:11:42,"If you think they don't have feelings, yeah, then the advertising hasn't worked on you."
00:11:42,00:11:43,I don't think.
00:11:43,00:11:47,"Well, they try to do because if I thought the rice crispy's had feelings, I probably won't"
00:11:47,00:11:48,want to eat them.
00:11:48,00:11:49,I think I would enjoy it more.
00:11:49,00:11:51,As they screamed.
00:11:51,00:12:00,"So, on sushi, sushi obviously depends on that seaweed that wraps around it to be maize."
00:12:00,00:12:04,"And so, you know, basically, the person who brought sushi to Japan, who made it a viable"
00:12:04,00:12:05,commercial product in Japan?
00:12:05,00:12:06,"No, is it Mr. Nori?"
00:12:06,00:12:07,Because I saw it's called it.
00:12:07,00:12:08,It wasn't Mr. Nori.
00:12:08,00:12:12,"It wasn't Jack O'Nouri, the Irish."
00:12:12,00:12:15,"It wasn't that, though, very good suggestion."
00:12:15,00:12:18,"It was a woman, actually, who was from Lancashire."
00:12:18,00:12:21,It was a woman called Kathleen Mary Drew Baker.
00:12:21,00:12:26,"And she was studying the Welsh equivalent of Nori, which is the Japanese seaweed that wraps"
00:12:26,00:12:27,around sushi.
00:12:27,00:12:34,"And in 1949, she discovered that this tiny algae was actually the lava of Nori."
00:12:34,00:12:37,"And before that, no one in Japan had known our department commercially because they hadn't"
00:12:37,00:12:40,been able to work out how to get it to propagate successfully.
00:12:40,00:12:41,"So, in Japan, they loved it."
00:12:41,00:12:44,"They loved sushi, but they couldn't sell it ever because they would eat little bits of it,"
00:12:44,00:12:45,but they couldn't farm it.
00:12:45,00:12:49,"And this woman just figured out this random thing, I think she was studying at Manchester"
00:12:49,00:12:51,"at the time, about Welsh seaweed."
00:12:51,00:12:52,And they picked up on it.
00:12:52,00:12:55,"And suddenly, a revolutionized sushi, and it meant they had a sushi industry."
00:12:55,00:12:57,And they now celebrate her.
00:12:57,00:13:01,"So, she's this woman who no one in this country has heard of, and who never visited Japan,"
00:13:01,00:13:02,is celebrated there.
00:13:02,00:13:03,She's known as Mother of the Sea.
00:13:03,00:13:08,There's a festival held in her honour every year in Osaka on April the 14th.
00:13:08,00:13:11,And people go and they pray to her and they give offerings.
00:13:11,00:13:16,"They sing these special songs that they think of the Drew monument, which is a monument to"
00:13:16,00:13:17,her.
00:13:17,00:13:18,"So, it's like, it should be a monument to you, Drew."
00:13:18,00:13:19,No.
00:13:19,00:13:20,"Well, that's not my name."
00:13:20,00:13:21,My name is Laying.
00:13:21,00:13:22,"So, I don't know why we're friends."
00:13:22,00:13:26,Japanese restaurants still don't hire women sushi restaurants.
00:13:26,00:13:27,I think most of them don't hire women.
00:13:27,00:13:29,"This is in, we're talking in Japan."
00:13:29,00:13:30,In Japan.
00:13:30,00:13:31,Yeah.
00:13:31,00:13:32,That's right.
00:13:32,00:13:33,One time.
00:13:33,00:13:34,"When I went to itsy, that one time."
00:13:34,00:13:35,Because what?
00:13:35,00:13:36,The woman was buying the counter.
00:13:36,00:13:37,Yeah.
00:13:37,00:13:38,Why don't they hire women?
00:13:38,00:13:39,The chefs.
00:13:39,00:13:40,"As the chefs, yes."
00:13:40,00:13:41,Sorry.
00:13:41,00:13:44,"So, I think there's a superstition in Japan that women's body temperature is too high."
00:13:44,00:13:45,Or there was a really...
00:13:45,00:13:48,We don't want to cook that raw fish.
00:13:48,00:13:49,Fine.
00:13:49,00:13:51,To be by your touch.
00:13:51,00:13:57,"Good luck running your raw chicken restaurant tonight, because that chicken is going to be"
00:13:57,00:13:58,fried.
00:13:58,00:14:06,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:14:06,00:14:08,And that is Anna.
00:14:08,00:14:16,"My fact is that when Mount Vesuvius erupted, it created many volcanoes in some people's heads."
00:14:16,00:14:17,"Oh, look."
00:14:17,00:14:18,This is really...
00:14:18,00:14:22,"OK, so first of all, it's not, when you say in their heads, you don't mean they're thinking"
00:14:22,00:14:24,about it and it didn't really happen.
00:14:24,00:14:25,"No, no."
00:14:25,00:14:26,It was very much real.
00:14:26,00:14:30,"This is, I'm talking about the famous eruption in, oh God, 49."
00:14:30,00:14:31,79.
00:14:31,00:14:32,Thank you.
00:14:32,00:14:33,"That's good together, right now."
00:14:33,00:14:34,1979?
00:14:34,00:14:35,"Yeah, yeah."
00:14:35,00:14:39,"It was glossed over by that, as election went, but it didn't happen."
00:14:39,00:14:43,"So this is the eruption of Vesuvius in '79, '80."
00:14:43,00:14:48,"And it's the fact that I read about this in a review of a book called Caesar's Last Breath,"
00:14:48,00:14:50,"which has just come out, it's by someone called Sam Kean."
00:14:50,00:14:53,And it's about the history and the science of air.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Yes.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Sorry.
00:14:55,00:14:57,"I think we all paused, because I think that's a familiar name."
00:14:57,00:15:00,"He wrote the written book that we've got called the Disappearing Spoon, actually."
00:15:00,00:15:01,That's it.
00:15:01,00:15:02,"Yeah, really good about chemistry."
00:15:02,00:15:03,"He's a great author, yeah."
00:15:03,00:15:08,"Well, this sounds incredible, and I've ordered it, and so he was wrote about this, and he"
00:15:08,00:15:15,"said that when Vesuvius erupted, the heat made a hole in some people's skulls."
00:15:15,00:15:20,"And then because of the pressure and the heat, the water in people's brains started to boil,"
00:15:20,00:15:23,"and then all the chemicals and substances in their brain started to boil, and they turned"
00:15:23,00:15:26,"into a gas, and then they were ejected out of the little holes in their skulls."
00:15:26,00:15:30,So they had these holes in their skulls that were ejecting steams and other chemicals.
00:15:30,00:15:32,"And it's really gruesome, but it was 2000 years ago, guys."
00:15:32,00:15:33,So I think we can laugh about it now.
00:15:33,00:15:34,It's amazing.
00:15:34,00:15:35,It's really grim.
00:15:35,00:15:36,It's really grim.
00:15:36,00:15:38,"I know, but it's extraordinary, right?"
00:15:38,00:15:40,Because what did it do?
00:15:40,00:15:47,"The heat burnt through the air, just through the skull, boiled and created a mini volcano,"
00:15:47,00:15:50,a rutting out of the people who were being killed by the volcano.
00:15:50,00:15:51,That's insane.
00:15:51,00:15:52,Yes.
00:15:52,00:15:55,"It sounds like, you know, in a cartoon, when someone gets really mad."
00:15:55,00:15:56,Yes.
00:15:56,00:15:57,Yes.
00:15:57,00:16:00,"And smoke comes out of there, ears usually, but if they got really mad, maybe it would"
00:16:00,00:16:01,just burst out with this guy.
00:16:01,00:16:05,"Well, it sounds like someone's microwave to tampon and put it in their ears."
00:16:05,00:16:08,"But yeah, that's it."
00:16:08,00:16:11,I've never heard anything remotely like that happening.
00:16:11,00:16:12,It's weird.
00:16:12,00:16:14,And I just love the fact that he's obviously made that.
00:16:14,00:16:16,"So it was all Sam Keen saying, it created mini volcano."
00:16:16,00:16:19,"Because it's not a real volcano, because it's not magma."
00:16:19,00:16:20,It's not magma.
00:16:20,00:16:21,No.
00:16:21,00:16:24,And they're not large geological formations.
00:16:24,00:16:26,But it did make people's heads steam when the...
00:16:26,00:16:27,Yeah.
00:16:27,00:16:28,"It made them explode, didn't it?"
00:16:28,00:16:29,It made them explode.
00:16:29,00:16:32,"Sorry, because there are lots of different stages, aren't there, of the explosion?"
00:16:32,00:16:33,So there was...
00:16:33,00:16:37,"Part of it, people were being buried in ash, and then part of it, is this when the pyroclastic"
00:16:37,00:16:39,flow hit?
00:16:39,00:16:40,This will be when it was at its hottest.
00:16:40,00:16:41,So yes.
00:16:41,00:16:44,I think it was a combination of that sudden heat and sudden pressure.
00:16:44,00:16:45,Okay.
00:16:45,00:16:46,Friends.
00:16:46,00:16:47,Yeah.
00:16:47,00:16:48,Crazy.
00:16:48,00:16:52,"And so this year, interestingly, scientists have pieced together bits of a skull that was"
00:16:52,00:16:57,"blown up in this way, and they've got all the bits together, and they've put it through"
00:16:57,00:17:01,"a computer system, and they've managed to get a picture of the guy what he would have"
00:17:01,00:17:02,looked like.
00:17:02,00:17:05,And he just looks like a Mediterranean person who lived around that time.
00:17:05,00:17:09,But it's amazing that they can get all the bits of skull that have exploded from the volcano
00:17:09,00:17:11,"in someone's head, and then see what they look like."
00:17:11,00:17:12,That's incredible.
00:17:12,00:17:17,"Because presumably with the explosion, it would have gone off into various places, so you'd"
00:17:17,00:17:18,have to be...
00:17:18,00:17:19,Yeah.
00:17:19,00:17:20,Mix matching.
00:17:20,00:17:21,"Yeah, jigsawing."
00:17:21,00:17:25,"It's like funny bones, that children's book, it's like the adult version of that children's"
00:17:25,00:17:26,book.
00:17:26,00:17:27,Yeah.
00:17:27,00:17:30,And how they defended themselves in the initial stages?
00:17:30,00:17:31,What do you mean?
00:17:31,00:17:33,In the initial stages of the eruption.
00:17:33,00:17:34,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:34,00:17:37,"So we're talking about, are we talking about rocks falling from the sky, or are we talking"
00:17:37,00:17:38,about...
00:17:38,00:17:43,"Yeah, there have been earthquakes for a few days, and then there was a huge explosion in"
00:17:43,00:17:47,"the mountain, and mushroom cloud went up, something like 20,000 metres, so there were little"
00:17:47,00:17:52,"stones rattling around onto the ground, and people tied pillows onto their heads and walked"
00:17:52,00:17:53,around like that.
00:17:53,00:17:54,No way.
00:17:54,00:17:55,Yeah.
00:17:55,00:17:56,That was how they defended themselves.
00:17:56,00:18:02,"You know what, that big mushroom cloud, those big plumes, are called volcanologists."
00:18:02,00:18:03,What?
00:18:03,00:18:04,They are called plinions.
00:18:04,00:18:05,"Oh, really?"
00:18:05,00:18:06,After pliny?
00:18:06,00:18:07,Yeah.
00:18:07,00:18:09,Which pliny though?
00:18:09,00:18:10,The elder.
00:18:10,00:18:16,"No, so the elder famously died when he was so curious he got into about the younger."
00:18:16,00:18:17,Yeah.
00:18:17,00:18:18,There was only one of the older...
00:18:18,00:18:19,The older older.
00:18:19,00:18:20,Pliny the younger.
00:18:20,00:18:24,"So he described the eruption when he was watching it as well, so it wasn't even just"
00:18:24,00:18:27,pliny the elder who was trying to describe it.
00:18:27,00:18:28,Pliny the younger.
00:18:28,00:18:30,"It was back on land going, ""I'm going to describe this as well."""
00:18:30,00:18:34,He saw the giant plumes of smoke that were erupting around it.
00:18:34,00:18:39,"He called them umbrella pines, and that's been lost, but as a tribute to him naming it,"
00:18:39,00:18:40,it's been plinion.
00:18:40,00:18:41,No way.
00:18:41,00:18:42,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:18:42,00:18:47,"Isn't it amazing that 2,000 years later he's still pliny the younger, he's not graduated."
00:18:47,00:18:51,"But younger, doesn't matter how old you are, you're still younger, doesn't mean you're"
00:18:51,00:18:52,young just because you're younger.
00:18:52,00:18:53,That's true.
00:18:53,00:18:55,"He's like kid rock, isn't it?"
00:18:55,00:18:57,"Oh, look, he's knocking on a bit now."
00:18:57,00:19:02,"He should change his name to dad rock now, shouldn't he?"
00:19:02,00:19:07,"Did you know what the clouds are called, that form the clouds of kind of pollution that"
00:19:07,00:19:08,form around volcanoes?
00:19:08,00:19:12,"So obviously a lot of sulfur dioxide and lots of other gases come out of it, and they"
00:19:12,00:19:15,react with the moisture in the air and with the oxygen and the debris.
00:19:15,00:19:19,"And they form this, if it's daylight, they form this big cloud that you can't really see"
00:19:19,00:19:20,through.
00:19:20,00:19:21,And it's called a Vogue.
00:19:21,00:19:22,"Vogue, Vogue."
00:19:22,00:19:23,A Vogue.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Was that a Vogue?
00:19:24,00:19:25,"Yeah, a Vogue."
00:19:25,00:19:29,"Well, as Wikipedia says, it's a portmanteau of volcano fog and smog, so I don't know which one"
00:19:29,00:19:30,is the O-Hog.
00:19:30,00:19:31,The O-Hog.
00:19:31,00:19:32,The O-Hog.
00:19:32,00:19:33,Is the O-Hog.
00:19:33,00:19:34,So the G is from smog?
00:19:34,00:19:35,Yeah.
00:19:35,00:19:36,Okay.
00:19:36,00:19:38,"Yeah, they call it that in Hawaii, I think."
00:19:38,00:19:39,"Oh, okay."
00:19:39,00:19:44,"Yeah, as in they'll say, there's a lot of Vogue out there because it happens relatively regularly."
00:19:44,00:19:45,Really?
00:19:45,00:19:46,"Yeah, I think so."
00:19:46,00:19:47,It's a bit of a Voguey day.
00:19:47,00:19:48,Have you got your fog lights on?
00:19:48,00:19:53,They think that Pompeii had a one-way traffic system.
00:19:53,00:19:54,"Oh, really?"
00:19:54,00:19:58,"Yeah, based on the wheelbruts and the arrangement of it."
00:19:58,00:20:03,"I just think it's amazing that you can know that there was a one-way traffic system 2,000"
00:20:03,00:20:04,years ago.
00:20:04,00:20:05,Yeah.
00:20:05,00:20:06,So I've been to Pompeii.
00:20:06,00:20:07,I went last year.
00:20:07,00:20:09,"Have you been to Pompeii, James?"
00:20:09,00:20:10,"You, okay."
00:20:10,00:20:14,"I went to a sushi restaurant once, but I'm not going to go on about it."
00:20:14,00:20:18,"If you've not been to Pompeii and you were listening to the podcast right now, definitely"
00:20:18,00:20:19,go.
00:20:19,00:20:23,It is genuinely the most exciting archaeological thing I've ever seen in my life.
00:20:23,00:20:27,"It feels like time travel because everything is still there, including the people, which"
00:20:27,00:20:28,is mad.
00:20:28,00:20:32,You just walk around and there's this body of a person who was there on the day that it
00:20:32,00:20:33,happened.
00:20:33,00:20:35,You don't see that anywhere else.
00:20:35,00:20:36,So it's pretty amazing.
00:20:36,00:20:41,"The day that we went, I went with my wife, Finella, and she was really ill."
00:20:41,00:20:44,So she took a lot of lemsip and she had a lot of coffee and it was boiling hot.
00:20:44,00:20:45,And she started hallucinating.
00:20:45,00:20:46,Here's another tip.
00:20:46,00:20:51,"You want a hallucinate, you can't afford LSD, lemsip and coffee and heat."
00:20:51,00:20:52,That's what you need to do.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"And it was crazy because there was all these dead bodies around, obviously."
00:20:54,00:20:56,And so she was going nuts over it.
00:20:56,00:20:58,"You don't see the actual bodies, though, do you?"
00:20:58,00:20:59,You do.
00:20:59,00:21:01,"Yeah, they're in the pottery section."
00:21:01,00:21:03,"That's the cast of the bodies, I think."
00:21:03,00:21:04,Yeah.
00:21:04,00:21:07,"So what's happened is the people get buried, okay?"
00:21:07,00:21:09,And then they rot away.
00:21:09,00:21:11,And then there's a hole where the body used to be.
00:21:11,00:21:14,And then the way that they get them is they pour kind of concrete or something into
00:21:14,00:21:17,"it, and then they pull it out as a cast of a person."
00:21:17,00:21:19,"Oh, I thought that was them."
00:21:19,00:21:22,"You should have really read some of the information, so that's what you're in for."
00:21:22,00:21:27,"I tell you what, I tell you what, I did read an information plaque, I was stuck on it"
00:21:27,00:21:31,"for ages, and then I realised Pompey doesn't have information plaques."
00:21:31,00:21:38,And what I was reading was three different translations for how to use the recycling bin.
00:21:38,00:21:43,"So there are really few household objects left behind, and it's partly because people"
00:21:43,00:21:47,had 18 hours between eruption and the arrival of the huge hot cloud.
00:21:47,00:21:51,"So most people had left, and taking whatever they could carry with them."
00:21:51,00:21:55,"But also the reason there's nothing there is that people returned, as soon as it was all"
00:21:55,00:22:00,"over, dug down into the ruins and nicked what they could."
00:22:00,00:22:01,Right.
00:22:01,00:22:05,"And some of them fell in and died, so some of the bodies are those of looters whose tunnels"
00:22:05,00:22:06,collapsed.
00:22:06,00:22:07,Wow.
00:22:07,00:22:15,"There's a German prince who made replica of Vesuvius in, so this is in the 80th century."
00:22:15,00:22:21,"It was in 1794, and there was this guy called Prince Leopold III Friedrich Franz, and"
00:22:21,00:22:22,he--
00:22:22,00:22:23,Charles German.
00:22:23,00:22:26,Charles German name you could have.
00:22:26,00:22:31,"And Prince Leopold went traveling around Europe, and he visited Vesuvius and thought, well,"
00:22:31,00:22:32,that's very impressive.
00:22:32,00:22:36,"This map of this volcano they've got, I'm going to build one when I get back home."
00:22:36,00:22:40,"And he got back home, and he built something that he called the Stone Island of Virlits"
00:22:40,00:22:46,"in the countryside near Berlin, and it was a five-story high brick and stone building"
00:22:46,00:22:49,"that he covered in all these boulders, so it looked like a volcano."
00:22:49,00:22:55,"And then he built a cone, the peak of it, and he put three fireplaces inside this hollowed"
00:22:55,00:22:57,out cone.
00:22:57,00:23:01,"And then he made this crater, and he filled it with water."
00:23:01,00:23:03,And he erected some red lamps.
00:23:03,00:23:07,"And then when he set the fires and tipped out the water, the red lamps illuminated the"
00:23:07,00:23:11,"water, so it looked like lava running down his fake mountain, and him and his mates used"
00:23:11,00:23:14,to get together with some booze of an evening.
00:23:14,00:23:17,And then they used to light the fires and set off the volcano and watch Vesuvius erupts.
00:23:17,00:23:18,Wow.
00:23:18,00:23:19,That's quite cool.
00:23:19,00:23:23,"I got one last thing, which is from Pompeii, it's just to give a bit of insight into the"
00:23:23,00:23:27,"type of people that live there, because it's hard to kind of picture their day-to-day"
00:23:27,00:23:28,activities.
00:23:28,00:23:33,They discovered in the ruins graffiti that's just remained on walls of various places.
00:23:33,00:23:37,So they've translated a bunch of them that they could still manage to make out the full
00:23:37,00:23:38,sentences of.
00:23:38,00:23:40,"One reads, ""If you're going to fight, get out."""
00:23:40,00:23:43,And that's written on the side of a tavern wall that they had.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"Another reads, ""I don't care about your pregnancy, Silvilla."
00:23:46,00:23:47,"I despise it."""
00:23:47,00:23:48,And that's a private message.
00:23:48,00:23:51,"I don't know how, because it would have been on the wall."
00:23:51,00:23:52,That's a PM.
00:23:52,00:23:53,That's a PM.
00:23:53,00:23:54,A PM.
00:23:54,00:23:55,A PM.
00:23:55,00:23:56,A PM.
00:23:56,00:23:57,Wall.
00:23:57,00:24:00,I'm amazed you haven't fallen into ruins since you bear the tedious scribblings of so many
00:24:00,00:24:04,"writers, and that was found at four different walls there."
00:24:04,00:24:05,That's funny.
00:24:05,00:24:08,"That's like you get where people write on toilet walls, isn't it?"
00:24:08,00:24:09,They write stuff like that.
00:24:09,00:24:11,"Well, the final one is a bit of a toilet wall."
00:24:11,00:24:12,It's Brotus.
00:24:12,00:24:13,Brotus.
00:24:13,00:24:14,Brotus.
00:24:14,00:24:15,Brotus.
00:24:15,00:24:16,Brotus.
00:24:16,00:24:17,Brotus.
00:24:17,00:24:18,Brotus.
00:24:18,00:24:19,Brotus.
00:24:19,00:24:20,Brotus.
00:24:20,00:24:21,Brotus.
00:24:21,00:24:22,Brotus.
00:24:22,00:24:23,Brotus.
00:24:23,00:24:24,Brotus.
00:24:24,00:24:25,Brotus.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"You suck well, and that was founded a brothel."
00:24:26,00:24:36,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:24:36,00:24:42,"OK, my fact this week is that the first bendy straws were used by people in hospital."
00:24:42,00:24:43,And why?
00:24:43,00:24:49,"Well, I mean, there's more convenient way to drink a drink, I guess, but why just in hospital?"
00:24:49,00:24:51,"You've just answered your own question, isn't it?"
00:24:51,00:24:52,"It's that, isn't it?"
00:24:52,00:24:53,It is.
00:24:53,00:24:59,"It's just kind of like this, because I associate bendy straws more with fun times, and parties"
00:24:59,00:25:00,and stuff.
00:25:00,00:25:05,"But the guy who invented them, the first place that he managed to sell them was to a hospital."
00:25:05,00:25:09,"And like you say, it's so that people who are kind of lying down or not quite vertical"
00:25:09,00:25:14,"can drink more easily, because before that they would always drink out of glass straws."
00:25:14,00:25:15,Glass.
00:25:15,00:25:16,"Oh, wow."
00:25:16,00:25:17,Yeah.
00:25:17,00:25:19,"And that, it comes with a risk."
00:25:19,00:25:20,"Yeah, but you're in a hospital, so."
00:25:20,00:25:21,That's true.
00:25:21,00:25:23,You can't think of a better place to sell them.
00:25:23,00:25:24,He's a straw.
00:25:24,00:25:25,It doesn't matter.
00:25:25,00:25:29,It only comes with a risk to the extent that drinking out of a glass comes with a risk.
00:25:29,00:25:31,I think it also comes with a risk.
00:25:31,00:25:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:32,00:25:33,"And you have a drink out of beakers, don't you?"
00:25:33,00:25:34,"Yeah, I have tippy cups."
00:25:34,00:25:35,I don't know what a tippy cup is.
00:25:35,00:25:36,I don't know.
00:25:36,00:25:41,"That's one of those things that a kid has with two handles on either side, and they kind"
00:25:41,00:25:42,of suck.
00:25:42,00:25:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:43,00:25:44,"It's got two handles, and it's got a little spout."
00:25:44,00:25:47,"And also, it's amazing, because you can sort it upside down, and none of it falls out, even"
00:25:47,00:25:48,through the little spout.
00:25:48,00:25:50,It's like suckling on a breast.
00:25:50,00:25:55,"That's why my kitchen cabinets follow them, James."
00:25:55,00:25:58,So I've been reading about the plastic straw apocalypse.
00:25:58,00:25:59,Yes.
00:25:59,00:26:02,"So that's kind of why I wanted to talk about straws, because we should all stop bloody"
00:26:02,00:26:03,using them.
00:26:03,00:26:04,Right.
00:26:04,00:26:05,And our grandchildren won't have heard of them.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Why?
00:26:06,00:26:07,What happened?
00:26:07,00:26:08,What happened?
00:26:08,00:26:09,They made a plastic mate.
00:26:09,00:26:10,"Well, so is sushi."
00:26:10,00:26:11,I know sushi.
00:26:11,00:26:12,I know sushi.
00:26:12,00:26:15,But plastic can damage the environment.
00:26:15,00:26:19,"And the thing with straws is usually if you're in a bar or whatever, you get a straw,"
00:26:19,00:26:20,you kind of throw it away.
00:26:20,00:26:24,"It's mixed in with all the detritus and glass and whatever, and it's really hard to kind"
00:26:24,00:26:27,of try and take it out so you can recycle it.
00:26:27,00:26:28,So no one recycles.
00:26:28,00:26:29,"Oh, OK."
00:26:29,00:26:31,So the problem is they're not being recycled.
00:26:31,00:26:32,And what do you do?
00:26:32,00:26:37,"You have it for like, what, 30 seconds, and how long does it take to drink a gin and tonic?"
00:26:37,00:26:40,But you have it only for like 10 minutes or whatever.
00:26:40,00:26:41,Yeah.
00:26:41,00:26:43,It's usually when I strawpido them.
00:26:43,00:26:45,"So 80% of the time it takes about a second, yeah."
00:26:45,00:26:47,And sometimes they give you two straws.
00:26:47,00:26:48,Yeah.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"Do you want a stat, Dan?"
00:26:50,00:26:51,Yeah.
00:26:51,00:26:54,And can I just also just quickly say I do know that plastic is bad for the planet.
00:26:54,00:26:55,Why not?
00:26:55,00:26:56,"It's more, I was trying to work out why."
00:26:56,00:26:57,And that makes sense.
00:26:57,00:26:58,Because what do we do?
00:26:58,00:27:00,"I always throw straws just into, anywhere."
00:27:00,00:27:01,Pigeons.
00:27:01,00:27:06,You're always buying packets of straws and chucking them about.
00:27:06,00:27:07,Yeah.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"And that's, please Andy."
00:27:09,00:27:12,Americans use 500 million straws a day.
00:27:12,00:27:13,Wow.
00:27:13,00:27:15,There's only about 300 million Americans.
00:27:15,00:27:16,So some people are having a couple of straws.
00:27:16,00:27:17,More than one each.
00:27:17,00:27:18,There's more than one each.
00:27:18,00:27:24,"And the total number used a day, there was an article about this which gave an amazing comparison."
00:27:24,00:27:30,It would fill 125 yellow American school buses each day full of straws.
00:27:30,00:27:34,That's more than a mile long queue of American yellow school buses.
00:27:34,00:27:36,And there's no children in them.
00:27:36,00:27:37,They're all for the straws.
00:27:37,00:27:38,Just straws.
00:27:38,00:27:39,Just straws.
00:27:39,00:27:40,And they?
00:27:40,00:27:41,Each day.
00:27:41,00:27:42,It's a complete waste of buses.
00:27:42,00:27:43,That's the way it should be.
00:27:43,00:27:44,Yeah.
00:27:44,00:27:45,You have to go through to make the buses to keep the straws.
00:27:45,00:27:46,Exactly.
00:27:46,00:27:47,Now there's kids getting to school.
00:27:47,00:27:48,Yeah.
00:27:48,00:27:49,We can't carry on like this.
00:27:49,00:27:53,"I mean, the thing is, if we recycle them, maybe it won't be so bad, but no one ever does."
00:27:53,00:27:55,And they're just completely piled up.
00:27:55,00:27:58,"Although I said this to you the other day, Anna, and you said you quite like a straw with"
00:27:58,00:27:59,a gin and toilet.
00:27:59,00:28:00,I need straws.
00:28:00,00:28:02,And I always ask for them if they don't give them to me in my gin and tonic.
00:28:02,00:28:04,"Otherwise, the ice gets in the way of the liquid."
00:28:04,00:28:06,And so I push it too hard towards my mouth.
00:28:06,00:28:08,And the liquid goes all down my front.
00:28:08,00:28:09,So I do actually need straws.
00:28:09,00:28:11,"But I'm not a verse to, like, glass or metal or something."
00:28:11,00:28:13,Would you be happy to have your own personal straw?
00:28:13,00:28:14,I'd love that.
00:28:14,00:28:17,I could get my initial engraved on it.
00:28:17,00:28:18,Yeah.
00:28:18,00:28:19,I think that's a good idea.
00:28:19,00:28:20,I think we'll have our own personal straws in the future.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Yeah.
00:28:21,00:28:22,I think that's a really good call.
00:28:22,00:28:23,Yeah.
00:28:23,00:28:25,You could kind of hang it off your belt.
00:28:25,00:28:26,Like people used to have with a knife.
00:28:26,00:28:27,Yeah.
00:28:27,00:28:28,No one used to have a knife draw.
00:28:28,00:28:32,"You'd just have a knife, which you hung by your side, and you just for dinner or like cropped"
00:28:32,00:28:33,dandy style.
00:28:33,00:28:34,For dinner.
00:28:34,00:28:35,Right.
00:28:35,00:28:36,You're not the one that you're carrying around.
00:28:36,00:28:37,Would it be metal or would it be made of plastic?
00:28:37,00:28:38,It'll be a metal one.
00:28:38,00:28:39,Yeah.
00:28:39,00:28:41,"Otherwise, you can't really engrave in plastic."
00:28:41,00:28:42,That's a great story.
00:28:42,00:28:45,And then you can use it for an emergency tracheotomy.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:48,Because everyone will always have one.
00:28:48,00:28:49,Yeah.
00:28:49,00:28:50,Yeah.
00:28:50,00:28:51,Perfect.
00:28:51,00:28:55,"So in other plastic news, plastic recycling news, so the bad thing about a lot of plastic is"
00:28:55,00:28:56,"they end up in the ocean, right?"
00:28:56,00:28:59,"We should say, and they choke various animals."
00:28:59,00:29:02,"I think you were saying that straws specifically go up turtles and noses, don't they?"
00:29:02,00:29:03,"Well, when Dan's around, they do."
00:29:03,00:29:04,Yeah.
00:29:04,00:29:08,And they can't fight any pigeons.
00:29:08,00:29:10,That does happen a couple of years ago.
00:29:10,00:29:14,"There was a video of one being extricated from a turtle's nose, and that was kind of the"
00:29:14,00:29:18,"impetus that started this whole kind of, we need to stop having straws."
00:29:18,00:29:19,Yeah.
00:29:19,00:29:23,"If you're in a bar, by the way, not if you're in a bar, but if you run a bar, get rid of your"
00:29:23,00:29:24,straws.
00:29:24,00:29:25,Yeah.
00:29:25,00:29:28,"And if you're listening to this podcast in a bar, a, talk to someone."
00:29:28,00:29:31,"But more importantly, throw away your straw."
00:29:31,00:29:32,Yeah.
00:29:32,00:29:34,"Actually, all bar one are banning them, aren't they?"
00:29:34,00:29:35,Yes.
00:29:35,00:29:36,Good for them.
00:29:36,00:29:37,Yeah.
00:29:37,00:29:39,So I think you won't be able to get plastic straws in all bar one very shortly because of
00:29:39,00:29:40,this very reason.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"So, I know they're going to have no replacement."
00:29:43,00:29:46,"Yeah, people are just expected to drink stuff straight from the glass, which I agree is a"
00:29:46,00:29:47,travesty.
00:29:47,00:29:48,Yeah.
00:29:48,00:29:49,That's what I'm talking about.
00:29:49,00:29:50,What are your feelings on crazy straws?
00:29:50,00:29:54,"Oh, they're the funny, windy ones you get for birthday presents."
00:29:54,00:29:55,Yeah.
00:29:55,00:29:56,They're kind of cute.
00:29:56,00:29:57,"Yeah, love them."
00:29:57,00:29:58,Yeah.
00:29:58,00:29:59,"Well, because you don't usually throw those away."
00:29:59,00:30:00,Those are keepers.
00:30:00,00:30:01,"No, you'd be mad to throw those away."
00:30:01,00:30:02,Yeah.
00:30:02,00:30:03,They're solid.
00:30:03,00:30:04,They're a hard plastic.
00:30:04,00:30:08,I was reading about crazy straws online because they believe deeply that it's more than
00:30:08,00:30:10,just a straw that it's a philosophy.
00:30:10,00:30:11,What?
00:30:11,00:30:12,Yeah.
00:30:12,00:30:16,I read an interview by the guy who invented the crazy straw glasses.
00:30:16,00:30:17,"You know, the one where you--"
00:30:17,00:30:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:18,00:30:19,Classic.
00:30:19,00:30:20,"Yeah, classic."
00:30:20,00:30:23,He said that we say it's a metaphor for life.
00:30:23,00:30:27,Take extra time to go on a winding country road as opposed to the highway.
00:30:27,00:30:30,That's how he sees the crazy straw industry.
00:30:30,00:30:36,"It's not only are you buying something more long term, but you are experiencing the drink"
00:30:36,00:30:38,in a more philosophical fashion.
00:30:38,00:30:39,It's taking the scenic route.
00:30:39,00:30:40,Yeah.
00:30:40,00:30:41,It's the Buddha of straws.
00:30:41,00:30:45,"It reminds me a bit of, you know that magazine that you get under delayed gratification."
00:30:45,00:30:46,Yes.
00:30:46,00:30:48,Which you get the news like three months later.
00:30:48,00:30:49,Yeah.
00:30:49,00:30:52,It's a bit like that because you're drinking your Coca-Cola or whatever.
00:30:52,00:30:53,Yeah.
00:30:53,00:30:55,And there's a few seconds when it's not quite got to your mouth yet.
00:30:55,00:30:56,"Yeah, that's true."
00:30:56,00:30:58,That you can kind of imagine what you're going to taste.
00:30:58,00:30:59,Yeah.
00:30:59,00:31:00,It's that--
00:31:00,00:31:03,We did it as a quote on QI in the very early episodes.
00:31:03,00:31:09,Stephen Fry quotes from James Bond saying the best martini of the day was the one just
00:31:09,00:31:10,before the first one.
00:31:10,00:31:11,It's the anticipation.
00:31:11,00:31:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:12,00:31:16,"It's the taste just for-- by the way, mentioning delayed gratification."
00:31:16,00:31:17,Andy got his latest coffee the other day.
00:31:17,00:31:18,Can you quickly mention this?
00:31:18,00:31:19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:31:19,00:31:22,"It came with a letter saying, we're really sorry."
00:31:22,00:31:26,"You've probably noticed this issue of, like, identification has got to you a bit late."
00:31:26,00:31:27,Sorry.
00:31:27,00:31:30,"None of the news is from before, I think, March."
00:31:30,00:31:31,Clay.
00:31:31,00:31:34,You think the letter would be apologised if it came early?
00:31:34,00:31:39,"Yes, that's true."
00:31:39,00:31:41,"And so, do you know, Dan, how--"
00:31:41,00:31:42,Probably not.
00:31:42,00:31:47,What's the longest length of straw that you could drink out of?
00:31:47,00:31:48,Ooh.
00:31:48,00:31:50,"If I put, say, a can of beer on the floor."
00:31:50,00:31:51,Yeah.
00:31:51,00:31:55,"And I gave you as long a straw as you wanted, but you had to suck from the top of it."
00:31:55,00:31:57,What is the tallest it could be?
00:31:57,00:32:00,I'm going to say two floors.
00:32:00,00:32:01,That's a lot.
00:32:01,00:32:05,"Two floors, so how many metres are you saying?"
00:32:05,00:32:07,So that door is two metres.
00:32:07,00:32:08,"Oh, OK."
00:32:08,00:32:12,I'll say 16 metres.
00:32:12,00:32:14,The floors I'm talking about have a very high ceiling.
00:32:14,00:32:15,Yeah.
00:32:15,00:32:17,"Oh, yeah, because you live in Versailles, don't you?"
00:32:17,00:32:18,Yeah.
00:32:18,00:32:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:21,00:32:24,"Guys, do you think it's less or more than 16 metres?"
00:32:24,00:32:25,I think--
00:32:25,00:32:26,"Or maybe there's an infinite amount, maybe."
00:32:26,00:32:28,I think it's going to be less than that.
00:32:28,00:32:31,So I guess you need to have enough to be making a vacuum in the straw.
00:32:31,00:32:32,The water fills up to fill.
00:32:32,00:32:35,So it's just how long can I breathe in?
00:32:35,00:32:39,I think I can breathe in long enough to suck in three metres worth of air towards me.
00:32:39,00:32:40,"Oh, no."
00:32:40,00:32:41,"No, I can go up."
00:32:41,00:32:43,"Yeah, but the difference is with a straw, you can pause."
00:32:43,00:32:45,You can take breaks.
00:32:45,00:32:50,"As in, if I were sucking on a straw, I could put my thumb over the straw and it'll hang there."
00:32:50,00:32:51,That's not going to lose it.
00:32:51,00:32:52,Oh.
00:32:52,00:32:53,I can then re-suck.
00:32:53,00:32:58,"Yeah, but once you've got all the air out of the straw, surely, there's no-- you can't"
00:32:58,00:33:00,"remove more if there's a complete vacuum in the straw, right?"
00:33:00,00:33:06,"No, Andy is well on the route here, so if you had a perfect vacuum sucking up, that's the"
00:33:06,00:33:07,best sucking you can do.
00:33:07,00:33:09,You can't do any better than that.
00:33:09,00:33:16,"And to get, if you're on earth, so you have to pull it up against the atmospheric pressure,"
00:33:16,00:33:17,the highest is about 10 metres.
00:33:17,00:33:22,"If you had a vacuum, a perfect one, so obviously humans couldn't do any more than that."
00:33:22,00:33:23,10 metres is cool.
00:33:23,00:33:26,That's still high enough that I could be on the second floor of a building and get someone
00:33:26,00:33:28,to deliver a drink to my door and pour my straw out.
00:33:28,00:33:31,You drink it.
00:33:31,00:33:36,The reason that that's kind of interesting or kind of important is because if you're trying
00:33:36,00:33:40,to-- if you've got a mine and you want to suck the water out of the mine so people can go
00:33:40,00:33:44,"down and dig for rocks or whatever, you can only suck it up to 10 metres."
00:33:44,00:33:48,"So anything lower than that, you need to do some pushing as well as sucking, which means"
00:33:48,00:33:52,"you need an engine, which is why in the industrial revolution you had all these people who were"
00:33:52,00:33:56,inventing engines like Water and Newcoma and people like that because they needed to
00:33:56,00:33:58,get this stuff up there without--
00:33:58,00:34:01,So no matter how wide the straw doesn't matter.
00:34:01,00:34:02,10 metres is the limit.
00:34:02,00:34:03,Yeah.
00:34:03,00:34:04,That is really interesting.
00:34:04,00:34:05,Wow.
00:34:05,00:34:06,Yeah.
00:34:06,00:34:10,"I'm so, you think, here's the next question that you were just about to ask Dan, how do trees"
00:34:10,00:34:12,suck up water from the roots to the top of a tree?
00:34:12,00:34:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:34:13,00:34:17,I was just thinking about-- I was just saying a xylem in a plant must work like this.
00:34:17,00:34:18,"Oh, can we work it out?"
00:34:18,00:34:20,Is it possible to be worked out?
00:34:20,00:34:21,No.
00:34:21,00:34:23,"Well, it's in this kind of thing, it's always the same answer."
00:34:23,00:34:25,The partner didn't.
00:34:25,00:34:27,It's capillary action.
00:34:27,00:34:28,"Oh, OK."
00:34:28,00:34:34,"So if you get a really, really, really, really thin straw kind of thing, then there's another"
00:34:34,00:34:36,force that kind of sucks it up there.
00:34:36,00:34:40,"And there's also the cohesion of water, which means water molecules kind of pull on each"
00:34:40,00:34:42,other because they have surface tension.
00:34:42,00:34:43,"Yes, because they're hydro--"
00:34:43,00:34:44,That is amazing.
00:34:44,00:34:49,"So if the straw is thin enough, it can be longer than 10 metres is what we're saying."
00:34:49,00:34:50,"If it's super, super thin."
00:34:50,00:34:52,So like one of those tiny ones that you do get in a bar?
00:34:52,00:34:55,"It's already hard to suck liquid out of those tiny ones, I think."
00:34:55,00:34:57,Which is why they give you two?
00:34:57,00:34:58,Yes.
00:34:58,00:35:01,"I always thought they were just for show, like offer staring, which is why I think they should"
00:35:01,00:35:02,get bloody rid of them.
00:35:02,00:35:06,I'm very excited that we might launch an anti-straw revolution.
00:35:06,00:35:07,Yeah.
00:35:07,00:35:09,Big straws going to come after us.
00:35:09,00:35:11,But the big straw can't be bothered in 10 metres.
00:35:11,00:35:20,"Oh, we need to just go on to the third floor of a building."
00:35:20,00:35:24,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:35:24,00:35:25,And that is my fact.
00:35:25,00:35:31,My fact this week is that bomb detectors in America work 16 times better when they are
00:35:31,00:35:34,fitted with a fake dog nose on the end.
00:35:34,00:35:37,This is such a silly fact.
00:35:37,00:35:38,But it's real.
00:35:38,00:35:39,I know.
00:35:39,00:35:40,"It's astonishing, isn't it?"
00:35:40,00:35:41,It's amazing.
00:35:41,00:35:42,"Yeah, so they basically tested this out in America."
00:35:42,00:35:49,They 3D printed out the nostril of a dog and they stuck it onto the end of a bomb detector
00:35:49,00:35:55,and they use the methods by which bomb detecting dogs use when they're sniffing for bombs.
00:35:55,00:36:00,So a usual bomb detector will sort of take in a bunch of air and it will analyse it.
00:36:00,00:36:02,Dogs do quick sniffs.
00:36:02,00:36:04,So they did that with this fake nose as well.
00:36:04,00:36:05,They did these quick sniffs.
00:36:05,00:36:10,"And as a result, they found that it produced results that were 16 times better by having"
00:36:10,00:36:15,the weird nasal structure of a dog on the end of their bomb detectors.
00:36:15,00:36:19,"Yeah, because dogs, I didn't quite realise this about how dogs sniff and how they"
00:36:19,00:36:24,"take in air, that they exhale in a completely different place to where they inhale, don't"
00:36:24,00:36:25,they?
00:36:25,00:36:26,What?
00:36:26,00:36:27,What?
00:36:27,00:36:28,Yeah.
00:36:28,00:36:29,So they could probably play really long notes on a trumpet.
00:36:29,00:36:30,Oh yeah.
00:36:30,00:36:31,Or a surgery do.
00:36:31,00:36:32,Yeah.
00:36:32,00:36:34,They'd be amazing at surgery do's.
00:36:34,00:36:39,The way dogs breathe is that they inhale through their nostrils on the front of their
00:36:39,00:36:40,nose.
00:36:40,00:36:42,"But if you look at any dogs nose, you would have seen, if you've got a dog, they've got"
00:36:42,00:36:45,these slits down the side of their nose.
00:36:45,00:36:46,And that's where they exhale.
00:36:46,00:36:48,So if you looked at a picture of a dog now.
00:36:48,00:36:49,What?
00:36:49,00:36:51,"They've got like a, I'm actually just going to show you."
00:36:51,00:36:52,No way.
00:36:52,00:36:53,Just super quickly.
00:36:53,00:36:54,You would have seen it on every dog.
00:36:54,00:36:55,I've never seen a dog.
00:36:55,00:36:56,All dogs have different noses.
00:36:56,00:36:57,Oh no.
00:36:57,00:36:59,"Like a, they've all got this same nose."
00:36:59,00:37:02,Like a pug has a different nose to a side view.
00:37:02,00:37:03,I do.
00:37:03,00:37:05,"They've all got dog noses that have a, do they?"
00:37:05,00:37:06,Do they?
00:37:06,00:37:07,I've none of them have like a human nose.
00:37:07,00:37:11,I'm going to look for a variety of dog noses.
00:37:11,00:37:12,"Okay, okay."
00:37:12,00:37:13,Right.
00:37:13,00:37:14,So here you go.
00:37:14,00:37:15,"Yeah, yeah."
00:37:15,00:37:16,Look at that.
00:37:16,00:37:17,Oh wow.
00:37:17,00:37:18,And then that's lip then.
00:37:18,00:37:19,"Yes, yeah."
00:37:19,00:37:20,Okay.
00:37:20,00:37:21,Anna is not lying.
00:37:21,00:37:22,We can confirm.
00:37:22,00:37:23,I'm not lying.
00:37:23,00:37:24,All dog noses have this slit.
00:37:24,00:37:27,And they've got this thing called an A-lar fold or an a-lar fold in their nose.
00:37:27,00:37:31,And they inhale air and then they pull the fold down so the air can't come back out the way
00:37:31,00:37:32,it went in.
00:37:32,00:37:33,Right.
00:37:33,00:37:34,And they exhale it out of the slit.
00:37:34,00:37:36,And that makes their sense of smell much better because it kind of stops the air from
00:37:36,00:37:39,being exhale down the same channel that they're trying to breathe in more sense.
00:37:39,00:37:41,So it stops at all getting mixed up together.
00:37:41,00:37:42,Oh.
00:37:42,00:37:45,And it means they can smell all the incoming air more intensely and in a more concentrated
00:37:45,00:37:46,way.
00:37:46,00:37:48,"So that explains why this bomb detects a kind of stuff works, right?"
00:37:48,00:37:52,Because it means that they're just passing loads and loads of air over it rather than bringing
00:37:52,00:37:54,the same stuff in and blowing it out.
00:37:54,00:37:55,Exactly.
00:37:55,00:37:57,That is the most surprising thing I've learned today.
00:37:57,00:37:58,I know.
00:37:58,00:37:59,I was really surprised I didn't ever think about that.
00:37:59,00:38:00,Or even noticed that slit.
00:38:00,00:38:01,A secret slit.
00:38:01,00:38:02,That we've not noticed.
00:38:02,00:38:03,Yeah.
00:38:03,00:38:05,A secret slit.
00:38:05,00:38:11,I was reading in Australia they have dogs that sniff out koalas.
00:38:11,00:38:15,"So there's like, for example, there's one dog who in 2014 I think it was called Maya was"
00:38:15,00:38:21,trained specifically to cover a 480 hectare bit of land in order to map out where all the
00:38:21,00:38:22,koalas were.
00:38:22,00:38:26,"However, she was not trained to smell out koalas themselves."
00:38:26,00:38:28,She was trained to smell out their feces.
00:38:28,00:38:33,"So she would not disrupt the koalas and get into, I guess, any fights or scare them or whatever."
00:38:33,00:38:35,She was just looking for the poo.
00:38:35,00:38:40,So her nostrils were trained specifically just for the feces as opposed to the koala.
00:38:40,00:38:45,This year there's another dog in Australia that's been put into the same kind of role.
00:38:45,00:38:47,And he is a dog called bear.
00:38:47,00:38:49,And so bear is also sniffing out koalas.
00:38:49,00:38:50,Who does a dog bear?
00:38:50,00:38:51,"Yeah, I know."
00:38:51,00:38:52,It's confusing.
00:38:52,00:38:54,What's the one that's looking for bears as well?
00:38:54,00:38:55,"Oh, yeah, and he's looking for bears."
00:38:55,00:38:56,"Yeah, it's very confusing."
00:38:56,00:38:57,Yeah.
00:38:57,00:38:58,So you've got a dog called panda.
00:38:58,00:38:59,Do you object to that?
00:38:59,00:39:00,I do.
00:39:00,00:39:01,"Yeah, okay."
00:39:01,00:39:06,"I mean, you're sat right here, so it's hard to say it to your face."
00:39:06,00:39:07,It's just stupid name.
00:39:07,00:39:08,He went for it.
00:39:08,00:39:12,"No, she didn't even feel like he found it that hard."
00:39:12,00:39:19,"Yeah, but you can't just say that all dogs should be called dog, if that's the all."
00:39:19,00:39:22,I don't think I was saying that with the way of venting.
00:39:22,00:39:25,That's why we have names is to differentiate things.
00:39:25,00:39:26,Yeah.
00:39:26,00:39:28,James isn't saying we call dogs dog.
00:39:28,00:39:33,"Yeah, I think there's a bit of a straw in that argument going on here."
00:39:33,00:39:37,"I'm just saying that you should give it a name, which is not another animal."
00:39:37,00:39:40,But what do you object to them being given human names like Fred?
00:39:40,00:39:41,Because I do object to that.
00:39:41,00:39:44,I think it's lying about the fact that this is a dog.
00:39:44,00:39:45,It's not lying.
00:39:45,00:39:46,It's not lying.
00:39:46,00:39:47,I don't think it is a lie.
00:39:47,00:39:53,"First of all, the first of all, the secret slits, and now it turns like an even a user."
00:39:53,00:39:58,"I think there should be an approved list of dog names called Rover and Fido, and that's"
00:39:58,00:39:59,more or less it.
00:39:59,00:40:00,Yeah.
00:40:00,00:40:01,"That's, yeah."
00:40:01,00:40:03,I think you should be able to pick from list of 10 dog names.
00:40:03,00:40:04,Yeah.
00:40:04,00:40:05,I haven't got them all worked out yet.
00:40:05,00:40:06,"You don't need that then, do you?"
00:40:06,00:40:07,No.
00:40:07,00:40:10,So humans need lots of names because you're going to lots of different social situations
00:40:10,00:40:12,where you need to know someone's name.
00:40:12,00:40:14,"Most dogs are with their owner, the whole time."
00:40:14,00:40:19,"I know, but if you're in a park and you go Rover and the entire park's with their dogs."
00:40:19,00:40:23,But that could be a maximum of what in ten of the dogs in the park.
00:40:23,00:40:26,That's not how probability works.
00:40:26,00:40:30,It wouldn't be a maximum of what in ten dogs in the park.
00:40:30,00:40:36,"It would be a maximum of all of them, obviously, but the odds would be all of them very slim."
00:40:36,00:40:40,"There is a chance of it being none of them in the past, but that relies on your dog having"
00:40:40,00:40:48,"left the park and having no other dog in the park or Rover, which is also a possibility."
00:40:48,00:40:54,"So anyway, bear has the civility, right?"
00:40:54,00:40:56,So check out the slits on bear.
00:40:56,00:41:04,"He can sniff out not only a koala, so he's been trained not to sniff out the feces."
00:41:04,00:41:09,"He's been trained to sniff out the hair of a koala bear, but the molted hair of a koala"
00:41:09,00:41:11,bear and fresh-multed hair.
00:41:11,00:41:17,So he's specifically going for hair that is not attached to a koala just so he's still
00:41:17,00:41:18,here.
00:41:18,00:41:19,Isn't that amazing?
00:41:19,00:41:22,I didn't know that hair smelled different when it wasn't attached to you.
00:41:22,00:41:23,When it was attached to you.
00:41:23,00:41:27,What this might be is another thing that dogs are really good at doing is separating smells
00:41:27,00:41:30,and they've got a smell-filing system in their noses.
00:41:30,00:41:34,"So what they might be doing is smelling that there's hair, but without the smell of"
00:41:34,00:41:35,the flesh of a koala.
00:41:35,00:41:36,"Oh, yes."
00:41:36,00:41:37,"Yeah, yeah."
00:41:37,00:41:42,"So we've got this mucus in their nose, and the reason their nose is the wet, what it helps"
00:41:42,00:41:46,them do is like file away the smells into different parts of their nose.
00:41:46,00:41:49,So certain molecules travel through the mucus faster than others.
00:41:49,00:41:53,"So it knows that the first molecule that gets to it, the bit that actually smells, is likely"
00:41:53,00:41:57,"to be poo, whereas the second molecule that gets through a site to be beef, and if a molecule"
00:41:57,00:41:59,"takes ages, you know, it might be grass or something."
00:41:59,00:42:03,"So if you have pooey beef, it knows that it's pooey beef, because it's gone through both"
00:42:03,00:42:04,of them.
00:42:04,00:42:05,Precisely.
00:42:05,00:42:08,"So it only gets the first smell that hits, it's just pooey."
00:42:08,00:42:12,"It's like an and/or decision gait in a kind of a computer, right?"
00:42:12,00:42:13,Yeah.
00:42:13,00:42:18,So you're saying that it can get the hair and then gets a live koala.
00:42:18,00:42:19,Yeah.
00:42:19,00:42:23,"But if it only gets one of those two, it knows that it's just the hair or just the shaved"
00:42:23,00:42:24,koala.
00:42:24,00:42:25,Exactly.
00:42:25,00:42:26,Yeah.
00:42:26,00:42:29,"Did you know that blood hounds, who have an amazing sense of smell, smell what there is?"
00:42:29,00:42:30,No.
00:42:30,00:42:31,Who's just talking?
00:42:31,00:42:32,Yeah.
00:42:32,00:42:38,"My dog has, oh no, how does he smell with his lips?"
00:42:38,00:42:39,Yep.
00:42:39,00:42:41,That's how the joke should be told.
00:42:41,00:42:44,"It's not a joke, but it's the truth."
00:42:44,00:42:47,"This is actually a bit of a stretch, but..."
00:42:47,00:42:52,"This is the old Tushinsky special, so it's something ridiculous and they're backtracked"
00:42:52,00:42:53,severely.
00:42:53,00:42:58,"Well, what they do is, they've got these really long ears blood hounds, and you'll notice"
00:42:58,00:43:02,"that there is a place further down their heads than most dogs, and they also have really,"
00:43:02,00:43:05,really droopy jaws and really lots of wrinkles.
00:43:05,00:43:10,"And what these all do is they trap sense, and there is a supposed to drag along the ground,"
00:43:10,00:43:14,"so there is scoop up lots of smells, and then they get flicked and carried in the wrinkles"
00:43:14,00:43:19,"of their skin because they're so flabby and up to their nose, so there is there to drag"
00:43:19,00:43:20,along the ground and pick up smells for them.
00:43:20,00:43:22,"Yeah, and I think that's not far off, is it?"
00:43:22,00:43:23,That is so close.
00:43:23,00:43:24,Yeah.
00:43:24,00:43:25,"Okay, right."
00:43:25,00:43:26,"But how long does it take for them to smell something, then?"
00:43:26,00:43:28,"I guess sometimes it would take a while, and then you've lost where there's a lot."
00:43:28,00:43:29,You've lost where it was.
00:43:29,00:43:30,Yeah.
00:43:30,00:43:35,"I have one thing about bomb disposal, yeah, it's just a headline from a local news paper,"
00:43:35,00:43:40,"this is the Bristol Post, this is within the last month, and the headline is, ""Bomb Disposal"
00:43:40,00:43:43,"Squad called to Western Superma Beach, only to find a really big plate."""
00:43:43,00:43:50,"There's a bloke who found something metal on the beach who started digging it up, and"
00:43:50,00:43:54,"it was huge, and he thought, ""Oh God, okay, this might be something really serious."""
00:43:54,00:43:58,"And so he re-barried it, found the bomb disposal squad, and they arrived, as a plate."
00:43:58,00:44:02,Who's taking such a huge plate to the beach?
00:44:02,00:44:05,"It's like a platter for sandwiches, maybe."
00:44:05,00:44:06,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:06,00:44:08,And it would look like the top of a mine.
00:44:08,00:44:12,"Completely, yeah, yeah, it's not a crazy decision to make, but with hindsight, it turns out"
00:44:12,00:44:13,to have been funny.
00:44:13,00:44:24,"Okay, that is it, that is all of our facts, thank you so much for listening."
00:44:24,00:44:27,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said over
