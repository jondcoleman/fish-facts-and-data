00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640
 Hey there club fish members, Dan here. Welcome to your exclusive extra secret bit of bonus

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.360
 content and this time we have for you a very exciting compilation. Exciting because as

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.600
 with last time it is rampact with the bonanza of comedy dorks so as well as me, Andy and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.680
 James you are going to get the soothing nerdy tones of John Lloyd, Hank Green, Hannah Fry,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.760
 Harriet Lloyd and Sally Phillips. Sally Phillips's episode it's worth noting is from the British

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.880
 Library gig that we did a few months back and so you're going to hear at the end of

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.880
 this episode a very quick Q&A that we managed to sneak in at the end of that show and unfortunately

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.840
 we couldn't do longer because we ran over from the main show but they are super fun,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.160
 these live shows and it is worth saying that if you do want to come to one of those we

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.240
 do have three left this year so far so we're going to be doing two more at the Soho Theatre

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.480
 on the 21st of August now unfortunately it's sold out but if you happen to be in central

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.880
 London on the day do just check their website because there are returns and also sometimes

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.480
 they just release tickets that they've held back but if you do want to come to another

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.800
 live show in September we have one on the 14th of September at Kings Place for the London

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.400
 podcast festival and that show is also sold out however unlike the Soho shows we are live

 the Kings Place gig you will be able to buy live stream tickets so that you can watch it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.880
 from the comfort of your own home on top of that you can also discuss what we're saying

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.640

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.560
 for the meantime enjoy the compilation.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 [Music]

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:03.560
 Does the table feel bigger to you guys?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 No.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.560
 Doesn't it?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560
 Oh that's interesting.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 It just feels bigger.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
 No it is bigger.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 No.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.560
 Is it?

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.560
 It feels bigger.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.560
 It definitely feels bigger.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560
 Do we normally have something in the middle?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.560
 No.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.560
 Do we have a feeling as well?

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.560
 Well I'm now but only because you put it in my head.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.560
 Let's before we lose all this magic.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560
 Let's go.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.560
 Oh my god.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.560
 Okay.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560
 All right.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.560
 I'll tell you a fact that is true though.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.560
 Perfect.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.560
 You've been taking lessons from Dan in the segue.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.560
 Well actually I don't know that this is true.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.560
 I'm going to tell you a muck fact which you can check later.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.560
 That's a great time.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.560
 A muck fact.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.560
 There used to be a thing about McDonald's.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.560
 McDonald's nutrition muck facts.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.560
 Which I used to love.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.560
 Yeah.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.560
 It's like a fact but a muck fact.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560
 Jane Goodall's son.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560
 She did chimpanzees.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560
 That's right isn't it?

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.560
 Yeah that's right.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.560
 She had a son and she used to keep him in a cage

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.560
 to protect him from the chimpanzees which were aggressive.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.560
 Guess what he does now for a job?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.560
 A prison warden.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.560
 Shock photographer.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.560
 Oh.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.560
 He just wants to be back in the cage.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560
 Well I don't know.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560
 He feels safe.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.560
 It's a safe place.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.560
 I would love to interview him.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.560
 Yeah.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560
 That is incredible.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560
 Isn't it?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.560
 Let's check it's true by the way.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.560
 I've definitely been told that in a product by someone who might know.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.560
 I've got a doll of Jane Goodall.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.560
 It's like a Barbie doll of Jane Goodall right?

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.560
 Really?

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560
 Yeah.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.560
 For my daughter.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.560
 That's so weird.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.560
 For your daughter.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.560
 What's, what are the, does it have accessories?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 Yeah it has a little David Grey beard which is the name of the chimpanzee

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560
 who she loads after.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.560
 A little boy in a cage.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.560
 But the thing is like, I know Dan collects a lot of celebrity,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.560
 you know, memorabilia and almost all the people end up, you know,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.560
 celebrities, they end up getting in trouble for something.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.560
 I thought I was safe with Jane Goodall.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560
 Yeah.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.560
 I thought there's no way that she could get cancelled.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.560
 Well, let's start it tonight.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.560
 No she's not.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.560
 I do it.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.560
 What has she done?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.560
 She kept herself in a cage.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.560
 She kept herself in a cage.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.560
 No but we all keep our kids in.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.560
 So he didn't get killed by aggressive chimpanzees.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.560
 So what is a cot but a weak cage?

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.560
 Exactly.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.560
 A cage there to talk.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.560
 Yeah, exactly.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.560
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.560
 You know that, I mean animals and show business is a marriage made in hell.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.560
 Yeah.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.560
 We were talking earlier about how this unarmed stick insect

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.560
 made it from New Zealand in the lots over to the UK.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.560
 So stick insects are on every continent except Antarctica.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.560
 We've got them globally and you find a lot of these ones

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.560
 that shouldn't be appearing in other countries somehow there.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.560
 Do you know how they do it?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.560
 How do stick insects get to other countries?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.560
 Yeah.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.560
 But not through logs.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.560
 But not through logs.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560
 Toothpicks.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.560
 They pretend to be toothpicks.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560
 That's good.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.560
 Very nice.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.560
 So you'll be in a Chinese restaurant going to clean your teeth and then, yeah.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.560
 Is it ballooning like spiders that kind of thing?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.560
 No, it's not.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.560
 Poosticks, they float down the slow moving rivers.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.560
 I don't know.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.560
 It's hitchhiking.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.560
 It is hitchhiking.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.560
 It is hitchhiking.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.560
 It's hitchhiking through birds.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.560
 So birds will eat a stick insect.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.560
 But then you'll have inside a stick insect an egg.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.560
 And the egg doesn't need to be fertilized in order to be viable and give birth.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.560
 And they can travel through the whole digestive system.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.560
 Birds will eat a stick insect, fly, you know, migrate somewhere,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.560
 poo out these eggs, which will still be usable.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.560
 And they get born in these countries.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560
 It's so clever.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.560
 Yeah, it's extraordinary.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.560
 The amazing thing about that is if you ever see pictures of stick insect eggs,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.560
 and we might mention this before, they look like seeds.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.560
 Yeah.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.560
 Which is amazing if you think that you're made to look like a stick,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.560
 and your babies or your eggs are made to look like seeds.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.560
 It's just so, you know, I just think the evolution of that is so super.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.560
 And the mimicry that the fact that they like, they, they wave in the wind.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.560
 Yeah.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560
 If they need to.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.560
 But the idea being, of course, that birds like to eat seeds.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.560
 And so if the birds like to eat the seeds,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.560
 then they also like to eat things that look like seeds.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.560
 So sometimes they just get the eggs directly into them and then poo them out.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.560
 Exactly.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.560
 That's right. Yeah.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.560
 Can I tell you one more thing about animals in children's literature?

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560
 Yeah, go on.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.560
 So the story of Peter Pan.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.560
 Yeah.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.560
 Features a crocodile.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.560
 Yeah.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.560
 Swallowed a clock.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.560
 In 2011, there was a crocodile which was in a zoo in Ukraine

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.560
 and it swallowed a mobile phone.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.560
 And the owner was a lady called Rimmer Golovko

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.560
 and the zookeeper's didn't believe her.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.560
 They said the crocodile can't possibly have swallowed him up by phone.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.560
 And the crocodile started ringing.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.560
 And they realized, no, he absolutely has swallowed that phone.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.560
 She was trying to take a really cool shot of the,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.560
 of the crocodile from, from, you know, just inside the enclosure.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.560
 And unfortunately, yeah.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.560
 And they, they really, there isn't an ending to the story

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.560
 because they were trying to pep him up

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.560
 because he was feeling a bit peaky.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.560
 Oh, no.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.560
 They were, the way to pep up a crocodile that's feeling a bit peaky,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.560
 it turns out, is to feed it live quail rather than pork.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.560
 Okay. Yeah.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.560
 I suppose crocodiles, they eat like stones, don't they,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.560
 to help them digest things, I think, do they?

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560
 Oh, maybe.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.560
 So they don't always have just food in the stomach.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.560
 No.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.560
 So I'm just trying to not have a good spin on this.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.560
 Even an early Anokia will trouble it.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.560
 Scientists, those weirdos, mad,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.560
 they, they found out that crocodiles like classical music.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.560
 Really?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.560
 And they prefer classical music,

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.560
 and they therefore think that dinosaurs would have enjoyed classical music as well.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.560
 And the way they did that was they got a crocodile to do an MRI scan.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.560
 And the report says, you know, with some technical difficulty,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.560
 it was quite hard to get the crocodile into the scanner.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.560
 Because you need it to be awake to listen to the music, don't you?

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.560
 You need it to be awake to listen to the music, exactly.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.560
 I think it's very loud in an MRI scanner.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.560
 Yeah.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.560
 I imagine it was horrifying for the crocodile.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.560
 Poor thing.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.560
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.560
 At least it had a bit of Mozart to listen to.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.560
 Yeah, I guess.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.560
 It's quite interesting the effect of music on animals.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.560
 Shall I hit you with some more of those facts?

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.560
 Yeah.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.560
 Yeah, I investigated that a tiny bit,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.560
 and went down the deepest of rabbit holes.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.560
 Well, one was a bit dumb.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.560
 It's just sharks appear scarier if accompanied by ominous music.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.560
 No.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.560
 You say it's a bit dumb, but I think it's a bit dumb-dumb.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.560
 Yeah, dumb-dumb-dumb.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.560
 Yes, exactly.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.560
 But they were then encouraging documentary makers

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.560
 to be very, very careful of the soundtracks that they used.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560
 Oh, really?

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560
 Oh, really?

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.560
 Yeah, because how animals are seen in documentaries

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.560
 has a direct impact on how much money you can raise

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.560
 for that particular breed in conservation.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.560
 That's true.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.560
 I was watching a TV show yesterday which featured some sharks,

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.560
 and earlier in the show there was some ominous music,

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.560
 and at the end, actually, there was some rather majestic music.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.560
 And it does change the way you feel.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.560
 How much money did you give?

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.560
 None.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.560
 Right.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.560
 I was trying to find famous pig walkers.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.560
 The other some.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.560
 I got one.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.560
 Found one.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.560
 Not the Middle Ages, unfortunately.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.560
 Abraham Lincoln.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.560
 No.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.560
 Yeah, Abraham Lincoln.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.560
 So in America, we touched on this 200 episodes or so very briefly.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.560
 Drovers would take pigs across America.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.560
 In 1847, there was one toll gate in North Carolina

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.560
 that showed the number of animals that came through.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:23.560
 You had 692 sheep, 898 cattle, 1,317 horses, and 51,753 hogs.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.560
 Wow.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.560
 So it was a big business doing this.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.560
 And one of the people who used to bring them onto a riverboat

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.560
 was Abraham Lincoln.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.560
 So he'd meet them at a point, and he would walk them all onto riverboats.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.560
 Now, the thing with moving pigs around is pigs get really distracted,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.560
 as you're saying.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.560
 Like, you know, it doesn't need a leash.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.560
 What do we do?

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.560
 If pigs see a body of water, like a little puddle,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.560
 all of them will run for the puddle and want to go in and roll around.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.560
 So it's really hard to move them.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.560
 So what they used to do, and Lincoln used to do this as well,

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.560
 is you used to sew the eyelids shut of the pigs.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.560
 Oh, no.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.560
 And you would herd them, and then when they got to where you were going,

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.560
 you would undo the sew-ins.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.560
 And they voted this guy in as president.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.560
 Yeah.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.560
 Just blindfold the pigs.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.560
 Yeah.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.560
 It must be easier to blindfold a pig.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.560
 Well, I don't know.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.560
 But Lincoln had a needle, he had a thread.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.560
 He would sew the eyelids shut.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.560
 I reckon they could probably shake the blindfold off, right?

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.560
 They are clever, and they are willful.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560
 That's awful.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.560
 That's where he got the ham in his name from.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.560
 Previously, it was called Abraham Lincoln.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.560
 Hey, have you guys heard of the wrinkle-faced bat?

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.560
 No.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.560
 I have.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.560
 No.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.560
 They're so ugly.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.560
 Oh, God, this is incredible.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.560
 I didn't know about this until researching for this.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.560
 It's a pretty-- yeah, it's a pretty ugly bat.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.560
 It's got a lot of excessive skin on its face.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.560
 But one thing it has, which is really special and quite unique,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.560
 is it's got this extra flap of skin that sits underneath on its chin,

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.560
 and it can put it up over its face.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.560
 So it's like COVID times.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.560
 Like a mask.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.560
 Yeah, it's a mask.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.560
 But what?

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.560
 Because it's a bat.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.560
 The bat has a mask against COVID.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.560
 Yeah, but also--

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.560
 That's how this all happened.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.560
 How did they get it to begin with?

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.560
 You're right.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.560
 But when you look at it, it's like a reverse Batman head,

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.560
 because Batman doesn't cover the mouth, but has the bat head.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.560
 But in this case--

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.560
 Does he?

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.560
 Yeah.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.560
 Hold my bat, man.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.560
 He's got a--

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.560
 Yeah.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.560
 One of my chief problems with Batman is that he really does not

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.560
 consider the anatomy of bats at all in his costumes.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.560
 He's really-- bats are very small and not threatening and have

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.560
 the highest voices.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.560
 There's nothing bat-like about Batman.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.560
 Yeah, that's true.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.560
 Yeah.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.560
 The nipples thing is always a thing.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.560
 Those could be very pronounced goosebumps.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.560
 We don't know.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.560
 Bats do have-- I think they do have nipples.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.560
 Do they have nipples?

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.560
 Oh, I thought there was always an issue.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.560
 I mean, they're mammals.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.560
 You're right.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.560
 Sorry.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.560
 It's that they often take off the nipples on his suit.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.560
 That's an issue.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.560
 Oh, that's the-- God, what are they thinking?

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.560
 Yeah.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.560
 I thought the nipples on bats were in the armpits.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.560
 Often.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.560
 That's-- sorry.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.560
 No, that's it.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.560
 They've put the nipples in the wrong spot on the suit.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.560
 That's it.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.560
 That's what's wrong with it.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.560
 They didn't film Groundhog Day in "Punks of Tony."

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560
 Really?

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.560
 Yeah, it's not filmed there.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.560
 It doesn't look right or something.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.560
 They have-- where it was filmed, they have things like--

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.560
 there's a scene in the movie where Bill Murray always

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.560
 stands in a puddle.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.560
 Yeah.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.560
 And they have a little plaque there now.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.560
 This is where he stood in the puddle every single day.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.560
 That's great.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.560
 Yeah.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.560
 And a few other spots around the tent.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.560
 The people go-- if you went to wherever it is--

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.560
 Yeah.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.560
 Would you deliberately step in a puddle there for a photo

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.560
 up like they do at--

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.560
 Like Abbey Road kind of thing?

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.560
 Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560
 I think people liked it.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.560
 I think you would, James.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.560
 Because you love going to places that are unique and--

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.560
 No, you're right.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.560
 I would.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.560
 Yeah, that's-- yeah.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.560
 But the dino is still there.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.560
 He has a scene in the dino where he, like,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.560
 chucks everything around.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.560
 Sorry, can I just say it?

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.560
 Maybe you sound, James, like I'm saying you do incredibly

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.560
 hacked or something.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.560
 No, no.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.560
 But so--

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.560
 Your photo of you holding up the Leading Tarapisa,

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.560
 I think it's brilliant.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.560
 Well, I took a photo of people taking photos of the Leading

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.560
 Tarapisa and then just try to lean behind her.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.560
 So they were holding me up.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.560
 One of my favorite videos I've seen, a friend of ours,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.560
 mutual friend, don't know if you know her.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.560
 Carrie Ed Katia, giving-- she's a--

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.560
 --comedian.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.560
 She went to Paris and as every-- sorry, not Paris.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560
 I'll stick you in the eye.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.560
 So-- and then she left there to do a tarpisa.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.560
 She walked around.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.560
 There's about 50 people that are doing that Leaning pose

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.560
 with their hands in the air.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.560
 And she ran around giving high-five to my turns

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.560
 to every single person.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.560
 Maybe we should all install a second knocker.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.560
 Yeah.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.560
 Yeah.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.560
 You have to label it.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.560
 Well, my lady hands would appreciate that.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.560
 Absolutely.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.560
 Heavy knocker that I have to keep lifting.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.560
 I think, really, you have doorbells, so don't you?

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.560
 I was going to say I do.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.560
 That implies you have one knocker on.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.560
 I think if you're saying we're going to have a second knocker.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.560
 He does have a doorbell.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.560
 I don't mean to give away too much about that.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.560
 Well, it's quite a rare thing to have on your door-to-door knocker

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.560
 these days.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.560
 So I think you've given away a bit much about where you live.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.560
 And if you put a second one, then definitely everyone's--

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.560
 Everyone's like, that's his house.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.560
 I have to install a secret second knocker.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.560
 A cupboard that you open the door.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.560
 There's a knocker inside.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.560
 I'll do that.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.560
 No, I've got it.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.560
 Do you guys not have a knocker on your door?

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.560
 I don't.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.560
 I don't think so.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.560
 I can't remember.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560
 I do know other people in knockers, though.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.560
 That's just another tangent.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.560
 What a sentence.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.560
 It was so good.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.560
 Andy talking earlier about waste disposal.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.560
 Of course, pig toilets used to be a thing in China, especially.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.560
 And the idea was that you would have your toilet.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.560
 It would be on the first floor.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.560
 And the pigs would be living on the ground floor.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.560
 And they would just eat your excrement.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.560
 Oh, no.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.560
 And they took-- they existed from at least 200 BC.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.560
 And they were still existent at least in 2005.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.560
 You could see them in northern China.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.560
 Wow.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.560
 And some of the really, really far north provinces.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.560
 2005?

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.560
 Holy moly.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.560
 As far as I know, they might still exist.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.560
 But we don't know about any.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.560
 But it's really clever because, obviously, your poo can be used as fertilizer.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.560
 But it's not great to be put in human poo everywhere because, you know,

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.560
 it might have parasites or it smells really bad or whatever.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.560
 But if you feed it to a pig, then the pig's internal, you know,

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.560
 stomach will get rid of a lot of the problems that human poo might have.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.560
 And when it comes out, it's cleaner.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.560
 And pig poo doesn't smell nearly as bad as human poo.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.560
 So you end up-- you're basically, you know,

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.560
 manufacturing this excellent poo from human poo by putting it through a pig.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560
 That's extraordinary.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.560
 Yeah.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.560
 Isn't it cool?

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.560
 That's amazing.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.560
 Yeah.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.560
 It would put me off the-- it would put me off eating the pig.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.560
 Yeah.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.560
 You know, a lot of religions don't eat pork, right?

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.560
 And one of the reasons, I think, is because in these kind of pig toilets

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.560
 or pigs eating excrement was in the areas where these religions started.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.560
 Right.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.560
 And it was only when the Romans got the pigs and sort of the pigs

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.560
 that had eaten acorns outside of the cities

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.560
 and stopped eating human excrement that the Romans thought,

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.560
 "Well, we should eat these things because they're not eating human poo anymore."

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.560
 Yeah.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.560
 And so, yeah, that's why some parts of the world still will eat bacon

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.560
 and ham and whatever, but a lot of religions won't.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.560
 Can I tell you a pig competition that used to happen in--

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.560
 Yeah, go on.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.560
 --rural cotswolds?

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.560
 Yeah.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.560
 It was at the turn of the 20th century in the cotswolds,

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.560
 and it was a pub Saturday night competition,

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.560
 which was effectively pig karaoke.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.560
 Okay.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.560
 So you have to sing a song,

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.560
 but you have to sing a song while holding a pig under your arm,

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.560
 a small pig.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.560
 Mm-hmm.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.560
 And it's a popular song of the day.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.560
 Does it have to be a duet with the pig?

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.560
 No, it's just you, but--

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.560
 So what is the pig doing in this case?

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.560
 Well, if you smile or laugh at all during the song,

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.560
 you're disqualified, and the pig wriggles, obviously,

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.560
 and your friends are allowed to shout abuse at you as you're doing it.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.560
 But if you win, you get to keep the pig.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.560
 Okay.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.560
 So that's just a fun competition for the pub.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.560
 What happens?

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.560
 Talking about American pig handling, did you know that--

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.560
 I just had nothing to say to that, Andy.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.560
 I'm really sorry.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.560
 No, no.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.560
 There's nothing to say to it.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.560
 I was trying to think what singers they could be singing,

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.560
 and it just couldn't come.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.560
 Oh, I see.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.560
 Yeah.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.560
 Did you know that the Texas Senate recently passed a bill

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.560
 making it legal to shoot wild pigs from hot air balloons?

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.560
 Okay.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.560
 I mean, that's a niche sport, isn't it?

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.560
 But apparently it's now legal.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.560
 Is that still legal?

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.560
 I think we mentioned that in the book of the year years ago.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.560
 It was just happening.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.560
 I don't even know if it was passed.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.560
 Yeah, it's 2017, I think it was.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.560
 It's a real problem with feral hugs, don't they?

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.560
 In America.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.560
 Yeah.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.560
 And that's why they do that.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.560
 Is that in kites, I think, that you're allowed to shoot

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.560
 from hot air balloons?

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.560
 It is because it's smoother to shoot it from a hot air balloon.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.560
 As in, hot air balloons are quite sedate.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.560
 So you can probably aim quite well.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.560
 Yeah.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.560
 And they don't make a lot of noise like a helicopter,

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.560
 so they wouldn't scare the pigs.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.560
 It's a good idea.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.560
 It's a great idea.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.560
 It's a great idea.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.560
 If you dress it right, it might look like a giant disco ball

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.560
 in the sky.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.560
 Yeah.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.560
 And also, we mentioned a few weeks ago--

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.560
 next week.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.560
 Next week, we're going to mention how well you make hot air balloons

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.560
 out of intestines of animals, didn't they?

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560
 Yeah, that's right.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.560
 How do you see the future, James?

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.560
 That's amazing.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.560
 One more thing about insects and their footprints,

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.560
 which I found cool.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.560
 Oh.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.560
 So insects leave little damp footprints wherever they go.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.560
 That's cute.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.560
 And you normally don't notice them, obviously.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.560
 Spandle.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.560
 Spandle.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560
 Leave wet footprints on the floor.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.560
 Spandle.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.560
 So insects spandle wherever they go.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.560
 Brilliant.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.560
 Each footprint is a quadrillionth of a liter.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.560
 It's not helpful.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.560
 It's very small amount, obviously.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.560
 And it was believed, until quite recently,

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.560
 that the liquid is helping them to stick to the leaf.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.560
 Like, you know, when you have a glass with a wet bottom,

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.560
 it sticks to the table or whatever on the coast.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.560
 And so that was what it was believed to be.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.560
 But there was an experiment conducted by a Cambridge scientist

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.560
 called David Labonte, and it was done on stick insects.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.560
 This is how I came across this.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.560
 And this study was published in the scientific journal

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.560
 Soft Matter, which sounds great.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.560
 And he put wires on stick insects feet,

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.560
 because they're quite slow and they're quite docile.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.560
 And then he measured with a tiny sensor,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.560
 the force that was required to lift their feet off glass plates

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.560
 at various different amounts of wetness.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.560
 This is really a hard experiment to do.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.560
 And it turns out, this is the really exciting thing,

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.560
 that the liquid may actually let them unstick their feet,

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.560
 rather than being the other way around.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.560
 It's like a release, release a quadrillionth of a liter.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.560
 Because that is one of the interesting things, isn't it?

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.560
 Because everyone thinks they're called stick insects

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.560
 because they look like sticks,

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.560
 but it's because they stick to things.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.560
 Oh, no. Is that? No.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.560
 Oh, no. There you go. I believed it.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.560
 I did. I was totally...

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.560
 Have you heard of the Euro Club?

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.560
 No, I haven't.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.560
 This is a new invention.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.560
 Oh, no.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.560
 It is a golf club.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.560
 Oh, this sounds great.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.560
 Let's say you're out playing golf.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.560
 And the base where you go is...

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.560
 Clubhouse?

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.560
 Jesus Christ.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.560
 It's far away.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.560
 But hang on, I need the toilet.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.560
 Euro Club is a hollow club where you can take off the lid.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.560
 The invention comes with a kind of curtain

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.560
 that you can put over.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.560
 That's lovely.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.560
 And you are able to relieve yourself into your golf clubs.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.560
 Brilliant.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.560
 And then continue on with your game.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.560
 Okay, well, sorry, James.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.560
 You'll have a few thoughts, but I've got a few too.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.560
 Yeah, well, why don't you go first?

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.560
 I mean me too, frankly.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.560
 So, firstly, it presupposes that there are no trees

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.560
 anywhere near this golf course.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.560
 Are you allowed to go on trees?

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.560
 Well, it's...

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.560
 Can you have a tree wee?

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.560
 It is regularly done,

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.560
 but I think it's kind of frowned upon,

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.560
 like just urinating in the open.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.560
 And also, women can't do that.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.560
 Well, it doesn't sound like women can piss into a golf club,

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.560
 either, mate.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.560
 You can have a she-wee.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.560
 You can have a she-wee onto the Euro Club.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.560
 That'll affect the swing

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.560
 and that'll affect the hold of the golf club, you know.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.560
 Well, I want to know that if you urinate in sweat,

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.560
 there's going to be...

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.560
 It's going to change the way that it feels to swing, right?

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.560
 Yeah.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.560
 As you hold it up,

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.560
 it's all going to be down the end

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.560
 where you're the top end of the club.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.560
 Also, you need to make sure that seal is...

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.560
 Absolutely.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560
 I don't know if these people

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.560
 have had any centrifugal forces.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.560
 I was going to say watertight.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.560
 Piss tight.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.560
 That seal needs to be.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.560
 Actually, I am thinking,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.560
 like, Hannah, you'd know better than me,

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.560
 but if you hold a golf club like this,

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.560
 the urine is going to be in your hand

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.560
 when you're holding it at the top of the swing.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.560
 Exactly.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.560
 And then when you come down,

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.560
 the momentum of the urine going down the club

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.560
 should give you more angular momentum

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.560
 and should make you hit the ball further.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560
 Hmm.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.560
 I mean, sure.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.560
 Maybe that's the secret of a lot of great golfers.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.560
 That's why.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.560
 They've been using the Euro...

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.560
 Tiger Woods.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.560
 Yeah, Tiger Woods, yeah.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.560
 Piss filled club for his entire career.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.560
 What's your secret?

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.560
 It just smiles enigmatically when you get away.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.560
 That's brilliant.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.560
 So, famous fake tan brand is Saint-Tropez.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.560
 Mm-hmm.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.560
 And I thought I'd look into Saint-Tropez

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.560
 because it's a famous place

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.560
 where people might go to get suntans and stuff,

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.560
 and that's why it's got the name.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.560
 It became famous thanks to Brigitte Bardot,

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.560
 who, she came from a really wealthy family

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.560
 and her parents had a house there,

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.560
 but also due to a big argument about topless bathing.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.560
 And this was in 1964,

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.560
 and everyone wanted to do topless bathing in Saint-Tropez,

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.560
 but the mayor really did not want them to do it.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.560
 And there was a massive argument.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.560
 It's really famous in France.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.560
 And the mayor went so far as to order a helicopter

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.560
 which he flew over all of the beaches

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.560
 looking for women who had the tops off.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.560
 Dropping towels on them from the height.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.560
 Isn't that amazing?

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.560
 I mean, if he was so bothered by it,

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.560
 I mean, maybe just consider not looking.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.560
 I think if you're the mayor, you have to.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.560
 You have to go around looking at everyone on the beach.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.560
 Wow.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.560
 Do you remember there used to be an airplane

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.560
 that rock stars used?

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.560
 So, Zeppelin used it.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.560
 It had an open fire chimney.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.560
 What inside?

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.560
 It had a fireplace.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.560
 It had a fireplace.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.560
 It did.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.560
 You can see photos.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.560
 They're sitting around like an open fire by a chimney.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.560
 Have we not discussed that before?

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.560
 No.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.560
 Have we not?

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.560
 I can't remember.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.560
 Look, I think it's all about benefit and reward, right?

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.560
 Risk-reward ratio.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.560
 And on that, it seems way off.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.560
 It's rock and roll, Hannah.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.560
 The chimney sweep has got to go up

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.560
 when you're at 30,000 feet.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:15.560
 I remember through Time magazine's Best Inventions of 2022,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.560
 which was pretty good.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.560
 Oh, I think I know one of these.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.560
 Oh, go for it.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.560
 Is one of them a prosthetic hand

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.560
 that you can try with your mind?

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.560
 There was one like that.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.560
 Yeah.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.560
 It was incredible.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.560
 I kind of went for the less good ones.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.560
 Tasty tape, I thought was pretty cool.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.560
 That's nice.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.560
 It's like cellotape for burritos.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.560
 So, you know, you make a burrito

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.560
 and it kind of can fall apart and stuff.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.560
 This is edible cellotape, and it means you can like...

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.560
 That's brilliant.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.560
 It is a genius idea, isn't it?

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:44.560
 Sorry, it's edible.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.560
 Is it tasty?

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.560
 It's called tasty tape, so...

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.560
 It could be cool as advertising.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.560
 Put some Hannah's MSG on it.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.560
 Yeah?

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.560
 Everything's tasty.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.560
 That's just quite a nice idea, isn't it?

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560
 I think that's a great idea.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.560
 Yeah.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.560
 Yeah, like that.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.560
 Say goodbye to burrito-collapsed misery.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.560
 Do you bring your own tape to the burrito...

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.560
 Party.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.560
 Party.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.560
 Yeah.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.560
 It's not a big dispenser at the counter.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560
 Okay.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.560
 I would say it's more if you're making them yourself.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.560
 Okay.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.560
 I would say you advise...

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.560
 They can fold effectively.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.560
 I mean, they're folding wizards.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.560
 Yeah.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.560
 They are very good.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.560
 They're crows, and really, they don't...

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.560
 Actually, I've never had it fall apart.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.560
 I genuinely thought you were about to admit

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.560
 that you'd never had a burrito.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.560
 If you make your own fajitas, for instance.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.560
 Yes.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.560
 Like, you're at home making fajitas.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.560
 Sure.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.560
 They do fall apart, like, don't they?

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560
 Oh, do they not?

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.560
 You are an expert origami.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.560
 They're pretty good.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.560
 They keep the shape.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.560
 You're not putting enough stuff in.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.560
 No, maybe that's it.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.560
 Maybe that's it.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.560
 Yeah.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.560
 Yeah, your bread to filling ratio needs to be addressed.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.560
 They are a bit.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.560
 They are a bit at the tiny tip of the fajita world.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.560
 It's a slightly sad affair.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.560
 'Cause if you go to Formula One, you kind of sat in your place

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.560
 and they fly past it about a million miles an hour.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.560
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.560
 Like, just see them for one second.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.560
 I have always thought that about watching it light.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.560
 Like, doesn't it just go past you and then...

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.560
 It does, yeah.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.560
 Yeah.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.560
 I did that with the Olympic cycling.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:05.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.560
 And same with the Tour de France self-replace.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.560
 Weighted, boom, and then we waited four hours.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.560
 And then, boom, the other way.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.560
 Got on the bus with the dogs.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.560
 They were pissed off as well.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.560
 Did I ever tell you that thing about my friend who was in France

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.560
 and was on the tour?

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.560
 I've done that on the show.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.560
 I don't think so.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.560
 I love it anyway.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.560
 A friend of mine went to the Tour de France.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.560
 He knew this at the time, got a house, rented a house,

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.560
 and the Tour de France came right past the house.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.560
 Wow.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.560
 So he had his whole family with him

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.560
 and he had people from his work and they all watched it.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.560
 And he found out that the house was for sale.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.560
 So he bought the house and he went,

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.560
 "We're going to come back every year

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.560
 and we're going to watch the Tour de France from this spot."

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.560
 Not knowing that the Tour de France changes its route

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.560
 every single year.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.560
 Oh, my God.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.560
 It's brilliant.

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.560
 It still has the house.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.560
 (APPLAUSE)

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.560
 So if you can play the music a bit,

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.560
 this is the shows over now.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.560
 Can I ask, who's the person who sent me a message

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.560
 saying the newest species in Lizard in New Zealand

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.560
 was discovered by me?

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.560
 Are you lying?

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.560
 Wow.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.560
 That's not evidence.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.560
 It's circumstantial out there.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.560
 But also, that wasn't the person who was asking,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.560
 "What are you lying about?"

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.560
 Are you Ben Barr?

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.560
 Can we get a mic over, actually?

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.560
 Let's quickly get a mic.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.560
 Tell us your name, first of all.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.560
 I'm Lockie.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.560
 He's definitely from New Zealand.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.560
 Hi, Lockie.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.560
 We've established.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.560
 I named a hoplodactylus tohu after working with

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.560
 some of the indigenous Māori communities in New Zealand,

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.560
 because it was important to their tribes or whatever

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.560
 that lived in the area that the species was in.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.560
 You named it what? A hoplodactylus?

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.560
 It's called hoplodactylus tohu.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.560
 What is it? It's a gecko.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.560
 Oh, wow.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.560
 It's a New Zealand gecko, which is the odds of that happening.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.560
 Oh, my God, you must have been seeing it at the whole show.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.560
 You didn't fucking see it?

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.560
 Yeah, I was going to wait till the end.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.560
 I wasn't going to be...

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.560
 That's amazing. That's incredible.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.560
 Wait, so you found a new species of gecko

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.560
 or a very old species of gecko?

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.560
 Yeah, it's always been there, but no one knew it.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.560
 No one knew it existed.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.560
 That's amazing. Yeah, using DNA stuff, we found it.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.560
 So, I got a message just today from someone

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.560
 saying, because we did a fact about

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.560
 stick insects on a previous fish episode,

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.560
 it's just gone out with John Lloyd.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.560
 John Lloyd, the creator of QI

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.560
 and, you know, Blackadder

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.560
 and Spitting Image.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.560
 I think he's here. John, are you here?

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.560
 Is he here? Yeah, he is.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.560
 Yeah, that's our founder.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.560
 Blackadder, Spitting Image,

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.560
 not the minor-clock news, but the legend.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.560
 So, we did this fact,

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.560
 and someone messaged me saying,

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.560
 "Just in case you're not completely sick of stick insects,

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.560
 check out the Lord Howe Island

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.560
 Phasmid."

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.560
 Phasmid? Phasmid, yeah.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.560
 Phasmid, yeah.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.560
 And then she wrote, "Full disclosure,

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.560
 it was my dad who found it

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.560
 when he went climbing Balls Pyramid

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.560
 with Dick Smith."

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.560
 Balls and Dick?

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.560
 That's the... Yeah, love it.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.560
 That's wonderful.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.560
 Oh, thank you very much, Loki, that's brilliant.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.560
 Are we going to do some more? Yeah, one or two more.

00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.560
 Okay, so, we'll have to be really quick, I guess.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.560
 Yeah, yeah, quick.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.560
 Someone messaged saying,

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.560
 "What is the one disgusting fact

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.560
 that you wish you'd never learned?"

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.560
 Oh, there's a frog called the horror frog.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.560
 Oh, no, there's a frog...

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.560
 There's a frog fertility thing. It's really horrible.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.560
 Uh...

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.560
 We were in Wales when we did it on the show.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.560
 It was in Cardiff in the Glee Club,

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.560
 and the audience physically...

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.560
 We're all repulsed, but I can't remember

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.560
 the details of the fact now.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.560
 So, if you go back 300 episodes

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.560
 and listen to that, you're welcome.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.560
 Have you got one?

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.560
 I've got one. There are orangutan brothels.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.560
 No.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.560
 There are where...

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.560
 No.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.560
 Do you want me not just to say it?

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.560
 No, say it. I'll tell you how I found this out,

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.560
 because the story is quite funny.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.560
 I was filming Death in Paradise,

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.560
 and I really didn't want to go.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.560
 I was like, "I don't like this show."

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.560
 Imagine if you don't do this show.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.560
 I'd turn it down three times.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.560
 Because if you don't do it, I'm going to drop you

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.560
 because you just don't want to be on telly.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.560
 You wouldn't be hosting dog award ceremonies.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.560
 That's your thing.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.560
 It was only when I got on the plane

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.560
 that I went, "Actually, I'm going to the Caribbean

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.560
 for 10 days. It's not that bad."

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.560
 And I got out there, and I had a really great time.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.560
 Had the most amazing cast,

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.560
 a brilliant gang of renegades.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.560
 And one of the people,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.560
 Francis,

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.560
 who was telling us about house he had

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.560
 in Borneo, and he said,

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.560
 "Oh, you know,

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.560
 it was a very small house,

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.560
 and there were a reed roof,

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.560
 and snakes used to fall in when it rained."

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.560
 And I said, "Oh, that's awful. I couldn't handle that."

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.560
 I couldn't handle that. He said, "It wasn't the worst thing, though.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.560
 The worst thing was the

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.560
 sex tourists going through the jungle

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.560
 to have sex with the orangutans."

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.560
 And I was like, "No way."

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.560
 And we said, "The orangutans are threatened."

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.560
 And I said,

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.560
 "Oh, because of the logging?"

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.560
 And he went, "No, because of the sex tourists going in

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.560
 and having sex with them." I said, "Oh, that's awful."

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.560
 And Nick Moran from

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.560
 what's he called, you know,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.560
 the lock stock,

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.560
 he said,

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.560
 "Oh, that's disgusting." He said,

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.560
 "They have sex with the orangutans." He said,

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.560
 "I wouldn't fuck a ginger human," he said.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.560
 [laughter]

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.560
 Like the problem,

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.560
 like the problem was that the orangutan

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.560
 was orange.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.560
 [laughter]

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:36.560
 Sorry, Andy. I know your parents are in.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.560
 I'm sorry.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.560
 Sorry, Andy's mum and dad.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.560
 [laughter]

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.560
 Oh, look.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.560
 Any other questions?

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.560
 Yeah.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.560
 Well, once again, Sally has brought us to the end

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.560
 of a show.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.560
 Thank you so much, everyone.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.560
 Thank you. Have a good night.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.560
 [applause]

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.560
 [music]

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.560
 [applause]

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.560
 [music]

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.560
 [applause]

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.560
 [applause]

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:12.560
 [applause]

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.560
 [applause]

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.560
 All right, that's it.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.560
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.560
 Hope you enjoyed that.

 Goodbye.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.140
 (upbeat music)
