5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,760
 Harriet Lloyd and Sally Phillips. Sally Phillips's episode it's worth noting is from the British

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,880
 Library gig that we did a few months back and so you're going to hear at the end of

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,880
 this episode a very quick Q&A that we managed to sneak in at the end of that show and unfortunately

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,840
 we couldn't do longer because we ran over from the main show but they are super fun,

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,160
 these live shows and it is worth saying that if you do want to come to one of those we

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,240
 do have three left this year so far so we're going to be doing two more at the Soho Theatre

00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,880
 London on the day do just check their website because there are returns and also sometimes

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,480
 they just release tickets that they've held back but if you do want to come to another

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,800
 live show in September we have one on the 14th of September at Kings Place for the London

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
 [Music]

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:02:03,560
 Does the table feel bigger to you guys?

24
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
 No.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
 Doesn't it?

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
 Oh that's interesting.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
 It just feels bigger.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
 No it is bigger.

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
 No.

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
 Is it?

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
 It feels bigger.

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
 It definitely feels bigger.

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
 Do we normally have something in the middle?

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
 No.

35
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
 Do we have a feeling as well?

36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,560
 Well I'm now but only because you put it in my head.

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,560
 Let's before we lose all this magic.

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
 Let's go.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
 Oh my god.

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
 Okay.

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
 All right.

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
 I'll tell you a fact that is true though.

43
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
 Perfect.

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,560
 You've been taking lessons from Dan in the segue.

45
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,560
 Well actually I don't know that this is true.

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,560
 I'm going to tell you a muck fact which you can check later.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
 That's a great time.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
 A muck fact.

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
 There used to be a thing about McDonald's.

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,560
 McDonald's nutrition muck facts.

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,560
 Which I used to love.

52
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
 Yeah.

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
 It's like a fact but a muck fact.

54
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
 Jane Goodall's son.

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
 She did chimpanzees.

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
 That's right isn't it?

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
 Yeah that's right.

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
 She had a son and she used to keep him in a cage

59
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,560
 to protect him from the chimpanzees which were aggressive.

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
 Guess what he does now for a job?

61
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
 A prison warden.

62
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
 Shock photographer.

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
 Oh.

64
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
 He just wants to be back in the cage.

65
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
 Well I don't know.

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
 He feels safe.

67
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
 It's a safe place.

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
 I would love to interview him.

69
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
 Yeah.

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
 That is incredible.

71
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
 Isn't it?

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,560
 Let's check it's true by the way.

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,560
 I've definitely been told that in a product by someone who might know.

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
 I've got a doll of Jane Goodall.

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
 It's like a Barbie doll of Jane Goodall right?

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
 Really?

77
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
 Yeah.

78
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
 For my daughter.

79
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
 That's so weird.

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
 For your daughter.

81
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,560
 What's, what are the, does it have accessories?

82
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
 Yeah it has a little David Grey beard which is the name of the chimpanzee

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
 who she loads after.

84
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
 A little boy in a cage.

85
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,560
 But the thing is like, I know Dan collects a lot of celebrity,

86
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
 you know, memorabilia and almost all the people end up, you know,

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,560
 celebrities, they end up getting in trouble for something.

88
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
 I thought I was safe with Jane Goodall.

89
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
 Yeah.

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
 I thought there's no way that she could get cancelled.

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
 Well, let's start it tonight.

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
 No she's not.

93
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
 I do it.

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
 What has she done?

95
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
 She kept herself in a cage.

96
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
 She kept herself in a cage.

97
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
 No but we all keep our kids in.

98
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,560
 So he didn't get killed by aggressive chimpanzees.

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,560
 So what is a cot but a weak cage?

100
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
 Exactly.

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,560
 A cage there to talk.

102
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
 Yeah, exactly.

103
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
 Yeah, that's amazing.

104
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,560
 You know that, I mean animals and show business is a marriage made in hell.

105
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
 Yeah.

106
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,560
 We were talking earlier about how this unarmed stick insect

107
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,560
 made it from New Zealand in the lots over to the UK.

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,560
 So stick insects are on every continent except Antarctica.

109
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,560
 We've got them globally and you find a lot of these ones

110
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,560
 that shouldn't be appearing in other countries somehow there.

111
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,560
 Do you know how they do it?

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
 How do stick insects get to other countries?

113
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
 Yeah.

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
 But not through logs.

115
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
 But not through logs.

116
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
 Toothpicks.

117
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
 They pretend to be toothpicks.

118
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
 That's good.

119
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
 Very nice.

120
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,560
 So you'll be in a Chinese restaurant going to clean your teeth and then, yeah.

121
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,560
 Is it ballooning like spiders that kind of thing?

122
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,560
 No, it's not.

123
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,560
 Poosticks, they float down the slow moving rivers.

124
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
 I don't know.

125
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
 It's hitchhiking.

126
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
 It is hitchhiking.

127
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
 It is hitchhiking.

128
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,560
 It's hitchhiking through birds.

129
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
 So birds will eat a stick insect.

130
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,560
 But then you'll have inside a stick insect an egg.

131
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,560
 And the egg doesn't need to be fertilized in order to be viable and give birth.

132
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,560
 And they can travel through the whole digestive system.

133
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,560
 Birds will eat a stick insect, fly, you know, migrate somewhere,

134
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,560
 poo out these eggs, which will still be usable.

135
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
 And they get born in these countries.

136
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
 It's so clever.

137
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
 Yeah, it's extraordinary.

138
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,560
 The amazing thing about that is if you ever see pictures of stick insect eggs,

139
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,560
 and we might mention this before, they look like seeds.

140
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
 Yeah.

141
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,560
 Which is amazing if you think that you're made to look like a stick,

142
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,560
 and your babies or your eggs are made to look like seeds.

143
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,560
 It's just so, you know, I just think the evolution of that is so super.

144
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,560
 And the mimicry that the fact that they like, they, they wave in the wind.

145
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
 Yeah.

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,560
 If they need to.

147
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
 But the idea being, of course, that birds like to eat seeds.

148
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
 And so if the birds like to eat the seeds,

149
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
 then they also like to eat things that look like seeds.

150
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,560
 So sometimes they just get the eggs directly into them and then poo them out.

151
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
 Exactly.

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
 That's right. Yeah.

153
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,560
 Can I tell you one more thing about animals in children's literature?

154
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
 Yeah, go on.

155
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
 So the story of Peter Pan.

156
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
 Yeah.

157
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
 Features a crocodile.

158
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
 Yeah.

159
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
 Swallowed a clock.

160
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,560
 In 2011, there was a crocodile which was in a zoo in Ukraine

161
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,560
 and it swallowed a mobile phone.

162
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,560
 And the owner was a lady called Rimmer Golovko

163
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
 and the zookeeper's didn't believe her.

164
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
 They said the crocodile can't possibly have swallowed him up by phone.

165
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
 And the crocodile started ringing.

166
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,560
 And they realized, no, he absolutely has swallowed that phone.

167
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
 She was trying to take a really cool shot of the,

168
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,560
 of the crocodile from, from, you know, just inside the enclosure.

169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
 And unfortunately, yeah.

170
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,560
 And they, they really, there isn't an ending to the story

171
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
 because they were trying to pep him up

172
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
 because he was feeling a bit peaky.

173
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
 Oh, no.

174
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,560
 They were, the way to pep up a crocodile that's feeling a bit peaky,

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,560
 it turns out, is to feed it live quail rather than pork.

176
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
 Okay. Yeah.

177
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,560
 I suppose crocodiles, they eat like stones, don't they,

178
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
 to help them digest things, I think, do they?

179
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
 Oh, maybe.

180
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
 So they don't always have just food in the stomach.

181
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
 No.

182
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
 So I'm just trying to not have a good spin on this.

183
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,560
 Even an early Anokia will trouble it.

184
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,560
 Scientists, those weirdos, mad,

185
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
 they, they found out that crocodiles like classical music.

186
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
 Really?

187
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
 And they prefer classical music,

188
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,560
 and they therefore think that dinosaurs would have enjoyed classical music as well.

189
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,560
 And the way they did that was they got a crocodile to do an MRI scan.

190
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,560
 And the report says, you know, with some technical difficulty,

191
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
 it was quite hard to get the crocodile into the scanner.

192
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
 Because you need it to be awake to listen to the music, don't you?

193
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
 You need it to be awake to listen to the music, exactly.

194
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
 I think it's very loud in an MRI scanner.

195
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
 Yeah.

196
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
 I imagine it was horrifying for the crocodile.

197
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
 Poor thing.

198
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
 Yeah, exactly.

199
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
 At least it had a bit of Mozart to listen to.

200
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
 Yeah, I guess.

201
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,560
 It's quite interesting the effect of music on animals.

202
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,560
 Shall I hit you with some more of those facts?

203
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
 Yeah, yeah.

204
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
 Yeah.

205
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,560
 Yeah, I investigated that a tiny bit,

206
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,560
 and went down the deepest of rabbit holes.

207
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
 Well, one was a bit dumb.

208
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,560
 It's just sharks appear scarier if accompanied by ominous music.

209
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
 No.

210
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,560
 You say it's a bit dumb, but I think it's a bit dumb-dumb.

211
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
 Yeah, dumb-dumb-dumb.

212
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
 Yes, exactly.

213
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,560
 But they were then encouraging documentary makers

214
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,560
 to be very, very careful of the soundtracks that they used.

215
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
 Oh, really?

216
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
 Oh, really?

217
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,560
 Yeah, because how animals are seen in documentaries

218
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,560
 has a direct impact on how much money you can raise

219
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
 for that particular breed in conservation.

220
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
 That's true.

221
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,560
 I was watching a TV show yesterday which featured some sharks,

222
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
 and earlier in the show there was some ominous music,

223
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
 and at the end, actually, there was some rather majestic music.

224
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
 And it does change the way you feel.

225
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
 How much money did you give?

226
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
 None.

227
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,560
 Right.

228
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,560
 I was trying to find famous pig walkers.

229
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
 The other some.

230
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
 I got one.

231
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
 Found one.

232
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,560
 Not the Middle Ages, unfortunately.

233
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,560
 Abraham Lincoln.

234
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
 No.

235
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
 Yeah, Abraham Lincoln.

236
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,560
 So in America, we touched on this 200 episodes or so very briefly.

237
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,560
 Drovers would take pigs across America.

238
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,560
 In 1847, there was one toll gate in North Carolina

239
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
 that showed the number of animals that came through.

240
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,560
 You had 692 sheep, 898 cattle, 1,317 horses, and 51,753 hogs.

241
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
 Wow.

242
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
 So it was a big business doing this.

243
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,560
 And one of the people who used to bring them onto a riverboat

244
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
 was Abraham Lincoln.

245
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,560
 So he'd meet them at a point, and he would walk them all onto riverboats.

246
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,560
 Now, the thing with moving pigs around is pigs get really distracted,

247
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
 as you're saying.

248
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
 Like, you know, it doesn't need a leash.

249
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
 What do we do?

250
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,560
 If pigs see a body of water, like a little puddle,

251
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,560
 all of them will run for the puddle and want to go in and roll around.

252
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
 So it's really hard to move them.

253
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,560
 So what they used to do, and Lincoln used to do this as well,

254
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,560
 is you used to sew the eyelids shut of the pigs.

255
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
 Oh, no.

256
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,560
 And you would herd them, and then when they got to where you were going,

257
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
 you would undo the sew-ins.

258
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
 And they voted this guy in as president.

259
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
 Yeah.

260
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
 Just blindfold the pigs.

261
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
 Yeah.

262
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
 It must be easier to blindfold a pig.

263
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
 Well, I don't know.

264
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
 But Lincoln had a needle, he had a thread.

265
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
 He would sew the eyelids shut.

266
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,560
 I reckon they could probably shake the blindfold off, right?

267
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,560
 They are clever, and they are willful.

268
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
 That's awful.

269
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
 That's where he got the ham in his name from.

270
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
 Previously, it was called Abraham Lincoln.

271
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,560
 [LAUGHTER]

272
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,560
 Hey, have you guys heard of the wrinkle-faced bat?

273
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
 No.

274
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,560
 I have.

275
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
 No.

276
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
 They're so ugly.

277
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
 Oh, God, this is incredible.

278
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
 I didn't know about this until researching for this.

279
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,560
 It's a pretty-- yeah, it's a pretty ugly bat.

280
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
 It's got a lot of excessive skin on its face.

281
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,560
 But one thing it has, which is really special and quite unique,

282
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,560
 is it's got this extra flap of skin that sits underneath on its chin,

283
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,560
 and it can put it up over its face.

284
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,560
 So it's like COVID times.

285
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
 Like a mask.

286
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
 Yeah, it's a mask.

287
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,560
 But what?

288
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
 Because it's a bat.

289
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
 The bat has a mask against COVID.

290
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
 Yeah, but also--

291
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
 That's how this all happened.

292
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
 [LAUGHTER]

293
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
 How did they get it to begin with?

294
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,560
 You're right.

295
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,560
 But when you look at it, it's like a reverse Batman head,

296
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,560
 because Batman doesn't cover the mouth, but has the bat head.

297
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
 But in this case--

298
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
 Does he?

299
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
 Yeah.

300
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
 Hold my bat, man.

301
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
 He's got a--

302
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
 Yeah.

303
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,560
 One of my chief problems with Batman is that he really does not

304
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,560
 consider the anatomy of bats at all in his costumes.

305
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,560
 He's really-- bats are very small and not threatening and have

306
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
 the highest voices.

307
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,560
 There's nothing bat-like about Batman.

308
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
 Yeah, that's true.

309
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
 Yeah.

310
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
 The nipples thing is always a thing.

311
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
 Those could be very pronounced goosebumps.

312
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
 We don't know.

313
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
 Bats do have-- I think they do have nipples.

314
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
 Do they have nipples?

315
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
 Oh, I thought there was always an issue.

316
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
 I mean, they're mammals.

317
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
 You're right.

318
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
 Sorry.

319
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,560
 It's that they often take off the nipples on his suit.

320
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
 That's an issue.

321
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
 Oh, that's the-- God, what are they thinking?

322
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
 Yeah.

323
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
 I thought the nipples on bats were in the armpits.

324
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
 Often.

325
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
 That's-- sorry.

326
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
 No, that's it.

327
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
 They've put the nipples in the wrong spot on the suit.

328
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
 That's it.

329
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
 That's what's wrong with it.

330
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,560
 They didn't film Groundhog Day in "Punks of Tony."

331
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
 Really?

332
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
 Yeah, it's not filmed there.

333
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
 It doesn't look right or something.

334
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
 They have-- where it was filmed, they have things like--

335
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
 there's a scene in the movie where Bill Murray always

336
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
 stands in a puddle.

337
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
 Yeah.

338
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
 And they have a little plaque there now.

339
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
 This is where he stood in the puddle every single day.

340
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
 That's great.

341
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
 Yeah.

342
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
 And a few other spots around the tent.

343
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
 The people go-- if you went to wherever it is--

344
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
 Yeah.

345
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
 Would you deliberately step in a puddle there for a photo

346
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
 up like they do at--

347
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
 Like Abbey Road kind of thing?

348
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
 Yes, yeah, yeah.

349
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
 I think people liked it.

350
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
 I think you would, James.

351
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

352
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
 Because you love going to places that are unique and--

353
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
 No, you're right.

354
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
 I would.

355
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
 Yeah, that's-- yeah.

356
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
 But the dino is still there.

357
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
 He has a scene in the dino where he, like,

358
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
 chucks everything around.

359
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
 Sorry, can I just say it?

360
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
 Maybe you sound, James, like I'm saying you do incredibly

361
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
 hacked or something.

362
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
 No, no.

363
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
 But so--

364
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
 Your photo of you holding up the Leading Tarapisa,

365
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
 I think it's brilliant.

366
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,560
 Well, I took a photo of people taking photos of the Leading

367
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,560
 Tarapisa and then just try to lean behind her.

368
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
 So they were holding me up.

369
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
 One of my favorite videos I've seen, a friend of ours,

370
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,560
 mutual friend, don't know if you know her.

371
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
 Carrie Ed Katia, giving-- she's a--

372
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
 Yeah, yeah.

373
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
 --comedian.

374
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
 She went to Paris and as every-- sorry, not Paris.

375
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
 I'll stick you in the eye.

376
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,560
 So-- and then she left there to do a tarpisa.

377
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
 She walked around.

378
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
 There's about 50 people that are doing that Leaning pose

379
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
 with their hands in the air.

380
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
 And she ran around giving high-five to my turns

381
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
 to every single person.

382
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
 Maybe we should all install a second knocker.

383
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
 Yeah.

384
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
 Yeah.

385
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
 You have to label it.

386
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
 Well, my lady hands would appreciate that.

387
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
 Absolutely.

388
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
 Heavy knocker that I have to keep lifting.

389
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
 I think, really, you have doorbells, so don't you?

390
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
 I was going to say I do.

391
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
 That implies you have one knocker on.

392
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,560
 I think if you're saying we're going to have a second knocker.

393
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
 He does have a doorbell.

394
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
 I don't mean to give away too much about that.

395
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
 Yeah, yeah.

396
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,560
 Well, it's quite a rare thing to have on your door-to-door knocker

397
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
 these days.

398
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
 So I think you've given away a bit much about where you live.

399
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
 And if you put a second one, then definitely everyone's--

400
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
 [LAUGHTER]

401
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
 Everyone's like, that's his house.

402
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
 I have to install a secret second knocker.

403
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
 A cupboard that you open the door.

404
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
 There's a knocker inside.

405
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
 Yeah, yeah.

406
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
 I'll do that.

407
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
 Yeah, yeah.

408
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
 No, I've got it.

409
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
 Do you guys not have a knocker on your door?

410
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
 I don't.

411
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
 I don't think so.

412
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
 I can't remember.

413
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
 I do know other people in knockers, though.

414
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
 [LAUGHTER]

415
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
 That's just another tangent.

416
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
 [LAUGHTER]

417
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
 What a sentence.

418
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
 It was so good.

419
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,560
 Andy talking earlier about waste disposal.

420
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,560
 Of course, pig toilets used to be a thing in China, especially.

421
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,560
 And the idea was that you would have your toilet.

422
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
 It would be on the first floor.

423
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
 And the pigs would be living on the ground floor.

424
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
 And they would just eat your excrement.

425
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
 Oh, no.

426
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,560
 And they took-- they existed from at least 200 BC.

427
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,560
 And they were still existent at least in 2005.

428
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
 You could see them in northern China.

429
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
 Wow.

430
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
 And some of the really, really far north provinces.

431
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
 2005?

432
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
 Yeah, yeah.

433
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
 Holy moly.

434
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
 As far as I know, they might still exist.

435
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
 But we don't know about any.

436
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,560
 But it's really clever because, obviously, your poo can be used as fertilizer.

437
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,560
 But it's not great to be put in human poo everywhere because, you know,

438
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
 it might have parasites or it smells really bad or whatever.

439
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,560
 But if you feed it to a pig, then the pig's internal, you know,

440
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,560
 stomach will get rid of a lot of the problems that human poo might have.

441
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
 And when it comes out, it's cleaner.

442
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,560
 And pig poo doesn't smell nearly as bad as human poo.

443
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,560
 So you end up-- you're basically, you know,

444
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,560
 manufacturing this excellent poo from human poo by putting it through a pig.

445
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
 That's extraordinary.

446
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
 Yeah.

447
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
 Isn't it cool?

448
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
 That's amazing.

449
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
 Yeah.

450
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,560
 It would put me off the-- it would put me off eating the pig.

451
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,560
 Yeah.

452
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,560
 You know, a lot of religions don't eat pork, right?

453
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,560
 And one of the reasons, I think, is because in these kind of pig toilets

454
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,560
 or pigs eating excrement was in the areas where these religions started.

455
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
 Right.

456
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,560
 And it was only when the Romans got the pigs and sort of the pigs

457
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,560
 that had eaten acorns outside of the cities

458
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,560
 and stopped eating human excrement that the Romans thought,

459
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
 "Well, we should eat these things because they're not eating human poo anymore."

460
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
 Yeah.

461
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,560
 And so, yeah, that's why some parts of the world still will eat bacon

462
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,560
 and ham and whatever, but a lot of religions won't.

463
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,560
 Can I tell you a pig competition that used to happen in--

464
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
 Yeah, go on.

465
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
 --rural cotswolds?

466
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
 Yeah.

467
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,560
 It was at the turn of the 20th century in the cotswolds,

468
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,560
 and it was a pub Saturday night competition,

469
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
 which was effectively pig karaoke.

470
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
 Okay.

471
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
 So you have to sing a song,

472
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,560
 but you have to sing a song while holding a pig under your arm,

473
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
 a small pig.

474
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
 Mm-hmm.

475
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,560
 And it's a popular song of the day.

476
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
 Does it have to be a duet with the pig?

477
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
 No, it's just you, but--

478
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
 So what is the pig doing in this case?

479
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,560
 Well, if you smile or laugh at all during the song,

480
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
 you're disqualified, and the pig wriggles, obviously,

481
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
 and your friends are allowed to shout abuse at you as you're doing it.

482
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,560
 But if you win, you get to keep the pig.

483
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
 Okay.

484
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,560
 So that's just a fun competition for the pub.

485
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
 What happens?

486
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,560
 Talking about American pig handling, did you know that--

487
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
 I just had nothing to say to that, Andy.

488
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
 I'm really sorry.

489
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
 No, no.

490
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
 There's nothing to say to it.

491
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
 I was trying to think what singers they could be singing,

492
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
 and it just couldn't come.

493
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
 Oh, I see.

494
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
 Yeah.

495
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,560
 Did you know that the Texas Senate recently passed a bill

496
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,560
 making it legal to shoot wild pigs from hot air balloons?

497
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
 Okay.

498
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
 I mean, that's a niche sport, isn't it?

499
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
 But apparently it's now legal.

500
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
 Is that still legal?

501
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,560
 I think we mentioned that in the book of the year years ago.

502
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
 It was just happening.

503
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
 I don't even know if it was passed.

504
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,560
 Yeah, it's 2017, I think it was.

505
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

506
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,560
 It's a real problem with feral hugs, don't they?

507
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
 In America.

508
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
 Yeah.

509
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
 And that's why they do that.

510
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
 Is that in kites, I think, that you're allowed to shoot

511
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
 from hot air balloons?

512
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
 It is because it's smoother to shoot it from a hot air balloon.

513
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
 As in, hot air balloons are quite sedate.

514
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
 So you can probably aim quite well.

515
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
 Yeah.

516
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
 And they don't make a lot of noise like a helicopter,

517
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
 so they wouldn't scare the pigs.

518
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
 It's a good idea.

519
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
 It's a great idea.

520
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
 It's a great idea.

521
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,560
 If you dress it right, it might look like a giant disco ball

522
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
 in the sky.

523
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
 Yeah.

524
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,560
 And also, we mentioned a few weeks ago--

525
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
 next week.

526
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,560
 Next week, we're going to mention how well you make hot air balloons

527
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,560
 out of intestines of animals, didn't they?

528
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
 Yeah, that's right.

529
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
 How do you see the future, James?

530
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,560
 That's amazing.

531
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,560
 One more thing about insects and their footprints,

532
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
 which I found cool.

533
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
 Oh.

534
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,560
 So insects leave little damp footprints wherever they go.

535
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
 That's cute.

536
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
 And you normally don't notice them, obviously.

537
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
 Spandle.

538
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
 Spandle.

539
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,560
 Leave wet footprints on the floor.

540
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
 Spandle.

541
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
 So insects spandle wherever they go.

542
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
 Brilliant.

543
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,560
 Each footprint is a quadrillionth of a liter.

544
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,560
 It's not helpful.

545
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,560
 It's very small amount, obviously.

546
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
 And it was believed, until quite recently,

547
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,560
 that the liquid is helping them to stick to the leaf.

548
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
 Like, you know, when you have a glass with a wet bottom,

549
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,560
 it sticks to the table or whatever on the coast.

550
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
 And so that was what it was believed to be.

551
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,560
 But there was an experiment conducted by a Cambridge scientist

552
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,560
 called David Labonte, and it was done on stick insects.

553
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
 This is how I came across this.

554
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,560
 And this study was published in the scientific journal

555
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,560
 Soft Matter, which sounds great.

556
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,560
 And he put wires on stick insects feet,

557
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
 because they're quite slow and they're quite docile.

558
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,560
 And then he measured with a tiny sensor,

559
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,560
 the force that was required to lift their feet off glass plates

560
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
 at various different amounts of wetness.

561
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,560
 This is really a hard experiment to do.

562
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
 And it turns out, this is the really exciting thing,

563
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,560
 that the liquid may actually let them unstick their feet,

564
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,560
 rather than being the other way around.

565
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,560
 It's like a release, release a quadrillionth of a liter.

566
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
 Because that is one of the interesting things, isn't it?

567
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
 Because everyone thinks they're called stick insects

568
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
 because they look like sticks,

569
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
 but it's because they stick to things.

570
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,560
 Oh, no. Is that? No.

571
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,560
 Oh, no. There you go. I believed it.

572
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
 I did. I was totally...

573
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
 Have you heard of the Euro Club?

574
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
 No, I haven't.

575
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
 This is a new invention.

576
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
 Oh, no.

577
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
 It is a golf club.

578
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
 Oh, this sounds great.

579
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
 Let's say you're out playing golf.

580
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,560
 And the base where you go is...

581
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
 Clubhouse?

582
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
 Jesus Christ.

583
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
 It's far away.

584
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
 But hang on, I need the toilet.

585
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,560
 Euro Club is a hollow club where you can take off the lid.

586
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,560
 The invention comes with a kind of curtain

587
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
 that you can put over.

588
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
 That's lovely.

589
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
 And you are able to relieve yourself into your golf clubs.

590
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
 Brilliant.

591
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
 And then continue on with your game.

592
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
 Okay, well, sorry, James.

593
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
 You'll have a few thoughts, but I've got a few too.

594
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
 Yeah, well, why don't you go first?

595
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,560
 I mean me too, frankly.

596
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,560
 So, firstly, it presupposes that there are no trees

597
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
 anywhere near this golf course.

598
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
 Are you allowed to go on trees?

599
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
 Well, it's...

600
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
 Can you have a tree wee?

601
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
 It is regularly done,

602
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
 but I think it's kind of frowned upon,

603
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,560
 like just urinating in the open.

604
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,560
 And also, women can't do that.

605
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,560
 Well, it doesn't sound like women can piss into a golf club,

606
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
 either, mate.

607
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
 You can have a she-wee.

608
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
 You can have a she-wee onto the Euro Club.

609
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
 That'll affect the swing

610
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
 and that'll affect the hold of the golf club, you know.

611
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,560
 Well, I want to know that if you urinate in sweat,

612
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
 there's going to be...

613
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
 It's going to change the way that it feels to swing, right?

614
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
 Yeah.

615
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
 As you hold it up,

616
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
 it's all going to be down the end

617
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
 where you're the top end of the club.

618
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,560
 Also, you need to make sure that seal is...

619
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,560
 Absolutely.

620
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
 I don't know if these people

621
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
 have had any centrifugal forces.

622
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
 I was going to say watertight.

623
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
 Piss tight.

624
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
 That seal needs to be.

625
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,560
 Actually, I am thinking,

626
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,560
 like, Hannah, you'd know better than me,

627
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,560
 but if you hold a golf club like this,

628
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
 the urine is going to be in your hand

629
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
 when you're holding it at the top of the swing.

630
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
 Exactly.

631
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
 And then when you come down,

632
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
 the momentum of the urine going down the club

633
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
 should give you more angular momentum

634
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
 and should make you hit the ball further.

635
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
 Hmm.

636
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
 I mean, sure.

637
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
 Maybe that's the secret of a lot of great golfers.

638
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
 That's why.

639
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
 They've been using the Euro...

640
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
 Tiger Woods.

641
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
 Yeah, Tiger Woods, yeah.

642
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
 Piss filled club for his entire career.

643
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
 What's your secret?

644
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
 It just smiles enigmatically when you get away.

645
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
 That's brilliant.

646
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,560
 So, famous fake tan brand is Saint-Tropez.

647
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
 Mm-hmm.

648
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,560
 And I thought I'd look into Saint-Tropez

649
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
 because it's a famous place

650
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
 where people might go to get suntans and stuff,

651
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
 and that's why it's got the name.

652
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
 It became famous thanks to Brigitte Bardot,

653
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,560
 who, she came from a really wealthy family

654
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
 and her parents had a house there,

655
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,560
 but also due to a big argument about topless bathing.

656
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,560
 And this was in 1964,

657
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,560
 and everyone wanted to do topless bathing in Saint-Tropez,

658
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,560
 but the mayor really did not want them to do it.

659
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
 And there was a massive argument.

660
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
 It's really famous in France.

661
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,560
 And the mayor went so far as to order a helicopter

662
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,560
 which he flew over all of the beaches

663
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,560
 looking for women who had the tops off.

664
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,560
 Dropping towels on them from the height.

665
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
 Isn't that amazing?

666
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
 I mean, if he was so bothered by it,

667
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,560
 I mean, maybe just consider not looking.

668
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,560
 I think if you're the mayor, you have to.

669
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,560
 You have to go around looking at everyone on the beach.

670
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
 Wow.

671
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
 Do you remember there used to be an airplane

672
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
 that rock stars used?

673
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
 So, Zeppelin used it.

674
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,560
 It had an open fire chimney.

675
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
 What inside?

676
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
 It had a fireplace.

677
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
 It had a fireplace.

678
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
 It did.

679
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
 You can see photos.

680
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
 They're sitting around like an open fire by a chimney.

681
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
 Have we not discussed that before?

682
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
 No.

683
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
 Have we not?

684
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
 I can't remember.

685
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,560
 Look, I think it's all about benefit and reward, right?

686
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
 Risk-reward ratio.

687
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
 And on that, it seems way off.

688
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,560
 It's rock and roll, Hannah.

689
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
 The chimney sweep has got to go up

690
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
 when you're at 30,000 feet.

691
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:15,560
 I remember through Time magazine's Best Inventions of 2022,

692
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,560
 which was pretty good.

693
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
 Oh, I think I know one of these.

694
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
 Oh, go for it.

695
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
 Is one of them a prosthetic hand

696
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
 that you can try with your mind?

697
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
 There was one like that.

698
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
 Yeah.

699
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
 It was incredible.

700
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,560
 I kind of went for the less good ones.

701
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,560
 Tasty tape, I thought was pretty cool.

702
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,560
 That's nice.

703
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
 It's like cellotape for burritos.

704
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,560
 So, you know, you make a burrito

705
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
 and it kind of can fall apart and stuff.

706
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,560
 This is edible cellotape, and it means you can like...

707
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
 That's brilliant.

708
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
 It is a genius idea, isn't it?

709
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
 Sorry, it's edible.

710
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
 Is it tasty?

711
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
 It's called tasty tape, so...

712
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

713
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
 It could be cool as advertising.

714
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
 Put some Hannah's MSG on it.

715
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
 Yeah?

716
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
 Everything's tasty.

717
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
 That's just quite a nice idea, isn't it?

718
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
 I think that's a great idea.

719
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
 Yeah.

720
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
 Yeah, like that.

721
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
 Say goodbye to burrito-collapsed misery.

722
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,560
 Do you bring your own tape to the burrito...

723
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
 Party.

724
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
 Party.

725
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
 Yeah.

726
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,560
 It's not a big dispenser at the counter.

727
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
 Okay.

728
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
 I would say it's more if you're making them yourself.

729
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
 Okay.

730
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
 I would say you advise...

731
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
 They can fold effectively.

732
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
 I mean, they're folding wizards.

733
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,560
 Yeah.

734
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
 They are very good.

735
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
 They're crows, and really, they don't...

736
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
 Actually, I've never had it fall apart.

737
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
 I genuinely thought you were about to admit

738
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
 that you'd never had a burrito.

739
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,560
 If you make your own fajitas, for instance.

740
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
 Yes.

741
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
 Like, you're at home making fajitas.

742
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
 Sure.

743
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
 They do fall apart, like, don't they?

744
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
 Oh, do they not?

745
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
 You are an expert origami.

746
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
 They're pretty good.

747
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
 They keep the shape.

748
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
 You're not putting enough stuff in.

749
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
 No, maybe that's it.

750
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
 Maybe that's it.

751
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
 Yeah.

752
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,560
 Yeah, your bread to filling ratio needs to be addressed.

753
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
 They are a bit.

754
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,560
 They are a bit at the tiny tip of the fajita world.

755
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,560
 It's a slightly sad affair.

756
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,560
 'Cause if you go to Formula One, you kind of sat in your place

757
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
 and they fly past it about a million miles an hour.

758
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

759
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
 Like, just see them for one second.

760
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
 I have always thought that about watching it light.

761
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
 Like, doesn't it just go past you and then...

762
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
 It does, yeah.

763
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
 Yeah.

764
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
 I did that with the Olympic cycling.

765
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,560
 Yeah, yeah.

766
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
 And same with the Tour de France self-replace.

767
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,560
 Weighted, boom, and then we waited four hours.

768
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
 And then, boom, the other way.

769
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,560
 Got on the bus with the dogs.

770
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
 They were pissed off as well.

771
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,560
 Did I ever tell you that thing about my friend who was in France

772
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
 and was on the tour?

773
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
 I've done that on the show.

774
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
 I don't think so.

775
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
 I love it anyway.

776
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,560
 A friend of mine went to the Tour de France.

777
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
 He knew this at the time, got a house, rented a house,

778
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,560
 and the Tour de France came right past the house.

779
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
 Wow.

780
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
 So he had his whole family with him

781
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
 and he had people from his work and they all watched it.

782
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
 And he found out that the house was for sale.

783
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
 So he bought the house and he went,

784
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
 "We're going to come back every year

785
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
 and we're going to watch the Tour de France from this spot."

786
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
 Not knowing that the Tour de France changes its route

787
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
 every single year.

788
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
 Oh, my God.

789
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
 It's brilliant.

790
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
 It still has the house.

791
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
 (APPLAUSE)

792
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,560
 So if you can play the music a bit,

793
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
 this is the shows over now.

794
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,560
 Can I ask, who's the person who sent me a message

795
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
 saying the newest species in Lizard in New Zealand

796
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,560
 was discovered by me?

797
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
 Are you lying?

798
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,560
 Wow.

799
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
 That's not evidence.

800
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
 It's circumstantial out there.

801
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
 But also, that wasn't the person who was asking,

802
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,560
 "What are you lying about?"

803
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560
 Are you Ben Barr?

804
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
 Can we get a mic over, actually?

805
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,560
 Let's quickly get a mic.

806
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,560
 Tell us your name, first of all.

807
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
 I'm Lockie.

808
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,560
 He's definitely from New Zealand.

809
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
 Hi, Lockie.

810
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
 We've established.

811
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
 I named a hoplodactylus tohu after working with

812
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,560
 some of the indigenous Māori communities in New Zealand,

813
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
 because it was important to their tribes or whatever

814
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
 that lived in the area that the species was in.

815
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
 You named it what? A hoplodactylus?

816
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
 It's called hoplodactylus tohu.

817
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
 What is it? It's a gecko.

818
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
 Oh, wow.

819
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
 It's a New Zealand gecko, which is the odds of that happening.

820
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
 Oh, my God, you must have been seeing it at the whole show.

821
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
 You didn't fucking see it?

822
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
 Yeah, I was going to wait till the end.

823
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
 I wasn't going to be...

824
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
 That's amazing. That's incredible.

825
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
 Wait, so you found a new species of gecko

826
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,560
 or a very old species of gecko?

827
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
 Yeah, it's always been there, but no one knew it.

828
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
 No one knew it existed.

829
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
 That's amazing. Yeah, using DNA stuff, we found it.

830
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
 So, I got a message just today from someone

831
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
 saying, because we did a fact about

832
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
 stick insects on a previous fish episode,

833
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
 it's just gone out with John Lloyd.

834
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
 John Lloyd, the creator of QI

835
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
 and, you know, Blackadder

836
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
 and Spitting Image.

837
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
 I think he's here. John, are you here?

838
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
 Is he here? Yeah, he is.

839
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
 Yeah, that's our founder.

840
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
 Blackadder, Spitting Image,

841
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
 not the minor-clock news, but the legend.

842
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
 So, we did this fact,

843
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
 and someone messaged me saying,

844
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
 "Just in case you're not completely sick of stick insects,

845
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
 check out the Lord Howe Island

846
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
 Phasmid."

847
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
 Phasmid? Phasmid, yeah.

848
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
 Phasmid, yeah.

849
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
 And then she wrote, "Full disclosure,

850
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
 it was my dad who found it

851
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
 when he went climbing Balls Pyramid

852
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
 with Dick Smith."

853
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,560
 Balls and Dick?

854
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
 That's the... Yeah, love it.

855
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
 That's wonderful.

856
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
 Oh, thank you very much, Loki, that's brilliant.

857
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
 Are we going to do some more? Yeah, one or two more.

858
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
 Okay, so, we'll have to be really quick, I guess.

859
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
 Yeah, yeah, quick.

860
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
 Someone messaged saying,

861
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
 "What is the one disgusting fact

862
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
 that you wish you'd never learned?"

863
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,560
 Oh, there's a frog called the horror frog.

864
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
 Oh, no, there's a frog...

865
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,560
 There's a frog fertility thing. It's really horrible.

866
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
 Uh...

867
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
 We were in Wales when we did it on the show.

868
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
 It was in Cardiff in the Glee Club,

869
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
 and the audience physically...

870
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
 We're all repulsed, but I can't remember

871
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
 the details of the fact now.

872
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
 So, if you go back 300 episodes

873
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
 and listen to that, you're welcome.

874
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
 Have you got one?

875
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
 I've got one. There are orangutan brothels.

876
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
 No.

877
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
 There are where...

878
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
 No.

879
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
 Do you want me not just to say it?

880
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
 No, say it. I'll tell you how I found this out,

881
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
 because the story is quite funny.

882
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
 I was filming Death in Paradise,

883
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
 and I really didn't want to go.

884
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
 I was like, "I don't like this show."

885
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
 Imagine if you don't do this show.

886
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
 I'd turn it down three times.

887
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
 Because if you don't do it, I'm going to drop you

888
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
 because you just don't want to be on telly.

889
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
 You wouldn't be hosting dog award ceremonies.

890
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
 That's your thing.

891
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
 It was only when I got on the plane

892
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
 that I went, "Actually, I'm going to the Caribbean

893
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,560
 for 10 days. It's not that bad."

894
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
 And I got out there, and I had a really great time.

895
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
 Had the most amazing cast,

896
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
 a brilliant gang of renegades.

897
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
 And one of the people,

898
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
 Francis,

899
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
 who was telling us about house he had

900
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
 in Borneo, and he said,

901
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
 "Oh, you know,

902
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
 it was a very small house,

903
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
 and there were a reed roof,

904
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
 and snakes used to fall in when it rained."

905
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
 And I said, "Oh, that's awful. I couldn't handle that."

906
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
 I couldn't handle that. He said, "It wasn't the worst thing, though.

907
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,560
 The worst thing was the

908
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
 sex tourists going through the jungle

909
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
 to have sex with the orangutans."

910
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
 And I was like, "No way."

911
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
 And we said, "The orangutans are threatened."

912
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
 And I said,

913
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
 "Oh, because of the logging?"

914
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
 And he went, "No, because of the sex tourists going in

915
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
 and having sex with them." I said, "Oh, that's awful."

916
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
 And Nick Moran from

917
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
 what's he called, you know,

918
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
 the lock stock,

919
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
 he said,

920
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
 "Oh, that's disgusting." He said,

921
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
 "They have sex with the orangutans." He said,

922
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
 "I wouldn't fuck a ginger human," he said.

923
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,560
 [laughter]

924
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
 Like the problem,

925
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
 like the problem was that the orangutan

926
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
 was orange.

927
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
 [laughter]

928
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:36,560
 Sorry, Andy. I know your parents are in.

929
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
 I'm sorry.

930
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,560
 Sorry, Andy's mum and dad.

931
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
 [laughter]

932
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,560
 Oh, look.

933
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
 Any other questions?

934
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
 Yeah.

935
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
 Well, once again, Sally has brought us to the end

936
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,560
 of a show.

937
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560

938
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
