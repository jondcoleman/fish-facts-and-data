00:00:14,00:00:19,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:19,00:00:23,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:00:27,00:00:30,"I am Richard Zinsky, and Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:00:30,00:00:32,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:32,00:00:35,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:35,00:00:38,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:38,00:00:41,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact."
00:00:41,00:00:45,My fact this week is that the White House's Oval Office
00:00:45,00:00:48,is a giant weighing scale.
00:00:48,00:00:51,- What do they use it for normally?
00:00:51,00:00:53,- Wailing the President.
00:00:53,00:00:55,"- No, to see how heavy he is."
00:00:55,00:00:56,"- No, it's not."
00:00:56,00:00:58,"- So are you waving? - Yeah, that's what I thought."
00:00:58,00:01:00,"- Yeah, it's to see that he's there full stop."
00:01:00,00:01:02,So the secret service need a monitor
00:01:02,00:01:04,where the President is at all times.
00:01:04,00:01:06,"However, they're not allowed into the Oval Office."
00:01:06,00:01:09,"He doesn't want them in there, so they have to stand outside."
00:01:09,00:01:11,"Now, when the doors open, they can see where he is,"
00:01:11,00:01:14,"but when the door is shut, they can't see where the President is."
00:01:14,00:01:16,"So if you look at pictures of the Oval Office,"
00:01:16,00:01:19,there is a giant oval carpet that literally spans the entire office room
00:01:19,00:01:21,except for a few inches to the wall.
00:01:21,00:01:25,And underneath it are weighing pads that are connected to a line
00:01:25,00:01:26,that goes outside.
00:01:26,00:01:30,So the secret service can see where he is in the Oval Office
00:01:30,00:01:32,purely by where he's standing.
00:01:32,00:01:34,- I think I would get a load of objects
00:01:34,00:01:36,that weighed exactly the same as me
00:01:36,00:01:38,and just keep moving them around the office
00:01:38,00:01:39,just to blind up the secret service.
00:01:39,00:01:41,- Like Indiana Jones at the beginning of the first film.
00:01:41,00:01:42,- Yeah.
00:01:42,00:01:44,"- But it's kind of like, if you've seen Harry Potter,"
00:01:44,00:01:47,"the Marauder's Map, where they just follow the footsteps on the map."
00:01:47,00:01:49,That's what the secret service have to have.
00:01:49,00:01:50,"- Except it's not a Marauder's Map,"
00:01:50,00:01:52,because the things are labeled as the President.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"It's just someone who weighs roughly the same amount as the President, right?"
00:01:54,00:01:56,"So it's definitely Obama's in the Oval Office,"
00:01:56,00:01:59,or someone who is also human sized as in the Oval Office.
00:01:59,00:02:01,"- Yeah, or two people in the Oval Office."
00:02:01,00:02:04,"It's just way of making sure that no one kidnaps him through a window, maybe."
00:02:04,00:02:06,"- Well, they allowed him to the Oval Office."
00:02:06,00:02:07,"- I don't know, actually."
00:02:07,00:02:10,"This is a fact, which I haven't seen in many places."
00:02:10,00:02:13,"It's from Brad Meltzer, who is a best-selling novelist,"
00:02:13,00:02:15,but also works at the White House and gives tours.
00:02:15,00:02:17,"And he did a Huffington Post piece where he said,"
00:02:17,00:02:19,"""Here is secret service secrets."""
00:02:19,00:02:21,And that was the top one.
00:02:21,00:02:24,- 'Cause he got lots of randomers into the Oval Office.
00:02:24,00:02:27,I'd be a bit insulted as his secret service if I wasn't allowed in.
00:02:27,00:02:29,"- Well, I think it's more, they're probably allowed in at some point."
00:02:29,00:02:31,I don't think it's like a total ban on secret service people.
00:02:31,00:02:33,"I think when he's working on a day-to-day basis,"
00:02:33,00:02:34,he doesn't want secret service people.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"- Let's say they're doing something really important,"
00:02:36,00:02:38,"which is quite classified,"
00:02:38,00:02:40,"and only the people who need to know are in there,"
00:02:40,00:02:43,"so the other guys just stood outside, like playing cards or something."
00:02:43,00:02:45,"- Do you think if he puts on a bit of weight,"
00:02:45,00:02:47,they start giving him a slide look?
00:02:47,00:02:48,- Right.
00:02:48,00:02:52,"- So, are you sure about that biscuit, Mr. President?"
00:02:52,00:02:54,(laughing)
00:02:54,00:02:56,- This article by Brad Meltzer also mentions
00:02:56,00:03:00,that anytime we hear about the White House going under renovations
00:03:00,00:03:02,"of an old room, it's actually that the secret service"
00:03:02,00:03:04,"are conducting an investigation,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,and it's the only way of giving an excuse
00:03:06,00:03:10,to allow for the first family to be out of the White House
00:03:10,00:03:11,"while renovations are going on,"
00:03:11,00:03:13,but it actually means they're conducting an investigation.
00:03:13,00:03:14,- Is that right?
00:03:14,00:03:15,- This will always be that.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"- No, no, but I think there's been a few cases."
00:03:17,00:03:19,"It's a sort of, like, inside knowledge thing"
00:03:19,00:03:21,"that if there's an investigation by the secret service,"
00:03:21,00:03:23,they will say currently unobenerate.
00:03:23,00:03:24,- What are they investigating?
00:03:24,00:03:26,- That needs the President to be away.
00:03:26,00:03:28,"- It's hard to research them,"
00:03:28,00:03:30,"because they're quite open about some things,"
00:03:30,00:03:32,but then other things are surprisingly secretive.
00:03:32,00:03:33,"- It is surprising, isn't it?"
00:03:33,00:03:36,It's not that they would want to keep anything from us.
00:03:36,00:03:37,- It's controversial.
00:03:37,00:03:38,Are they telling the truth?
00:03:38,00:03:39,Is the author telling the truth?
00:03:39,00:03:42,"We know a bit too much about the secret service, it seems, recently."
00:03:42,00:03:44,- I thought it would just be called the service.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"- Exactly, yeah, the open service."
00:03:46,00:03:49,- You know that we have a lot of presidents and leaders
00:03:49,00:03:51,who like exercise and like jogging.
00:03:51,00:03:53,"Obviously, when they go out on a jog,"
00:03:53,00:03:56,they have to be accompanied by their little secret service cabal
00:03:56,00:03:57,who have to jog with them.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"For instance, there was an article, I think this is in the Atlantic,"
00:03:59,00:04:01,"by someone who'd been in the secret service under Clinton,"
00:04:01,00:04:03,"and he said it was a complete nightmare,"
00:04:03,00:04:05,"because Clinton loved running,"
00:04:05,00:04:07,and they even built him his own little running track
00:04:07,00:04:09,"inside the White House grounds,"
00:04:09,00:04:11,"but he didn't like it, he liked to be out there with the people."
00:04:11,00:04:13,"Whenever Clinton went for a run,"
00:04:13,00:04:15,"a bunch of them all had to go for a run as well,"
00:04:15,00:04:16,but not just for a run.
00:04:16,00:04:19,"They had to go for a run carrying like all their guns and weapons,"
00:04:19,00:04:20,"and it'd be super alert,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,and always be ready to attack someone
00:04:22,00:04:24,if they attacked the president.
00:04:24,00:04:25,And so it sounds like absolutely hell.
00:04:25,00:04:27,- Imagine if Moll Farrah became president.
00:04:27,00:04:29,(laughing)
00:04:29,00:04:32,"- Oh my gosh, who would you, that's true."
00:04:32,00:04:35,"There are five people to qualify from being president,"
00:04:35,00:04:37,"and they're the five fastest people in the world,"
00:04:37,00:04:39,because surely you need five people faster than the president.
00:04:39,00:04:42,"- But Moll's not in the five fastest people in the world, is he?"
00:04:42,00:04:43,"- For running distances,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,which is what Moll's was doing.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"I mean, it's hardly, you say ball becomes president,"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"and you can only run 100 metres, 200 metres."
00:04:51,00:04:53,What trouble could he get in?
00:04:53,00:04:55,"- But he won't be able to get away,"
00:04:55,00:04:57,because at least the secret time is busing more people
00:04:57,00:05:00,"to start running after the first 5,000 metres,"
00:05:00,00:05:02,but no president Farrah has been running.
00:05:02,00:05:04,"- So when president Farrah is running,"
00:05:04,00:05:07,"what they'll do is they'll all be running in like a relay,"
00:05:07,00:05:09,and they pass the gun.
00:05:09,00:05:12,(laughing)
00:05:12,00:05:15,"- Yeah, they do have to, it's quite funny,"
00:05:15,00:05:17,when you look into sort of odd little things
00:05:17,00:05:19,"that they have to prepare for in the safety of a president,"
00:05:19,00:05:21,like Clinton going for his runs.
00:05:21,00:05:23,So do you remember that famous incident
00:05:23,00:05:25,where George Bush swallowed a pretzel
00:05:25,00:05:27,and started choking on it?
00:05:27,00:05:30,"Apparently, that was a thing that they had to try and work out"
00:05:30,00:05:31,"how to avoid from ever happening again,"
00:05:31,00:05:33,because-- - So did they all suck the pretzel?
00:05:33,00:05:35,So called the pretzel first.
00:05:35,00:05:37,"- Exactly, what do you do in that situation?"
00:05:37,00:05:39,So the only thing-- - The only thing--
00:05:39,00:05:41,- The only thing-- (laughing)
00:05:41,00:05:43,- The only thing that they could come up with
00:05:43,00:05:46,"was a sort of emergency push button,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,which I assumed he should have had anyway.
00:05:48,00:05:49,- Or the pretzel button.
00:05:49,00:05:51,"- No, it's not exclusively for pretzel, if he's--"
00:05:51,00:05:54,"- It's a pretzel shake, I hope they made a pretzel shake."
00:05:54,00:05:56,(laughing)
00:05:56,00:05:58,"- Some of the presidential secret service things,"
00:05:58,00:06:01,I read in one book called Personality Character
00:06:01,00:06:03,and Leadership in the White House.
00:06:03,00:06:04,I don't know if it's true.
00:06:04,00:06:07,"That Gerald Ford, whenever he farted,"
00:06:07,00:06:09,would blame the secret service who were around him.
00:06:09,00:06:10,(laughing)
00:06:10,00:06:14,"Oh, God, Jesus, guys, can you not keep a bit of the car room?"
00:06:14,00:06:15,- That's amazing.
00:06:15,00:06:16,"- Apparently, that's true."
00:06:16,00:06:17,- I guess that's true.
00:06:17,00:06:20,We spoke about this before on the podcast.
00:06:20,00:06:21,There was one president.
00:06:21,00:06:23,"I think it was Johnson, who would just,"
00:06:23,00:06:25,"if he was taking a piss, would just urinate"
00:06:25,00:06:27,"on the secret service member and say,"
00:06:27,00:06:28,"""I can do this, I'm the president."""
00:06:28,00:06:31,"- I think the story went, something like,"
00:06:31,00:06:32,"it was LBJ, wasn't it?"
00:06:32,00:06:35,And I think what happened was he went for a piss
00:06:35,00:06:37,on the side of the road when they were driving somewhere
00:06:37,00:06:40,and they kind of did like a human wall around him
00:06:40,00:06:42,and then there's like a gust of wind
00:06:42,00:06:44,"and it blew the pee on to one of the guys,"
00:06:44,00:06:46,"and he said, ""Excuse me, Mr. President, you're peeing on me."""
00:06:46,00:06:48,"And he said, ""Well, it's my prerogative to do that."""
00:06:48,00:06:50,I think that's what the story is anyway.
00:06:50,00:06:51,- Okay.
00:06:51,00:06:52,- Makes him slightly less unpleasant
00:06:52,00:06:54,than deliberately weeing on his...
00:06:54,00:06:55,"- Yes, yes."
00:06:55,00:06:58,- Every time he needed to do a cool one of them into the office.
00:06:58,00:06:59,(laughing)
00:06:59,00:07:03,There was a assassination attempt that was made on Ronald Reagan
00:07:03,00:07:06,"and it was made by John Hinckley, Jr."
00:07:06,00:07:10,"and one of the secret service guys, a guy called Jerry Parr,"
00:07:10,00:07:13,is the guy who got Ronald Reagan into the limousine
00:07:13,00:07:14,and got him off to...
00:07:14,00:07:16,And notice that he blood was coming out of his mouth
00:07:16,00:07:19,"and said, ""We need to get to the hospital right now."""
00:07:19,00:07:22,So he said to have saved Ronald Reagan's life.
00:07:22,00:07:25,"Interestingly, he became a secret service officer"
00:07:25,00:07:28,because he had watched a movie called Code of the Secret Service.
00:07:28,00:07:31,"Years before, which starred Ronald Reagan"
00:07:31,00:07:33,as a secret service guy.
00:07:33,00:07:34,- No way!
00:07:34,00:07:36,"- Yeah, so he ended up saving the life of the guy"
00:07:36,00:07:37,who got him into it through...
00:07:37,00:07:39,- So Ronald Reagan saved his own life in a way.
00:07:39,00:07:40,- Exactly.
00:07:40,00:07:41,(laughing)
00:07:41,00:07:42,- Wow.
00:07:42,00:07:43,- That's incredible.
00:07:43,00:07:44,"- Yes, really cool."
00:07:44,00:07:46,"- That made a good movie in itself, wasn't it?"
00:07:46,00:07:47,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:07:47,00:07:49,"- Just one thing about the British secret services,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,which I thought was interesting.
00:07:51,00:07:52,"So during the Second World War,"
00:07:52,00:07:54,"they obviously requisitioned a load of, you know,"
00:07:54,00:07:56,country houses and castles and things like that
00:07:56,00:07:57,and stately homes.
00:07:57,00:07:59,And one place they had was in Scotland.
00:07:59,00:08:00,It was called Invaler Lodge.
00:08:00,00:08:04,"And it was used for spies who weren't good enough to spy,"
00:08:04,00:08:07,but had already learned too much secret information
00:08:07,00:08:08,to be allowed to leave.
00:08:08,00:08:10,(laughing)
00:08:10,00:08:11,- That way.
00:08:11,00:08:12,"- Yeah, wow."
00:08:12,00:08:14,- And they had to stay there for the rest of the war.
00:08:14,00:08:17,"- One of them, one unfortunate man who had signed up to spy,"
00:08:17,00:08:20,he was refused to actually go and spy in the field
00:08:20,00:08:23,because apparently he was outstandingly ugly.
00:08:23,00:08:26,So there was a report which said he'd be recognized anywhere.
00:08:26,00:08:28,Once he'd never forgotten.
00:08:28,00:08:34,"He has no teeth at all, except two gold tusks and two incisors."
00:08:34,00:08:36,(laughing)
00:08:36,00:08:37,Poor man.
00:08:37,00:08:42,- But they must have been as well.
00:08:42,00:08:43,"Like by the time they all left,"
00:08:43,00:08:45,everyone would have known the secrets
00:08:45,00:08:46,that they were meant to be keeping as well.
00:08:46,00:08:47,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:08:47,00:08:48,- Have come here.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"Wow, I got told this thing about."
00:08:49,00:08:50,(laughing)
00:08:50,00:08:51,"The one guy goes, ""No!"""
00:08:51,00:08:53,"""Come on, Mike!"""
00:08:53,00:08:56,(upbeat rock music)
00:08:56,00:09:03,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:09:03,00:09:06,"- Okay, my fact this week is that because male bumblebees"
00:09:06,00:09:08,"rely on sight to find females,"
00:09:08,00:09:11,they sometimes find themselves chasing after aeroplanes.
00:09:11,00:09:13,(laughing)
00:09:13,00:09:16,- So presumably their eyesight is not very good?
00:09:16,00:09:19,"- Well, it's good for an insect."
00:09:19,00:09:20,(laughing)
00:09:20,00:09:22,But it's not good for like an eagle.
00:09:22,00:09:23,"- Oh, okay."
00:09:23,00:09:24,- Okay.
00:09:24,00:09:26,- Bumblebees do have kind of good eyesight
00:09:26,00:09:28,as in they can see lots of colors.
00:09:28,00:09:29,- Yeah.
00:09:29,00:09:31,- People didn't realize they could see colors
00:09:31,00:09:33,and then Carl Frisch is a cold.
00:09:33,00:09:35,"That guy who works out that they did the waggle dance,"
00:09:35,00:09:37,he's quite famous scientist.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"- Yeah, he got a Nobel Prize for that."
00:09:39,00:09:42,"- Yeah, and he did an experiments where he proved"
00:09:42,00:09:45,"that they could see colors by getting loads of gray,"
00:09:45,00:09:47,like gray card and then one colored card
00:09:47,00:09:49,and always put the food on the colored one
00:09:49,00:09:50,that could always tell where it was.
00:09:50,00:09:52,So they do have color sight.
00:09:52,00:09:53,- So are you saying we need to stop painting
00:09:53,00:09:55,our aeroplane Stripe Black and Yellow?
00:09:55,00:09:57,(laughing)
00:09:57,00:10:00,"- Well, there is a Stripe Black and Yellow aeroplane"
00:10:00,00:10:03,and it is the smallest airplane that has flown.
00:10:03,00:10:04,- Is it the size of a bee?
00:10:04,00:10:06,- It's called the Bumblebees a bit bigger.
00:10:06,00:10:09,It's eight foot ten inches in length
00:10:09,00:10:11,and the wingspan is five foot six
00:10:11,00:10:12,and it's tiny.
00:10:12,00:10:13,- It's so small.
00:10:13,00:10:14,- It's so small.
00:10:14,00:10:15,- Yeah.
00:10:15,00:10:16,It's a bike lane as well.
00:10:16,00:10:17,- Yeah.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"- I mean, it does not look like it should get off the ground."
00:10:19,00:10:22,The wings are so small that you shouldn't think it has enough left.
00:10:22,00:10:25,- It looks like your car has just had some wings.
00:10:25,00:10:27,And not even as big as your car
00:10:27,00:10:29,because it fits five people in a car.
00:10:29,00:10:30,- Here's my armspan.
00:10:30,00:10:33,It's six inches shorter than my armspan across the whole plane.
00:10:33,00:10:34,- And yes.
00:10:34,00:10:35,- The wingtip.
00:10:35,00:10:37,"- Looking at that, despite the fact that that's Black and Yellow"
00:10:37,00:10:40,"and is the smallest plane, I still think B's are idiots."
00:10:40,00:10:41,They look at something that size.
00:10:41,00:10:43,I think it's genuinely a bee.
00:10:43,00:10:45,- Do they chase after the plane once it's in flight
00:10:45,00:10:47,or is there a lot of B's at Heathrow?
00:10:47,00:10:49,- It's in flight.
00:10:49,00:10:53,So I got this from a newsletter of the Bee Conservation Society.
00:10:53,00:10:57,It's all about how male bees find the queens.
00:10:57,00:10:59,And there are different ways of doing it.
00:10:59,00:11:02,One way that they do it is by all load of males
00:11:02,00:11:05,kind of leave their smells around in a certain area.
00:11:05,00:11:06,Their pheromones.
00:11:06,00:11:08,And they kind of do it as a gang.
00:11:08,00:11:10,And they put loads and loads of stuff around them.
00:11:10,00:11:12,Then the queen just smells tons and tons of males
00:11:12,00:11:14,and then goes down and then they make that way.
00:11:14,00:11:18,And another way is by kind of chasing after a female.
00:11:18,00:11:21,So they'll see one in flight and they'll chase after the female.
00:11:21,00:11:25,"And even though their eyesight is kind of good for insects,"
00:11:25,00:11:27,it's not quite that good.
00:11:27,00:11:30,And so if they see something which is small looking
00:11:30,00:11:32,"but actually is far away and is flying,"
00:11:32,00:11:35,"then they can sometimes, according to this newsletter,"
00:11:35,00:11:37,mistake it for an aeroplane.
00:11:37,00:11:39,- Do we know how far they get towards the plane
00:11:39,00:11:41,before they realise the mistake?
00:11:41,00:11:44,- They realise the mistake and then they have to casually turn around
00:11:44,00:11:46,as though they weren't chasing.
00:11:46,00:11:48,- Do you mean like what you tried to get onto a tube train
00:11:48,00:11:50,and it goes away and you pretend you weren't buffing gas?
00:11:50,00:11:51,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:51,00:11:56,- Or do they think that there's just certain female bees
00:11:56,00:11:59,out there or male bees that are extremely fast?
00:11:59,00:12:04,"- Like Matt, he was like, ""President, you saying bolter of the bees?"""
00:12:04,00:12:09,"- No, it didn't go that far into the psychology of the bee."
00:12:09,00:12:13,- That makes more sense that it's at a distance though.
00:12:13,00:12:15,- I sort of can forgive the bee slightly.
00:12:15,00:12:17,I think it planets like a bee from far away.
00:12:17,00:12:21,"- Sorry, just one more thing on the colours that bees can see."
00:12:21,00:12:23,"They can't really see red,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,"but they can see things that are further in the spectrum,"
00:12:25,00:12:27,so they can see like ultraviolet.
00:12:27,00:12:30,They can see a little bit of yellow and orange.
00:12:30,00:12:32,They can see blue. They can see violet.
00:12:32,00:12:35,And they can see another colour which I saw in a website
00:12:35,00:12:40,"was called bee purple. And bee purple is a colour that we can't see,"
00:12:40,00:12:43,which is like a combination of yellow and ultraviolet.
00:12:43,00:12:44,- Really?
00:12:44,00:12:46,- That's so cool.
00:12:46,00:12:48,- How do we know they can see it?
00:12:48,00:12:52,Have they done paintings and there's just these big blind spots?
00:12:52,00:12:54,"- I don't know, I think you can,"
00:12:54,00:12:57,"if you know the wavelength that something gives off,"
00:12:57,00:13:00,you can know that there is a colour there even if you can't see it.
00:13:00,00:13:02,- So they can tell that it's a sort of purple-ish
00:13:02,00:13:05,in the spectrum area. - That's so cool.
00:13:05,00:13:08,I don't think you can mix normal colours with ultraviolet as well.
00:13:08,00:13:11,"- I don't think so. But it makes sense that you can, doesn't it?"
00:13:11,00:13:12,- Yeah.
00:13:12,00:13:13,- I don't know.
00:13:13,00:13:16,- As you mixed it with the colour would gradually disappear
00:13:16,00:13:19,because we can't see stuff in the ultraviolet spectrum.
00:13:19,00:13:21,So we'll be putting an invisibility cloak on.
00:13:21,00:13:24,Manufacturers of invisibility cloak should take notes.
00:13:24,00:13:27,- I imagine that it doesn't quite work like that.
00:13:27,00:13:29,- I think she's absolutely right.
00:13:29,00:13:32,- See? I'm not the only one that gets slammed from my Harry Potter references.
00:13:32,00:13:33,- Stop being right.
00:13:33,00:13:37,- Do we know if there's anything in our day-to-day life
00:13:37,00:13:39,"that is actually that be purple,"
00:13:39,00:13:41,but we obviously just see it as purple?
00:13:41,00:13:44,"- Well, there are plants which have colours"
00:13:44,00:13:46,"that if you shine a UV light on them,"
00:13:46,00:13:48,"you can see that they glow in a certain way,"
00:13:48,00:13:50,"that you can't see as humans,"
00:13:50,00:13:52,but bees presumably can't see
00:13:52,00:13:55,because they point towards the centre of the plant.
00:13:55,00:13:57,"So they're pointing the bee to the centre of the plant,"
00:13:57,00:14:00,"but if you or I were to look at it, we would never see those arrows."
00:14:00,00:14:01,- Okay.
00:14:01,00:14:02,- But we would see it as a different colour.
00:14:02,00:14:03,We wouldn't see it as nothing.
00:14:03,00:14:04,"- Yes, exactly."
00:14:04,00:14:05,- It would be invisible.
00:14:05,00:14:07,- You look bees aren't the only things that make honey.
00:14:07,00:14:08,I did not know this.
00:14:08,00:14:09,- Really?
00:14:09,00:14:10,- Wops.
00:14:10,00:14:12,- Wops make honey.
00:14:12,00:14:13,- Do they?
00:14:13,00:14:14,- Yeah.
00:14:14,00:14:16,- There's a particular species of it called
00:14:16,00:14:18,the brachigastra mellificator.
00:14:18,00:14:21,"And apparently you can even eat that wasps honey,"
00:14:21,00:14:26,but I don't think it's found because it's quite hard to breed wasps.
00:14:26,00:14:27,- I don't know why it's not found.
00:14:27,00:14:29,- A single pound of clover honey
00:14:29,00:14:34,requires 8.7 million flowers to be manufactured.
00:14:34,00:14:38,8.7 million flowers for one pound of clover honey.
00:14:38,00:14:40,"- Oh my god, I go through so much honey."
00:14:40,00:14:41,- That's terrible.
00:14:41,00:14:44,"- I mean, the flowers can do multiple pollinations."
00:14:44,00:14:45,It's all right?
00:14:45,00:14:46,- Okay.
00:14:46,00:14:47,- Have you guys heard about
00:14:47,00:14:50,and I only realised as we were about start recording
00:14:50,00:14:52,that actually this article's from 2015.
00:14:52,00:14:54,So potentially this already now exists.
00:14:54,00:14:57,But the highway for bees in Norway?
00:14:57,00:14:58,- No.
00:14:58,00:15:02,"- In Oslo and Norway, they want to make life better for bees basically"
00:15:02,00:15:04,and they have a lot of green spaces.
00:15:04,00:15:07,And the idea is that they want to create networks
00:15:07,00:15:10,so that the bees can go between the green spaces
00:15:10,00:15:13,through sort of like alleyways that are created in buildings
00:15:13,00:15:15,and between buildings and so on.
00:15:15,00:15:16,- In buildings?
00:15:16,00:15:18,"- Yeah, so like literally tunnels inside."
00:15:18,00:15:20,"- Yeah, like trying to get in the left."
00:15:20,00:15:21,"- Well, no, imagine in this room."
00:15:21,00:15:22,- Yeah.
00:15:22,00:15:25,- You have their own-- - Get the next lift.
00:15:25,00:15:27,"- Yeah, they just, it's like tunnels and so on"
00:15:27,00:15:29,and the bees can travel and find their way
00:15:29,00:15:31,to the next green place that they're going to.
00:15:31,00:15:33,- I think it might be that.
00:15:33,00:15:36,But I thought it would be like rooftop gardens and stuff
00:15:36,00:15:38,rather than actually inside the buildings.
00:15:38,00:15:39,"- Yeah, I probably made that up."
00:15:39,00:15:41,- They put signposts on rooftops saying
00:15:41,00:15:43,bees you're allowed to fly over.
00:15:43,00:15:45,- What they do is that bees are in one place.
00:15:45,00:15:46,They might want to go to another place
00:15:46,00:15:48,and they just make sure there's a corridor
00:15:48,00:15:50,of green spaces where they can go.
00:15:50,00:15:52,- So they put green on the rooftops?
00:15:52,00:15:53,- Yeah.
00:15:53,00:15:54,- And flowers that they like and things like this.
00:15:54,00:15:55,"- Yeah, lovely."
00:15:55,00:15:56,- Because you can make your garden really be friendly.
00:15:56,00:15:58,They're all these specific flowers that you can grow
00:15:58,00:15:59,and you guarantee bees.
00:15:59,00:16:02,- And London is basically covered in bees.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"- Yeah, it's true."
00:16:04,00:16:05,- Basically.
00:16:05,00:16:06,- Yeah.
00:16:06,00:16:08,- When you say basically you mean knots.
00:16:08,00:16:09,- So many rooftops.
00:16:09,00:16:11,- Do you mean the hips to be hives in shortage?
00:16:11,00:16:14,"- No, I mean the Royal Festival Hall has a bee hive on top of it."
00:16:14,00:16:16,Harrods has a bee hive on top of it.
00:16:16,00:16:18,And there's one specific London beekeeper
00:16:18,00:16:20,who goes to all of these different places.
00:16:20,00:16:21,"- And is he, does he do parkour?"
00:16:21,00:16:24,- Do you just jump from one to the other?
00:16:24,00:16:26,- But it is a problem because it's really fashionable
00:16:26,00:16:28,to have a bee hive and it's really cool.
00:16:28,00:16:30,But what they haven't done is planted 8.7 million flowers.
00:16:30,00:16:32,So you get exhausted bee hives
00:16:32,00:16:36,and they haven't got enough flowers and plants to pollinate.
00:16:36,00:16:38,So what you should actually do is plant a wild flower meadow
00:16:38,00:16:40,because that's not as sexy as getting a load of bees
00:16:40,00:16:41,off the internet.
00:16:41,00:16:42,- That's true.
00:16:42,00:16:43,"- If you do have a garden,"
00:16:43,00:16:44,"but not many people do have gardens in London,"
00:16:44,00:16:45,"but if you do have them,"
00:16:45,00:16:46,"you should plant lots of flowers, shouldn't you?"
00:16:46,00:16:47,- Yeah.
00:16:47,00:16:50,- Did you know there's such a thing as a bee beautician?
00:16:50,00:16:51,- No.
00:16:51,00:16:52,- A bee beautician.
00:16:52,00:16:53,Yeah.
00:16:53,00:16:56,"So her job is to brush bees hair,"
00:16:56,00:16:57,to wash them with shampoo.
00:16:57,00:17:00,"So bees are, when specimens are collected,"
00:17:00,00:17:01,then they're preserved in ethanol
00:17:01,00:17:03,and that makes them kind of soggy and slimy.
00:17:03,00:17:05,And she has to prepare them to be fit for display.
00:17:05,00:17:08,"So she's got, she's concocted special bee shampoo"
00:17:08,00:17:10,and then she dunks it in the bee shampoo
00:17:10,00:17:11,and then she hangs it out.
00:17:11,00:17:13,"So she inserts a tiny, tiny pin,"
00:17:13,00:17:15,"I think, at the hinge of one of its legs."
00:17:15,00:17:17,And then she's created a blow dryer for bees.
00:17:17,00:17:18,- Of course.
00:17:18,00:17:19,- No.
00:17:19,00:17:21,"- Yeah, so she at first tried actual blow dryers,"
00:17:21,00:17:23,but she found that they were too violent.
00:17:23,00:17:24,So it used to be...
00:17:24,00:17:25,- She's gone.
00:17:25,00:17:27,- She's just got the little legs left in the clamp
00:17:27,00:17:28,and the rest of the bee.
00:17:28,00:17:34,- She does say so it used to blow their limbs off
00:17:34,00:17:36,"and then she'd have to glue the limbs back on,"
00:17:36,00:17:37,which is the whole other thing.
00:17:37,00:17:38,- Glue the limbs back on.
00:17:38,00:17:40,"- Yeah, but she did say something interesting about bees,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,which is that they have lots of split ends.
00:17:42,00:17:44,"And so that's why she has to use a special shampoo,"
00:17:44,00:17:47,it's because they get very clumpy and frizzy when they get wet.
00:17:47,00:17:48,- What is this shampoo?
00:17:48,00:17:55,- It's a mixture of water and sodium bicarbonate or something.
00:17:55,00:17:56,- Okay.
00:17:56,00:17:57,"- But wasps don't have split ends,"
00:17:57,00:18:01,"so if you don't want frizzy hair, be a wasp."
00:18:01,00:18:03,"- It's a bit late for me, really."
00:18:03,00:18:11,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:18:11,00:18:14,and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:18:14,00:18:16,- My fact is that running a leaf blower for 30 minutes
00:18:16,00:18:20,creates more emissions than driving a pickup truck
00:18:20,00:18:22,"3,800 miles."
00:18:22,00:18:23,- No way.
00:18:23,00:18:24,- That is incredible.
00:18:24,00:18:26,"- It does sound unbelievably untrue, doesn't it?"
00:18:26,00:18:27,- Yeah.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"- I'm following the words of James Fallow,"
00:18:29,00:18:31,"who's a correspondent at the Atlantic,"
00:18:31,00:18:33,which is a very reputable magazine.
00:18:33,00:18:36,And he has a campaign against these things.
00:18:36,00:18:38,"Well, I guess if you were pro,"
00:18:38,00:18:40,then you wouldn't work out the emissions.
00:18:40,00:18:44,"What he says is that about a third of the petrol they use,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,"because they use petrol gas in America,"
00:18:46,00:18:49,is vomited out in aerosol form.
00:18:49,00:18:52,And that gets mixed in with tiny particles of oil
00:18:52,00:18:54,"in the exhaust, in the droplets."
00:18:54,00:18:56,So he has calculated that.
00:18:56,00:18:58,Which if true means that you could drive from Coven Garden
00:18:58,00:18:59,to Jerusalem.
00:18:59,00:19:00,- Wow.
00:19:00,00:19:03,"- I think they compared it to a particular type of pickup, didn't they?"
00:19:03,00:19:04,"- Sorry, yeah, F-150."
00:19:04,00:19:06,Maybe it's an unbelievably clean.
00:19:06,00:19:07,- I think it is.
00:19:07,00:19:09,- I think it is an extremely efficient one.
00:19:09,00:19:11,But it's still good.
00:19:11,00:19:12,"I mean, it's still amazing."
00:19:12,00:19:13,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:13,00:19:15,I thought the F-150 was a model of Cassiot watch.
00:19:15,00:19:16,Is it not?
00:19:16,00:19:17,- That's the F-91W.
00:19:17,00:19:18,- Great.
00:19:18,00:19:19,- Anyway.
00:19:19,00:19:20,- So is he suggesting we all try and clear our leaves
00:19:20,00:19:21,with pickup trucks?
00:19:21,00:19:23,Because I think it's gonna be harder.
00:19:23,00:19:26,"- If you use the F-150 and you can blow it in the right way,"
00:19:26,00:19:29,I guess you could save technically on emissions?
00:19:29,00:19:30,- You could.
00:19:30,00:19:32,- The exhaust pipe pointed the right direction.
00:19:32,00:19:34,- Imagine trying to drive a B with the leaf plug.
00:19:34,00:19:36,(laughing)
00:19:36,00:19:38,It will legs everywhere.
00:19:38,00:19:41,"- Yeah, so I mean, people really hate these things."
00:19:41,00:19:42,"- Yeah, the horrible."
00:19:42,00:19:44,I think they make the most disgusting noise
00:19:44,00:19:45,and they should all be banned.
00:19:45,00:19:46,I genuinely do think that.
00:19:46,00:19:48,"- They're very, very, very loud."
00:19:48,00:19:49,- And I think they're unnecessary.
00:19:49,00:19:50,"Just rake your bloody garden, guys."
00:19:50,00:19:53,"- That must be easier to blow it than rake it, though."
00:19:53,00:19:56,"- Also, you're blowing it into someone else's spot, aren't you?"
00:19:56,00:19:58,Or do you blow it into a pile?
00:19:58,00:19:59,- I think you blow it into a pile.
00:19:59,00:20:01,"- Blowing it into a pile, okay."
00:20:01,00:20:03,- I've got leaves all over my bloody garden at the moment.
00:20:03,00:20:04,I would kill for a blower.
00:20:04,00:20:06,- Your garden's small.
00:20:06,00:20:08,- I don't need to be rude.
00:20:08,00:20:09,(laughing)
00:20:09,00:20:11,"- Well, that is quite rude."
00:20:11,00:20:13,"- All I'm saying is, it's evidently rakeable."
00:20:13,00:20:16,You couldn't pick up truck in your garden.
00:20:16,00:20:18,"- I think, kill for a blower."
00:20:18,00:20:21,It was the most rude thing in that sentence by a long mile.
00:20:21,00:20:24,(laughing)
00:20:24,00:20:25,- Oh dear.
00:20:25,00:20:27,"- Yeah, but I can see that they are."
00:20:27,00:20:28,I think my neighbours have got one.
00:20:28,00:20:29,They are pretty loud.
00:20:29,00:20:31,"- If your neighbours have got one,"
00:20:31,00:20:32,you will definitely know about it.
00:20:32,00:20:34,"- Well, there is a big loud noise coming from my neighbours"
00:20:34,00:20:36,every now and then in the autumn.
00:20:36,00:20:37,(laughing)
00:20:37,00:20:38,- That's what it is.
00:20:38,00:20:39,You don't want to pry.
00:20:39,00:20:40,"- Well, it could be that."
00:20:40,00:20:42,It sounds a bit like an aeroplane taking off.
00:20:42,00:20:43,Is that what they sound like?
00:20:43,00:20:44,"- Yeah, they do."
00:20:44,00:20:46,- Unless do they have an airstrip in their garden?
00:20:46,00:20:47,"- Well, they're going to be."
00:20:47,00:20:50,(laughing)
00:20:50,00:20:54,- Oh dear.
00:20:54,00:20:58,"In California, there are 20 cities that have banned us."
00:20:58,00:20:59,- Wow.
00:20:59,00:21:01,"- Yeah, I was reading an article by the Kendall family,"
00:21:01,00:21:05,"who are from California, are in a state where they want to get it banned."
00:21:05,00:21:07,"And they're pointing out that the reason it's so annoying,"
00:21:07,00:21:09,"and this definitely does ring true,"
00:21:09,00:21:10,"is that compared to a lawnmower,"
00:21:10,00:21:11,"which can be as loud,"
00:21:11,00:21:13,but operates at the same kind of frequency
00:21:13,00:21:14,"and volume the whole time,"
00:21:14,00:21:17,"leaf blow is really go up and down, don't they?"
00:21:17,00:21:18,So you can't predict it.
00:21:18,00:21:21,So you're constantly being shocked by its volume increases
00:21:21,00:21:22,and decreases.
00:21:22,00:21:23,- That's very interesting.
00:21:23,00:21:24,- That's what stresses you out.
00:21:24,00:21:26,"- How long have we had leaf blowers, by the way?"
00:21:26,00:21:27,Does anyone know?
00:21:27,00:21:28,Since about the 50s or 60s?
00:21:28,00:21:29,"- Yeah, 50s."
00:21:29,00:21:32,"Except in Japan, in 19th century,"
00:21:32,00:21:35,they used like bellows that used for a fire as leaf blowers.
00:21:35,00:21:36,"- Oh, they."
00:21:36,00:21:39,"- Yeah, I haven't seen a photo of the bellows."
00:21:39,00:21:40,"I tried to find one,"
00:21:40,00:21:43,and I couldn't find a picture of Japanese ancient leaf blowing bellows.
00:21:43,00:21:45,"- No, but there is an early book."
00:21:45,00:21:47,But the 1950s reference is weird.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"If anyone can tell us if this is true,"
00:21:49,00:21:52,"Wikipedia claims, and this is from a book called,"
00:21:52,00:21:54,"""Everything you ever needed to know about leaf blowers."""
00:21:54,00:21:56,So you would have thought this would be the authority on it.
00:21:56,00:22:00,"But this claims it was invented by a guy called Dom Quinto,"
00:22:00,00:22:03,who originally designed it in the 1950s as an agricultural sprayer.
00:22:03,00:22:06,But people were taking out the spraying device
00:22:06,00:22:08,and just using it to blow their leaves on it.
00:22:08,00:22:10,But there's no evidence aside from this book
00:22:10,00:22:12,that this Dom Quinto chap ever existed.
00:22:12,00:22:15,"So if you are him, always offspring, get in touch."
00:22:15,00:22:17,- Do you know who invented the rake?
00:22:17,00:22:18,- No.
00:22:18,00:22:20,- Is it Mike Rake?
00:22:20,00:22:23,"No, it's not Mike Rake."
00:22:23,00:22:25,"I mean, these are always a bit dubious, aren't they?"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"But apparently the steel rake,"
00:22:27,00:22:29,"which is kind of a bit springy,"
00:22:29,00:22:32,"and the modern day one that's good for raking stuff with,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,"was invented by a guy called Chester Greenwood,"
00:22:34,00:22:37,who also supposedly invented earmuffs.
00:22:37,00:22:38,- Really?
00:22:38,00:22:39,- Apparently.
00:22:39,00:22:40,- Wow.
00:22:40,00:22:42,- And he's quite famous in North America in Maine
00:22:42,00:22:44,that there's a certain town where every year
00:22:44,00:22:47,they have a celebration of his inventing.
00:22:47,00:22:48,- What are they doing?
00:22:48,00:22:50,They've put a load of earmuffs to go on raking stuff out.
00:22:50,00:22:51,- Yeah.
00:22:51,00:22:53,- To drown out the noise of the leaf blowers.
00:22:53,00:22:55,- They're trying to protest against.
00:22:55,00:22:56,"- They kind of do that, I think."
00:22:56,00:22:58,They kind of wear earmuffs.
00:22:58,00:23:00,They have an earmuff parade and stuff.
00:23:00,00:23:01,- They have a parade!
00:23:01,00:23:04,- I think they don't really bother about the rake part
00:23:04,00:23:05,of it that much.
00:23:05,00:23:06,They're more bothered about the earmuffs
00:23:06,00:23:08,because he was quite young when he invented them.
00:23:08,00:23:10,He was like 16 or 17 or so.
00:23:10,00:23:12,- I thought it was 13.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"- 13, yeah, it could be."
00:23:14,00:23:17,"- Maine sounds like a very exciting place to live, doesn't it?"
00:23:17,00:23:18,That's their highlight of the year.
00:23:18,00:23:21,"- Well, the thing is, it's cold and they have a lot of trees."
00:23:21,00:23:23,So earmuffs and rakes are the kind of things you might invent
00:23:23,00:23:24,if you live there.
00:23:24,00:23:26,- And they have every major horror story
00:23:26,00:23:28,"that we know of in popular culture,"
00:23:28,00:23:30,"set there through Stephen King,"
00:23:30,00:23:31,"because he lives in Bangor, Maine."
00:23:31,00:23:33,"So it, the clown, is from Maine and..."
00:23:33,00:23:36,"- Okay, you can't credit an entire state for one person"
00:23:36,00:23:37,that it's produced.
00:23:37,00:23:39,(laughter)
00:23:39,00:23:41,"- I know, but well done, Maine."
00:23:41,00:23:43,"- There is a cool thing you can do with leaf blowers,"
00:23:43,00:23:44,which is turn them into a hovercraft.
00:23:44,00:23:45,- Can you?
00:23:45,00:23:46,- Yeah.
00:23:46,00:23:48,There's a very cool video online of a Texan man
00:23:48,00:23:49,called Ryan Craven.
00:23:49,00:23:52,So shout out to Texas who created Ryan Craven.
00:23:52,00:23:53,(laughter)
00:23:53,00:23:57,Who sort of four of them together into a kind of platform
00:23:57,00:23:58,and he puts the skateboard across the platform.
00:23:58,00:24:00,"And it hovers very, very low off the ground,"
00:24:00,00:24:01,but it does hover.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"- You know, on Fallen Leaves,"
00:24:03,00:24:06,I was actually looking at this for cause in the TV show
00:24:06,00:24:08,"we did this week, no such things in news."
00:24:08,00:24:09,We were talking about Chernobyl.
00:24:09,00:24:11,- Is that still available on iPlayer?
00:24:11,00:24:12,"- I think it might be, yeah."
00:24:12,00:24:14,"And actually, if you're international, it's on YouTube."
00:24:14,00:24:15,- That's it.
00:24:15,00:24:16,"- But that's besides the point, Jay."
00:24:16,00:24:17,"- Jay, how would you find that?"
00:24:17,00:24:19,- You go to Know Such Things The News.com.
00:24:19,00:24:20,- Thanks for asking.
00:24:20,00:24:21,- Yeah.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"Anyway, we recorded a TV show this week."
00:24:23,00:24:24,And we mentioned Chernobyl.
00:24:24,00:24:26,(laughter)
00:24:26,00:24:28,And Leaves in Chernobyl don't decompose
00:24:28,00:24:30,because the radioactivity means that the bacteria
00:24:30,00:24:32,"are no longer there, can no longer survive."
00:24:32,00:24:34,So they can't decompose the leaves.
00:24:34,00:24:37,"And so there are, you know, that it's missing this fungus"
00:24:37,00:24:40,and the worms and the microbes and stuff like that.
00:24:40,00:24:43,And so it's just building up this huge floor of dead leaves.
00:24:43,00:24:45,"And at the moment, if a forest fire started,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,"which can't happen, it's that in temperatures,"
00:24:47,00:24:50,"it would be a complete disaster with spread radiation,"
00:24:50,00:24:53,"much, much further and wider than it is already,"
00:24:53,00:24:55,because it would just catch fire to all these dry dead leaves
00:24:55,00:24:56,out on the ground.
00:24:56,00:25:00,"- That's like in Australia, a sort of Aussie non-nuclear version"
00:25:00,00:25:02,"of that is the eucalyptus tree,"
00:25:02,00:25:06,"because their leaves, when they drop off the tree,"
00:25:06,00:25:09,they have a kind of sort of what's called like a toxic name palm
00:25:09,00:25:12,thing about them in that they're too hard to break down
00:25:12,00:25:14,for all the insects and animals.
00:25:14,00:25:16,"They sit there, dry as hell."
00:25:16,00:25:20,"And if a forest fire starts and it hits a eucalyptus patch,"
00:25:20,00:25:22,"that will just go massively up in flame,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,just sitting there waiting to be caught on fire.
00:25:24,00:25:26,- And this must be because a eucalyptus tree
00:25:26,00:25:28,"is one of the trees that love being set on fire,"
00:25:28,00:25:29,because how they spread their seeds.
00:25:29,00:25:31,"- Yes, they love to be set on fire."
00:25:31,00:25:33,They sort of have an inner tree waiting
00:25:33,00:25:35,to break out of the bigger tree.
00:25:35,00:25:38,And forest fires is what brings that to happen.
00:25:38,00:25:41,- I think they're pretty much ambivalent about the whole thing.
00:25:41,00:25:43,- Do you think they don't even know their trees?
00:25:43,00:25:47,"- In 2011, someone patented a glove rake,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,which is really cool.
00:25:49,00:25:51,"It's a normal glove, except it's got these five long,"
00:25:51,00:25:52,"you look a bit like him with scissors hands,"
00:25:52,00:25:54,except we were able to break hands.
00:25:54,00:25:56,And you could just go around breaking stuff up
00:25:56,00:25:57,with your bare hands.
00:25:57,00:25:58,- You have to be on your hands and knees.
00:25:58,00:25:59,- You would have to be on your hands and knees.
00:25:59,00:26:00,- That's not going to be nice.
00:26:00,00:26:02,"I mean, because it's the middle of autumn."
00:26:02,00:26:03,It's going to be damp.
00:26:03,00:26:04,"- Edward rake hands, by the way,"
00:26:04,00:26:05,would have been really useful in that scene
00:26:05,00:26:07,where Edward Scissor-Hands cuts all the hedges.
00:26:07,00:26:09,(laughing)
00:26:09,00:26:11,He could have been on the side cleaning up.
00:26:11,00:26:12,"- Yeah, there's a lot."
00:26:12,00:26:14,"Edward, been back hands comes along."
00:26:14,00:26:16,(laughing)
00:26:16,00:26:18,"Guys, why are we all called Edward?"
00:26:18,00:26:20,(laughing)
00:26:20,00:26:21,- We're not related.
00:26:21,00:26:22,We've got different surnames.
00:26:22,00:26:24,(laughing)
00:26:24,00:26:26,- They've all got the surnames.
00:26:26,00:26:27,- Hands.
00:26:27,00:26:29,"- Wait, is it a double barrel surname?"
00:26:29,00:26:32,"- Yeah, so what are the married Mrs. Scissor?"
00:26:32,00:26:34,One of the married Mrs. Rake.
00:26:34,00:26:36,- I've never noticed before the moment
00:26:36,00:26:38,where we come up with a title of an episode.
00:26:38,00:26:41,"I think no such thing as Edward, been back hands."
00:26:41,00:26:43,(laughing)
00:26:43,00:26:50,"Okay, it is time to move on to our final fact of the show"
00:26:50,00:26:52,and that is Chuzinsky.
00:26:52,00:26:56,"- Yes, my fact is that early humans had spiky penises."
00:26:56,00:26:58,(laughing)
00:26:58,00:26:59,- That is insane.
00:26:59,00:27:00,How early?
00:27:00,00:27:01,- I actually couldn't believe it.
00:27:01,00:27:02,Just a couple of weeks ago.
00:27:02,00:27:03,- 6.30 this month.
00:27:03,00:27:05,(laughing)
00:27:05,00:27:09,"- No, this was a study on human genes that was done in 2011"
00:27:09,00:27:12,"and it found that about 700,000 years ago,"
00:27:12,00:27:16,so before our common ancestors split into modern humans
00:27:16,00:27:18,"and the Andethals, then we have the gene"
00:27:18,00:27:20,that carries penis spines.
00:27:20,00:27:22,And then that gene seems to have been deleted
00:27:22,00:27:25,when we evolved into modern humans today.
00:27:25,00:27:28,"But lots of other, like almost all other primates"
00:27:28,00:27:29,still have penis spines.
00:27:29,00:27:30,- Too bad.
00:27:30,00:27:32,"- Yeah, they do except for spider monkeys, I think,"
00:27:32,00:27:34,all primates have penis spines.
00:27:34,00:27:37,And what do the spines feel like as in...
00:27:37,00:27:39,(laughing)
00:27:39,00:27:43,"If I gripped a chimped penis, would I be arrested?"
00:27:43,00:27:44,"- Be arrested, yeah."
00:27:44,00:27:45,(laughing)
00:27:45,00:27:46,- Would I cut my hands?
00:27:46,00:27:48,Would the palms of my hands be sliced?
00:27:48,00:27:50,- The ones on primates I think are more bumpy.
00:27:50,00:27:53,"Some are not really spiky spines, like cats, I think, too."
00:27:53,00:27:55,But I think they're more like lumps.
00:27:55,00:27:56,I've slightly blunt spiked.
00:27:56,00:27:58,"- You've never seen the film with Tisopee in this, have you?"
00:27:58,00:28:00,(laughing)
00:28:02,00:28:06,"- So just to go into quickly, the reason that we might well,"
00:28:06,00:28:08,that men might have had spiky penises in the past.
00:28:08,00:28:10,We're not totally sure about it.
00:28:10,00:28:14,But we think it might be because what it can do is
00:28:14,00:28:19,it can help clear out rival sperm from a female vagina.
00:28:19,00:28:22,"So if you get the spikes in, then as it's sort of retracting,"
00:28:22,00:28:24,they scrape the edge of a vagina
00:28:24,00:28:26,and they'll bring out any sperm that's been left in there
00:28:26,00:28:27,by someone else.
00:28:27,00:28:29,And they can break through a little sperm sack
00:28:29,00:28:31,and break it open to make the sperm.
00:28:31,00:28:32,"- No animals, isn't it?"
00:28:32,00:28:36,I think dragonflies have like spayed shaped penises
00:28:36,00:28:37,that they do with that.
00:28:37,00:28:40,- It must be really hard to study the evolution
00:28:40,00:28:44,of human penises because the lack of bone means that
00:28:44,00:28:47,"how can you, how can you, you just, there's nothing."
00:28:47,00:28:49,"- So erotic, all bones, no bone."
00:28:49,00:28:50,- All bone and bone.
00:28:50,00:28:51,- All bone and bone.
00:28:51,00:28:52,(laughing)
00:28:52,00:28:54,- That's what you said that a few times.
00:28:54,00:28:55,(laughing)
00:28:55,00:28:58,- I've gotta change my strapline on a lot of dating sites.
00:28:58,00:29:01,(laughing)
00:29:01,00:29:03,- We might have had a bone.
00:29:03,00:29:06,"I must stop saying we, in reference to our penises,"
00:29:06,00:29:07,then might have had a bone.
00:29:07,00:29:10,"We don't know, but other primates do have a penile bone,"
00:29:10,00:29:11,"I think, don't they?"
00:29:11,00:29:13,And it has a lot of advantages having a bone there
00:29:13,00:29:15,because it means you can push it out much quicker
00:29:15,00:29:17,than having to wait for the blood to engorge it.
00:29:17,00:29:18,(laughing)
00:29:18,00:29:20,Just flip right out and it can stay out for longer.
00:29:20,00:29:24,And I think Richard Dawkins is one.
00:29:24,00:29:27,(laughing)
00:29:27,00:29:30,"- Richard Dawkins, in the selfish gene,"
00:29:30,00:29:33,wrote that the advantage of humans not having this
00:29:33,00:29:37,is that having to get blood flowing in there
00:29:37,00:29:39,"shows that you've got like a healthy blood flow,"
00:29:39,00:29:41,"shows is kind of a sign of good health,"
00:29:41,00:29:43,so women are more attracted to it.
00:29:43,00:29:45,So that might be why we've a men of evolved.
00:29:45,00:29:46,- Okay.
00:29:46,00:29:47,"- Penises without the bone,"
00:29:47,00:29:48,because it's harder to get it blown up.
00:29:48,00:29:51,"- I've heard so, in place of the bone,"
00:29:51,00:29:54,"there is a new thing that they're testing out,"
00:29:54,00:29:55,which is a metal rod.
00:29:55,00:29:58,So some men could now have a metal rod inside their penis.
00:29:58,00:29:59,"And the idea is for,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,"it's done, do you remember where it's done, Andy?"
00:30:01,00:30:02,- In hospitals mostly.
00:30:02,00:30:05,(laughing)
00:30:05,00:30:06,"- If it's big off with you and about,"
00:30:06,00:30:07,you should be very careful.
00:30:07,00:30:08,(laughing)
00:30:08,00:30:10,- So the idea is that this is for people
00:30:10,00:30:11,suffering from erectile dysfunction
00:30:11,00:30:13,"and if they've gone through various courses,"
00:30:13,00:30:16,they're gonna then say on health services
00:30:16,00:30:18,or whatever they will say you can have this.
00:30:18,00:30:20,"And the idea is that it's a little metal rod inside,"
00:30:20,00:30:22,"but when you want an erection,"
00:30:22,00:30:24,you can press a button like a remote control
00:30:24,00:30:26,and it pre-heats this metal bar
00:30:26,00:30:29,to a heat point where it expands within you.
00:30:29,00:30:31,"- Yo, I'm never gonna get on a flight, are you?"
00:30:31,00:30:34,(laughing)
00:30:34,00:30:36,"- I mean, that's just not,"
00:30:36,00:30:38,"it's just not gonna happen, you know?"
00:30:38,00:30:41,"Every single time you're gonna set it off,"
00:30:41,00:30:42,they're gonna get that paddle thing.
00:30:42,00:30:44,"You're gonna go up and down your body,"
00:30:44,00:30:46,you can get to the rod.
00:30:46,00:30:47,- Yeah.
00:30:47,00:30:48,"- What, and you think you just go,"
00:30:48,00:30:49,"never mind, I'm going home, doesn't matter."
00:30:49,00:30:50,"- I think that would happen, yeah."
00:30:50,00:30:51,- Yeah.
00:30:51,00:30:52,- The other thing is you can get a bit of cartilage
00:30:52,00:30:53,"but if you have erectile problems,"
00:30:53,00:30:55,and then you have to just kind of maneuver
00:30:55,00:30:56,the penis into position.
00:30:56,00:30:58,So it's kind of permanently erect from that point.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"That's in Mary Roach's book, ""Bonk,"""
00:31:00,00:31:02,"which is about science and sex,"
00:31:02,00:31:03,and it's an amazing book.
00:31:03,00:31:05,"- Oh, it's incredible book, yeah."
00:31:05,00:31:08,- So this is partly about how males
00:31:08,00:31:11,"of various species manage to get rid of competition,"
00:31:11,00:31:14,"'cause the spines are often used to scrape,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,to scrape out the sperm out of the vagina.
00:31:16,00:31:17,- Yeah.
00:31:17,00:31:18,- And so I was looking at other ways
00:31:18,00:31:19,that you get rid of the competition.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"And one is that, in mice, sperm club together"
00:31:22,00:31:25,as a group to beat rival sperm.
00:31:25,00:31:26,- It's exactly like--
00:31:26,00:31:27,- Like where I saw it.
00:31:27,00:31:28,- What?
00:31:28,00:31:30,(laughing)
00:31:30,00:31:31,- Yeah.
00:31:31,00:31:32,- The jets of the sperm?
00:31:32,00:31:35,(laughing)
00:31:35,00:31:36,"- It's exactly like in a cycling race,"
00:31:36,00:31:38,"which James will know more about,"
00:31:38,00:31:40,"where they move faster if they move as a group,"
00:31:40,00:31:42,so they can tell if they're the sperm
00:31:42,00:31:43,"that belong to the same person,"
00:31:43,00:31:45,"and all the sperm that belong to that person get together,"
00:31:45,00:31:47,and all the sperm that belong to another person get together.
00:31:47,00:31:49,This is in these mice inside this female mouse.
00:31:49,00:31:50,- Yeah.
00:31:50,00:31:52,"- And so they, as a group, they move much faster"
00:31:52,00:31:53,than they do individually.
00:31:53,00:31:54,What's that called?
00:31:54,00:31:55,It's like the--
00:31:55,00:31:57,"- Peloton, peloton effect."
00:31:57,00:31:58,- It's a peloton.
00:31:58,00:31:59,It's the peloton of sperm.
00:31:59,00:32:00,"And then when they get near the finish line,"
00:32:00,00:32:01,suddenly they all start to beat them away.
00:32:01,00:32:02,- Someone breaks away.
00:32:02,00:32:03,- Yeah.
00:32:03,00:32:04,- And then the muck haven't dish sperm wins.
00:32:04,00:32:05,- Exactly.
00:32:05,00:32:06,- Yeah.
00:32:06,00:32:07,- So they're just programmed.
00:32:07,00:32:09,It'll be smell or--
00:32:09,00:32:10,"- No, what is it?"
00:32:10,00:32:11,What is it?
00:32:11,00:32:12,How do they know this?
00:32:12,00:32:13,- How can they grow together?
00:32:13,00:32:14,- How can they grow together?
00:32:14,00:32:17,"- Well, cells can be programmed to do things."
00:32:17,00:32:18,So I imagine it must be that.
00:32:18,00:32:20,It's inside the DNA of the cell.
00:32:20,00:32:23,That has instructions of what it should do.
00:32:23,00:32:25,It makes the tails wag.
00:32:25,00:32:26,- Yeah.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"- And also, if they have their specific rendition"
00:32:28,00:32:30,"of ""Keep Cool"" from my site's story,"
00:32:30,00:32:31,then they can tell.
00:32:31,00:32:34,- Which is the best song to sing for a sperm.
00:32:34,00:32:37,Because you do need to keep lower than the ambient temperature of the body.
00:32:37,00:32:40,"- Yeah, it's weird that they want the lyrics in the original website."
00:32:40,00:32:47,(laughter)
00:32:47,00:32:48,"- Okay, that is it."
00:32:48,00:32:49,"And as all of our facts,"
