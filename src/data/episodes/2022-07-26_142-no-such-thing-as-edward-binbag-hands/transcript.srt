 - [ you can hear the music ]

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 - [ you can hear the music ]

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 - [ you can hear the music ]

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 - [ you can hear the music ]

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 [ you can hear the music ]

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 [ you can hear the music ]

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with James Harkin,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I am Richard Zinsky, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 My fact this week is that the White House's Oval Office

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 is a giant weighing scale.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 - What do they use it for normally?

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 - Wailing the President.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 - No, to see how heavy he is.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 - No, it's not.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 - So are you waving? - Yeah, that's what I thought.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 - Yeah, it's to see that he's there full stop.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 So the secret service need a monitor

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 where the President is at all times.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 However, they're not allowed into the Oval Office.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 He doesn't want them in there, so they have to stand outside.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Now, when the doors open, they can see where he is,

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 but when the door is shut, they can't see where the President is.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 So if you look at pictures of the Oval Office,

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 there is a giant oval carpet that literally spans the entire office room

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 except for a few inches to the wall.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And underneath it are weighing pads that are connected to a line

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 that goes outside.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 So the secret service can see where he is in the Oval Office

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 purely by where he's standing.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 - I think I would get a load of objects

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 that weighed exactly the same as me

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 and just keep moving them around the office

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 just to blind up the secret service.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 - Like Indiana Jones at the beginning of the first film.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 - Yeah.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 - But it's kind of like, if you've seen Harry Potter,

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 the Marauder's Map, where they just follow the footsteps on the map.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 That's what the secret service have to have.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 - Except it's not a Marauder's Map,

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 because the things are labeled as the President.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 It's just someone who weighs roughly the same amount as the President, right?

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 So it's definitely Obama's in the Oval Office,

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 or someone who is also human sized as in the Oval Office.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 - Yeah, or two people in the Oval Office.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 It's just way of making sure that no one kidnaps him through a window, maybe.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 - Well, they allowed him to the Oval Office.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 - I don't know, actually.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 This is a fact, which I haven't seen in many places.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 It's from Brad Meltzer, who is a best-selling novelist,

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 but also works at the White House and gives tours.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And he did a Huffington Post piece where he said,

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 "Here is secret service secrets."

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And that was the top one.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 - 'Cause he got lots of randomers into the Oval Office.

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I'd be a bit insulted as his secret service if I wasn't allowed in.

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 - Well, I think it's more, they're probably allowed in at some point.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I don't think it's like a total ban on secret service people.

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I think when he's working on a day-to-day basis,

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 he doesn't want secret service people.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 - Let's say they're doing something really important,

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 which is quite classified,

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 and only the people who need to know are in there,

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 so the other guys just stood outside, like playing cards or something.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 - Do you think if he puts on a bit of weight,

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 they start giving him a slide look?

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 - Right.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 - So, are you sure about that biscuit, Mr. President?

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 (laughing)

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 - This article by Brad Meltzer also mentions

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 that anytime we hear about the White House going under renovations

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 of an old room, it's actually that the secret service

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 are conducting an investigation,

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 and it's the only way of giving an excuse

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 to allow for the first family to be out of the White House

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 while renovations are going on,

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 but it actually means they're conducting an investigation.

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 - Is that right?

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 - This will always be that.

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 - No, no, but I think there's been a few cases.

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It's a sort of, like, inside knowledge thing

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 that if there's an investigation by the secret service,

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 they will say currently unobenerate.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 - What are they investigating?

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 - That needs the President to be away.

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 - It's hard to research them,

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 because they're quite open about some things,

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 but then other things are surprisingly secretive.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 - It is surprising, isn't it?

96
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 It's not that they would want to keep anything from us.

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 - It's controversial.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Are they telling the truth?

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Is the author telling the truth?

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 We know a bit too much about the secret service, it seems, recently.

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 - I thought it would just be called the service.

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 - Exactly, yeah, the open service.

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 - You know that we have a lot of presidents and leaders

104
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 who like exercise and like jogging.

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Obviously, when they go out on a jog,

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 they have to be accompanied by their little secret service cabal

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 who have to jog with them.

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 For instance, there was an article, I think this is in the Atlantic,

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 by someone who'd been in the secret service under Clinton,

110
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 and he said it was a complete nightmare,

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 because Clinton loved running,

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 and they even built him his own little running track

113
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 inside the White House grounds,

114
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 but he didn't like it, he liked to be out there with the people.

115
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Whenever Clinton went for a run,

116
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 a bunch of them all had to go for a run as well,

117
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 but not just for a run.

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 They had to go for a run carrying like all their guns and weapons,

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 and it'd be super alert,

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 and always be ready to attack someone

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 if they attacked the president.

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And so it sounds like absolutely hell.

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 - Imagine if Moll Farrah became president.

124
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 (laughing)

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 - Oh my gosh, who would you, that's true.

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 There are five people to qualify from being president,

127
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 and they're the five fastest people in the world,

128
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 because surely you need five people faster than the president.

129
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 - But Moll's not in the five fastest people in the world, is he?

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 - For running distances,

131
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 which is what Moll's was doing.

132
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 I mean, it's hardly, you say ball becomes president,

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 and you can only run 100 metres, 200 metres.

134
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 What trouble could he get in?

135
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 - But he won't be able to get away,

136
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 because at least the secret time is busing more people

137
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 to start running after the first 5,000 metres,

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 but no president Farrah has been running.

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 - So when president Farrah is running,

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 what they'll do is they'll all be running in like a relay,

141
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 and they pass the gun.

142
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 (laughing)

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 - Yeah, they do have to, it's quite funny,

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 when you look into sort of odd little things

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 that they have to prepare for in the safety of a president,

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 like Clinton going for his runs.

147
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So do you remember that famous incident

148
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 where George Bush swallowed a pretzel

149
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 and started choking on it?

150
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Apparently, that was a thing that they had to try and work out

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 how to avoid from ever happening again,

152
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 because-- - So did they all suck the pretzel?

153
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 So called the pretzel first.

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 - Exactly, what do you do in that situation?

155
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 So the only thing-- - The only thing--

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 - The only thing-- (laughing)

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 - The only thing that they could come up with

158
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 was a sort of emergency push button,

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 which I assumed he should have had anyway.

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 - Or the pretzel button.

161
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 - No, it's not exclusively for pretzel, if he's--

162
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 - It's a pretzel shake, I hope they made a pretzel shake.

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 (laughing)

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 - Some of the presidential secret service things,

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I read in one book called Personality Character

166
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 and Leadership in the White House.

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 I don't know if it's true.

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 That Gerald Ford, whenever he farted,

169
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 would blame the secret service who were around him.

170
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 (laughing)

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Oh, God, Jesus, guys, can you not keep a bit of the car room?

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 - That's amazing.

173
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 - Apparently, that's true.

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 - I guess that's true.

175
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 We spoke about this before on the podcast.

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 There was one president.

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I think it was Johnson, who would just,

178
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 if he was taking a piss, would just urinate

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 on the secret service member and say,

180
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 "I can do this, I'm the president."

181
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 - I think the story went, something like,

182
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 it was LBJ, wasn't it?

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And I think what happened was he went for a piss

184
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 on the side of the road when they were driving somewhere

185
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 and they kind of did like a human wall around him

186
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 and then there's like a gust of wind

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 and it blew the pee on to one of the guys,

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 and he said, "Excuse me, Mr. President, you're peeing on me."

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And he said, "Well, it's my prerogative to do that."

190
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I think that's what the story is anyway.

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 - Okay.

192
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 - Makes him slightly less unpleasant

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 than deliberately weeing on his...

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 - Yes, yes.

195
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 - Every time he needed to do a cool one of them into the office.

196
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 (laughing)

197
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 There was a assassination attempt that was made on Ronald Reagan

198
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 and it was made by John Hinckley, Jr.

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 and one of the secret service guys, a guy called Jerry Parr,

200
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 is the guy who got Ronald Reagan into the limousine

201
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 and got him off to...

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And notice that he blood was coming out of his mouth

203
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 and said, "We need to get to the hospital right now."

204
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So he said to have saved Ronald Reagan's life.

205
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Interestingly, he became a secret service officer

206
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 because he had watched a movie called Code of the Secret Service.

207
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Years before, which starred Ronald Reagan

208
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 as a secret service guy.

209
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 - No way!

210
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 - Yeah, so he ended up saving the life of the guy

211
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 who got him into it through...

212
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 - So Ronald Reagan saved his own life in a way.

213
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 - Exactly.

214
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 (laughing)

215
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 - Wow.

216
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 - That's incredible.

217
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 - Yes, really cool.

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 - That made a good movie in itself, wasn't it?

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

220
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 - Just one thing about the British secret services,

221
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 which I thought was interesting.

222
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 So during the Second World War,

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 they obviously requisitioned a load of, you know,

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 country houses and castles and things like that

225
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 and stately homes.

226
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And one place they had was in Scotland.

227
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It was called Invaler Lodge.

228
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And it was used for spies who weren't good enough to spy,

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 but had already learned too much secret information

230
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 to be allowed to leave.

231
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 (laughing)

232
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 - That way.

233
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 - Yeah, wow.

234
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 - And they had to stay there for the rest of the war.

235
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 - One of them, one unfortunate man who had signed up to spy,

236
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 he was refused to actually go and spy in the field

237
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 because apparently he was outstandingly ugly.

238
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 So there was a report which said he'd be recognized anywhere.

239
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Once he'd never forgotten.

240
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 He has no teeth at all, except two gold tusks and two incisors.

241
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 (laughing)

242
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Poor man.

243
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 - But they must have been as well.

244
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Like by the time they all left,

245
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 everyone would have known the secrets

246
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 that they were meant to be keeping as well.

247
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

248
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 - Have come here.

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Wow, I got told this thing about.

250
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 (laughing)

251
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 The one guy goes, "No!"

252
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 "Come on, Mike!"

253
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 (upbeat rock music)

254
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

255
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 - Okay, my fact this week is that because male bumblebees

256
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 rely on sight to find females,

257
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 they sometimes find themselves chasing after aeroplanes.

258
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 (laughing)

259
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 - So presumably their eyesight is not very good?

260
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 - Well, it's good for an insect.

261
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 (laughing)

262
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 But it's not good for like an eagle.

263
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 - Oh, okay.

264
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 - Okay.

265
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 - Bumblebees do have kind of good eyesight

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 as in they can see lots of colors.

267
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 - Yeah.

268
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 - People didn't realize they could see colors

269
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 and then Carl Frisch is a cold.

270
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 That guy who works out that they did the waggle dance,

271
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 he's quite famous scientist.

272
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 - Yeah, he got a Nobel Prize for that.

273
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 - Yeah, and he did an experiments where he proved

274
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 that they could see colors by getting loads of gray,

275
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 like gray card and then one colored card

276
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 and always put the food on the colored one

277
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 that could always tell where it was.

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 So they do have color sight.

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 - So are you saying we need to stop painting

280
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 our aeroplane Stripe Black and Yellow?

281
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 (laughing)

282
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 - Well, there is a Stripe Black and Yellow aeroplane

283
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 and it is the smallest airplane that has flown.

284
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 - Is it the size of a bee?

285
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 - It's called the Bumblebees a bit bigger.

286
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 It's eight foot ten inches in length

287
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 and the wingspan is five foot six

288
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 and it's tiny.

289
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 - It's so small.

290
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 - It's so small.

291
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 - Yeah.

292
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 It's a bike lane as well.

293
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 - Yeah.

294
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 - I mean, it does not look like it should get off the ground.

295
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 The wings are so small that you shouldn't think it has enough left.

296
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 - It looks like your car has just had some wings.

297
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And not even as big as your car

298
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 because it fits five people in a car.

299
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 - Here's my armspan.

300
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 It's six inches shorter than my armspan across the whole plane.

301
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 - And yes.

302
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 - The wingtip.

303
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 - Looking at that, despite the fact that that's Black and Yellow

304
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 and is the smallest plane, I still think B's are idiots.

305
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 They look at something that size.

306
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 I think it's genuinely a bee.

307
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 - Do they chase after the plane once it's in flight

308
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 or is there a lot of B's at Heathrow?

309
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 - It's in flight.

310
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 So I got this from a newsletter of the Bee Conservation Society.

311
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 It's all about how male bees find the queens.

312
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And there are different ways of doing it.

313
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 One way that they do it is by all load of males

314
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 kind of leave their smells around in a certain area.

315
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Their pheromones.

316
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And they kind of do it as a gang.

317
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 And they put loads and loads of stuff around them.

318
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Then the queen just smells tons and tons of males

319
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 and then goes down and then they make that way.

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And another way is by kind of chasing after a female.

321
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 So they'll see one in flight and they'll chase after the female.

322
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And even though their eyesight is kind of good for insects,

323
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 it's not quite that good.

324
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And so if they see something which is small looking

325
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 but actually is far away and is flying,

326
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 then they can sometimes, according to this newsletter,

327
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 mistake it for an aeroplane.

328
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 - Do we know how far they get towards the plane

329
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 before they realise the mistake?

330
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 - They realise the mistake and then they have to casually turn around

331
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 as though they weren't chasing.

332
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 - Do you mean like what you tried to get onto a tube train

333
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 and it goes away and you pretend you weren't buffing gas?

334
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

335
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 - Or do they think that there's just certain female bees

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 out there or male bees that are extremely fast?

337
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 - Like Matt, he was like, "President, you saying bolter of the bees?"

338
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 - No, it didn't go that far into the psychology of the bee.

339
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 - That makes more sense that it's at a distance though.

340
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 - I sort of can forgive the bee slightly.

341
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I think it planets like a bee from far away.

342
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 - Sorry, just one more thing on the colours that bees can see.

343
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 They can't really see red,

344
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 but they can see things that are further in the spectrum,

345
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 so they can see like ultraviolet.

346
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 They can see a little bit of yellow and orange.

347
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 They can see blue. They can see violet.

348
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 And they can see another colour which I saw in a website

349
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 was called bee purple. And bee purple is a colour that we can't see,

350
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 which is like a combination of yellow and ultraviolet.

351
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 - Really?

352
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 - That's so cool.

353
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 - How do we know they can see it?

354
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Have they done paintings and there's just these big blind spots?

355
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 - I don't know, I think you can,

356
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 if you know the wavelength that something gives off,

357
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 you can know that there is a colour there even if you can't see it.

358
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 - So they can tell that it's a sort of purple-ish

359
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 in the spectrum area. - That's so cool.

360
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I don't think you can mix normal colours with ultraviolet as well.

361
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 - I don't think so. But it makes sense that you can, doesn't it?

362
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 - Yeah.

363
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 - I don't know.

364
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 - As you mixed it with the colour would gradually disappear

365
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 because we can't see stuff in the ultraviolet spectrum.

366
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 So we'll be putting an invisibility cloak on.

367
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Manufacturers of invisibility cloak should take notes.

368
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 - I imagine that it doesn't quite work like that.

369
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 - I think she's absolutely right.

370
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 - See? I'm not the only one that gets slammed from my Harry Potter references.

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 - Stop being right.

372
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 - Do we know if there's anything in our day-to-day life

373
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 that is actually that be purple,

374
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 but we obviously just see it as purple?

375
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 - Well, there are plants which have colours

376
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 that if you shine a UV light on them,

377
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 you can see that they glow in a certain way,

378
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 that you can't see as humans,

379
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 but bees presumably can't see

380
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 because they point towards the centre of the plant.

381
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 So they're pointing the bee to the centre of the plant,

382
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 but if you or I were to look at it, we would never see those arrows.

383
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 - Okay.

384
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 - But we would see it as a different colour.

385
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 We wouldn't see it as nothing.

386
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 - Yes, exactly.

387
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 - It would be invisible.

388
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 - You look bees aren't the only things that make honey.

389
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 I did not know this.

390
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 - Really?

391
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 - Wops.

392
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 - Wops make honey.

393
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 - Do they?

394
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 - Yeah.

395
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 - There's a particular species of it called

396
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 the brachigastra mellificator.

397
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And apparently you can even eat that wasps honey,

398
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 but I don't think it's found because it's quite hard to breed wasps.

399
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 - I don't know why it's not found.

400
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 - A single pound of clover honey

401
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 requires 8.7 million flowers to be manufactured.

402
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 8.7 million flowers for one pound of clover honey.

403
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 - Oh my god, I go through so much honey.

404
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 - That's terrible.

405
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 - I mean, the flowers can do multiple pollinations.

406
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 It's all right?

407
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 - Okay.

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 - Have you guys heard about

409
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 and I only realised as we were about start recording

410
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 that actually this article's from 2015.

411
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 So potentially this already now exists.

412
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 But the highway for bees in Norway?

413
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 - No.

414
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 - In Oslo and Norway, they want to make life better for bees basically

415
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 and they have a lot of green spaces.

416
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And the idea is that they want to create networks

417
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 so that the bees can go between the green spaces

418
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 through sort of like alleyways that are created in buildings

419
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 and between buildings and so on.

420
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 - In buildings?

421
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 - Yeah, so like literally tunnels inside.

422
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 - Yeah, like trying to get in the left.

423
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 - Well, no, imagine in this room.

424
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 - Yeah.

425
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 - You have their own-- - Get the next lift.

426
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 - Yeah, they just, it's like tunnels and so on

427
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 and the bees can travel and find their way

428
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 to the next green place that they're going to.

429
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 - I think it might be that.

430
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 But I thought it would be like rooftop gardens and stuff

431
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 rather than actually inside the buildings.

432
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 - Yeah, I probably made that up.

433
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 - They put signposts on rooftops saying

434
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 bees you're allowed to fly over.

435
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 - What they do is that bees are in one place.

436
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 They might want to go to another place

437
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 and they just make sure there's a corridor

438
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 of green spaces where they can go.

439
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 - So they put green on the rooftops?

440
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 - Yeah.

441
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 - And flowers that they like and things like this.

442
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 - Yeah, lovely.

443
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 - Because you can make your garden really be friendly.

444
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 They're all these specific flowers that you can grow

445
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 and you guarantee bees.

446
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 - And London is basically covered in bees.

447
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 - Yeah, it's true.

448
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 - Basically.

449
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 - Yeah.

450
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 - When you say basically you mean knots.

451
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 - So many rooftops.

452
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 - Do you mean the hips to be hives in shortage?

453
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 - No, I mean the Royal Festival Hall has a bee hive on top of it.

454
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Harrods has a bee hive on top of it.

455
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And there's one specific London beekeeper

456
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 who goes to all of these different places.

457
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 - And is he, does he do parkour?

458
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 - Do you just jump from one to the other?

459
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 - But it is a problem because it's really fashionable

460
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 to have a bee hive and it's really cool.

461
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 But what they haven't done is planted 8.7 million flowers.

462
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 So you get exhausted bee hives

463
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 and they haven't got enough flowers and plants to pollinate.

464
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 So what you should actually do is plant a wild flower meadow

465
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 because that's not as sexy as getting a load of bees

466
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 off the internet.

467
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 - That's true.

468
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 - If you do have a garden,

469
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 but not many people do have gardens in London,

470
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 but if you do have them,

471
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 you should plant lots of flowers, shouldn't you?

472
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 - Yeah.

473
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 - Did you know there's such a thing as a bee beautician?

474
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 - No.

475
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 - A bee beautician.

476
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Yeah.

477
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 So her job is to brush bees hair,

478
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 to wash them with shampoo.

479
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 So bees are, when specimens are collected,

480
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 then they're preserved in ethanol

481
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 and that makes them kind of soggy and slimy.

482
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 And she has to prepare them to be fit for display.

483
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 So she's got, she's concocted special bee shampoo

484
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 and then she dunks it in the bee shampoo

485
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 and then she hangs it out.

486
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 So she inserts a tiny, tiny pin,

487
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 I think, at the hinge of one of its legs.

488
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And then she's created a blow dryer for bees.

489
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 - Of course.

490
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 - No.

491
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 - Yeah, so she at first tried actual blow dryers,

492
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 but she found that they were too violent.

493
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 So it used to be...

494
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 - She's gone.

495
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 - She's just got the little legs left in the clamp

496
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 and the rest of the bee.

497
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 - She does say so it used to blow their limbs off

498
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 and then she'd have to glue the limbs back on,

499
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 which is the whole other thing.

500
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 - Glue the limbs back on.

501
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 - Yeah, but she did say something interesting about bees,

502
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 which is that they have lots of split ends.

503
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And so that's why she has to use a special shampoo,

504
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 it's because they get very clumpy and frizzy when they get wet.

505
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 - What is this shampoo?

506
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 - It's a mixture of water and sodium bicarbonate or something.

507
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 - Okay.

508
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 - But wasps don't have split ends,

509
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 so if you don't want frizzy hair, be a wasp.

510
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 - It's a bit late for me, really.

511
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

512
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

513
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 - My fact is that running a leaf blower for 30 minutes

514
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 creates more emissions than driving a pickup truck

515
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 3,800 miles.

516
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 - No way.

517
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 - That is incredible.

518
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 - It does sound unbelievably untrue, doesn't it?

519
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 - Yeah.

520
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 - I'm following the words of James Fallow,

521
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 who's a correspondent at the Atlantic,

522
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 which is a very reputable magazine.

523
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And he has a campaign against these things.

524
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Well, I guess if you were pro,

525
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 then you wouldn't work out the emissions.

526
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 What he says is that about a third of the petrol they use,

527
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 because they use petrol gas in America,

528
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 is vomited out in aerosol form.

529
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And that gets mixed in with tiny particles of oil

530
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 in the exhaust, in the droplets.

531
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So he has calculated that.

532
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Which if true means that you could drive from Coven Garden

533
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 to Jerusalem.

534
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 - Wow.

535
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 - I think they compared it to a particular type of pickup, didn't they?

536
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 - Sorry, yeah, F-150.

537
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Maybe it's an unbelievably clean.

538
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 - I think it is.

539
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 - I think it is an extremely efficient one.

540
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 But it's still good.

541
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 I mean, it's still amazing.

542
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

543
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 I thought the F-150 was a model of Cassiot watch.

544
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Is it not?

545
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 - That's the F-91W.

546
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 - Great.

547
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 - Anyway.

548
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 - So is he suggesting we all try and clear our leaves

549
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 with pickup trucks?

550
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Because I think it's gonna be harder.

551
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 - If you use the F-150 and you can blow it in the right way,

552
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 I guess you could save technically on emissions?

553
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 - You could.

554
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 - The exhaust pipe pointed the right direction.

555
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 - Imagine trying to drive a B with the leaf plug.

556
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 (laughing)

557
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 It will legs everywhere.

558
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 - Yeah, so I mean, people really hate these things.

559
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 - Yeah, the horrible.

560
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I think they make the most disgusting noise

561
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 and they should all be banned.

562
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I genuinely do think that.

563
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 - They're very, very, very loud.

564
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 - And I think they're unnecessary.

565
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Just rake your bloody garden, guys.

566
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 - That must be easier to blow it than rake it, though.

567
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 - Also, you're blowing it into someone else's spot, aren't you?

568
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Or do you blow it into a pile?

569
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 - I think you blow it into a pile.

570
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 - Blowing it into a pile, okay.

571
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 - I've got leaves all over my bloody garden at the moment.

572
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I would kill for a blower.

573
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 - Your garden's small.

574
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 - I don't need to be rude.

575
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 (laughing)

576
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 - Well, that is quite rude.

577
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 - All I'm saying is, it's evidently rakeable.

578
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 You couldn't pick up truck in your garden.

579
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 - I think, kill for a blower.

580
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 It was the most rude thing in that sentence by a long mile.

581
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 (laughing)

582
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 - Oh dear.

583
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 - Yeah, but I can see that they are.

584
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 I think my neighbours have got one.

585
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 They are pretty loud.

586
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 - If your neighbours have got one,

587
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 you will definitely know about it.

588
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 - Well, there is a big loud noise coming from my neighbours

589
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 every now and then in the autumn.

590
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 (laughing)

591
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 - That's what it is.

592
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 You don't want to pry.

593
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 - Well, it could be that.

594
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 It sounds a bit like an aeroplane taking off.

595
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Is that what they sound like?

596
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 - Yeah, they do.

597
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 - Unless do they have an airstrip in their garden?

598
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 - Well, they're going to be.

599
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 (laughing)

600
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 - Oh dear.

601
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 In California, there are 20 cities that have banned us.

602
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 - Wow.

603
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 - Yeah, I was reading an article by the Kendall family,

604
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 who are from California, are in a state where they want to get it banned.

605
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And they're pointing out that the reason it's so annoying,

606
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 and this definitely does ring true,

607
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 is that compared to a lawnmower,

608
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 which can be as loud,

609
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 but operates at the same kind of frequency

610
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 and volume the whole time,

611
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 leaf blow is really go up and down, don't they?

612
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 So you can't predict it.

613
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 So you're constantly being shocked by its volume increases

614
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 and decreases.

615
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 - That's very interesting.

616
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 - That's what stresses you out.

617
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 - How long have we had leaf blowers, by the way?

618
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Does anyone know?

619
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Since about the 50s or 60s?

620
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 - Yeah, 50s.

621
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Except in Japan, in 19th century,

622
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 they used like bellows that used for a fire as leaf blowers.

623
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 - Oh, they.

624
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 - Yeah, I haven't seen a photo of the bellows.

625
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I tried to find one,

626
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 and I couldn't find a picture of Japanese ancient leaf blowing bellows.

627
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 - No, but there is an early book.

628
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 But the 1950s reference is weird.

629
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 If anyone can tell us if this is true,

630
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Wikipedia claims, and this is from a book called,

631
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 "Everything you ever needed to know about leaf blowers."

632
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 So you would have thought this would be the authority on it.

633
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 But this claims it was invented by a guy called Dom Quinto,

634
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 who originally designed it in the 1950s as an agricultural sprayer.

635
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 But people were taking out the spraying device

636
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 and just using it to blow their leaves on it.

637
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 But there's no evidence aside from this book

638
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 that this Dom Quinto chap ever existed.

639
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 So if you are him, always offspring, get in touch.

640
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 - Do you know who invented the rake?

641
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 - No.

642
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 - Is it Mike Rake?

643
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 No, it's not Mike Rake.

644
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I mean, these are always a bit dubious, aren't they?

645
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 But apparently the steel rake,

646
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 which is kind of a bit springy,

647
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 and the modern day one that's good for raking stuff with,

648
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 was invented by a guy called Chester Greenwood,

649
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 who also supposedly invented earmuffs.

650
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 - Really?

651
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 - Apparently.

652
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 - Wow.

653
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 - And he's quite famous in North America in Maine

654
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 that there's a certain town where every year

655
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 they have a celebration of his inventing.

656
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 - What are they doing?

657
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 They've put a load of earmuffs to go on raking stuff out.

658
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 - Yeah.

659
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 - To drown out the noise of the leaf blowers.

660
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 - They're trying to protest against.

661
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 - They kind of do that, I think.

662
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 They kind of wear earmuffs.

663
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 They have an earmuff parade and stuff.

664
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 - They have a parade!

665
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 - I think they don't really bother about the rake part

666
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 of it that much.

667
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 They're more bothered about the earmuffs

668
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 because he was quite young when he invented them.

669
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 He was like 16 or 17 or so.

670
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 - I thought it was 13.

671
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 - 13, yeah, it could be.

672
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 - Maine sounds like a very exciting place to live, doesn't it?

673
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 That's their highlight of the year.

674
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 - Well, the thing is, it's cold and they have a lot of trees.

675
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 So earmuffs and rakes are the kind of things you might invent

676
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 if you live there.

677
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 - And they have every major horror story

678
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 that we know of in popular culture,

679
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 set there through Stephen King,

680
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 because he lives in Bangor, Maine.

681
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 So it, the clown, is from Maine and...

682
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 - Okay, you can't credit an entire state for one person

683
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 that it's produced.

684
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 (laughter)

685
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 - I know, but well done, Maine.

686
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 - There is a cool thing you can do with leaf blowers,

687
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 which is turn them into a hovercraft.

688
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 - Can you?

689
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 - Yeah.

690
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 There's a very cool video online of a Texan man

691
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 called Ryan Craven.

692
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 So shout out to Texas who created Ryan Craven.

693
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 (laughter)

694
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Who sort of four of them together into a kind of platform

695
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 and he puts the skateboard across the platform.

696
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And it hovers very, very low off the ground,

697
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 but it does hover.

698
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 - You know, on Fallen Leaves,

699
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 I was actually looking at this for cause in the TV show

700
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 we did this week, no such things in news.

701
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 We were talking about Chernobyl.

702
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 - Is that still available on iPlayer?

703
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 - I think it might be, yeah.

704
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And actually, if you're international, it's on YouTube.

705
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 - That's it.

706
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 - But that's besides the point, Jay.

707
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 - Jay, how would you find that?

708
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 - You go to Know Such Things The News.com.

709
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 - Thanks for asking.

710
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 - Yeah.

711
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Anyway, we recorded a TV show this week.

712
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And we mentioned Chernobyl.

713
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 (laughter)

714
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And Leaves in Chernobyl don't decompose

715
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 because the radioactivity means that the bacteria

716
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 are no longer there, can no longer survive.

717
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 So they can't decompose the leaves.

718
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And so there are, you know, that it's missing this fungus

719
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 and the worms and the microbes and stuff like that.

720
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And so it's just building up this huge floor of dead leaves.

721
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And at the moment, if a forest fire started,

722
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 which can't happen, it's that in temperatures,

723
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 it would be a complete disaster with spread radiation,

724
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 much, much further and wider than it is already,

725
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 because it would just catch fire to all these dry dead leaves

726
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 out on the ground.

727
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 - That's like in Australia, a sort of Aussie non-nuclear version

728
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 of that is the eucalyptus tree,

729
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 because their leaves, when they drop off the tree,

730
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 they have a kind of sort of what's called like a toxic name palm

731
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 thing about them in that they're too hard to break down

732
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 for all the insects and animals.

733
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 They sit there, dry as hell.

734
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 And if a forest fire starts and it hits a eucalyptus patch,

735
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 that will just go massively up in flame,

736
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 just sitting there waiting to be caught on fire.

737
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 - And this must be because a eucalyptus tree

738
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 is one of the trees that love being set on fire,

739
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 because how they spread their seeds.

740
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 - Yes, they love to be set on fire.

741
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 They sort of have an inner tree waiting

742
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 to break out of the bigger tree.

743
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And forest fires is what brings that to happen.

744
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 - I think they're pretty much ambivalent about the whole thing.

745
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 - Do you think they don't even know their trees?

746
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 - In 2011, someone patented a glove rake,

747
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 which is really cool.

748
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 It's a normal glove, except it's got these five long,

749
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 you look a bit like him with scissors hands,

750
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 except we were able to break hands.

751
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And you could just go around breaking stuff up

752
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 with your bare hands.

753
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 - You have to be on your hands and knees.

754
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 - You would have to be on your hands and knees.

755
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 - That's not going to be nice.

756
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I mean, because it's the middle of autumn.

757
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 It's going to be damp.

758
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 - Edward rake hands, by the way,

759
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 would have been really useful in that scene

760
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 where Edward Scissor-Hands cuts all the hedges.

761
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 (laughing)

762
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 He could have been on the side cleaning up.

763
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 - Yeah, there's a lot.

764
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Edward, been back hands comes along.

765
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 (laughing)

766
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Guys, why are we all called Edward?

767
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 (laughing)

768
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 - We're not related.

769
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 We've got different surnames.

770
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 (laughing)

771
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 - They've all got the surnames.

772
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 - Hands.

773
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 - Wait, is it a double barrel surname?

774
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 - Yeah, so what are the married Mrs. Scissor?

775
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 One of the married Mrs. Rake.

776
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 - I've never noticed before the moment

777
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 where we come up with a title of an episode.

778
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 I think no such thing as Edward, been back hands.

779
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 (laughing)

780
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Okay, it is time to move on to our final fact of the show

781
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 and that is Chuzinsky.

782
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 - Yes, my fact is that early humans had spiky penises.

783
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 (laughing)

784
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 - That is insane.

785
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 How early?

786
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 - I actually couldn't believe it.

787
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Just a couple of weeks ago.

788
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 - 6.30 this month.

789
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 (laughing)

790
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 - No, this was a study on human genes that was done in 2011

791
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 and it found that about 700,000 years ago,

792
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 so before our common ancestors split into modern humans

793
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 and the Andethals, then we have the gene

794
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 that carries penis spines.

795
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And then that gene seems to have been deleted

796
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 when we evolved into modern humans today.

797
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 But lots of other, like almost all other primates

798
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 still have penis spines.

799
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 - Too bad.

800
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 - Yeah, they do except for spider monkeys, I think,

801
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 all primates have penis spines.

802
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And what do the spines feel like as in...

803
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 (laughing)

804
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 If I gripped a chimped penis, would I be arrested?

805
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 - Be arrested, yeah.

806
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 (laughing)

807
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 - Would I cut my hands?

808
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Would the palms of my hands be sliced?

809
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 - The ones on primates I think are more bumpy.

810
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Some are not really spiky spines, like cats, I think, too.

811
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 But I think they're more like lumps.

812
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 I've slightly blunt spiked.

813
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 - You've never seen the film with Tisopee in this, have you?

814
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 (laughing)

815
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 - So just to go into quickly, the reason that we might well,

816
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 that men might have had spiky penises in the past.

817
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 We're not totally sure about it.

818
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 But we think it might be because what it can do is

819
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 it can help clear out rival sperm from a female vagina.

820
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 So if you get the spikes in, then as it's sort of retracting,

821
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 they scrape the edge of a vagina

822
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 and they'll bring out any sperm that's been left in there

823
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 by someone else.

824
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And they can break through a little sperm sack

825
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and break it open to make the sperm.

826
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 - No animals, isn't it?

827
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I think dragonflies have like spayed shaped penises

828
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 that they do with that.

829
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 - It must be really hard to study the evolution

830
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 of human penises because the lack of bone means that

831
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 how can you, how can you, you just, there's nothing.

832
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 - So erotic, all bones, no bone.

833
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 - All bone and bone.

834
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 - All bone and bone.

835
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 (laughing)

836
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 - That's what you said that a few times.

837
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 (laughing)

838
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 - I've gotta change my strapline on a lot of dating sites.

839
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 (laughing)

840
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 - We might have had a bone.

841
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 I must stop saying we, in reference to our penises,

842
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 then might have had a bone.

843
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 We don't know, but other primates do have a penile bone,

844
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 I think, don't they?

845
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And it has a lot of advantages having a bone there

846
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 because it means you can push it out much quicker

847
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 than having to wait for the blood to engorge it.

848
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 (laughing)

849
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Just flip right out and it can stay out for longer.

850
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And I think Richard Dawkins is one.

851
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 (laughing)

852
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 - Richard Dawkins, in the selfish gene,

853
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 wrote that the advantage of humans not having this

854
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 is that having to get blood flowing in there

855
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 shows that you've got like a healthy blood flow,

856
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 shows is kind of a sign of good health,

857
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 so women are more attracted to it.

858
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 So that might be why we've a men of evolved.

859
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 - Okay.

860
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 - Penises without the bone,

861
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 because it's harder to get it blown up.

862
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 - I've heard so, in place of the bone,

863
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 there is a new thing that they're testing out,

864
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 which is a metal rod.

865
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 So some men could now have a metal rod inside their penis.

866
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 And the idea is for,

867
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 it's done, do you remember where it's done, Andy?

868
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 - In hospitals mostly.

869
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 (laughing)

870
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 - If it's big off with you and about,

871
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 you should be very careful.

872
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 (laughing)

873
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 - So the idea is that this is for people

874
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 suffering from erectile dysfunction

875
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 and if they've gone through various courses,

876
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 they're gonna then say on health services

877
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 or whatever they will say you can have this.

878
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 And the idea is that it's a little metal rod inside,

879
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 but when you want an erection,

880
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 you can press a button like a remote control

881
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 and it pre-heats this metal bar

882
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 to a heat point where it expands within you.

883
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 - Yo, I'm never gonna get on a flight, are you?

884
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 (laughing)

885
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 - I mean, that's just not,

886
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 it's just not gonna happen, you know?

887
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Every single time you're gonna set it off,

888
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 they're gonna get that paddle thing.

889
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 You're gonna go up and down your body,

890
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 you can get to the rod.

891
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 - Yeah.

892
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 - What, and you think you just go,

893
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 never mind, I'm going home, doesn't matter.

894
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 - I think that would happen, yeah.

895
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 - Yeah.

896
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 - The other thing is you can get a bit of cartilage

897
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 but if you have erectile problems,

898
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 and then you have to just kind of maneuver

899
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 the penis into position.

900
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 So it's kind of permanently erect from that point.

901
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 That's in Mary Roach's book, "Bonk,"

902
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 which is about science and sex,

903
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 and it's an amazing book.

904
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 - Oh, it's incredible book, yeah.

905
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 - So this is partly about how males

906
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 of various species manage to get rid of competition,

907
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 'cause the spines are often used to scrape,

908
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 to scrape out the sperm out of the vagina.

909
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 - Yeah.

910
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 - And so I was looking at other ways

911
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 that you get rid of the competition.

912
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 And one is that, in mice, sperm club together

913
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 as a group to beat rival sperm.

914
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 - It's exactly like--

915
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 - Like where I saw it.

916
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 - What?

917
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 (laughing)

918
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 - Yeah.

919
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 - The jets of the sperm?

920
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 (laughing)

921
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 - It's exactly like in a cycling race,

922
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 which James will know more about,

923
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 where they move faster if they move as a group,

924
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 so they can tell if they're the sperm

925
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 that belong to the same person,

926
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 and all the sperm that belong to that person get together,

927
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 and all the sperm that belong to another person get together.

928
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 This is in these mice inside this female mouse.

929
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 - Yeah.

930
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 - And so they, as a group, they move much faster

931
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 than they do individually.

932
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 What's that called?

933
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 It's like the--

934
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 - Peloton, peloton effect.

935
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 - It's a peloton.

936
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 It's the peloton of sperm.

937
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 And then when they get near the finish line,

938
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 suddenly they all start to beat them away.

939
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 - Someone breaks away.

940
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 - Yeah.

941
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 - And then the muck haven't dish sperm wins.

942
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 - Exactly.

943
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 - Yeah.

944
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 - So they're just programmed.

945
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 It'll be smell or--

946
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 - No, what is it?

947
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 What is it?

948
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 How do they know this?

949
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 - How can they grow together?

950
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 - How can they grow together?

951
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 - Well, cells can be programmed to do things.

952
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 So I imagine it must be that.

953
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 It's inside the DNA of the cell.

954
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 That has instructions of what it should do.

955
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 It makes the tails wag.

956
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 - Yeah.

957
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 - And also, if they have their specific rendition

958
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 of "Keep Cool" from my site's story,

959
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 then they can tell.

960
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 - Which is the best song to sing for a sperm.

961
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Because you do need to keep lower than the ambient temperature of the body.

962
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 - Yeah, it's weird that they want the lyrics in the original website.

963
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 (laughter)

964
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 - Okay, that is it.

965
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
