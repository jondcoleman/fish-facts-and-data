 [ you can hear the music ]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 - [ you can hear the music ]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 - [ you can hear the music ]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 - [ you can hear the music ]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 - [ you can hear the music ]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 [ you can hear the music ]

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 [ you can hear the music ]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with James Harkin,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 I am Richard Zinsky, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 My fact this week is that the White House's Oval Office

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 is a giant weighing scale.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 - What do they use it for normally?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 - Wailing the President.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 - No, to see how heavy he is.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 - No, it's not.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 - So are you waving? - Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 - Yeah, it's to see that he's there full stop.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 So the secret service need a monitor

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 where the President is at all times.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 However, they're not allowed into the Oval Office.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 He doesn't want them in there, so they have to stand outside.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Now, when the doors open, they can see where he is,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 but when the door is shut, they can't see where the President is.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 So if you look at pictures of the Oval Office,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 there is a giant oval carpet that literally spans the entire office room

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 except for a few inches to the wall.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 And underneath it are weighing pads that are connected to a line

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 that goes outside.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 So the secret service can see where he is in the Oval Office

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 purely by where he's standing.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 - I think I would get a load of objects

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 that weighed exactly the same as me

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 and just keep moving them around the office

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 just to blind up the secret service.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 - Like Indiana Jones at the beginning of the first film.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 - Yeah.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 - But it's kind of like, if you've seen Harry Potter,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 the Marauder's Map, where they just follow the footsteps on the map.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 That's what the secret service have to have.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 - Except it's not a Marauder's Map,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 because the things are labeled as the President.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 It's just someone who weighs roughly the same amount as the President, right?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 So it's definitely Obama's in the Oval Office,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 or someone who is also human sized as in the Oval Office.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 - Yeah, or two people in the Oval Office.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 It's just way of making sure that no one kidnaps him through a window, maybe.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 - Well, they allowed him to the Oval Office.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 - I don't know, actually.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 This is a fact, which I haven't seen in many places.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 It's from Brad Meltzer, who is a best-selling novelist,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 but also works at the White House and gives tours.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 And he did a Huffington Post piece where he said,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 "Here is secret service secrets."

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 And that was the top one.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 - 'Cause he got lots of randomers into the Oval Office.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 I'd be a bit insulted as his secret service if I wasn't allowed in.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 - Well, I think it's more, they're probably allowed in at some point.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 I don't think it's like a total ban on secret service people.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 I think when he's working on a day-to-day basis,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 he doesn't want secret service people.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 - Let's say they're doing something really important,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 which is quite classified,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 and only the people who need to know are in there,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 so the other guys just stood outside, like playing cards or something.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 - Do you think if he puts on a bit of weight,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 they start giving him a slide look?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 - Right.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 - So, are you sure about that biscuit, Mr. President?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 (laughing)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 - This article by Brad Meltzer also mentions

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 that anytime we hear about the White House going under renovations

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 of an old room, it's actually that the secret service

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 are conducting an investigation,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 and it's the only way of giving an excuse

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 to allow for the first family to be out of the White House

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 while renovations are going on,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 but it actually means they're conducting an investigation.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 - Is that right?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 - This will always be that.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 - No, no, but I think there's been a few cases.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 It's a sort of, like, inside knowledge thing

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 that if there's an investigation by the secret service,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 they will say currently unobenerate.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 - What are they investigating?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 - That needs the President to be away.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 - It's hard to research them,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 because they're quite open about some things,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 but then other things are surprisingly secretive.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 - It is surprising, isn't it?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 It's not that they would want to keep anything from us.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 - It's controversial.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Are they telling the truth?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Is the author telling the truth?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 We know a bit too much about the secret service, it seems, recently.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 - I thought it would just be called the service.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 - Exactly, yeah, the open service.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 - You know that we have a lot of presidents and leaders

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 who like exercise and like jogging.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Obviously, when they go out on a jog,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 they have to be accompanied by their little secret service cabal

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 who have to jog with them.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 For instance, there was an article, I think this is in the Atlantic,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 by someone who'd been in the secret service under Clinton,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 and he said it was a complete nightmare,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 because Clinton loved running,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 and they even built him his own little running track

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 inside the White House grounds,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 but he didn't like it, he liked to be out there with the people.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Whenever Clinton went for a run,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 a bunch of them all had to go for a run as well,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 but not just for a run.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 They had to go for a run carrying like all their guns and weapons,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 and it'd be super alert,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 and always be ready to attack someone

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 if they attacked the president.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 And so it sounds like absolutely hell.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 - Imagine if Moll Farrah became president.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 (laughing)

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 - Oh my gosh, who would you, that's true.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 There are five people to qualify from being president,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 and they're the five fastest people in the world,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 because surely you need five people faster than the president.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 - But Moll's not in the five fastest people in the world, is he?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 - For running distances,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 which is what Moll's was doing.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 I mean, it's hardly, you say ball becomes president,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 and you can only run 100 metres, 200 metres.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 What trouble could he get in?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 - But he won't be able to get away,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 because at least the secret time is busing more people

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 to start running after the first 5,000 metres,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 but no president Farrah has been running.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 - So when president Farrah is running,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 what they'll do is they'll all be running in like a relay,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 and they pass the gun.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 (laughing)

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 - Yeah, they do have to, it's quite funny,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 when you look into sort of odd little things

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 that they have to prepare for in the safety of a president,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 like Clinton going for his runs.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 So do you remember that famous incident

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 where George Bush swallowed a pretzel

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 and started choking on it?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Apparently, that was a thing that they had to try and work out

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 how to avoid from ever happening again,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 because-- - So did they all suck the pretzel?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 So called the pretzel first.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 - Exactly, what do you do in that situation?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 So the only thing-- - The only thing--

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 - The only thing-- (laughing)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 - The only thing that they could come up with

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 was a sort of emergency push button,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 which I assumed he should have had anyway.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 - Or the pretzel button.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 - No, it's not exclusively for pretzel, if he's--

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 - It's a pretzel shake, I hope they made a pretzel shake.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 (laughing)

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 - Some of the presidential secret service things,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 I read in one book called Personality Character

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 and Leadership in the White House.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 I don't know if it's true.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 That Gerald Ford, whenever he farted,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 would blame the secret service who were around him.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 (laughing)

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Oh, God, Jesus, guys, can you not keep a bit of the car room?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 - That's amazing.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 - Apparently, that's true.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 - I guess that's true.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 We spoke about this before on the podcast.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 There was one president.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 I think it was Johnson, who would just,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 if he was taking a piss, would just urinate

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 on the secret service member and say,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 "I can do this, I'm the president."

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 - I think the story went, something like,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 it was LBJ, wasn't it?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 And I think what happened was he went for a piss

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 on the side of the road when they were driving somewhere

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 and they kind of did like a human wall around him

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 and then there's like a gust of wind

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 and it blew the pee on to one of the guys,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 and he said, "Excuse me, Mr. President, you're peeing on me."

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 And he said, "Well, it's my prerogative to do that."

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 I think that's what the story is anyway.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 - Okay.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 - Makes him slightly less unpleasant

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 than deliberately weeing on his...

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 - Yes, yes.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 - Every time he needed to do a cool one of them into the office.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 (laughing)

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 There was a assassination attempt that was made on Ronald Reagan

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 and it was made by John Hinckley, Jr.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 and one of the secret service guys, a guy called Jerry Parr,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 is the guy who got Ronald Reagan into the limousine

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 and got him off to...

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 And notice that he blood was coming out of his mouth

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 and said, "We need to get to the hospital right now."

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 So he said to have saved Ronald Reagan's life.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Interestingly, he became a secret service officer

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 because he had watched a movie called Code of the Secret Service.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Years before, which starred Ronald Reagan

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 as a secret service guy.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 - No way!

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 - Yeah, so he ended up saving the life of the guy

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 who got him into it through...

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 - So Ronald Reagan saved his own life in a way.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 - Exactly.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 (laughing)

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 - Wow.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 - That's incredible.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 - Yes, really cool.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 - That made a good movie in itself, wasn't it?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 - Just one thing about the British secret services,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 which I thought was interesting.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 So during the Second World War,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 they obviously requisitioned a load of, you know,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 country houses and castles and things like that

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 and stately homes.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 And one place they had was in Scotland.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 It was called Invaler Lodge.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And it was used for spies who weren't good enough to spy,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 but had already learned too much secret information

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 to be allowed to leave.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 (laughing)

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 - That way.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 - Yeah, wow.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 - And they had to stay there for the rest of the war.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 - One of them, one unfortunate man who had signed up to spy,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 he was refused to actually go and spy in the field

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 because apparently he was outstandingly ugly.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 So there was a report which said he'd be recognized anywhere.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Once he'd never forgotten.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 He has no teeth at all, except two gold tusks and two incisors.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 (laughing)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Poor man.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 - But they must have been as well.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Like by the time they all left,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 everyone would have known the secrets

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 that they were meant to be keeping as well.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 - Have come here.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Wow, I got told this thing about.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 (laughing)

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 The one guy goes, "No!"

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 "Come on, Mike!"

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 (upbeat rock music)

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 - Okay, my fact this week is that because male bumblebees

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 rely on sight to find females,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 they sometimes find themselves chasing after aeroplanes.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 (laughing)

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 - So presumably their eyesight is not very good?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 - Well, it's good for an insect.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 (laughing)

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 But it's not good for like an eagle.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 - Oh, okay.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 - Okay.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 - Bumblebees do have kind of good eyesight

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 as in they can see lots of colors.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 - Yeah.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 - People didn't realize they could see colors

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 and then Carl Frisch is a cold.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 That guy who works out that they did the waggle dance,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 he's quite famous scientist.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 - Yeah, he got a Nobel Prize for that.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 - Yeah, and he did an experiments where he proved

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 that they could see colors by getting loads of gray,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 like gray card and then one colored card

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 and always put the food on the colored one

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 that could always tell where it was.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 So they do have color sight.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 - So are you saying we need to stop painting

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 our aeroplane Stripe Black and Yellow?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 (laughing)

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 - Well, there is a Stripe Black and Yellow aeroplane

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 and it is the smallest airplane that has flown.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 - Is it the size of a bee?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 - It's called the Bumblebees a bit bigger.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 It's eight foot ten inches in length

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 and the wingspan is five foot six

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 and it's tiny.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 - It's so small.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 - It's so small.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 - Yeah.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 It's a bike lane as well.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 - Yeah.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 - I mean, it does not look like it should get off the ground.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 The wings are so small that you shouldn't think it has enough left.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 - It looks like your car has just had some wings.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 And not even as big as your car

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 because it fits five people in a car.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 - Here's my armspan.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 It's six inches shorter than my armspan across the whole plane.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 - And yes.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 - The wingtip.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 - Looking at that, despite the fact that that's Black and Yellow

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 and is the smallest plane, I still think B's are idiots.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 They look at something that size.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 I think it's genuinely a bee.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 - Do they chase after the plane once it's in flight

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 or is there a lot of B's at Heathrow?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 - It's in flight.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 So I got this from a newsletter of the Bee Conservation Society.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 It's all about how male bees find the queens.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 And there are different ways of doing it.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 One way that they do it is by all load of males

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 kind of leave their smells around in a certain area.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Their pheromones.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 And they kind of do it as a gang.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 And they put loads and loads of stuff around them.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Then the queen just smells tons and tons of males

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 and then goes down and then they make that way.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 And another way is by kind of chasing after a female.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 So they'll see one in flight and they'll chase after the female.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 And even though their eyesight is kind of good for insects,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 it's not quite that good.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 And so if they see something which is small looking

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 but actually is far away and is flying,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 then they can sometimes, according to this newsletter,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 mistake it for an aeroplane.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 - Do we know how far they get towards the plane

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 before they realise the mistake?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 - They realise the mistake and then they have to casually turn around

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 as though they weren't chasing.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 - Do you mean like what you tried to get onto a tube train

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 and it goes away and you pretend you weren't buffing gas?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 - Or do they think that there's just certain female bees

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 out there or male bees that are extremely fast?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 - Like Matt, he was like, "President, you saying bolter of the bees?"

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 - No, it didn't go that far into the psychology of the bee.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 - That makes more sense that it's at a distance though.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 - I sort of can forgive the bee slightly.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 I think it planets like a bee from far away.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 - Sorry, just one more thing on the colours that bees can see.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 They can't really see red,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 but they can see things that are further in the spectrum,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 so they can see like ultraviolet.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 They can see a little bit of yellow and orange.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 They can see blue. They can see violet.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 And they can see another colour which I saw in a website

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 was called bee purple. And bee purple is a colour that we can't see,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 which is like a combination of yellow and ultraviolet.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 - Really?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 - That's so cool.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 - How do we know they can see it?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 Have they done paintings and there's just these big blind spots?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 - I don't know, I think you can,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 if you know the wavelength that something gives off,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 you can know that there is a colour there even if you can't see it.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 - So they can tell that it's a sort of purple-ish

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 in the spectrum area. - That's so cool.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 I don't think you can mix normal colours with ultraviolet as well.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 - I don't think so. But it makes sense that you can, doesn't it?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 - Yeah.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 - I don't know.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 - As you mixed it with the colour would gradually disappear

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 because we can't see stuff in the ultraviolet spectrum.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 So we'll be putting an invisibility cloak on.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Manufacturers of invisibility cloak should take notes.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 - I imagine that it doesn't quite work like that.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 - I think she's absolutely right.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 - See? I'm not the only one that gets slammed from my Harry Potter references.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 - Stop being right.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 - Do we know if there's anything in our day-to-day life

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 that is actually that be purple,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 but we obviously just see it as purple?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 - Well, there are plants which have colours

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 that if you shine a UV light on them,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 you can see that they glow in a certain way,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 that you can't see as humans,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 but bees presumably can't see

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 because they point towards the centre of the plant.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 So they're pointing the bee to the centre of the plant,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 but if you or I were to look at it, we would never see those arrows.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 - Okay.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 - But we would see it as a different colour.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 We wouldn't see it as nothing.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 - Yes, exactly.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 - It would be invisible.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 - You look bees aren't the only things that make honey.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 I did not know this.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 - Really?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 - Wops.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 - Wops make honey.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 - Do they?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 - Yeah.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 - There's a particular species of it called

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 the brachigastra mellificator.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 And apparently you can even eat that wasps honey,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 but I don't think it's found because it's quite hard to breed wasps.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 - I don't know why it's not found.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 - A single pound of clover honey

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 requires 8.7 million flowers to be manufactured.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 8.7 million flowers for one pound of clover honey.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 - Oh my god, I go through so much honey.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 - That's terrible.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 - I mean, the flowers can do multiple pollinations.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 It's all right?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 - Okay.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 - Have you guys heard about

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 and I only realised as we were about start recording

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 that actually this article's from 2015.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 So potentially this already now exists.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 But the highway for bees in Norway?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 - No.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 - In Oslo and Norway, they want to make life better for bees basically

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 and they have a lot of green spaces.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 And the idea is that they want to create networks

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 so that the bees can go between the green spaces

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 through sort of like alleyways that are created in buildings

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 and between buildings and so on.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 - In buildings?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 - Yeah, so like literally tunnels inside.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 - Yeah, like trying to get in the left.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 - Well, no, imagine in this room.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 - Yeah.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 - You have their own-- - Get the next lift.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 - Yeah, they just, it's like tunnels and so on

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 and the bees can travel and find their way

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 to the next green place that they're going to.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 - I think it might be that.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 But I thought it would be like rooftop gardens and stuff

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 rather than actually inside the buildings.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 - Yeah, I probably made that up.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 - They put signposts on rooftops saying

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 bees you're allowed to fly over.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 - What they do is that bees are in one place.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 They might want to go to another place

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 and they just make sure there's a corridor

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 of green spaces where they can go.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 - So they put green on the rooftops?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 - Yeah.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 - And flowers that they like and things like this.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 - Yeah, lovely.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 - Because you can make your garden really be friendly.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 They're all these specific flowers that you can grow

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 and you guarantee bees.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 - And London is basically covered in bees.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 - Yeah, it's true.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 - Basically.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 - Yeah.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 - When you say basically you mean knots.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 - So many rooftops.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 - Do you mean the hips to be hives in shortage?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 - No, I mean the Royal Festival Hall has a bee hive on top of it.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 Harrods has a bee hive on top of it.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 And there's one specific London beekeeper

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 who goes to all of these different places.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 - And is he, does he do parkour?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 - Do you just jump from one to the other?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 - But it is a problem because it's really fashionable

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 to have a bee hive and it's really cool.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 But what they haven't done is planted 8.7 million flowers.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 So you get exhausted bee hives

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 and they haven't got enough flowers and plants to pollinate.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 So what you should actually do is plant a wild flower meadow

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 because that's not as sexy as getting a load of bees

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 off the internet.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 - That's true.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 - If you do have a garden,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 but not many people do have gardens in London,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 but if you do have them,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 you should plant lots of flowers, shouldn't you?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 - Yeah.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 - Did you know there's such a thing as a bee beautician?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 - No.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 - A bee beautician.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 Yeah.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 So her job is to brush bees hair,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 to wash them with shampoo.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 So bees are, when specimens are collected,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 then they're preserved in ethanol

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 and that makes them kind of soggy and slimy.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 And she has to prepare them to be fit for display.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 So she's got, she's concocted special bee shampoo

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 and then she dunks it in the bee shampoo

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 and then she hangs it out.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 So she inserts a tiny, tiny pin,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 I think, at the hinge of one of its legs.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 And then she's created a blow dryer for bees.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 - Of course.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 - No.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 - Yeah, so she at first tried actual blow dryers,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 but she found that they were too violent.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 So it used to be...

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 - She's gone.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 - She's just got the little legs left in the clamp

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 and the rest of the bee.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 - She does say so it used to blow their limbs off

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 and then she'd have to glue the limbs back on,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 which is the whole other thing.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 - Glue the limbs back on.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 - Yeah, but she did say something interesting about bees,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 which is that they have lots of split ends.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 And so that's why she has to use a special shampoo,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 it's because they get very clumpy and frizzy when they get wet.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 - What is this shampoo?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 - It's a mixture of water and sodium bicarbonate or something.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 - Okay.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 - But wasps don't have split ends,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 so if you don't want frizzy hair, be a wasp.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 - It's a bit late for me, really.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 - My fact is that running a leaf blower for 30 minutes

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 creates more emissions than driving a pickup truck

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 3,800 miles.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 - No way.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 - That is incredible.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 - It does sound unbelievably untrue, doesn't it?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 - Yeah.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 - I'm following the words of James Fallow,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 who's a correspondent at the Atlantic,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 which is a very reputable magazine.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 And he has a campaign against these things.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Well, I guess if you were pro,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 then you wouldn't work out the emissions.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 What he says is that about a third of the petrol they use,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 because they use petrol gas in America,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 is vomited out in aerosol form.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 And that gets mixed in with tiny particles of oil

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 in the exhaust, in the droplets.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 So he has calculated that.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Which if true means that you could drive from Coven Garden

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 to Jerusalem.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 - Wow.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 - I think they compared it to a particular type of pickup, didn't they?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 - Sorry, yeah, F-150.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Maybe it's an unbelievably clean.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 - I think it is.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 - I think it is an extremely efficient one.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 But it's still good.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 I mean, it's still amazing.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 I thought the F-150 was a model of Cassiot watch.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Is it not?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 - That's the F-91W.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 - Great.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 - Anyway.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 - So is he suggesting we all try and clear our leaves

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 with pickup trucks?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Because I think it's gonna be harder.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 - If you use the F-150 and you can blow it in the right way,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 I guess you could save technically on emissions?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 - You could.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 - The exhaust pipe pointed the right direction.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 - Imagine trying to drive a B with the leaf plug.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 (laughing)

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 It will legs everywhere.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 - Yeah, so I mean, people really hate these things.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 - Yeah, the horrible.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 I think they make the most disgusting noise

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 and they should all be banned.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 I genuinely do think that.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 - They're very, very, very loud.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 - And I think they're unnecessary.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Just rake your bloody garden, guys.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 - That must be easier to blow it than rake it, though.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 - Also, you're blowing it into someone else's spot, aren't you?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Or do you blow it into a pile?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 - I think you blow it into a pile.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 - Blowing it into a pile, okay.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 - I've got leaves all over my bloody garden at the moment.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 I would kill for a blower.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 - Your garden's small.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 - I don't need to be rude.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 (laughing)

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 - Well, that is quite rude.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 - All I'm saying is, it's evidently rakeable.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 You couldn't pick up truck in your garden.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 - I think, kill for a blower.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 It was the most rude thing in that sentence by a long mile.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 (laughing)

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 - Oh dear.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 - Yeah, but I can see that they are.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 I think my neighbours have got one.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 They are pretty loud.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 - If your neighbours have got one,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 you will definitely know about it.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 - Well, there is a big loud noise coming from my neighbours

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 every now and then in the autumn.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 (laughing)

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 - That's what it is.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 You don't want to pry.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 - Well, it could be that.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 It sounds a bit like an aeroplane taking off.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Is that what they sound like?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 - Yeah, they do.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 - Unless do they have an airstrip in their garden?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 - Well, they're going to be.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 (laughing)

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 - Oh dear.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 In California, there are 20 cities that have banned us.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 - Wow.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 - Yeah, I was reading an article by the Kendall family,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 who are from California, are in a state where they want to get it banned.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 And they're pointing out that the reason it's so annoying,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 and this definitely does ring true,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 is that compared to a lawnmower,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 which can be as loud,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 but operates at the same kind of frequency

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 and volume the whole time,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 leaf blow is really go up and down, don't they?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 So you can't predict it.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 So you're constantly being shocked by its volume increases

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 and decreases.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 - That's very interesting.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 - That's what stresses you out.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 - How long have we had leaf blowers, by the way?

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Does anyone know?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Since about the 50s or 60s?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 - Yeah, 50s.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Except in Japan, in 19th century,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 they used like bellows that used for a fire as leaf blowers.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 - Oh, they.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 - Yeah, I haven't seen a photo of the bellows.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 I tried to find one,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 and I couldn't find a picture of Japanese ancient leaf blowing bellows.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 - No, but there is an early book.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 But the 1950s reference is weird.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 If anyone can tell us if this is true,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Wikipedia claims, and this is from a book called,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 "Everything you ever needed to know about leaf blowers."

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 So you would have thought this would be the authority on it.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 But this claims it was invented by a guy called Dom Quinto,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 who originally designed it in the 1950s as an agricultural sprayer.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 But people were taking out the spraying device

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 and just using it to blow their leaves on it.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 But there's no evidence aside from this book

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 that this Dom Quinto chap ever existed.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 So if you are him, always offspring, get in touch.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 - Do you know who invented the rake?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 - No.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 - Is it Mike Rake?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 No, it's not Mike Rake.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 I mean, these are always a bit dubious, aren't they?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 But apparently the steel rake,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 which is kind of a bit springy,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 and the modern day one that's good for raking stuff with,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 was invented by a guy called Chester Greenwood,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 who also supposedly invented earmuffs.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 - Really?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 - Apparently.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 - Wow.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 - And he's quite famous in North America in Maine

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 that there's a certain town where every year

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 they have a celebration of his inventing.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 - What are they doing?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 They've put a load of earmuffs to go on raking stuff out.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 - Yeah.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 - To drown out the noise of the leaf blowers.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 - They're trying to protest against.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 - They kind of do that, I think.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 They kind of wear earmuffs.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 They have an earmuff parade and stuff.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 - They have a parade!

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 - I think they don't really bother about the rake part

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 of it that much.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 They're more bothered about the earmuffs

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 because he was quite young when he invented them.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 He was like 16 or 17 or so.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 - I thought it was 13.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 - 13, yeah, it could be.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 - Maine sounds like a very exciting place to live, doesn't it?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 That's their highlight of the year.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 - Well, the thing is, it's cold and they have a lot of trees.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 So earmuffs and rakes are the kind of things you might invent

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 if you live there.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 - And they have every major horror story

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 that we know of in popular culture,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 set there through Stephen King,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 because he lives in Bangor, Maine.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 So it, the clown, is from Maine and...

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 - Okay, you can't credit an entire state for one person

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 that it's produced.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 (laughter)

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 - I know, but well done, Maine.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 - There is a cool thing you can do with leaf blowers,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 which is turn them into a hovercraft.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 - Can you?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 - Yeah.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 There's a very cool video online of a Texan man

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 called Ryan Craven.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 So shout out to Texas who created Ryan Craven.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 (laughter)

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Who sort of four of them together into a kind of platform

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 and he puts the skateboard across the platform.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 And it hovers very, very low off the ground,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 but it does hover.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 - You know, on Fallen Leaves,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 I was actually looking at this for cause in the TV show

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 we did this week, no such things in news.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 We were talking about Chernobyl.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 - Is that still available on iPlayer?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 - I think it might be, yeah.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 And actually, if you're international, it's on YouTube.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 - That's it.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 - But that's besides the point, Jay.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 - Jay, how would you find that?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 - You go to Know Such Things The News.com.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 - Thanks for asking.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 - Yeah.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Anyway, we recorded a TV show this week.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 And we mentioned Chernobyl.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 (laughter)

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 And Leaves in Chernobyl don't decompose

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 because the radioactivity means that the bacteria

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 are no longer there, can no longer survive.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 So they can't decompose the leaves.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 And so there are, you know, that it's missing this fungus

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 and the worms and the microbes and stuff like that.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 And so it's just building up this huge floor of dead leaves.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 And at the moment, if a forest fire started,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 which can't happen, it's that in temperatures,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 it would be a complete disaster with spread radiation,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 much, much further and wider than it is already,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 because it would just catch fire to all these dry dead leaves

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 out on the ground.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 - That's like in Australia, a sort of Aussie non-nuclear version

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 of that is the eucalyptus tree,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 because their leaves, when they drop off the tree,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 they have a kind of sort of what's called like a toxic name palm

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 thing about them in that they're too hard to break down

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 for all the insects and animals.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 They sit there, dry as hell.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 And if a forest fire starts and it hits a eucalyptus patch,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 that will just go massively up in flame,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 just sitting there waiting to be caught on fire.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 - And this must be because a eucalyptus tree

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 is one of the trees that love being set on fire,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 because how they spread their seeds.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 - Yes, they love to be set on fire.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 They sort of have an inner tree waiting

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 to break out of the bigger tree.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 And forest fires is what brings that to happen.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 - I think they're pretty much ambivalent about the whole thing.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 - Do you think they don't even know their trees?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 - In 2011, someone patented a glove rake,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 which is really cool.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 It's a normal glove, except it's got these five long,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 you look a bit like him with scissors hands,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 except we were able to break hands.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 And you could just go around breaking stuff up

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 with your bare hands.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 - You have to be on your hands and knees.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 - You would have to be on your hands and knees.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 - That's not going to be nice.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 I mean, because it's the middle of autumn.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 It's going to be damp.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 - Edward rake hands, by the way,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 would have been really useful in that scene

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 where Edward Scissor-Hands cuts all the hedges.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 (laughing)

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 He could have been on the side cleaning up.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 - Yeah, there's a lot.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 Edward, been back hands comes along.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 (laughing)

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 Guys, why are we all called Edward?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 (laughing)

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 - We're not related.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 We've got different surnames.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 (laughing)

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 - They've all got the surnames.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 - Hands.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 - Wait, is it a double barrel surname?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 - Yeah, so what are the married Mrs. Scissor?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 One of the married Mrs. Rake.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 - I've never noticed before the moment

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 where we come up with a title of an episode.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 I think no such thing as Edward, been back hands.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 (laughing)

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Okay, it is time to move on to our final fact of the show

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 and that is Chuzinsky.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 - Yes, my fact is that early humans had spiky penises.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 (laughing)

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 - That is insane.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 How early?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 - I actually couldn't believe it.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Just a couple of weeks ago.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 - 6.30 this month.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 (laughing)

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 - No, this was a study on human genes that was done in 2011

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 and it found that about 700,000 years ago,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 so before our common ancestors split into modern humans

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 and the Andethals, then we have the gene

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 that carries penis spines.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 And then that gene seems to have been deleted

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 when we evolved into modern humans today.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 But lots of other, like almost all other primates

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 still have penis spines.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 - Too bad.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 - Yeah, they do except for spider monkeys, I think,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 all primates have penis spines.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 And what do the spines feel like as in...

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 (laughing)

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 If I gripped a chimped penis, would I be arrested?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 - Be arrested, yeah.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 (laughing)

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 - Would I cut my hands?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Would the palms of my hands be sliced?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 - The ones on primates I think are more bumpy.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 Some are not really spiky spines, like cats, I think, too.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 But I think they're more like lumps.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 I've slightly blunt spiked.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 - You've never seen the film with Tisopee in this, have you?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 (laughing)

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 - So just to go into quickly, the reason that we might well,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 that men might have had spiky penises in the past.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 We're not totally sure about it.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 But we think it might be because what it can do is

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 it can help clear out rival sperm from a female vagina.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 So if you get the spikes in, then as it's sort of retracting,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 they scrape the edge of a vagina

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 and they'll bring out any sperm that's been left in there

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 by someone else.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 And they can break through a little sperm sack

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 and break it open to make the sperm.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 - No animals, isn't it?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 I think dragonflies have like spayed shaped penises

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 that they do with that.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 - It must be really hard to study the evolution

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 of human penises because the lack of bone means that

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 how can you, how can you, you just, there's nothing.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 - So erotic, all bones, no bone.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 - All bone and bone.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 - All bone and bone.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 (laughing)

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 - That's what you said that a few times.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 (laughing)

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 - I've gotta change my strapline on a lot of dating sites.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 (laughing)

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 - We might have had a bone.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 I must stop saying we, in reference to our penises,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 then might have had a bone.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 We don't know, but other primates do have a penile bone,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 I think, don't they?

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 And it has a lot of advantages having a bone there

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 because it means you can push it out much quicker

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 than having to wait for the blood to engorge it.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 (laughing)

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 Just flip right out and it can stay out for longer.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 And I think Richard Dawkins is one.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 (laughing)

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 - Richard Dawkins, in the selfish gene,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 wrote that the advantage of humans not having this

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 is that having to get blood flowing in there

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 shows that you've got like a healthy blood flow,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 shows is kind of a sign of good health,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 so women are more attracted to it.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 So that might be why we've a men of evolved.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 - Okay.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 - Penises without the bone,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 because it's harder to get it blown up.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 - I've heard so, in place of the bone,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 there is a new thing that they're testing out,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 which is a metal rod.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 So some men could now have a metal rod inside their penis.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 And the idea is for,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 it's done, do you remember where it's done, Andy?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 - In hospitals mostly.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 (laughing)

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 - If it's big off with you and about,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 you should be very careful.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 (laughing)

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 - So the idea is that this is for people

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 suffering from erectile dysfunction

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 and if they've gone through various courses,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 they're gonna then say on health services

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 or whatever they will say you can have this.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 And the idea is that it's a little metal rod inside,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 but when you want an erection,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 you can press a button like a remote control

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 and it pre-heats this metal bar

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 to a heat point where it expands within you.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 - Yo, I'm never gonna get on a flight, are you?

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 (laughing)

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 - I mean, that's just not,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 it's just not gonna happen, you know?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 Every single time you're gonna set it off,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 they're gonna get that paddle thing.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 You're gonna go up and down your body,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 you can get to the rod.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 - Yeah.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 - What, and you think you just go,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 never mind, I'm going home, doesn't matter.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 - I think that would happen, yeah.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 - Yeah.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 - The other thing is you can get a bit of cartilage

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 but if you have erectile problems,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 and then you have to just kind of maneuver

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 the penis into position.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 So it's kind of permanently erect from that point.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 That's in Mary Roach's book, "Bonk,"

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 which is about science and sex,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 and it's an amazing book.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 - Oh, it's incredible book, yeah.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 - So this is partly about how males

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 of various species manage to get rid of competition,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 'cause the spines are often used to scrape,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 to scrape out the sperm out of the vagina.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 - Yeah.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 - And so I was looking at other ways

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 that you get rid of the competition.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 And one is that, in mice, sperm club together

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 as a group to beat rival sperm.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 - It's exactly like--

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 - Like where I saw it.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 - What?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 (laughing)

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 - Yeah.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 - The jets of the sperm?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 (laughing)

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 - It's exactly like in a cycling race,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 which James will know more about,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 where they move faster if they move as a group,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 so they can tell if they're the sperm

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 that belong to the same person,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 and all the sperm that belong to that person get together,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 and all the sperm that belong to another person get together.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 This is in these mice inside this female mouse.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 - Yeah.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 - And so they, as a group, they move much faster

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 than they do individually.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 What's that called?

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 It's like the--

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 - Peloton, peloton effect.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 - It's a peloton.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 It's the peloton of sperm.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 And then when they get near the finish line,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 suddenly they all start to beat them away.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 - Someone breaks away.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 - Yeah.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 - And then the muck haven't dish sperm wins.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 - Exactly.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 - Yeah.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 - So they're just programmed.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 It'll be smell or--

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 - No, what is it?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 What is it?

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 How do they know this?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 - How can they grow together?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 - How can they grow together?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 - Well, cells can be programmed to do things.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 So I imagine it must be that.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 It's inside the DNA of the cell.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 That has instructions of what it should do.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 It makes the tails wag.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 - Yeah.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 - And also, if they have their specific rendition

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 of "Keep Cool" from my site's story,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 then they can tell.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 - Which is the best song to sing for a sperm.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Because you do need to keep lower than the ambient temperature of the body.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 - Yeah, it's weird that they want the lyrics in the original website.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 (laughter)

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 - Okay, that is it.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 And as all of our facts,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
