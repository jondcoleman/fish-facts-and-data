00:00:00,00:00:06,"""Hey there Club Fish members, Dan here. Hope you're all doing well. Welcome to a bonus"
00:00:06,00:00:10,compilation episode. These are all the bits that didn't make it to the main show either
00:00:10,00:00:14,"because they just didn't fit the narrative or they're on a tangent, they just didn't"
00:00:14,00:00:19,"fit the shape, so we bung them all together here so that you can hear the stuff that didn't"
00:00:19,00:00:24,"make it. Quite excitingly, for this particular compilation, it's not just the voice of us"
00:00:24,00:00:28,"for fishers, but we have a bunch of guests, so you'll remember we did some Edinburgh"
00:00:28,00:00:33,"shows recently, and a bunch of the offcuts from those recordings have made their way"
00:00:33,00:00:38,"here, so you're gonna hear, and you'll be hearing them in this order, Ian Smith, Elf"
00:00:38,00:00:43,"Lions, you're gonna get a couple of sentences from Ahir Shah, there's Andrew O'Neill, and"
00:00:43,00:00:48,"then finally Nish Kumar, and you're also gonna hear a couple of audience-submitted facts"
00:00:48,00:00:53,that we riff on as well. So that's the show for today. Thank you everyone who came to
00:00:53,00:00:56,our live shows by the way. We had two live shows very recently at the London podcast
00:00:56,00:01:00,"festival, Jamie Morton from My Dad Wrote a Porno was there, we had a really great night"
00:01:00,00:01:05,"with him, and then the following night we had Richard Osman on, and again, just a wild,"
00:01:05,00:01:10,"brilliant live show. We love our live shows so much, and if you missed out on it, they're"
00:01:10,00:01:14,"obviously gonna be coming out as edited episodes, but if you wanna see the full thing, like"
00:01:14,00:01:17,"from the moment that we walk on stage, all the way through to the quiz that we play at"
00:01:17,00:01:25,"the end, you can still get access to the live stream video. If you go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live,"
00:01:25,00:01:29,"you're gonna find a link that will take you to the Kings Place website, where you can"
00:01:29,00:01:33,buy the live stream video. That's gonna be up for the next week. We're trying to see
00:01:33,00:01:38,"if we can get an extension on it, so if you wanna check that out, do that, and you'll"
00:01:38,00:01:42,"notice, if you have headed to our website, that there is another link there for the Cheltenham"
00:01:42,00:01:47,"Literary Festival. That's happening on the 16th of October, so we're doing another live"
00:01:47,00:01:51,"show. It's part of this brilliant literature festival, and we are gonna be joined on stage"
00:01:51,00:01:56,"by one of our favorite people, Rachel Parris. So if you happen to be in the area, come and"
00:01:56,00:02:01,"say hi. Okay, let's get on to this compilation, and we begin with Ian Smith, who by the way"
00:02:01,00:02:05,"was nominated for the best show at the Edinburgh Fringe this year for his show, ""Foot Spa"
00:02:05,00:02:11,"Half Empty"", so that's very cool. But let's get into it. Here we go, on with the compilation."
00:02:11,00:02:33,"I found a story that happened in 2008 of a real-life jigsaw problem, and I wonder, 'cause"
00:02:33,00:02:38,"I can't find an update on it, whether or not this person is still trying to solve it. So"
00:02:38,00:02:47,"this is a bin man who was called Graham Hill, and he found in a bunch of bags, £10,000 worth"
00:02:47,00:02:53,"of £10 and £20 notes, and he handed it over to the police. He said, 'I found this', and"
00:02:53,00:02:57,after the amount of time that's required for them to keep it and wait for someone to claim
00:02:57,00:03:03,"it, had passed, they gave it back to him, so he was 10,000 quid richer, except for some"
00:03:03,00:03:08,"reason every single one of the bills had been cut into tiny small pieces, and the Bank of"
00:03:08,00:03:13,"England had said, 'If you can put them all back together, absolutely they're legal tender,"
00:03:13,00:03:19,"and you've got £10,000, but right now you just have shreds of £10,000'. And so that's"
00:03:19,00:03:24,"what he has in his house, so he apparently was gonna make an attempt to try and jigsaw"
00:03:24,00:03:28,"piece it back together. When was this done? 2008. Wow, it's a different time. Like these"
00:03:28,00:03:33,"days you get bankers who have lost their Bitcoin and put it in a dump, and they're trying to"
00:03:33,00:03:38,"get that back, but in those days it was just bin men with bags of shredded money, wasn't"
00:03:38,00:03:43,"it? Yeah. Because if your money rips, you can put it together with sellotape. Like I've"
00:03:43,00:03:48,"seen that before where I've got a note that is stuck, and that's fine. Yeah, I think what"
00:03:48,00:03:54,"you need is there's a serial number on every bank note, and that needs to be exactly correct"
00:03:54,00:03:58,"because they'll check it, and so if it's in two pieces, that's easy, you just sellotape"
00:03:58,00:04:03,"it, but if it's in a thousand pieces. Yeah. How did he know it was worth £10,000? Like"
00:04:03,00:04:09,"if you presented me with a bin bag full of shredded money, how would you assess? I think"
00:04:09,00:04:14,"that's about £10,000 worth of that. I can do that with complete notes. I have no idea."
00:04:14,00:04:17,"So you can weigh them. So you can weigh them. You know how much paper there is, and you know"
00:04:17,00:04:23,"how much one note weighs, and you just divide them. Yes. That's clever. That's clever. I'm"
00:04:23,00:04:28,"just being reminded, one of my first ever paid gigs that I ever got in stand-up was up the"
00:04:28,00:04:34,"creek, and I was handed an envelope of money, and I think it was something like £200 that"
00:04:34,00:04:39,"I'd made, and I was very excitedly saying to my friends, ""Let's go to the pub walking"
00:04:39,00:04:47,"down the street,"" and I ripped open the envelope, and hadn't... I ripped it over on the side,"
00:04:47,00:04:52,"and I tore all the money. This was before it went to plastic. I tore all the money,"
00:04:52,00:04:59,and Gustav Windcab blew off the top third of all my notes. And yet you continued with
00:04:59,00:05:04,"your comedy career, despite that very obvious side from the universe that it wasn't for"
00:05:04,00:05:08,"you. Well, you can talk about it. That gave me five minutes for my next set."
00:05:08,00:05:14,"One of the... This is only vaguely related, but it's one of the funniest things I've seen,"
00:05:14,00:05:20,"and it does involve wind, but I was in New Zealand with Finn Taylor, and I think Phil"
00:05:20,00:05:27,sang. And Finn Taylor was talking about how he had a small part in the new Tomb Raider
00:05:27,00:05:32,"film, and I think it was cut from the final edit. I'm not sure if it was on special features"
00:05:32,00:05:38,"or anything, but he basically said, ""This cast and crew cap is the only memento that"
00:05:38,00:05:45,"I have from the film."" And then almost immediately, like a sitcom, Gustav Wind blew the hat into"
00:05:45,00:05:51,"the water as the boat's going away, and was just sort of like... Almost didn't laugh,"
00:05:51,00:05:55,"but just remember saying, ""That's the funniest thing. That's the funniest thing I've ever"
00:05:55,00:05:59,"seen. The timing of it."" But I still felt like... But I can't laugh because I think it's sad"
00:05:59,00:06:08,"as well, but yeah, it was so perfect. It's lost all proof using that movie."
00:06:08,00:06:14,Would you like some beat slang? Oh yeah. Right. I'm feeling hairy. What's that? My tender
00:06:14,00:06:25,"profile. No, good is good, feeling hairy. Feeling good. My rod. My rod. Car. Like a hot rod."
00:06:25,00:06:31,"Exactly. Let's stable the iron. Put it back in your trousers, mate. It's parked the car."
00:06:31,00:06:36,"What's a kick stick? Kick stick. It's not on your bike, is it? It's not the... No, that's"
00:06:36,00:06:41,"a kick stand. Nice. It's a cigarette. Kick stick. To give you a kick. Right. Yes, sir."
00:06:41,00:06:45,But they were very quickly taking the piss out of the beats. Yeah. And the Village Voice
00:06:45,00:06:49,"magazine in New York, they ran a rent a beat-knit competition. Right. Where you could hire a"
00:06:49,00:06:52,"beat-knit for your party. They did it as a joke, and then they actually, I think, started"
00:06:52,00:06:59,"getting beat-poets in who said, ""Yeah, I could do with $40."" All right. Yeah. Bongo's optional."
00:06:59,00:07:01,"Yeah, I don't know how they earned any money, because most of them didn't actually publish"
00:07:01,00:07:06,"anything, or like a lot of their... One of the main members, Neil Cassidy, I don't think"
00:07:06,00:07:09,"he published anything. Oh, he did? Well, maybe posthumously, yeah. Possthumously. Yeah,"
00:07:09,00:07:14,"it's not what it helps, is it? Can you just put this beer on my tab? I'm going to publish"
00:07:14,00:07:19,"some stuff posthumously, and I'll make sure you get it. Posthumously tab is a great idea."
00:07:19,00:07:26,"I'm going to be massive, I promise. One of my favourite clowns from history is Lulu Adams,"
00:07:26,00:07:33,a UK clown. And she was known as one of the first ever women circus clowns. She was born
00:07:33,00:07:39,"in 1900, and she was like the first ever female clown to appear at Olympia. And I just think"
00:07:39,00:07:43,"she was incredible. She played the bagpipe, she could ride a horse. At the same time,"
00:07:43,00:07:48,"her whole family were in the circus, like just a proper, old-fashioned showwoman show"
00:07:48,00:07:54,"family. And she did a double act with her husband, Albertino, and they got hired by"
00:07:54,00:07:59,"the Bertram Mill Circus, which was such a big deal. And they got offered a contract,"
00:07:59,00:08:05,"which was like, I think, $35 or £35 a week, which was the equivalent of like £2,000 a"
00:08:05,00:08:11,"week now, which was massive to go to New York to do this amazing tour of their act."
00:08:11,00:08:15,"And then they went on air, this was in 1948, and they were being interviewed on the New"
00:08:15,00:08:21,"York Radio in April on the day, the opening night, and they asked Albertino what's it"
00:08:21,00:08:29,"like to perform. And as he answered, he died on air of a heart attack. And that evening,"
00:08:29,00:08:34,Lulu Adams went on stage and continued to do the double act. And she completed the entire
00:08:34,00:08:40,nine-month contract on her own. And the newspaper article was like the first female clown is
00:08:40,00:08:45,"smiling even though her heart is breaking. But it's just, and then she continued performing"
00:08:45,00:08:49,for the rest of her life and then moved to Brighton and made costumes for performers.
00:08:49,00:08:54,What a professional. That's professionalism. And I want to say that if all the three of
00:08:54,00:08:59,"you guys who do the podcast with me died, I would continue to do it as if nothing had"
00:08:59,00:09:00,happened.
00:09:00,00:09:07,"Right, Anna, we know. You say that every week, Anna, and it's starting to pull."
00:09:07,00:09:12,"Yeah, my booby traps keep failing, it's a shame."
00:09:12,00:09:18,"I really miss what sounds like the golden age of non-imperson dating, which is the video"
00:09:18,00:09:25,"dating thing. So this was on TV as a kind of joke when I was growing up. Like, you sit"
00:09:25,00:09:27,"in a studio, you record a video of yourself."
00:09:27,00:09:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:28,00:09:33,Yeah. There was a guy called Jeffrey Elman. He set it up. He was a young videographer.
00:09:33,00:09:37,"And so you have this huge library of videos, and then you just watch like a five minute"
00:09:37,00:09:41,"tape of any potential person. And you say, right, I'm interested in Jennifer. And then"
00:09:41,00:09:47,"Jennifer gets a phone call saying, Greg is interested in you. Can you go in and view"
00:09:47,00:09:48,Greg's video?
00:09:48,00:09:49,Right.
00:09:49,00:09:50,And literally a VHS.
00:09:50,00:09:51,Yes.
00:09:51,00:09:52,"Yeah, yeah."
00:09:52,00:09:55,"And so, like, it's laborious. But the thing is, the way the interviews were conducted,"
00:09:55,00:09:58,"this guy, Jeffrey Elman, did the interviews himself, right? You'd fill out a form of your"
00:09:58,00:10:00,preferences and then he would do a little interview with you.
00:10:00,00:10:06,"But he would also kind of interrogate you. So listen to this. Elman recollected, I'd"
00:10:06,00:10:10,"say to you, you've got five kids and you live way out in the suburbs. Now, I don't mean"
00:10:10,00:10:14,"to insult you, Ethel, but how dateable are you? And then Ethel's on the spot having to"
00:10:14,00:10:18,"answer. Like, well, I'm, you know, I can send the kids off to their auntie or whatever. Like,"
00:10:18,00:10:20,as in she's having to answer for herself.
00:10:20,00:10:22,"Yeah, that's a bit probing."
00:10:22,00:10:26,"But it's kind of, I suppose, the reasoning was she's proving, oh no, look, this is how"
00:10:26,00:10:27,great I am as a match or a prospect.
00:10:27,00:10:30,They must give Ethel the questions beforehand.
00:10:30,00:10:31,I don't know.
00:10:31,00:10:34,"I quite like the idea of the Jeremy Paxman kind of dating service, whereas if you answer"
00:10:34,00:10:37,"on a plate, it's just seven-ten points."
00:10:37,00:10:38,"It's just the same question, yeah."
00:10:38,00:10:46,"So you'd like films. Well, I've seen them. It had 17 franchises by the mid-80s. And there"
00:10:46,00:10:50,"was one, there was even, there was one specifically for people in Washington, D.C. with herpes."
00:10:50,00:10:52,That's how successful it was.
00:10:52,00:10:53,Wow.
00:10:53,00:10:54,I don't know why.
00:10:54,00:10:55,I don't know why.
00:10:55,00:10:59,"I suppose if you have herpes, then you should only shag people with herpes. Is that the"
00:10:59,00:11:00,thinking?
00:11:00,00:11:01,"Absolutely. That is the thinking, clearly."
00:11:01,00:11:02,Yeah.
00:11:02,00:11:05,"And that's, we've mentioned this before, but that's basically one of the reasons the"
00:11:05,00:11:10,YouTube guys gave for setting up YouTube at all was that video dating. So you would put
00:11:10,00:11:14,"up a video of yourself in this exact same way, but you're knocking out VHS and you just"
00:11:14,00:11:18,click to the next link. That was largely part of the creation of it.
00:11:18,00:11:22,I watch everything on two-time speed with stuff like that to get through it. So I'd
00:11:22,00:11:24,"be disappointed when they turned up with normal, bassy voices."
00:11:24,00:11:30,"Shit, Monk sorted it."
00:11:30,00:11:35,"If we gave dinosaurs to every country in the world, it wouldn't help because dinosaurs"
00:11:35,00:11:36,couldn't live today.
00:11:36,00:11:37,Really?
00:11:37,00:11:44,"And that is because in the Cretaceous era, they had about 35% oxygen and today we have"
00:11:44,00:11:49,about 21% oxygen. So there wouldn't be enough oxygen for them to live. They'd all be sort
00:11:49,00:11:51,of gasping for air the whole time.
00:11:51,00:11:52,That'd be terrible.
00:11:52,00:11:59,"You're telling me that this series of documentaries I watch, set on Isle and Nubart."
00:11:59,00:12:05,"I don't know. I haven't seen it, but they all have like gas masks and equipment."
00:12:05,00:12:06,It's pretty upsetting.
00:12:06,00:12:08,You haven't seen Jurassic Park?
00:12:08,00:12:09,I'm afraid I haven't.
00:12:09,00:12:10,Not any of them.
00:12:10,00:12:15,"No, but there's a new one out, isn't there? So I think they might have to catch up."
00:12:15,00:12:18,"Start with the new one and work backwards. That's how you're meant to do it, like the"
00:12:18,00:12:21,Star Wars films.
00:12:21,00:12:27,Here's the thing on diplomacy. So we talked about dinosaur diplomacy. There's other things
00:12:27,00:12:33,"like ping pong diplomacy, where China and America played ping pong against each other."
00:12:33,00:12:37,"There is panda diplomacy, where China gave out pandas to different countries. And I"
00:12:37,00:12:42,found one called xylophone diplomacy. Does anyone know what that is?
00:12:42,00:12:43,Feels like we can guess.
00:12:43,00:12:47,Try the dinosaur thing. You play the ribs of the dinosaur like a xylophone and that
00:12:47,00:12:50,lightens the mood at tricky summits.
00:12:50,00:12:54,You send everyone xylophones and that gives the primary school children something to do
00:12:54,00:12:55,and parents are very grateful.
00:12:55,00:13:01,"No, I read this in The Economist and it says xylophone diplomacy, a made up term created"
00:13:01,00:13:07,in order to have an entry for the letter x in The Economist A to Z of international relations.
00:13:07,00:13:10,"Right, thanks a lot."
00:13:10,00:13:11,Love it.
00:13:11,00:13:14,"The way all these things worked, I guess, is you sent in a bit of money and you filled"
00:13:14,00:13:19,"out a questionnaire, which could be very long. So the operation match was 75 questions."
00:13:19,00:13:22,And then they took your questionnaire and they tried to match it up with others using
00:13:22,00:13:25,"a computer algorithm, which is why it was computerized."
00:13:25,00:13:31,"I think a good way of doing it would be to have like 10,000 questions that you have to"
00:13:31,00:13:35,go through and you're matched by how far you go through before you give up.
00:13:35,00:13:36,That's very good.
00:13:36,00:13:40,Because I think I would be well matched to someone who had the same level of getting
00:13:40,00:13:42,bored quickly as I do.
00:13:42,00:13:46,I think you'd answer them all because you're a completist. Do you like long lists of information?
00:13:46,00:13:51,And probably the person who dated me would need to be similar to put up with that.
00:13:51,00:13:55,"I do have a dating app for you, James. I know you're off the market, but there is a new"
00:13:55,00:13:59,"one in the USA called SCORE, which is a dating app for people who have a good to excellent"
00:13:59,00:14:00,credit rating.
00:14:00,00:14:01,Oh!
00:14:01,00:14:02,And it's...
00:14:02,00:14:03,I do have a good credit rating.
00:14:03,00:14:04,I knew you were excellent.
00:14:04,00:14:09,"I just think that's so... I think that's quite good, actually, like..."
00:14:09,00:14:10,It's very sensible.
00:14:10,00:14:12,I disagree. I think that's a good case of opposites attract.
00:14:12,00:14:16,"Actually, you're so right, but much more responsible to pay yourself up with someone with a bad"
00:14:16,00:14:18,one so you can raise them up to your level.
00:14:18,00:14:19,Absolutely.
00:14:19,00:14:20,That's not how it works. They drag you down. Anna.
00:14:20,00:14:21,That's what happens in love.
00:14:21,00:14:22,You're right.
00:14:22,00:14:23,You're right.
00:14:23,00:14:24,Drag each other down.
00:14:24,00:14:33,"I've got one here from Jeffrey Partica, which is a fishy stretch, it's been said."
00:14:33,00:14:37,That was disgusting.
00:14:37,00:14:43,"It is a stretch of a fact, but I'm reading it because I know Tom Cruise is a huge, huge"
00:14:43,00:14:44,deal in Andy's life.
00:14:44,00:14:50,"So, Tom Cruise took up race car driving and got married because of the Russian Revolution."
00:14:50,00:14:51,Okay.
00:14:51,00:14:58,"Now, it's a long journey. There's a long journey to get to what this is. 1917, Rubin Malmoulian"
00:14:58,00:15:02,was studying at a stage production at the Imperial Moscow University in the hopes of
00:15:02,00:15:07,"directing, and he was from a Tsarist family, so he fled America when the revolution broke"
00:15:07,00:15:08,out.
00:15:08,00:15:09,He became a director...
00:15:09,00:15:10,Fled to America.
00:15:10,00:15:11,Sorry.
00:15:11,00:15:13,Very few people fled America when the Russian Revolution broke out.
00:15:13,00:15:15,That's too cautious.
00:15:15,00:15:19,"Yeah, he fled to America."
00:15:19,00:15:25,"And years later, he becomes the initial director of Cleopatra with Elizabeth Taylor."
00:15:25,00:15:29,"There was lots of problems, constant script changes, creative differences, so he was"
00:15:29,00:15:31,eventually replaced as the director.
00:15:31,00:15:36,"So then Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor were scheduled to be in the movie together,"
00:15:36,00:15:40,"but because of the shooting delays, because of this, Taylor was prevented from joining"
00:15:40,00:15:45,"the film, so both roles were recast with Robert Mitchum and Shirley MacLean, which freed up"
00:15:45,00:15:49,Paul Newman to be in The Hustler with Jackie Gleason.
00:15:49,00:15:54,"The Hustler is credited with popularizing pool in America, giving Paul Newman a lifelong"
00:15:54,00:15:56,love of the game.
00:15:56,00:16:01,It also allowed him to reprise his role as Fast Eddie Felsen 25 years later in the Scorsese
00:16:01,00:16:03,"sequel, The Color of Money."
00:16:03,00:16:04,James has started eating a biscuit.
00:16:04,00:16:06,He's likely performatively.
00:16:06,00:16:09,He could be more far away from the microphone right now.
00:16:09,00:16:11,That's what happens when he gets interested.
00:16:11,00:16:14,I don't think I'm going to be needed for a few more minutes.
00:16:14,00:16:18,"It was in this movie, as Fast Eddie Felsen, that Paul Newman introduced Tom Cruise to"
00:16:18,00:16:21,the thrill of driving too fast.
00:16:21,00:16:26,"Thanks to his new love, Cruise was cast in the Nascar movie Days of Thunder."
00:16:26,00:16:27,He met Nicole Kidman.
00:16:27,00:16:29,"Oh, that's the only one, isn't it?"
00:16:29,00:16:30,Yeah.
00:16:30,00:16:31,And then it just ends.
00:16:31,00:16:33,"There might have been a few other consequences due to the Russian Revolution, but I think"
00:16:33,00:16:36,it'd be difficult to find something more inane.
00:16:36,00:16:39,That's certainly the worst consequence.
00:16:39,00:16:41,"No, that's terrific."
00:16:41,00:16:45,Tom Cruise could have had a career as a kind of sensitive character actor.
00:16:45,00:16:46,Yeah.
00:16:46,00:16:48,But were it not for the Russian Revolution?
00:16:48,00:16:49,There you go.
00:16:49,00:16:50,Yeah.
00:16:50,00:16:51,Great.
00:16:51,00:16:52,Nice.
00:16:52,00:16:53,Love it.
00:16:53,00:16:54,Just on guitars.
00:16:54,00:16:58,"Can I give everyone a guitar song recommendation that's called, it's really good."
00:16:58,00:17:03,"It's called United Breaks Guitars, and it was a hit in 2009."
00:17:03,00:17:05,"Have you, you've heard everything, Andrew."
00:17:05,00:17:06,He's nodding along.
00:17:06,00:17:10,"It's a musician called Dave Carroll who was, and I guess this must be the bane of a lot"
00:17:10,00:17:12,of guitar players' lives.
00:17:12,00:17:18,"He was on a plane and he watched the baggage handlers throw his $3,500 guitar all over"
00:17:18,00:17:19,the shop.
00:17:19,00:17:21,"So, my golf clubs?"
00:17:21,00:17:27,"You could sing an equally popular, relatable song about that."
00:17:27,00:17:31,"And it's really good, and he wrote this song about how they've broken his guitar."
00:17:31,00:17:34,"I think it's great, but they're nice, tragically like country."
00:17:34,00:17:35,"It's wonderful, isn't it?"
00:17:35,00:17:36,It's really good.
00:17:36,00:17:39,"It's that thing where, you know, this incredibly precious thing."
00:17:39,00:17:44,"I mean, obviously there's a kind of, like a hand luggage arms race, isn't there?"
00:17:44,00:17:49,"And there was originally a story about people employed in airports are, they're rewarded"
00:17:49,00:17:55,like a few quid for each bag they sort of refuse to put on.
00:17:55,00:17:58,"Because it's, imagine how difficult that job actually is."
00:17:58,00:18:01,You've got a massive stag do who haven't read the terms and conditions.
00:18:01,00:18:02,"They've all got bags, two bigs to go on."
00:18:02,00:18:06,"You've got to tell everyone it's, you know, you can't take it on, and it's 60 extra quids"
00:18:06,00:18:08,to put it on the hold each.
00:18:08,00:18:13,"But with guitars, yeah, just, you know, this incredibly precious thing, what you have to"
00:18:13,00:18:19,"do is down tune them when you, if you're going to put them in the luggage hold, put it in"
00:18:19,00:18:24,"a hard case, down tune it so you haven't got the tension on the strings."
00:18:24,00:18:28,"If it gets dropped or smashed, that tension can make the neck cave in."
00:18:28,00:18:29,"Yeah, right."
00:18:29,00:18:30,Wow.
00:18:30,00:18:31,Interesting.
00:18:31,00:18:37,And that taking the tuning down is actually an entire style of guitaring in Hawaii.
00:18:37,00:18:39,And I'd never heard of this.
00:18:39,00:18:40,Slack key guitar.
00:18:40,00:18:41,"Oh, wow."
00:18:41,00:18:47,Slack keyed guitar is where you basically are detuning at least three strings of your
00:18:47,00:18:51,guitar in order to create an open cord that you can play.
00:18:51,00:18:54,"And then you can use the top notes as your baseline, and then you can play with the open"
00:18:54,00:18:55,cord for the rest.
00:18:55,00:18:59,"The thing about it is, like I was talking earlier about hiding your fingers behind a"
00:18:59,00:19:04,"handkerchief, slack key guitar in Hawaii was also something where you would hand down the"
00:19:04,00:19:09,tunings of each of those six strings to your family and not let anyone else know.
00:19:09,00:19:13,So it became like the family style of playing this particular guitar and we know a bunch
00:19:13,00:19:14,of them now.
00:19:14,00:19:18,"Yeah, it's become more open now, but that was, it was, it was handed down as the family"
00:19:18,00:19:19,secret for how you would play guitar.
00:19:19,00:19:23,And so everyone would have their own specific open cord.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Wow.
00:19:24,00:19:25,All these secret guitar chords.
00:19:25,00:19:29,"I had no idea that it was such an exciting secretive world, the world of guitar playing."
00:19:29,00:19:33,And we're sure it's not just because people always have to fly to Hawaii on a plane and
00:19:33,00:19:35,then they've left their guitars on strong.
00:19:35,00:19:41,"Oh, fuck, I better make this a thing."
00:19:41,00:19:44,"The first album I ever bought was the Jimi Hendrix album, which was great, because he"
00:19:44,00:19:46,does sound like nobody else.
00:19:46,00:19:48,Like it is an unbelievable sound he has.
00:19:48,00:19:53,And it was partly thanks to his sound engineer guy who was called Roger Mayer.
00:19:53,00:19:57,"And this is where the other weird military link comes in, because Roger Mayer sort of"
00:19:57,00:20:01,"qualified, did all his early work in acoustics in the Royal Naval Scientific Service, working"
00:20:01,00:20:03,on underwater warfare.
00:20:03,00:20:05,He was on submarines.
00:20:05,00:20:07,He was working on the stuff of keeping submarines silent.
00:20:07,00:20:10,"You know, that was his whole project when he was in the, in the Navy."
00:20:10,00:20:15,"So I just love this quote, when a steel hulled sub is running silent, you know, the whole"
00:20:15,00:20:19,point about submarines is you stay completely quiet and no one knows that you're there.
00:20:19,00:20:22,"When it's running silent, the sound of a dropped spanner can be picked up and the"
00:20:22,00:20:27,subsposition located from up to 160 kilometers away.
00:20:27,00:20:28,What?
00:20:28,00:20:29,What?
00:20:29,00:20:30,Imagine that.
00:20:30,00:20:32,Can that be true?
00:20:32,00:20:35,"He, like, I know what he's talking about, I guess."
00:20:35,00:20:36,"He, exactly."
00:20:36,00:20:37,I can't believe it.
00:20:37,00:20:41,"So basically all of, he realized all of his work also applied to guitars and he made this"
00:20:41,00:20:46,"amazing sound effects device for Hendrix, which creates an amazing trippy harmonic sound,"
00:20:46,00:20:48,the octave above your playing.
00:20:48,00:20:51,"And he showed it to Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin and Jimmy Page said, well, that's too much"
00:20:51,00:20:52,for me.
00:20:52,00:20:53,"Yeah, that's too far out for me."
00:20:53,00:20:54,Right.
00:20:54,00:20:55,But Hendrix was into it.
00:20:55,00:20:56,Roger Mair is still alive.
00:20:56,00:20:57,He's still.
00:20:57,00:20:58,He's still around.
00:20:58,00:20:59,Yeah.
00:20:59,00:21:02,"So the question is, if you put Jimmy Hendrix on a submarine and got him to play Purple"
00:21:02,00:21:10,"H, how far away the whole world could listen?"
00:21:10,00:21:14,"That period of time is one that I'm endlessly fascinated with the kind of, you know, the"
00:21:14,00:21:18,"mid sixties or a lot of those bands, a lot of the movies that came out around that time"
00:21:18,00:21:21,are a source of perennial fascination to me.
00:21:21,00:21:26,"And one of the things that is so strange about it all is, it's obviously, it's so close"
00:21:26,00:21:32,"to the Second World War, you know, like the, and the whole cultural landscape, it's like"
00:21:32,00:21:35,when you see photos of Bob Dylan touring the mid sixties and he's occasionally just walking
00:21:35,00:21:42,"around just sort of rubble in Liverpool or something because the whole, the whole idea"
00:21:42,00:21:47,of like the free love sixties is so close to the end of the Second World War.
00:21:47,00:21:51,And there's all these people who were sort of just called like just doing military service
00:21:51,00:21:57,and then suddenly are now trying to work out how to make Jimmy Hendrix's guitar successfully
00:21:57,00:22:03,"emulate the noise that runs through his head when he takes LSD, you know, it's like."
00:22:03,00:22:04,It's such an interesting point.
00:22:04,00:22:09,I think it's something that will never certainly with the world of like rock music experience
00:22:09,00:22:13,"again, where I was listening to Ozzy Osbourne talk the other day about the Beatles and he"
00:22:13,00:22:17,"said, you just, you will never understand what the Beatles meant to us, not just the"
00:22:17,00:22:19,"music, what they meant to us."
00:22:19,00:22:22,We were in a black and white world and it went technicolor.
00:22:22,00:22:26,"We suddenly believe that life was fun again and it was through that and it's, and all"
00:22:26,00:22:28,that period is what that was.
00:22:28,00:22:32,They were building off the back of trying to get back into technicolor off the back of
00:22:32,00:22:33,war.
00:22:33,00:22:34,It's fascinating stuff.
00:22:34,00:22:35,I agree.
00:22:35,00:22:36,I'm obsessed with that period.
00:22:36,00:22:43,"In the Yellow Submarine, you're in quiet and you drop a spanner."
00:22:43,00:22:44,Here's one.
00:22:44,00:22:51,"Dolphins, says Andrew Heldenbrand, can use ultrasound to detect pregnancies and will"
00:22:51,00:22:56,"pay special attention to pregnant women, nuzzling them while scanning them with ultrasonic"
00:22:56,00:22:57,frequencies.
00:22:57,00:22:59,"That's pretty cool, isn't it?"
00:22:59,00:23:02,"Walker, can they tell you things like what sex it is?"
00:23:02,00:23:03,"Yeah, they'll say."
00:23:03,00:23:05,Does it have the right number of fingers and toes?
00:23:05,00:23:08,"It's very annoying sometimes because they'll say, you must have been hoping for a boy or"
00:23:08,00:23:11,whatever and you might not have wanted to know that yet.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"What level of detail could they turn to the dad and go, it's bad news, I think I might"
00:23:14,00:23:15,have been the neighbor.
00:23:15,00:23:20,"Are they, is that, what are they fighting now?"
00:23:20,00:23:22,What's your milkman's nose like?
00:23:22,00:23:28,"I don't think it's huge detail, but I think they could probably detect the heartbeat because"
00:23:28,00:23:33,"they can do a very, very narrow beam of echolocation, it's called buzzing and they sound like a squeaky"
00:23:33,00:23:35,door to us when they're doing it.
00:23:35,00:23:36,"That is cool, isn't it?"
00:23:36,00:23:40,"So why don't they use, when you go to have your first scan, why don't they use dolphins"
00:23:40,00:23:42,instead of the machines?
00:23:42,00:23:43,The natural way.
00:23:43,00:23:50,"When you're having your water birth, yeah, meet the literal wet nurse, Flipper."
00:23:50,00:23:52,Have you guys heard of kitten fishing?
00:23:52,00:23:53,No.
00:23:53,00:23:54,No.
00:23:54,00:23:56,Can you guess what it is?
00:23:56,00:23:57,It's not pretending to be a kitten.
00:23:57,00:24:02,So cat fishing is where you pretend to be someone you're completely not and then they
00:24:02,00:24:05,think that they're dating you but you're not doing it and then eventually you might get
00:24:05,00:24:06,some money off the most.
00:24:06,00:24:11,"So kitten fishing, I reckon, is you pretending to be yourself as a child?"
00:24:11,00:24:13,"I see, to catch pedophiles or something."
00:24:13,00:24:14,Yes.
00:24:14,00:24:15,"No, it's not that."
00:24:15,00:24:20,It is just embellishing or misrepresenting yourself online to make you more desirable.
00:24:20,00:24:22,We all do that.
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Well, that's a special way for that."
00:24:23,00:24:28,"So according to Hinge, the website, the trouble is that when you do that, it kind of defeats"
00:24:28,00:24:31,"the whole purpose of online dating, which is to find the right match."
00:24:31,00:24:34,So you really have to be kind of as close to real as possible.
00:24:34,00:24:37,"Wait, but your right match is definitely lying as well."
00:24:37,00:24:38,"I think that's how everyone's doing, right?"
00:24:38,00:24:40,"They're all banking on everyone, exaggerating."
00:24:40,00:24:43,"That's what the first day is all about, working out what the lies were."
00:24:43,00:24:44,"Yes, exactly."
00:24:44,00:24:45,OK.
00:24:45,00:24:46,What about woke fishing?
00:24:46,00:24:47,"Oh, my God."
00:24:47,00:24:48,"Oh, pretending to be woke."
00:24:48,00:24:49,"Yeah, pretending to have views."
00:24:49,00:24:50,Absolutely.
00:24:50,00:24:51,That's the thing.
00:24:51,00:24:52,"Of course I support the cause, Conrad."
00:24:52,00:24:53,Actually.
00:24:53,00:24:56,Until you're in the pants.
00:24:56,00:24:58,Then it turns out you're shameful.
00:24:58,00:25:00,"In your bedside drawer, you've got a Tory rosette."
00:25:00,00:25:01,Is that it?
00:25:01,00:25:02,It's too late.
00:25:02,00:25:03,She's in love.
00:25:03,00:25:04,It's pretty much that.
00:25:04,00:25:05,Orbiting.
00:25:05,00:25:09,Orbiting is what that's a term.
00:25:09,00:25:13,It's another term that's in like modern dating slang.
00:25:13,00:25:15,So that's circling around someone not approaching.
00:25:15,00:25:18,"Yeah, pretty much, but in an online setting."
00:25:18,00:25:23,"So staying like occasionally liking the photos, leaving the odd very, very innocuous comments"
00:25:23,00:25:27,"so that you're kind of in the orbit, but you're not really engaging with them."
00:25:27,00:25:28,And then zombieing.
00:25:28,00:25:29,Yeah.
00:25:29,00:25:30,Coming back from the dead.
00:25:30,00:25:31,Yeah.
00:25:31,00:25:33,And offering a date.
00:25:33,00:25:34,Pretty much.
00:25:34,00:25:35,Nice.
00:25:35,00:25:36,So you know what ghosting is?
00:25:36,00:25:37,Yeah.
00:25:37,00:25:39,Where you just stop replying to someone completely and pretend they don't exist.
00:25:39,00:25:40,I know about it.
00:25:40,00:25:41,"Well, it's when someone who's previously."
00:25:41,00:25:44,My wife's been doing it to me since yesterday.
00:25:44,00:25:48,It's when someone who's previously ghosted you suddenly reappears and acts as if nothing
00:25:48,00:25:49,ever happened.
00:25:49,00:25:50,Oh.
00:25:50,00:25:51,Zombieing.
00:25:51,00:25:52,That's very good.
00:25:52,00:25:53,Very good.
00:25:53,00:25:54,"Very, very good."
00:25:54,00:25:56,Jack Kerouac.
00:25:56,00:26:01,"We said he's American and he was American, but his parents were Quebeca, Quebequaz."
00:26:01,00:26:02,Quebe...
00:26:02,00:26:05,"He was, they were from Quebec."
00:26:05,00:26:12,"But that meant that until he was six years old, he only spoke Jewel."
00:26:12,00:26:18,"Jewel is like, Jewel is a sort of a dialect from Quebec."
00:26:18,00:26:22,"It's kind of half French, half English, all very, very weird."
00:26:22,00:26:27,So the name comes from how they say the word chivalre.
00:26:27,00:26:31,So chivalre is French for horse and there's a phrase to speak French like a horse means
00:26:31,00:26:33,"to speak French very, very badly."
00:26:33,00:26:39,And so they call it Jewel and they have lots of sort of English words in there.
00:26:39,00:26:46,So dompe in Jewel means to throw out the trash like it comes from the dump and they turn
00:26:46,00:26:47,it into a French thing.
00:26:47,00:26:48,That's great.
00:26:48,00:26:53,"The word from peanut is pinot, just slightly French."
00:26:53,00:26:59,"And the word poutine, you know, which is like, it's like chips with cheese and gravy on it."
00:26:59,00:27:01,It's absolutely delicious.
00:27:01,00:27:04,But we think it might be Jewel for pudding.
00:27:04,00:27:09,So as in they took the English word pudding and then it became poutine and then it became
00:27:09,00:27:10,that.
00:27:10,00:27:11,Really?
00:27:11,00:27:13,But it's often called a degenerate language.
00:27:13,00:27:16,"He spoke it obviously, because he was born speaking it."
00:27:16,00:27:19,"And I think maybe we don't know to what extent he was speaking standard French, Canadian"
00:27:19,00:27:24,"to what extent it was Jewel, but even age 18, he still had quite a strong French accent,"
00:27:24,00:27:29,which I think is quite cocky given that age 17 was when he decided to write a great American
00:27:29,00:27:31,novel in English.
00:27:31,00:27:35,"Well, you know, yeah, you got to say, yes, it's high, but you know, when you're not fluent"
00:27:35,00:27:36,English yet.
00:27:36,00:27:37,I think that's pretty cool.
00:27:37,00:27:40,"Like how Napoleon was from Corsica, isn't it?"
00:27:40,00:27:41,Exactly.
00:27:41,00:27:44,A lot of the most famous people from a place were actually from the borders or the fringes
00:27:44,00:27:45,or the outline reasons.
00:27:45,00:27:46,Hitler was from Austria.
00:27:46,00:27:47,Yeah.
00:27:47,00:27:48,Right.
00:27:48,00:27:49,Stalin was from Georgia.
00:27:49,00:27:50,Yeah.
00:27:50,00:27:51,Yeah.
00:27:51,00:27:52,And we don't want to compare Kerouac to Hitler.
00:27:52,00:27:53,Stalin on Napoleon.
00:27:53,00:27:54,Tony Blair was born in Edinburgh.
00:27:54,00:27:55,"Oh, the inbox."
00:27:55,00:27:56,"Oh, my God."
00:27:56,00:28:01,Sometimes I just look forward.
00:28:01,00:28:05,"Okay, that is it."
