00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840
 "Hey there Club Fish members, Dan here. Hope you're all doing well. Welcome to a bonus

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.740
 compilation episode. These are all the bits that didn't make it to the main show either

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.960
 because they just didn't fit the narrative or they're on a tangent, they just didn't

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.380
 fit the shape, so we bung them all together here so that you can hear the stuff that didn't

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.040
 make it. Quite excitingly, for this particular compilation, it's not just the voice of us

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.720
 for fishers, but we have a bunch of guests, so you'll remember we did some Edinburgh

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.600
 shows recently, and a bunch of the offcuts from those recordings have made their way

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.960
 here, so you're gonna hear, and you'll be hearing them in this order, Ian Smith, Elf

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.880
 Lions, you're gonna get a couple of sentences from Ahir Shah, there's Andrew O'Neill, and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.640
 then finally Nish Kumar, and you're also gonna hear a couple of audience-submitted facts

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.200
 that we riff on as well. So that's the show for today. Thank you everyone who came to

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.960
 our live shows by the way. We had two live shows very recently at the London podcast

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.760
 festival, Jamie Morton from My Dad Wrote a Porno was there, we had a really great night

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.560
 with him, and then the following night we had Richard Osman on, and again, just a wild,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.320
 brilliant live show. We love our live shows so much, and if you missed out on it, they're

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.200
 obviously gonna be coming out as edited episodes, but if you wanna see the full thing, like

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.960
 from the moment that we walk on stage, all the way through to the quiz that we play at

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.680
 the end, you can still get access to the live stream video. If you go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.360
 you're gonna find a link that will take you to the Kings Place website, where you can

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.240
 buy the live stream video. That's gonna be up for the next week. We're trying to see

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.200
 if we can get an extension on it, so if you wanna check that out, do that, and you'll

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.760
 notice, if you have headed to our website, that there is another link there for the Cheltenham

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.040
 Literary Festival. That's happening on the 16th of October, so we're doing another live

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.640
 show. It's part of this brilliant literature festival, and we are gonna be joined on stage

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.600
 by one of our favorite people, Rachel Parris. So if you happen to be in the area, come and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.320
 say hi. Okay, let's get on to this compilation, and we begin with Ian Smith, who by the way

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.680
 was nominated for the best show at the Edinburgh Fringe this year for his show, "Foot Spa

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.640
 Half Empty", so that's very cool. But let's get into it. Here we go, on with the compilation.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:33.720
 I found a story that happened in 2008 of a real-life jigsaw problem, and I wonder, 'cause

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.520
 I can't find an update on it, whether or not this person is still trying to solve it. So

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:47.040
 this is a bin man who was called Graham Hill, and he found in a bunch of bags, £10,000 worth

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.560
 of £10 and £20 notes, and he handed it over to the police. He said, 'I found this', and

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.320
 after the amount of time that's required for them to keep it and wait for someone to claim

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.200
 it, had passed, they gave it back to him, so he was 10,000 quid richer, except for some

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.680
 reason every single one of the bills had been cut into tiny small pieces, and the Bank of

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.640
 England had said, 'If you can put them all back together, absolutely they're legal tender,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.480
 and you've got £10,000, but right now you just have shreds of £10,000'. And so that's

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.000
 what he has in his house, so he apparently was gonna make an attempt to try and jigsaw

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.800
 piece it back together. When was this done? 2008. Wow, it's a different time. Like these

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.720
 days you get bankers who have lost their Bitcoin and put it in a dump, and they're trying to

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.080
 get that back, but in those days it was just bin men with bags of shredded money, wasn't

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.560
 it? Yeah. Because if your money rips, you can put it together with sellotape. Like I've

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.760
 seen that before where I've got a note that is stuck, and that's fine. Yeah, I think what

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.080
 you need is there's a serial number on every bank note, and that needs to be exactly correct

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.240
 because they'll check it, and so if it's in two pieces, that's easy, you just sellotape

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.200
 it, but if it's in a thousand pieces. Yeah. How did he know it was worth £10,000? Like

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.800
 if you presented me with a bin bag full of shredded money, how would you assess? I think

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.320
 that's about £10,000 worth of that. I can do that with complete notes. I have no idea.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.960
 So you can weigh them. So you can weigh them. You know how much paper there is, and you know

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.880
 how much one note weighs, and you just divide them. Yes. That's clever. That's clever. I'm

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.920
 just being reminded, one of my first ever paid gigs that I ever got in stand-up was up the

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.040
 creek, and I was handed an envelope of money, and I think it was something like £200 that

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.040
 I'd made, and I was very excitedly saying to my friends, "Let's go to the pub walking

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:47.000
 down the street," and I ripped open the envelope, and hadn't... I ripped it over on the side,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.720
 and I tore all the money. This was before it went to plastic. I tore all the money,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.520
 and Gustav Windcab blew off the top third of all my notes. And yet you continued with

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.320
 your comedy career, despite that very obvious side from the universe that it wasn't for

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.400
 you. Well, you can talk about it. That gave me five minutes for my next set.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.080
 One of the... This is only vaguely related, but it's one of the funniest things I've seen,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.120
 and it does involve wind, but I was in New Zealand with Finn Taylor, and I think Phil

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:27.080
 sang. And Finn Taylor was talking about how he had a small part in the new Tomb Raider

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.480
 film, and I think it was cut from the final edit. I'm not sure if it was on special features

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.080
 or anything, but he basically said, "This cast and crew cap is the only memento that

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.520
 I have from the film." And then almost immediately, like a sitcom, Gustav Wind blew the hat into

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.320
 the water as the boat's going away, and was just sort of like... Almost didn't laugh,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.400
 but just remember saying, "That's the funniest thing. That's the funniest thing I've ever

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.640
 seen. The timing of it." But I still felt like... But I can't laugh because I think it's sad

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:08.600
 as well, but yeah, it was so perfect. It's lost all proof using that movie.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.640
 Would you like some beat slang? Oh yeah. Right. I'm feeling hairy. What's that? My tender

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:25.320
 profile. No, good is good, feeling hairy. Feeling good. My rod. My rod. Car. Like a hot rod.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.000
 Exactly. Let's stable the iron. Put it back in your trousers, mate. It's parked the car.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.440
 What's a kick stick? Kick stick. It's not on your bike, is it? It's not the... No, that's

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.840
 a kick stand. Nice. It's a cigarette. Kick stick. To give you a kick. Right. Yes, sir.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.960
 But they were very quickly taking the piss out of the beats. Yeah. And the Village Voice

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.920
 magazine in New York, they ran a rent a beat-knit competition. Right. Where you could hire a

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.760
 beat-knit for your party. They did it as a joke, and then they actually, I think, started

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:59.200
 getting beat-poets in who said, "Yeah, I could do with $40." All right. Yeah. Bongo's optional.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.920
 Yeah, I don't know how they earned any money, because most of them didn't actually publish

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.360
 anything, or like a lot of their... One of the main members, Neil Cassidy, I don't think

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.200
 he published anything. Oh, he did? Well, maybe posthumously, yeah. Possthumously. Yeah,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.040
 it's not what it helps, is it? Can you just put this beer on my tab? I'm going to publish

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.120
 some stuff posthumously, and I'll make sure you get it. Posthumously tab is a great idea.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:26.680
 I'm going to be massive, I promise. One of my favourite clowns from history is Lulu Adams,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:33.360
 a UK clown. And she was known as one of the first ever women circus clowns. She was born

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.880
 in 1900, and she was like the first ever female clown to appear at Olympia. And I just think

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.440
 she was incredible. She played the bagpipe, she could ride a horse. At the same time,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.640
 her whole family were in the circus, like just a proper, old-fashioned showwoman show

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.440
 family. And she did a double act with her husband, Albertino, and they got hired by

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.760
 the Bertram Mill Circus, which was such a big deal. And they got offered a contract,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.320
 which was like, I think, $35 or £35 a week, which was the equivalent of like £2,000 a

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:11.480
 week now, which was massive to go to New York to do this amazing tour of their act.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.760
 And then they went on air, this was in 1948, and they were being interviewed on the New

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.680
 York Radio in April on the day, the opening night, and they asked Albertino what's it

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:29.500
 like to perform. And as he answered, he died on air of a heart attack. And that evening,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.680
 Lulu Adams went on stage and continued to do the double act. And she completed the entire

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.520
 nine-month contract on her own. And the newspaper article was like the first female clown is

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.200
 smiling even though her heart is breaking. But it's just, and then she continued performing

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.440
 for the rest of her life and then moved to Brighton and made costumes for performers.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.720
 What a professional. That's professionalism. And I want to say that if all the three of

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.160
 you guys who do the podcast with me died, I would continue to do it as if nothing had

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.160
 happened.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:07.160
 Right, Anna, we know. You say that every week, Anna, and it's starting to pull.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.520
 Yeah, my booby traps keep failing, it's a shame.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:18.680
 I really miss what sounds like the golden age of non-imperson dating, which is the video

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:25.160
 dating thing. So this was on TV as a kind of joke when I was growing up. Like, you sit

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.240
 in a studio, you record a video of yourself.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.560
 Yeah. There was a guy called Jeffrey Elman. He set it up. He was a young videographer.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.000
 And so you have this huge library of videos, and then you just watch like a five minute

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.880
 tape of any potential person. And you say, right, I'm interested in Jennifer. And then

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.480
 Jennifer gets a phone call saying, Greg is interested in you. Can you go in and view

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.480
 Greg's video?

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.480
 Right.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.480
 And literally a VHS.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.480
 Yes.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.080
 And so, like, it's laborious. But the thing is, the way the interviews were conducted,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.240
 this guy, Jeffrey Elman, did the interviews himself, right? You'd fill out a form of your

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.920
 preferences and then he would do a little interview with you.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:06.200
 But he would also kind of interrogate you. So listen to this. Elman recollected, I'd

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.440
 say to you, you've got five kids and you live way out in the suburbs. Now, I don't mean

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.800
 to insult you, Ethel, but how dateable are you? And then Ethel's on the spot having to

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.960
 answer. Like, well, I'm, you know, I can send the kids off to their auntie or whatever. Like,

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.800
 as in she's having to answer for herself.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.400
 Yeah, that's a bit probing.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.280
 But it's kind of, I suppose, the reasoning was she's proving, oh no, look, this is how

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.880
 great I am as a match or a prospect.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.120
 They must give Ethel the questions beforehand.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.120
 I don't know.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.920
 I quite like the idea of the Jeremy Paxman kind of dating service, whereas if you answer

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.880
 on a plate, it's just seven-ten points.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.880
 It's just the same question, yeah.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:46.040
 So you'd like films. Well, I've seen them. It had 17 franchises by the mid-80s. And there

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.720
 was one, there was even, there was one specifically for people in Washington, D.C. with herpes.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.320
 That's how successful it was.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.320
 Wow.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.320
 I don't know why.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.320
 I don't know why.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.520
 I suppose if you have herpes, then you should only shag people with herpes. Is that the

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.520
 thinking?

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.520
 Absolutely. That is the thinking, clearly.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.520
 Yeah.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.560
 And that's, we've mentioned this before, but that's basically one of the reasons the

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.680
 YouTube guys gave for setting up YouTube at all was that video dating. So you would put

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.360
 up a video of yourself in this exact same way, but you're knocking out VHS and you just

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.600
 click to the next link. That was largely part of the creation of it.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.040
 I watch everything on two-time speed with stuff like that to get through it. So I'd

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.800
 be disappointed when they turned up with normal, bassy voices.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.000
 Shit, Monk sorted it.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.160
 If we gave dinosaurs to every country in the world, it wouldn't help because dinosaurs

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.600
 couldn't live today.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600
 Really?

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:44.800
 And that is because in the Cretaceous era, they had about 35% oxygen and today we have

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.600
 about 21% oxygen. So there wouldn't be enough oxygen for them to live. They'd all be sort

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.200
 of gasping for air the whole time.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.200
 That'd be terrible.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:59.480
 You're telling me that this series of documentaries I watch, set on Isle and Nubart.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:05.080
 I don't know. I haven't seen it, but they all have like gas masks and equipment.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.320
 It's pretty upsetting.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.160
 You haven't seen Jurassic Park?

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.400
 I'm afraid I haven't.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.800
 Not any of them.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.760
 No, but there's a new one out, isn't there? So I think they might have to catch up.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.360
 Start with the new one and work backwards. That's how you're meant to do it, like the

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.360
 Star Wars films.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.080
 Here's the thing on diplomacy. So we talked about dinosaur diplomacy. There's other things

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:33.000
 like ping pong diplomacy, where China and America played ping pong against each other.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.560
 There is panda diplomacy, where China gave out pandas to different countries. And I

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.300
 found one called xylophone diplomacy. Does anyone know what that is?

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.300
 Feels like we can guess.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.980
 Try the dinosaur thing. You play the ribs of the dinosaur like a xylophone and that

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.160
 lightens the mood at tricky summits.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.800
 You send everyone xylophones and that gives the primary school children something to do

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.960
 and parents are very grateful.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.880
 No, I read this in The Economist and it says xylophone diplomacy, a made up term created

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.120
 in order to have an entry for the letter x in The Economist A to Z of international relations.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.240
 Right, thanks a lot.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.480
 Love it.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.760
 The way all these things worked, I guess, is you sent in a bit of money and you filled

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.120
 out a questionnaire, which could be very long. So the operation match was 75 questions.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.840
 And then they took your questionnaire and they tried to match it up with others using

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.560
 a computer algorithm, which is why it was computerized.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:31.340
 I think a good way of doing it would be to have like 10,000 questions that you have to

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.780
 go through and you're matched by how far you go through before you give up.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:36.780
 That's very good.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.840
 Because I think I would be well matched to someone who had the same level of getting

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.200
 bored quickly as I do.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.360
 I think you'd answer them all because you're a completist. Do you like long lists of information?

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.080
 And probably the person who dated me would need to be similar to put up with that.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.720
 I do have a dating app for you, James. I know you're off the market, but there is a new

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.660
 one in the USA called SCORE, which is a dating app for people who have a good to excellent

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.660
 credit rating.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.660
 Oh!

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:02.660
 And it's...

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:03.860
 I do have a good credit rating.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.860
 I knew you were excellent.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.080
 I just think that's so... I think that's quite good, actually, like...

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080
 It's very sensible.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.920
 I disagree. I think that's a good case of opposites attract.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.560
 Actually, you're so right, but much more responsible to pay yourself up with someone with a bad

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.200
 one so you can raise them up to your level.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.200
 Absolutely.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200
 That's not how it works. They drag you down. Anna.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200
 That's what happens in love.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.200
 You're right.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200
 You're right.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.200
 Drag each other down.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:33.840
 I've got one here from Jeffrey Partica, which is a fishy stretch, it's been said.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.400
 That was disgusting.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:43.180
 It is a stretch of a fact, but I'm reading it because I know Tom Cruise is a huge, huge

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.180
 deal in Andy's life.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:50.140
 So, Tom Cruise took up race car driving and got married because of the Russian Revolution.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.140
 Okay.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:58.220
 Now, it's a long journey. There's a long journey to get to what this is. 1917, Rubin Malmoulian

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.560
 was studying at a stage production at the Imperial Moscow University in the hopes of

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.260
 directing, and he was from a Tsarist family, so he fled America when the revolution broke

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.260
 out.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.260
 He became a director...

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.260
 Fled to America.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.260
 Sorry.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.460
 Very few people fled America when the Russian Revolution broke out.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.460
 That's too cautious.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.820
 Yeah, he fled to America.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:25.020
 And years later, he becomes the initial director of Cleopatra with Elizabeth Taylor.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:29.500
 There was lots of problems, constant script changes, creative differences, so he was

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.940
 eventually replaced as the director.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.340
 So then Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor were scheduled to be in the movie together,

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.300
 but because of the shooting delays, because of this, Taylor was prevented from joining

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:45.500
 the film, so both roles were recast with Robert Mitchum and Shirley MacLean, which freed up

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.620
 Paul Newman to be in The Hustler with Jackie Gleason.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:54.500
 The Hustler is credited with popularizing pool in America, giving Paul Newman a lifelong

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.020
 love of the game.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:01.340
 It also allowed him to reprise his role as Fast Eddie Felsen 25 years later in the Scorsese

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.220
 sequel, The Color of Money.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.980
 James has started eating a biscuit.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.900
 He's likely performatively.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.380
 He could be more far away from the microphone right now.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.260
 That's what happens when he gets interested.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.380
 I don't think I'm going to be needed for a few more minutes.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.580
 It was in this movie, as Fast Eddie Felsen, that Paul Newman introduced Tom Cruise to

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.700
 the thrill of driving too fast.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.100
 Thanks to his new love, Cruise was cast in the Nascar movie Days of Thunder.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.100
 He met Nicole Kidman.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.100
 Oh, that's the only one, isn't it?

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.100
 Yeah.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.100
 And then it just ends.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.700
 There might have been a few other consequences due to the Russian Revolution, but I think

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.220
 it'd be difficult to find something more inane.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.620
 That's certainly the worst consequence.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.820
 No, that's terrific.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.820
 Tom Cruise could have had a career as a kind of sensitive character actor.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.820
 Yeah.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.340
 But were it not for the Russian Revolution?

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.340
 There you go.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.340
 Yeah.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.340
 Great.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.340
 Nice.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.340
 Love it.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.340
 Just on guitars.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.900
 Can I give everyone a guitar song recommendation that's called, it's really good.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.060
 It's called United Breaks Guitars, and it was a hit in 2009.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.700
 Have you, you've heard everything, Andrew.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.700
 He's nodding along.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.860
 It's a musician called Dave Carroll who was, and I guess this must be the bane of a lot

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.260
 of guitar players' lives.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:18.580
 He was on a plane and he watched the baggage handlers throw his $3,500 guitar all over

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.580
 the shop.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.940
 So, my golf clubs?

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.060
 You could sing an equally popular, relatable song about that.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.140
 And it's really good, and he wrote this song about how they've broken his guitar.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.140
 I think it's great, but they're nice, tragically like country.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.460
 It's wonderful, isn't it?

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.460
 It's really good.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.380
 It's that thing where, you know, this incredibly precious thing.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:44.380
 I mean, obviously there's a kind of, like a hand luggage arms race, isn't there?

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:49.420
 And there was originally a story about people employed in airports are, they're rewarded

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:55.100
 like a few quid for each bag they sort of refuse to put on.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.020
 Because it's, imagine how difficult that job actually is.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.020
 You've got a massive stag do who haven't read the terms and conditions.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.820
 They've all got bags, two bigs to go on.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.700
 You've got to tell everyone it's, you know, you can't take it on, and it's 60 extra quids

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.580
 to put it on the hold each.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.820
 But with guitars, yeah, just, you know, this incredibly precious thing, what you have to

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:19.580
 do is down tune them when you, if you're going to put them in the luggage hold, put it in

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:24.220
 a hard case, down tune it so you haven't got the tension on the strings.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.860
 If it gets dropped or smashed, that tension can make the neck cave in.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.860
 Yeah, right.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.860
 Wow.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.860
 Interesting.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:37.300
 And that taking the tuning down is actually an entire style of guitaring in Hawaii.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.260
 And I'd never heard of this.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.420
 Slack key guitar.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.740
 Oh, wow.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:47.260
 Slack keyed guitar is where you basically are detuning at least three strings of your

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.100
 guitar in order to create an open cord that you can play.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.620
 And then you can use the top notes as your baseline, and then you can play with the open

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.620
 cord for the rest.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.540
 The thing about it is, like I was talking earlier about hiding your fingers behind a

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:04.980
 handkerchief, slack key guitar in Hawaii was also something where you would hand down the

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.660
 tunings of each of those six strings to your family and not let anyone else know.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.820
 So it became like the family style of playing this particular guitar and we know a bunch

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:14.820
 of them now.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.100
 Yeah, it's become more open now, but that was, it was, it was handed down as the family

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.860
 secret for how you would play guitar.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.020
 And so everyone would have their own specific open cord.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.020
 Wow.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.460
 All these secret guitar chords.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.380
 I had no idea that it was such an exciting secretive world, the world of guitar playing.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.180
 And we're sure it's not just because people always have to fly to Hawaii on a plane and

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.500
 then they've left their guitars on strong.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:41.300
 Oh, fuck, I better make this a thing.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.100
 The first album I ever bought was the Jimi Hendrix album, which was great, because he

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.100
 does sound like nobody else.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.140
 Like it is an unbelievable sound he has.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:53.020
 And it was partly thanks to his sound engineer guy who was called Roger Mayer.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.140
 And this is where the other weird military link comes in, because Roger Mayer sort of

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.620
 qualified, did all his early work in acoustics in the Royal Naval Scientific Service, working

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.700
 on underwater warfare.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.260
 He was on submarines.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.700
 He was working on the stuff of keeping submarines silent.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.940
 You know, that was his whole project when he was in the, in the Navy.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.660
 So I just love this quote, when a steel hulled sub is running silent, you know, the whole

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.020
 point about submarines is you stay completely quiet and no one knows that you're there.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.500
 When it's running silent, the sound of a dropped spanner can be picked up and the

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.020
 subsposition located from up to 160 kilometers away.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.020
 What?

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.020
 What?

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.020
 Imagine that.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.020
 Can that be true?

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.060
 He, like, I know what he's talking about, I guess.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.060
 He, exactly.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.060
 I can't believe it.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.060
 So basically all of, he realized all of his work also applied to guitars and he made this

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:46.340
 amazing sound effects device for Hendrix, which creates an amazing trippy harmonic sound,

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.420
 the octave above your playing.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.620
 And he showed it to Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin and Jimmy Page said, well, that's too much

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:52.620
 for me.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.620
 Yeah, that's too far out for me.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.620
 Right.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.620
 But Hendrix was into it.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.620
 Roger Mair is still alive.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.620
 He's still.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.620
 He's still around.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.620
 Yeah.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.300
 So the question is, if you put Jimmy Hendrix on a submarine and got him to play Purple

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:10.100
 H, how far away the whole world could listen?

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.620
 That period of time is one that I'm endlessly fascinated with the kind of, you know, the

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.500
 mid sixties or a lot of those bands, a lot of the movies that came out around that time

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.180
 are a source of perennial fascination to me.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.500
 And one of the things that is so strange about it all is, it's obviously, it's so close

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.220
 to the Second World War, you know, like the, and the whole cultural landscape, it's like

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.900
 when you see photos of Bob Dylan touring the mid sixties and he's occasionally just walking

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:42.220
 around just sort of rubble in Liverpool or something because the whole, the whole idea

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:47.140
 of like the free love sixties is so close to the end of the Second World War.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.140
 And there's all these people who were sort of just called like just doing military service

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:57.140
 and then suddenly are now trying to work out how to make Jimmy Hendrix's guitar successfully

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:03.540
 emulate the noise that runs through his head when he takes LSD, you know, it's like.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.540
 It's such an interesting point.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.260
 I think it's something that will never certainly with the world of like rock music experience

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.500
 again, where I was listening to Ozzy Osbourne talk the other day about the Beatles and he

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.420
 said, you just, you will never understand what the Beatles meant to us, not just the

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.140
 music, what they meant to us.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.260
 We were in a black and white world and it went technicolor.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:26.740
 We suddenly believe that life was fun again and it was through that and it's, and all

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.740
 that period is what that was.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.420
 They were building off the back of trying to get back into technicolor off the back of

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.420
 war.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.420
 It's fascinating stuff.

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.420
 I agree.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.420
 I'm obsessed with that period.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:43.940
 In the Yellow Submarine, you're in quiet and you drop a spanner.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.940
 Here's one.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:51.140
 Dolphins, says Andrew Heldenbrand, can use ultrasound to detect pregnancies and will

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:56.200
 pay special attention to pregnant women, nuzzling them while scanning them with ultrasonic

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.200
 frequencies.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.700
 That's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.140
 Walker, can they tell you things like what sex it is?

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.140
 Yeah, they'll say.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.060
 Does it have the right number of fingers and toes?

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.700
 It's very annoying sometimes because they'll say, you must have been hoping for a boy or

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.420
 whatever and you might not have wanted to know that yet.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.380
 What level of detail could they turn to the dad and go, it's bad news, I think I might

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.380
 have been the neighbor.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:20.940
 Are they, is that, what are they fighting now?

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.420
 What's your milkman's nose like?

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:28.300
 I don't think it's huge detail, but I think they could probably detect the heartbeat because

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:33.500
 they can do a very, very narrow beam of echolocation, it's called buzzing and they sound like a squeaky

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.220
 door to us when they're doing it.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.340
 That is cool, isn't it?

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.260
 So why don't they use, when you go to have your first scan, why don't they use dolphins

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.260
 instead of the machines?

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.900
 The natural way.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:50.260
 When you're having your water birth, yeah, meet the literal wet nurse, Flipper.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.260
 Have you guys heard of kitten fishing?

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.260
 No.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.260
 No.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.260
 Can you guess what it is?

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.380
 It's not pretending to be a kitten.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.540
 So cat fishing is where you pretend to be someone you're completely not and then they

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.620
 think that they're dating you but you're not doing it and then eventually you might get

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.620
 some money off the most.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.180
 So kitten fishing, I reckon, is you pretending to be yourself as a child?

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.540
 I see, to catch pedophiles or something.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.540
 Yes.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.540
 No, it's not that.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:20.260
 It is just embellishing or misrepresenting yourself online to make you more desirable.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.260
 We all do that.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.620
 Well, that's a special way for that.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:28.060
 So according to Hinge, the website, the trouble is that when you do that, it kind of defeats

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.820
 the whole purpose of online dating, which is to find the right match.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.780
 So you really have to be kind of as close to real as possible.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.140
 Wait, but your right match is definitely lying as well.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.740
 I think that's how everyone's doing, right?

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.740
 They're all banking on everyone, exaggerating.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.980
 That's what the first day is all about, working out what the lies were.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:44.980
 Yes, exactly.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:45.980
 OK.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:46.980
 What about woke fishing?

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:47.980
 Oh, my God.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.980
 Oh, pretending to be woke.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.980
 Yeah, pretending to have views.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.980
 Absolutely.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:51.980
 That's the thing.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.980
 Of course I support the cause, Conrad.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:53.980
 Actually.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.140
 Until you're in the pants.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.100
 Then it turns out you're shameful.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.460
 In your bedside drawer, you've got a Tory rosette.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.460
 Is that it?

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.460
 It's too late.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.460
 She's in love.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.940
 It's pretty much that.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.940
 Orbiting.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.820
 Orbiting is what that's a term.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.580
 It's another term that's in like modern dating slang.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.780
 So that's circling around someone not approaching.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.540
 Yeah, pretty much, but in an online setting.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:23.820
 So staying like occasionally liking the photos, leaving the odd very, very innocuous comments

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.900
 so that you're kind of in the orbit, but you're not really engaging with them.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.900
 And then zombieing.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.900
 Yeah.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.900
 Coming back from the dead.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.900
 Yeah.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.460
 And offering a date.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.460
 Pretty much.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.460
 Nice.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.460
 So you know what ghosting is?

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.460
 Yeah.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.900
 Where you just stop replying to someone completely and pretend they don't exist.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.900
 I know about it.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.900
 Well, it's when someone who's previously.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.540
 My wife's been doing it to me since yesterday.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.500
 It's when someone who's previously ghosted you suddenly reappears and acts as if nothing

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.500
 ever happened.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.500
 Oh.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.500
 Zombieing.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.500
 That's very good.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.500
 Very good.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.500
 Very, very good.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.300
 Jack Kerouac.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:01.740
 We said he's American and he was American, but his parents were Quebeca, Quebequaz.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.740
 Quebe...

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.860
 He was, they were from Quebec.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:12.140
 But that meant that until he was six years old, he only spoke Jewel.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:18.700
 Jewel is like, Jewel is a sort of a dialect from Quebec.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.900
 It's kind of half French, half English, all very, very weird.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.020
 So the name comes from how they say the word chivalre.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.220
 So chivalre is French for horse and there's a phrase to speak French like a horse means

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.940
 to speak French very, very badly.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:39.260
 And so they call it Jewel and they have lots of sort of English words in there.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:46.100
 So dompe in Jewel means to throw out the trash like it comes from the dump and they turn

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.140
 it into a French thing.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.140
 That's great.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:53.140
 The word from peanut is pinot, just slightly French.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:59.800
 And the word poutine, you know, which is like, it's like chips with cheese and gravy on it.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.780
 It's absolutely delicious.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.580
 But we think it might be Jewel for pudding.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.500
 So as in they took the English word pudding and then it became poutine and then it became

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.500
 that.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.500
 Really?

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.780
 But it's often called a degenerate language.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.260
 He spoke it obviously, because he was born speaking it.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.780
 And I think maybe we don't know to what extent he was speaking standard French, Canadian

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.940
 to what extent it was Jewel, but even age 18, he still had quite a strong French accent,

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:29.980
 which I think is quite cocky given that age 17 was when he decided to write a great American

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.480
 novel in English.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.740
 Well, you know, yeah, you got to say, yes, it's high, but you know, when you're not fluent

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.740
 English yet.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.740
 I think that's pretty cool.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.020
 Like how Napoleon was from Corsica, isn't it?

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.020
 Exactly.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.020
 A lot of the most famous people from a place were actually from the borders or the fringes

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.020
 or the outline reasons.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.020
 Hitler was from Austria.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.020
 Yeah.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.020
 Right.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.020
 Stalin was from Georgia.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.020
 Yeah.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.020
 Yeah.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.020
 And we don't want to compare Kerouac to Hitler.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.020
 Stalin on Napoleon.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.740
 Tony Blair was born in Edinburgh.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.740
 Oh, the inbox.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.740
 Oh, my God.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.740
 Sometimes I just look forward.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.380
 Okay, that is it.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.100
 That is all of our outtakes.
