00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
 "Hey there Club Fish members, Dan here. Hope you're all doing well. Welcome to a bonus

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,740
 compilation episode. These are all the bits that didn't make it to the main show either

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,960
 because they just didn't fit the narrative or they're on a tangent, they just didn't

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,380
 fit the shape, so we bung them all together here so that you can hear the stuff that didn't

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,040
 make it. Quite excitingly, for this particular compilation, it's not just the voice of us

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,720
 for fishers, but we have a bunch of guests, so you'll remember we did some Edinburgh

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,600
 shows recently, and a bunch of the offcuts from those recordings have made their way

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,960
 here, so you're gonna hear, and you'll be hearing them in this order, Ian Smith, Elf

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,880
 Lions, you're gonna get a couple of sentences from Ahir Shah, there's Andrew O'Neill, and

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,640
 then finally Nish Kumar, and you're also gonna hear a couple of audience-submitted facts

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,200
 that we riff on as well. So that's the show for today. Thank you everyone who came to

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,960
 our live shows by the way. We had two live shows very recently at the London podcast

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,760
 festival, Jamie Morton from My Dad Wrote a Porno was there, we had a really great night

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,560
 with him, and then the following night we had Richard Osman on, and again, just a wild,

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,320
 brilliant live show. We love our live shows so much, and if you missed out on it, they're

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,200
 obviously gonna be coming out as edited episodes, but if you wanna see the full thing, like

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,960
 from the moment that we walk on stage, all the way through to the quiz that we play at

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:25,680
 the end, you can still get access to the live stream video. If you go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live,

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
 you're gonna find a link that will take you to the Kings Place website, where you can

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,240
 buy the live stream video. That's gonna be up for the next week. We're trying to see

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,200
 if we can get an extension on it, so if you wanna check that out, do that, and you'll

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,760
 notice, if you have headed to our website, that there is another link there for the Cheltenham

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,040
 Literary Festival. That's happening on the 16th of October, so we're doing another live

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,640
 show. It's part of this brilliant literature festival, and we are gonna be joined on stage

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,600
 by one of our favorite people, Rachel Parris. So if you happen to be in the area, come and

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,320
 say hi. Okay, let's get on to this compilation, and we begin with Ian Smith, who by the way

27
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,680
 was nominated for the best show at the Edinburgh Fringe this year for his show, "Foot Spa

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,640
 Half Empty", so that's very cool. But let's get into it. Here we go, on with the compilation.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:33,720
 I found a story that happened in 2008 of a real-life jigsaw problem, and I wonder, 'cause

30
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,520
 I can't find an update on it, whether or not this person is still trying to solve it. So

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:47,040
 this is a bin man who was called Graham Hill, and he found in a bunch of bags, £10,000 worth

32
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,560
 of £10 and £20 notes, and he handed it over to the police. He said, 'I found this', and

33
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,320
 after the amount of time that's required for them to keep it and wait for someone to claim

34
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,200
 it, had passed, they gave it back to him, so he was 10,000 quid richer, except for some

35
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,680
 reason every single one of the bills had been cut into tiny small pieces, and the Bank of

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,640
 England had said, 'If you can put them all back together, absolutely they're legal tender,

37
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,480
 and you've got £10,000, but right now you just have shreds of £10,000'. And so that's

38
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,000
 what he has in his house, so he apparently was gonna make an attempt to try and jigsaw

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,800
 piece it back together. When was this done? 2008. Wow, it's a different time. Like these

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,720
 days you get bankers who have lost their Bitcoin and put it in a dump, and they're trying to

41
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,080
 get that back, but in those days it was just bin men with bags of shredded money, wasn't

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,560
 it? Yeah. Because if your money rips, you can put it together with sellotape. Like I've

43
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,760
 seen that before where I've got a note that is stuck, and that's fine. Yeah, I think what

44
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,080
 you need is there's a serial number on every bank note, and that needs to be exactly correct

45
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,240
 because they'll check it, and so if it's in two pieces, that's easy, you just sellotape

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,200
 it, but if it's in a thousand pieces. Yeah. How did he know it was worth £10,000? Like

47
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,800
 if you presented me with a bin bag full of shredded money, how would you assess? I think

48
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,320
 that's about £10,000 worth of that. I can do that with complete notes. I have no idea.

49
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,960
 So you can weigh them. So you can weigh them. You know how much paper there is, and you know

50
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,880
 how much one note weighs, and you just divide them. Yes. That's clever. That's clever. I'm

51
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,920
 just being reminded, one of my first ever paid gigs that I ever got in stand-up was up the

52
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,040
 creek, and I was handed an envelope of money, and I think it was something like £200 that

53
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,040
 I'd made, and I was very excitedly saying to my friends, "Let's go to the pub walking

54
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:47,000
 down the street," and I ripped open the envelope, and hadn't... I ripped it over on the side,

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,720
 and I tore all the money. This was before it went to plastic. I tore all the money,

56
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,520
 and Gustav Windcab blew off the top third of all my notes. And yet you continued with

57
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,320
 your comedy career, despite that very obvious side from the universe that it wasn't for

58
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,400
 you. Well, you can talk about it. That gave me five minutes for my next set.

59
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,080
 One of the... This is only vaguely related, but it's one of the funniest things I've seen,

60
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,120
 and it does involve wind, but I was in New Zealand with Finn Taylor, and I think Phil

61
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,080
 sang. And Finn Taylor was talking about how he had a small part in the new Tomb Raider

62
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,480
 film, and I think it was cut from the final edit. I'm not sure if it was on special features

63
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,080
 or anything, but he basically said, "This cast and crew cap is the only memento that

64
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,520
 I have from the film." And then almost immediately, like a sitcom, Gustav Wind blew the hat into

65
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,320
 the water as the boat's going away, and was just sort of like... Almost didn't laugh,

66
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,400
 but just remember saying, "That's the funniest thing. That's the funniest thing I've ever

67
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,640
 seen. The timing of it." But I still felt like... But I can't laugh because I think it's sad

68
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:08,600
 as well, but yeah, it was so perfect. It's lost all proof using that movie.

69
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,640
 Would you like some beat slang? Oh yeah. Right. I'm feeling hairy. What's that? My tender

70
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:25,320
 profile. No, good is good, feeling hairy. Feeling good. My rod. My rod. Car. Like a hot rod.

71
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,000
 Exactly. Let's stable the iron. Put it back in your trousers, mate. It's parked the car.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,440
 What's a kick stick? Kick stick. It's not on your bike, is it? It's not the... No, that's

73
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,840
 a kick stand. Nice. It's a cigarette. Kick stick. To give you a kick. Right. Yes, sir.

74
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,960
 But they were very quickly taking the piss out of the beats. Yeah. And the Village Voice

75
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,920
 magazine in New York, they ran a rent a beat-knit competition. Right. Where you could hire a

76
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,760
 beat-knit for your party. They did it as a joke, and then they actually, I think, started

77
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:59,200
 getting beat-poets in who said, "Yeah, I could do with $40." All right. Yeah. Bongo's optional.

78
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,920
 Yeah, I don't know how they earned any money, because most of them didn't actually publish

79
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,360
 anything, or like a lot of their... One of the main members, Neil Cassidy, I don't think

80
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,200
 he published anything. Oh, he did? Well, maybe posthumously, yeah. Possthumously. Yeah,

81
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,040
 it's not what it helps, is it? Can you just put this beer on my tab? I'm going to publish

82
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,120
 some stuff posthumously, and I'll make sure you get it. Posthumously tab is a great idea.

83
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,680
 I'm going to be massive, I promise. One of my favourite clowns from history is Lulu Adams,

84
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,360
 a UK clown. And she was known as one of the first ever women circus clowns. She was born

85
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,880
 in 1900, and she was like the first ever female clown to appear at Olympia. And I just think

86
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,440
 she was incredible. She played the bagpipe, she could ride a horse. At the same time,

87
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,640
 her whole family were in the circus, like just a proper, old-fashioned showwoman show

88
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,440
 family. And she did a double act with her husband, Albertino, and they got hired by

89
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,760
 the Bertram Mill Circus, which was such a big deal. And they got offered a contract,

90
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,320
 which was like, I think, $35 or £35 a week, which was the equivalent of like £2,000 a

91
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,480
 week now, which was massive to go to New York to do this amazing tour of their act.

92
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,760
 And then they went on air, this was in 1948, and they were being interviewed on the New

93
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,680
 York Radio in April on the day, the opening night, and they asked Albertino what's it

94
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:29,500
 like to perform. And as he answered, he died on air of a heart attack. And that evening,

95
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,680
 Lulu Adams went on stage and continued to do the double act. And she completed the entire

96
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,520
 nine-month contract on her own. And the newspaper article was like the first female clown is

97
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,200
 smiling even though her heart is breaking. But it's just, and then she continued performing

98
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,440
 for the rest of her life and then moved to Brighton and made costumes for performers.

99
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,720
 What a professional. That's professionalism. And I want to say that if all the three of

100
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,160
 you guys who do the podcast with me died, I would continue to do it as if nothing had

101
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
 happened.

102
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,160
 Right, Anna, we know. You say that every week, Anna, and it's starting to pull.

103
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,520
 Yeah, my booby traps keep failing, it's a shame.

104
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,680
 I really miss what sounds like the golden age of non-imperson dating, which is the video

105
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:25,160
 dating thing. So this was on TV as a kind of joke when I was growing up. Like, you sit

106
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,240
 in a studio, you record a video of yourself.

107
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
 Oh, yeah.

108
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,560
 Yeah. There was a guy called Jeffrey Elman. He set it up. He was a young videographer.

109
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,000
 And so you have this huge library of videos, and then you just watch like a five minute

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,880
 tape of any potential person. And you say, right, I'm interested in Jennifer. And then

111
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,480
 Jennifer gets a phone call saying, Greg is interested in you. Can you go in and view

112
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
 Greg's video?

113
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
 Right.

114
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
 And literally a VHS.

115
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
 Yes.

116
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
 Yeah, yeah.

117
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,080
 And so, like, it's laborious. But the thing is, the way the interviews were conducted,

118
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,240
 this guy, Jeffrey Elman, did the interviews himself, right? You'd fill out a form of your

119
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,920
 preferences and then he would do a little interview with you.

120
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,200
 But he would also kind of interrogate you. So listen to this. Elman recollected, I'd

121
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,440
 say to you, you've got five kids and you live way out in the suburbs. Now, I don't mean

122
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,800
 to insult you, Ethel, but how dateable are you? And then Ethel's on the spot having to

123
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,960
 answer. Like, well, I'm, you know, I can send the kids off to their auntie or whatever. Like,

124
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,800
 as in she's having to answer for herself.

125
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,400
 Yeah, that's a bit probing.

126
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,280
 But it's kind of, I suppose, the reasoning was she's proving, oh no, look, this is how

127
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,880
 great I am as a match or a prospect.

128
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,120
 They must give Ethel the questions beforehand.

129
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
 I don't know.

130
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,920
 I quite like the idea of the Jeremy Paxman kind of dating service, whereas if you answer

131
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,880
 on a plate, it's just seven-ten points.

132
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
 It's just the same question, yeah.

133
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:46,040
 So you'd like films. Well, I've seen them. It had 17 franchises by the mid-80s. And there

134
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,720
 was one, there was even, there was one specifically for people in Washington, D.C. with herpes.

135
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,320
 That's how successful it was.

136
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
 Wow.

137
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
 I don't know why.

138
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
 I don't know why.

139
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,520
 I suppose if you have herpes, then you should only shag people with herpes. Is that the

140
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,520
 thinking?

141
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
 Absolutely. That is the thinking, clearly.

142
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
 Yeah.

143
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,560
 And that's, we've mentioned this before, but that's basically one of the reasons the

144
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,680
 YouTube guys gave for setting up YouTube at all was that video dating. So you would put

145
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,360
 up a video of yourself in this exact same way, but you're knocking out VHS and you just

146
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,600
 click to the next link. That was largely part of the creation of it.

147
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,040
 I watch everything on two-time speed with stuff like that to get through it. So I'd

148
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,800
 be disappointed when they turned up with normal, bassy voices.

149
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,000
 Shit, Monk sorted it.

150
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,160
 If we gave dinosaurs to every country in the world, it wouldn't help because dinosaurs

151
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,600
 couldn't live today.

152
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
 Really?

153
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,800
 And that is because in the Cretaceous era, they had about 35% oxygen and today we have

154
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,600
 about 21% oxygen. So there wouldn't be enough oxygen for them to live. They'd all be sort

155
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,200
 of gasping for air the whole time.

156
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
 That'd be terrible.

157
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:59,480
 You're telling me that this series of documentaries I watch, set on Isle and Nubart.

158
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,080
 I don't know. I haven't seen it, but they all have like gas masks and equipment.

159
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,320
 It's pretty upsetting.

160
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,160
 You haven't seen Jurassic Park?

161
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,400
 I'm afraid I haven't.

162
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,800
 Not any of them.

163
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,760
 No, but there's a new one out, isn't there? So I think they might have to catch up.

164
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,360
 Start with the new one and work backwards. That's how you're meant to do it, like the

165
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,360
 Star Wars films.

166
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,080
 Here's the thing on diplomacy. So we talked about dinosaur diplomacy. There's other things

167
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:33,000
 like ping pong diplomacy, where China and America played ping pong against each other.

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,560
 There is panda diplomacy, where China gave out pandas to different countries. And I

169
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,300
 found one called xylophone diplomacy. Does anyone know what that is?

170
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,300
 Feels like we can guess.

171
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,980
 Try the dinosaur thing. You play the ribs of the dinosaur like a xylophone and that

172
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,160
 lightens the mood at tricky summits.

173
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,800
 You send everyone xylophones and that gives the primary school children something to do

174
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,960
 and parents are very grateful.

175
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,880
 No, I read this in The Economist and it says xylophone diplomacy, a made up term created

176
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,120
 in order to have an entry for the letter x in The Economist A to Z of international relations.

177
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,240
 Right, thanks a lot.

178
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,480
 Love it.

179
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,760
 The way all these things worked, I guess, is you sent in a bit of money and you filled

180
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,120
 out a questionnaire, which could be very long. So the operation match was 75 questions.

181
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,840
 And then they took your questionnaire and they tried to match it up with others using

182
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,560
 a computer algorithm, which is why it was computerized.

183
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,340
 I think a good way of doing it would be to have like 10,000 questions that you have to

184
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,780
 go through and you're matched by how far you go through before you give up.

185
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,780
 That's very good.

186
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,840
 Because I think I would be well matched to someone who had the same level of getting

187
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,200
 bored quickly as I do.

188
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,360
 I think you'd answer them all because you're a completist. Do you like long lists of information?

189
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,080
 And probably the person who dated me would need to be similar to put up with that.

190
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,720
 I do have a dating app for you, James. I know you're off the market, but there is a new

191
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,660
 one in the USA called SCORE, which is a dating app for people who have a good to excellent

192
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
 credit rating.

193
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,660
 Oh!

194
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,660
 And it's...

195
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,860
 I do have a good credit rating.

196
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,860
 I knew you were excellent.

197
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,080
 I just think that's so... I think that's quite good, actually, like...

198
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
 It's very sensible.

199
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,920
 I disagree. I think that's a good case of opposites attract.

200
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,560
 Actually, you're so right, but much more responsible to pay yourself up with someone with a bad

201
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,200
 one so you can raise them up to your level.

202
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
 Absolutely.

203
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
 That's not how it works. They drag you down. Anna.

204
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
 That's what happens in love.

205
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
 You're right.

206
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
 You're right.

207
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
 Drag each other down.

208
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:33,840
 I've got one here from Jeffrey Partica, which is a fishy stretch, it's been said.

209
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,400
 That was disgusting.

210
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,180
 It is a stretch of a fact, but I'm reading it because I know Tom Cruise is a huge, huge

211
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,180
 deal in Andy's life.

212
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:50,140
 So, Tom Cruise took up race car driving and got married because of the Russian Revolution.

213
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,140
 Okay.

214
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:58,220
 Now, it's a long journey. There's a long journey to get to what this is. 1917, Rubin Malmoulian

215
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,560
 was studying at a stage production at the Imperial Moscow University in the hopes of

216
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,260
 directing, and he was from a Tsarist family, so he fled America when the revolution broke

217
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
 out.

218
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
 He became a director...

219
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,260
 Fled to America.

220
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,260
 Sorry.

221
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,460
 Very few people fled America when the Russian Revolution broke out.

222
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,460
 That's too cautious.

223
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,820
 Yeah, he fled to America.

224
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,020
 And years later, he becomes the initial director of Cleopatra with Elizabeth Taylor.

225
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,500
 There was lots of problems, constant script changes, creative differences, so he was

226
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,940
 eventually replaced as the director.

227
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,340
 So then Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor were scheduled to be in the movie together,

228
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,300
 but because of the shooting delays, because of this, Taylor was prevented from joining

229
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,500
 the film, so both roles were recast with Robert Mitchum and Shirley MacLean, which freed up

230
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,620
 Paul Newman to be in The Hustler with Jackie Gleason.

231
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,500
 The Hustler is credited with popularizing pool in America, giving Paul Newman a lifelong

232
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,020
 love of the game.

233
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,340
 It also allowed him to reprise his role as Fast Eddie Felsen 25 years later in the Scorsese

234
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,220
 sequel, The Color of Money.

235
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,980
 James has started eating a biscuit.

236
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,900
 He's likely performatively.

237
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,380
 He could be more far away from the microphone right now.

238
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,260
 That's what happens when he gets interested.

239
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,380
 I don't think I'm going to be needed for a few more minutes.

240
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,580
 It was in this movie, as Fast Eddie Felsen, that Paul Newman introduced Tom Cruise to

241
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,700
 the thrill of driving too fast.

242
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,100
 Thanks to his new love, Cruise was cast in the Nascar movie Days of Thunder.

243
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
 He met Nicole Kidman.

244
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
 Oh, that's the only one, isn't it?

245
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
 Yeah.

246
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100
 And then it just ends.

247
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,700
 There might have been a few other consequences due to the Russian Revolution, but I think

248
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,220
 it'd be difficult to find something more inane.

249
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,620
 That's certainly the worst consequence.

250
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,820
 No, that's terrific.

251
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,820
 Tom Cruise could have had a career as a kind of sensitive character actor.

252
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,820
 Yeah.

253
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,340
 But were it not for the Russian Revolution?

254
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,340
 There you go.

255
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
 Yeah.

256
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,340
 Great.

257
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,340
 Nice.

258
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,340
 Love it.

259
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
 Just on guitars.

260
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,900
 Can I give everyone a guitar song recommendation that's called, it's really good.

261
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,060
 It's called United Breaks Guitars, and it was a hit in 2009.

262
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,700
 Have you, you've heard everything, Andrew.

263
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,700
 He's nodding along.

264
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,860
 It's a musician called Dave Carroll who was, and I guess this must be the bane of a lot

265
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,260
 of guitar players' lives.

266
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:18,580
 He was on a plane and he watched the baggage handlers throw his $3,500 guitar all over

267
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,580
 the shop.

268
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,940
 So, my golf clubs?

269
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,060
 You could sing an equally popular, relatable song about that.

270
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,140
 And it's really good, and he wrote this song about how they've broken his guitar.

271
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,140
 I think it's great, but they're nice, tragically like country.

272
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,460
 It's wonderful, isn't it?

273
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,460
 It's really good.

274
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,380
 It's that thing where, you know, this incredibly precious thing.

275
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:44,380
 I mean, obviously there's a kind of, like a hand luggage arms race, isn't there?

276
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,420
 And there was originally a story about people employed in airports are, they're rewarded

277
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:55,100
 like a few quid for each bag they sort of refuse to put on.

278
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,020
 Because it's, imagine how difficult that job actually is.

279
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,020
 You've got a massive stag do who haven't read the terms and conditions.

280
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,820
 They've all got bags, two bigs to go on.

281
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,700
 You've got to tell everyone it's, you know, you can't take it on, and it's 60 extra quids

282
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,580
 to put it on the hold each.

283
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,820
 But with guitars, yeah, just, you know, this incredibly precious thing, what you have to

284
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,580
 do is down tune them when you, if you're going to put them in the luggage hold, put it in

285
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,220
 a hard case, down tune it so you haven't got the tension on the strings.

286
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,860
 If it gets dropped or smashed, that tension can make the neck cave in.

287
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,860
 Yeah, right.

288
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,860
 Wow.

289
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,860
 Interesting.

290
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,300
 And that taking the tuning down is actually an entire style of guitaring in Hawaii.

291
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,260
 And I'd never heard of this.

292
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,420
 Slack key guitar.

293
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,740
 Oh, wow.

294
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:47,260
 Slack keyed guitar is where you basically are detuning at least three strings of your

295
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,100
 guitar in order to create an open cord that you can play.

296
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,620
 And then you can use the top notes as your baseline, and then you can play with the open

297
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,620
 cord for the rest.

298
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,540
 The thing about it is, like I was talking earlier about hiding your fingers behind a

299
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,980
 handkerchief, slack key guitar in Hawaii was also something where you would hand down the

300
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,660
 tunings of each of those six strings to your family and not let anyone else know.

301
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,820
 So it became like the family style of playing this particular guitar and we know a bunch

302
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,820
 of them now.

303
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,100
 Yeah, it's become more open now, but that was, it was, it was handed down as the family

304
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,860
 secret for how you would play guitar.

305
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,020
 And so everyone would have their own specific open cord.

306
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
 Wow.

307
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,460
 All these secret guitar chords.

308
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,380
 I had no idea that it was such an exciting secretive world, the world of guitar playing.

309
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,180
 And we're sure it's not just because people always have to fly to Hawaii on a plane and

310
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,500
 then they've left their guitars on strong.

311
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,300
 Oh, fuck, I better make this a thing.

312
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,100
 The first album I ever bought was the Jimi Hendrix album, which was great, because he

313
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
 does sound like nobody else.

314
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,140
 Like it is an unbelievable sound he has.

315
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,020
 And it was partly thanks to his sound engineer guy who was called Roger Mayer.

316
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,140
 And this is where the other weird military link comes in, because Roger Mayer sort of

317
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,620
 qualified, did all his early work in acoustics in the Royal Naval Scientific Service, working

318
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,700
 on underwater warfare.

319
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,260
 He was on submarines.

320
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,700
 He was working on the stuff of keeping submarines silent.

321
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,940
 You know, that was his whole project when he was in the, in the Navy.

322
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,660
 So I just love this quote, when a steel hulled sub is running silent, you know, the whole

323
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,020
 point about submarines is you stay completely quiet and no one knows that you're there.

324
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,500
 When it's running silent, the sound of a dropped spanner can be picked up and the

325
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,020
 subsposition located from up to 160 kilometers away.

326
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,020
 What?

327
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
 What?

328
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,020
 Imagine that.

329
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,020
 Can that be true?

330
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,060
 He, like, I know what he's talking about, I guess.

331
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,060
 He, exactly.

332
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,060
 I can't believe it.

333
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,060
 So basically all of, he realized all of his work also applied to guitars and he made this

334
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,340
 amazing sound effects device for Hendrix, which creates an amazing trippy harmonic sound,

335
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,420
 the octave above your playing.

336
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,620
 And he showed it to Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin and Jimmy Page said, well, that's too much

337
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,620
 for me.

338
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,620
 Yeah, that's too far out for me.

339
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,620
 Right.

340
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,620
 But Hendrix was into it.

341
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,620
 Roger Mair is still alive.

342
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,620
 He's still.

343
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,620
 He's still around.

344
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,620
 Yeah.

345
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,300
 So the question is, if you put Jimmy Hendrix on a submarine and got him to play Purple

346
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:10,100
 H, how far away the whole world could listen?

347
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,620
 That period of time is one that I'm endlessly fascinated with the kind of, you know, the

348
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,500
 mid sixties or a lot of those bands, a lot of the movies that came out around that time

349
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,180
 are a source of perennial fascination to me.

350
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:26,500
 And one of the things that is so strange about it all is, it's obviously, it's so close

351
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,220
 to the Second World War, you know, like the, and the whole cultural landscape, it's like

352
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,900
 when you see photos of Bob Dylan touring the mid sixties and he's occasionally just walking

353
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:42,220
 around just sort of rubble in Liverpool or something because the whole, the whole idea

354
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,140
 of like the free love sixties is so close to the end of the Second World War.

355
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,140
 And there's all these people who were sort of just called like just doing military service

356
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:57,140
 and then suddenly are now trying to work out how to make Jimmy Hendrix's guitar successfully

357
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:03,540
 emulate the noise that runs through his head when he takes LSD, you know, it's like.

358
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
 It's such an interesting point.

359
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,260
 I think it's something that will never certainly with the world of like rock music experience

360
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,500
 again, where I was listening to Ozzy Osbourne talk the other day about the Beatles and he

361
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,420
 said, you just, you will never understand what the Beatles meant to us, not just the

362
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,140
 music, what they meant to us.

363
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,260
 We were in a black and white world and it went technicolor.

364
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,740
 We suddenly believe that life was fun again and it was through that and it's, and all

365
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,740
 that period is what that was.

366
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,420
 They were building off the back of trying to get back into technicolor off the back of

367
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,420
 war.

368
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,420
 It's fascinating stuff.

369
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,420
 I agree.

370
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,420
 I'm obsessed with that period.

371
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:43,940
 In the Yellow Submarine, you're in quiet and you drop a spanner.

372
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,940
 Here's one.

373
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:51,140
 Dolphins, says Andrew Heldenbrand, can use ultrasound to detect pregnancies and will

374
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,200
 pay special attention to pregnant women, nuzzling them while scanning them with ultrasonic

375
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
 frequencies.

376
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,700
 That's pretty cool, isn't it?

377
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,140
 Walker, can they tell you things like what sex it is?

378
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,140
 Yeah, they'll say.

379
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,060
 Does it have the right number of fingers and toes?

380
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,700
 It's very annoying sometimes because they'll say, you must have been hoping for a boy or

381
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,420
 whatever and you might not have wanted to know that yet.

382
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,380
 What level of detail could they turn to the dad and go, it's bad news, I think I might

383
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,380
 have been the neighbor.

384
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,940
 Are they, is that, what are they fighting now?

385
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,420
 What's your milkman's nose like?

386
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:28,300
 I don't think it's huge detail, but I think they could probably detect the heartbeat because

387
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,500
 they can do a very, very narrow beam of echolocation, it's called buzzing and they sound like a squeaky

388
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,220
 door to us when they're doing it.

389
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,340
 That is cool, isn't it?

390
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,260
 So why don't they use, when you go to have your first scan, why don't they use dolphins

391
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,260
 instead of the machines?

392
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,900
 The natural way.

393
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:50,260
 When you're having your water birth, yeah, meet the literal wet nurse, Flipper.

394
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
 Have you guys heard of kitten fishing?

395
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,260
 No.

396
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,260
 No.

397
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,260
 Can you guess what it is?

398
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,380
 It's not pretending to be a kitten.

399
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,540
 So cat fishing is where you pretend to be someone you're completely not and then they

400
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,620
 think that they're dating you but you're not doing it and then eventually you might get

401
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
 some money off the most.

402
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:11,180
 So kitten fishing, I reckon, is you pretending to be yourself as a child?

403
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,540
 I see, to catch pedophiles or something.

404
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,540
 Yes.

405
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
 No, it's not that.

406
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,260
 It is just embellishing or misrepresenting yourself online to make you more desirable.

407
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,260
 We all do that.

408
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,620
 Well, that's a special way for that.

409
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,060
 So according to Hinge, the website, the trouble is that when you do that, it kind of defeats

410
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,820
 the whole purpose of online dating, which is to find the right match.

411
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,780
 So you really have to be kind of as close to real as possible.

412
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,140
 Wait, but your right match is definitely lying as well.

413
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,740
 I think that's how everyone's doing, right?

414
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,740
 They're all banking on everyone, exaggerating.

415
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,980
 That's what the first day is all about, working out what the lies were.

416
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
 Yes, exactly.

417
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,980
 OK.

418
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,980
 What about woke fishing?

419
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,980
 Oh, my God.

420
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,980
 Oh, pretending to be woke.

421
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,980
 Yeah, pretending to have views.

422
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,980
 Absolutely.

423
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,980
 That's the thing.

424
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,980
 Of course I support the cause, Conrad.

425
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,980
 Actually.

426
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,140
 Until you're in the pants.

427
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,100
 Then it turns out you're shameful.

428
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,460
 In your bedside drawer, you've got a Tory rosette.

429
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
 Is that it?

430
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
 It's too late.

431
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,460
 She's in love.

432
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,940
 It's pretty much that.

433
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,940
 Orbiting.

434
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,820
 Orbiting is what that's a term.

435
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,580
 It's another term that's in like modern dating slang.

436
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,780
 So that's circling around someone not approaching.

437
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,540
 Yeah, pretty much, but in an online setting.

438
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,820
 So staying like occasionally liking the photos, leaving the odd very, very innocuous comments

439
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,900
 so that you're kind of in the orbit, but you're not really engaging with them.

440
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
 And then zombieing.

441
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,900
 Yeah.

442
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,900
 Coming back from the dead.

443
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,900
 Yeah.

444
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,460
 And offering a date.

445
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,460
 Pretty much.

446
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,460
 Nice.

447
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,460
 So you know what ghosting is?

448
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,460
 Yeah.

449
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,900
 Where you just stop replying to someone completely and pretend they don't exist.

450
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
 I know about it.

451
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
 Well, it's when someone who's previously.

452
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,540
 My wife's been doing it to me since yesterday.

453
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,500
 It's when someone who's previously ghosted you suddenly reappears and acts as if nothing

454
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 ever happened.

455
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
 Oh.

456
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
 Zombieing.

457
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
 That's very good.

458
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
 Very good.

459
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
 Very, very good.

460
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,300
 Jack Kerouac.

461
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:01,740
 We said he's American and he was American, but his parents were Quebeca, Quebequaz.

462
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,740
 Quebe...

463
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,860
 He was, they were from Quebec.

464
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:12,140
 But that meant that until he was six years old, he only spoke Jewel.

465
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:18,700
 Jewel is like, Jewel is a sort of a dialect from Quebec.

466
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,900
 It's kind of half French, half English, all very, very weird.

467
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,020
 So the name comes from how they say the word chivalre.

468
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,220
 So chivalre is French for horse and there's a phrase to speak French like a horse means

469
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,940
 to speak French very, very badly.

470
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,260
 And so they call it Jewel and they have lots of sort of English words in there.

471
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:46,100
 So dompe in Jewel means to throw out the trash like it comes from the dump and they turn

472
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,140
 it into a French thing.

473
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
 That's great.

474
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,140
 The word from peanut is pinot, just slightly French.

475
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:59,800
 And the word poutine, you know, which is like, it's like chips with cheese and gravy on it.

476
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,780
 It's absolutely delicious.

477
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,580
 But we think it might be Jewel for pudding.

478
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,500
 So as in they took the English word pudding and then it became poutine and then it became

479
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
 that.

480
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 Really?

481
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,780
 But it's often called a degenerate language.

482
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,260
 He spoke it obviously, because he was born speaking it.

483
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,780
 And I think maybe we don't know to what extent he was speaking standard French, Canadian

484
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,940
 to what extent it was Jewel, but even age 18, he still had quite a strong French accent,

485
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:29,980
 which I think is quite cocky given that age 17 was when he decided to write a great American

486
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,480
 novel in English.

487
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,740
 Well, you know, yeah, you got to say, yes, it's high, but you know, when you're not fluent

488
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
 English yet.

489
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,740
 I think that's pretty cool.

490
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,020
 Like how Napoleon was from Corsica, isn't it?

491
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,020
 Exactly.

492
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,020
 A lot of the most famous people from a place were actually from the borders or the fringes

493
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,020
 or the outline reasons.

494
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,020
 Hitler was from Austria.

495
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
 Yeah.

496
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
 Right.

497
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,020
 Stalin was from Georgia.

498
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
 Yeah.

499
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
 Yeah.

500
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
 And we don't want to compare Kerouac to Hitler.

501
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,020
 Stalin on Napoleon.

502
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,740
 Tony Blair was born in Edinburgh.

503
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,740
 Oh, the inbox.

504
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
 Oh, my God.

505
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,740
 Sometimes I just look forward.

506
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,380
 Okay, that is it.

507
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,100
 That is all of our outtakes.

508
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,100
 Thanks everyone.

509
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,500
 If you want to send in any thoughts about what you heard, if it made you think of a random

510
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,740
 extra fact, why not send that in to podcast@qi.com.

511
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,980
 All the people that were on the show today are all online.

512
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,100
 If you want to message them directly somewhere on Instagram or Twitter, go find their ads.

513
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,300
 Otherwise, come back in two weeks.

514
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,780
 We're going to have a drop us a line waiting for you and we will see you all then goodbye.
