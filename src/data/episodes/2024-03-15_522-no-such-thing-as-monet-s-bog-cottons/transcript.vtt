00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.380
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.900
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.340
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.380
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.420
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.360
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.620
 James Harkin and John Lloyd.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.920
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.680
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.800
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.980
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Johnny.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.560
 - My fact is, when the impressionist Claude Monet

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.960
 lived at Giverny, he had six gardeners,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.120
 one of whose whole job was to dust and wash the water lilies

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.480
 and clean the surface of the water.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.200
 - Wow, I guess if you're famous for painting water lilies,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.000
 you want them to look as good as possible, don't you?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.840
 It makes sense.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.680
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.680
 They need to be picturesque.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.120
 - Although maybe you wouldn't paint

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.160
 the bits of dust on them anyway, would you?

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.960
 How do you dust a water lily?

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.160
 - What are you using for that, a Hoover?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.240
 - I think you just wet it, right?

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.960
 But these were very special water lilies.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320
 They were specially imported from Japan.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.400
 Monet was crazy about Japanese art,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.680
 which you probably know had just arrived in France

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.840
 when Japan opened up in the 1850s to the West.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.440
 All these prints started arriving

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.800
 and all the impressionists were crazy about them.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.440
 And Monet got a real bargain.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.720
 In Zandarm, he was in Holland for a bit.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.120
 And there was a porcelain dealer

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.040
 who didn't know that these Japanese prints

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.280
 were going to come from World Finance

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.320
 and he wrapped all his china in them.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.200
 And so Monet bought some cheap china

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.520
 with these amazing prints by Hokusai

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.880
 and Hiroshige and all that.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.440
 - Oh, wow, cool.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.720
 - And I'm wearing the Hokusai jumper today.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.560
 - Oh, wow.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 - So you are.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.400
 - Is that deliberate?

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.240
 - No.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.240
 - So Hokusai is famous for this wave painting.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 People will know it.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.720
 Well, it's on my jumper and it's around.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 And it comes from a set of paintings called,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.600
 I think it's called 36 Views of Mount Fuji.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.720
 But there's actually 46 Views of Mount Fuji in that set

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.280
 because he did 36 and they were so popular.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.560
 He did another 10, but he didn't change the name.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.400
 - That's great.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.240
 - Too much effort.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.600
 Did he run out of energy just to the end?

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.440
 - That's interesting.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.560
 Monet also was famous for doing lots of paintings

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.760
 of the same thing, not just Waterloo's.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.000
 Steam trains he did, poplars.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.480
 Haystacks was very popular.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.360
 Same with Cézanne, who was a great mate of Monet's.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.080
 And Cézanne painted Molson Victoire, I think 200 times

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.720
 and never felt he got it quite right.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.640
 It was an extraordinary life

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.720
 because he struggled hugely with poverty

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.040
 and depression all his life.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.520
 But by the time we were talking about the Waterloo's,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.720
 he'd suddenly got rich.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.920
 I think the thing that really kicked it off

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.040
 was the heiress to the singer-sewing machine fortune.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.280
 I think her name was something like Waynetta,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.760
 something like what?

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.600
 - Waynetta Slop.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.000
 - Waynetta singer, what was she called?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.680
 Winaretta Singer, she was called.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.520
 - Wow.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.400
 - And she came to see Monet in 1886

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.760
 and she loved his stuff and bought a painting.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.840
 And suddenly the whole place is full of Americans

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.680
 coming to see him.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.880
 - It was Americans, wasn't it?

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.560
 It was American money that came in.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.640
 And is it Cassat?

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.600
 Marie Cassat, who was one of the impressionists.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.360
 And she was arguably the most important one

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.880
 because she was the one who got all the Americans

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.600
 really interested in it.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.520
 And then the Americans started buying all this stuff

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.440
 and then the impressionists just had loads of money

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.080
 and could do what they wanted.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.760
 - Yeah, I found a real offensive

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.280
 because I actually been to Zandarm.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.000
 In fact, I bought a boat in Zandarm

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.960
 and I rode it there for a year.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.160
 - An every man kind of story.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.960
 (all laughing)

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.200
 - 'Cause I often quote Monet, who had this great line,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.080
 "After 20 years, the wall is still there,"

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.800
 by which he meant to do things really well.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.880
 You've got to get the other side of this block

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.240
 into the zone, into the settlement.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.160
 And I often quote that as something that I feel very upset.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.800
 But this is a guy who, age 28,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.800
 he threw himself into the sain

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.880
 and attempted to drown himself.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.720
 - Yes, why, what was his plan there?

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.600
 Because it was unsuccessful, of course.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.840
 And if you can swim, I think it is quite hard.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.680
 - Well, that was the problem.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.680
 He jumped in and then regretted it and made it.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.560
 And remember, he was an incredibly good swimmer.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.080
 - All right, to the shore.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.680
 - It's currents, currents take you under

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.920
 and stop you from getting back up.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.960
 - I know, but you've got to pick your bit.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.560
 Like, if you can swim,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.320
 and I think it's quite hard to just not move your body.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.920
 - In order to paint a water lily,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.560
 you need to be a water lily.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.400
 - Right.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.720
 - Perhaps that's what was going on there.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.400
 - He was that committed.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.320
 He was, that's really interesting

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.320
 that you say you identify with him, John.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.280
 'Cause he kind of reminded me of you as I was reading this,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.040
 because as you say, he was such a perfectionist

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.640
 and obsessive and did seem to have this conviction

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.760
 he wasn't doing well enough.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.280
 He had another quote that was,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.080
 "My life has been nothing but a failure

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.400
 "and all that's left for me to do

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.160
 "is to destroy my paintings before I disappear."

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160
 - Oh, yeah, that's you, John.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.880
 (all laughing)

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.000
 - He did, he destroyed 500 of his paintings.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 - Wow. - In 1908,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.320
 they had to cancel an exhibition

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.200
 'cause he'd slashed 15 of the paintings with a knife.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.520
 - Must have been seriously annoying

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.280
 for the gallery curators.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.680
 - But this is worrying, Hannah, because--

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.560
 - I took my halfway through that theory.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.280
 I was like, "Why have I said this to my boss?"

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.200
 But go on. (all laughing)

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.960
 - John, no, no, don't go down to the tent

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.480
 to throw yourself in, for God's sake.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.080
 - Have you read Steve Jobs's biography by Walter--

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.400
 - Walter Isaacson? - Yes.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.880
 It's a searing book about this terribly complicated

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.120
 and really sort of mad person.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.120
 And I suddenly thought Jobs's perfection's a bit like me,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.320
 and I came back and I said to a friend,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.120
 "Have you read the Steve Jobs bio?"

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.960
 And he said, "Yes."

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.920
 I said, "Do you think I'm a bit like Steve Jobs?"

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.960
 And he went, "Um..."

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.200
 (all laughing)

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.640
 - You did genuinely go through a period

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.400
 of wearing polo-neck shirts.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.000
 Was that after that biography?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.360
 - Oh, yeah. - No, I've always worn them.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.200
 Have you, I guess. - He got it from you,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.800
 didn't he? - He's a navy thing, yeah.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.680
 - Oh, yeah. - All right.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.680
 The thing about the number,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.760
 the volume of paintings that he did, back to Monet,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.560
 there's accounts of where he'd be painting a scene

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.320
 and almost like filming a movie where your lighting changes

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.880
 and that's it for the day.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.760
 He'd go, "Get me another canvas."

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.440
 And they might bring another canvas

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.440
 that he was painting yesterday at that exact time,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.680
 so then he could continue on that.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.080
 So he was constantly swapping in and out canvases

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.360
 of work and progress.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.480
 - And he also used, because he had so many children,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.280
 because a very complicated private life

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.560
 is not sure you've discovered.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.160
 - Yeah, so it's similar to you again, John.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.880
 (all laughing)

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.200
 - That's so not true, so unfair.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.680
 - But yeah, and there were eight children in the house.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.600
 And he would get a swarm of them each to carry a canvas

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.840
 and he'd trot off to the beach with all these children

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.800
 and work on all the canvases at once.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.480
 - It sounds like chaos.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.760
 And actually, this element of his life

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.760
 reminds me more of Dan Shriver in fact.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.360
 (all laughing)

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.560
 - Too many kids.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.320
 - The next insult is level this way.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.240
 It's just the chaotic number of children,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.760
 because yes, he was quite poverty stricken for a long time.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.280
 - Yeah. - And then hit it.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.400
 (all laughing)

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.640
 - But then the art dealer who sold his art,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.960
 who was Ernest Hoshaday,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.240
 he was also poverty stricken, went bankrupt,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.200
 so moved in with Monet, Ernest brought his wife,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.280
 and I believe there's six children.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.360
 - Six children, yeah.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.960
 - In with Monet and Monet's wife and their two children,

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.200
 and then Monet fell in love with Ernest's wife,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.000
 and they're all, they can't pay rent,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.080
 and it just sounds like hell, God knows how he was putting

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.120
 together these really peaceful, blissful paintings.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.960
 - Dear dad.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.440
 - Where am I in those things that's where I'm at?

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.120
 - I imagine stepping into that household

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.960
 would fill me with the same sense of anxiety

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.360
 as like stepping into your house

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.840
 on a normal Saturday afternoon.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.000
 - Fair call, fair call.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.120
 - We should say his gardens were unpopular

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.600
 with a certain cohort, basically his neighbors, right?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.360
 Who were not fans,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.320
 'cause he subsumed everything to his art,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.000
 which went to the extent of him re-routing a local river

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.200
 to feed his, his, yes, to feed his pond.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.960
 And so all the neighbors who needed the river

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.880
 for their cattle farming and other things,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.680
 were like, well, this is our water.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.240
 And then they all panicked, 'cause they thought

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.320
 the lilies would poison the water supply,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.760
 'cause they were foreign and exotic.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.600
 - They were.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.440
 - And, yeah.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.440
 - The lilies are really interesting,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.720
 because they had been invented very recently,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.920
 'cause all the lilies in France were white,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.760
 and there's a guy called Boris Latour Malliac,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.040
 who came up with the idea of crossing French lilies

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.520
 with Japanese lilies,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.360
 and he kind of crossed two together

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.520
 and came up with this new version,

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.160
 and then he crossed that new version

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.720
 with some from North America

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.760
 to make all these different colors of lilies.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.400
 And actually, the in-between version of lily

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.880
 that he made is now extinct,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.280
 so we can't make that bit of science that he did ever again,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.400
 because the in-between step has gone.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.320
 - Wow.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.480
 - But Monet's first order from this guy, we have it,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.720
 and he ordered a load of water lilies from him,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.320
 but he also ordered some water smart weed,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.400
 a horn nut, and some broad-leaved bog cotton.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.800
 So those paintings could have been paintings

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.520
 of broad-leaved bog cotton,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.120
 if that had taken better than his water lilies.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.080
 - Yeah.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.040
 - The thing about him was that he was such

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.960
 an incredibly determined person.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.520
 Renoir said, "If it wasn't for Monet,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.920
 "we'd have all given up,"

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.120
 'cause he went on beyond the pain barrier all the time.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.160
 - They weren't massively late to the very start

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.400
 where they'd be Impressionists.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.320
 - No, no, it was incredibly unpopular.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.040
 There were booed and laughed at.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.960
 - Yeah, the word Impressionism came as an insult.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.120
 It was one of Monet's paintings was called

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.320
 Sunset and Impressionism.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.400
 - Impression Sunrise, yeah.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.040
 - Yeah, yeah, but then one of the critics

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.040
 made some funny joke about it.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.240
 I haven't written it down already.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.720
 - All right, I have is, he was called Louis Leroy,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.960
 and one of his lines on Impression Sunrise was,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.240
 "Wallpaper in its original state

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.600
 "is more finished than this seascape."

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.440
 - Wow.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.280
 Oh my goodness.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.640
 - And then when the Impressionists became famous,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.000
 he then took all the credit for it.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.040
 He was very proud that he'd invented the name,

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.160
 but he'd rubbish them at the time.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.000
 - Oh, really?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.280
 - Yeah, he was really rude about them.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.120
 And then the second time they did an exhibition,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.560
 it was described by a critic called Albert Wolfe

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.440
 as a horrifying spectacle,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.520
 five or six lunatics, one of whom is a woman.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.920
 (all laughing)

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.480
 And the woman he's talking about is Bertha Moriso,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.320
 and she's really interesting because she and her sisters

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.160
 were learning to paint,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.520
 and they had a private tutor called Joseph Guichard,

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.040
 and he won their mother,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.080
 considering the characters of your daughters,

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.000
 they will become painters.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.560
 Do you realise what this means?

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.360
 In the upper class milieu to which you belong,

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.160
 this will be revolutionary,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.520
 I might say almost catastrophic.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.480
 The idea that one of these girls

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.120
 might become a professional painter

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.640
 was just seen as not an acceptable profession.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.640
 - Yeah, people said they have declared war on beauty.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.320
 That was the kind of idea of what they were doing.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.240
 And Zola said they shouldn't be called Impressionists,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.400
 they should be called actualists,

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.240
 because that's what they were doing.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.520
 They were painting the actual thing.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.760
 Kind of like losing a beauty filter, I guess.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:05.600
 - They're not actually,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.080
 because if water lilies look like that,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.600
 then I think I've got something wrong with my eyesight.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.240
 It's blurry, aren't they painting their impression of it?

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.720
 - I think you are used to seeing dusty water lilies.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.360
 (all laughing)

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.440
 - 'Cause actually that painting that we named,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.960
 which was the Impression Sunrise,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.560
 I think he didn't have a name,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.400
 and he was gonna call it like Sunrise,

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.240
 and someone said to him,

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.080
 "Well, you can't really call it a Sunrise,

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.080
 "because it doesn't really look like a Sunrise."

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.720
 And he said, "Okay, we'll just put Impression Sunrise then."

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.960
 And that's kind of eventually,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.640
 after the insult where Impressionists came from.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.480
 - Yeah, right.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.560
 - The thing about Monet is that he was famous

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.520
 and immensely rich in his lifetime,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.560
 quite unlike Van Gogh, for example.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.960
 But you wouldn't forget that he was so,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.720
 it was such a disaster at the beginning.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.640
 So that exhibition that Louis Leroy commented on,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.760
 when all the figures came in,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.880
 the Impressionists found they each owed 184 francs

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.960
 to the gallery.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.800
 - Wow.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.320
 - They actually lost money.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.480
 - It's like the Edinburgh Festival.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.840
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.360
 - And so they had another go.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.080
 One of their few financial supporters decided

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.120
 to hold a lottery in which the first prize was

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.360
 one of Monet's friend Renoir's paintings.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.720
 And they had this lottery,

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.840
 and a local servant girl won the big prize.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.080
 She didn't want the painting,

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.440
 'cause she just heard everyone boo it,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.600
 so she got a cake.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.440
 - I don't know.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.520
 If you offered me a painting,

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.200
 be it Impressionists or not, or a cake,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.920
 I know there are days when I'd go for the cake.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.760
 - Yeah.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.160
 - It's like a short termism, isn't it?

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.360
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.040
 'Cause you have to go to the trouble of selling the painting

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.640
 in order to get the money to buy lots of cake,

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.960
 if that's how you wanna do it.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.800
 - Yeah, good point.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.640
 - And it's quicker just to get the cake.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.480
 - Really good point.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.320
 - The thing I love most about Monet,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.160
 and I didn't really know anything about

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.080
 what he was painting.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.160
 I knew the water lilies,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.480
 but I didn't know about this garden.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.680
 And the maintenance of the garden

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.040
 was so that he had the perfect thing to paint.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.520
 There was nothing left to the imagination.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.920
 So it wasn't even just the water lilies.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.360
 If trees that he were painting

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.840
 suddenly came into bloom and foliage was there,

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.280
 he'd hire gardeners to chop it away.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.160
 'Cause it's getting in the way

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.360
 of what I had as the perfect painting.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.560
 - I've been to the garden.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.400
 - Have you?

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.840
 - Yeah, it's just a garden with lots of tourists in it.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.680
 But it's like...

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.080
 - It's weird, he always painted the tourists

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.360
 out to the pictures, didn't he?

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.440
 - But it was like, it was a Japanese garden.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.560
 That's what he called it, I think.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.480
 Or that's what he was aiming for, a Japanese garden.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.040
 'Cause it's got a Japanese bridge, like you say.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.760
 And there's now, if you go to Japan,

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.120
 I can't remember which town it's in,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.400
 but there's like a replica of it

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.880
 called the Monet Pond.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.000
 And so it's like, he copied the Japanese gardens

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.920
 and now Japan has copied his garden

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.160
 and called it the Monet Garden.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.880
 - That seems great.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.080
 So the garden itself didn't immediately become

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.520
 a public place.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.240
 It was many years in the family.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.760
 And then the sun, when he passed away in 1966,

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.160
 he handed it over and it became part of a museum

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.200
 and then opened to the public.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.160
 And they've had these amazing gardeners

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.440
 that have been working there ever since

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.560
 to preserve as close as possible to what he had.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.720
 And so, as you said, James, they can't manufacture

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.680
 some of the plants anymore because a step is missing.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.560
 And so they have to find alternatives.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.440
 But it's just, it's so wonderful reading the accounts

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.200
 of how they go through all his letters.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.080
 They take the paintings and they hold them up

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.280
 exactly in the spot at the right distance

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.200
 and try and match the ponds to what is in the painting.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.200
 - So they're doing the exact same thing that he did,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.960
 but in reverse again. - In reverse, yeah.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.520
 - It's a really nice place to go.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.280
 It's almost like Disneyland, I would say.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.240
 It's quite fake, but it's like, it's really, really beautiful.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.560
 And it's definitely worth visiting.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.800
 - He was almost killed in 1865 while painting.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.640
 - Oh yeah?

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.760
 - Yeah, a rogue discus knocked him out.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.160
 - No, I do it. - 1865, you see?

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.800
 - Yeah, 1865. - Houseland.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.520
 - He was painting in the open

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.000
 and there were a bunch of picnickers and some children.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.200
 And a discus suddenly caved to shot.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.080
 - Who brings a discus to a picnic?

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.600
 - English tourists.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.760
 - That's amazing. - It says.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.800
 And so he ran to protect the kids,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.600
 but in doing so, it's kind of like a secret server sage

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.000
 and jumping out of the president and taking the bullet.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.880
 He took the discus. - That's so funny.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.480
 - They say if it had hit him any higher,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.840
 it might have killed him, but it knocked him out

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.440
 and he was bedridden for a while.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.120
 - So that exactly illustrates the QI principle, Dan,

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.600
 because I have read an entire book on Monet,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.800
 a 300-page book on Monet, in great detail

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.120
 to research this thing.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.720
 And I didn't know that thing about the discus.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.560
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.320
 - And Dan got it from Buzzfeed to Top 10 Facebook.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.760
 (all laughing)

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.520
 - Which impressionist are you most likely to be, Quiz?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.880
 (all laughing)

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.460
 (upbeat music)

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:31.760
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.680
 - My fact this week is that Neolithic Europeans

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.840
 regularly burn their houses down for no apparent reason.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.760
 - Wow. - That's amazing.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.280
 - It is unbelievable.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:47.280
 So this is a culture called the Cucuteni-Triplia culture.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.640
 Which is usually Neolithic cultures

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.200
 that are sort of named often, at least,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.040
 on where the evidence of them is found.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.160
 And they lived in southeast in Europe,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.440
 in like Romania, Moldova, Ukraine,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.440
 that kind of area between about 5,100 BC and 2,800 BC

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.200
 with lots of variation in how it's dated.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.440
 But the bizarre thing about them is,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.600
 from all the evidence we have, every 60 to 80 years,

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.360
 they just burn down all their houses.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.600
 - So weird. - Yeah.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.480
 - And entire towns, really.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.520
 So a lot of people think they were like the first civilization

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.800
 because they suddenly had these huge towns.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.800
 The settlement sizes increased by 20 times.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.640
 - They sometimes call them cities, don't they?

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.280
 - Yes, yeah. - I think it's a slightly

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.880
 optimistic. - How do you know it was them

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.920
 burning them down rather than the neighbors

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.760
 coming along the end of the week?

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.360
 - Yeah, Anna, well, well, do I know,

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.080
 I've done some extensive archaeology,

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.920
 and I have learned a few things.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.880
 So a lot of people have said it might be that.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.320
 I think the reason they say it's not

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.600
 is that it would have taken such a huge amount

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.480
 of fuel to do it.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.680
 So a settlement of 100 houses would require

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.800
 like four square miles of forest.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.200
 And also it's so regular.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.800
 It's this weird 60 to 80 cycle.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.920
 - There's a weird theory as well that they were actually

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.160
 reinforcing the structures when they were burning it

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.680
 because they found the walls actually hardened.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.600
 Just like, let's reset our houses.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.040
 Get everything out, let's burn the house down, and then--

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.920
 - Well, almost like firing a pot.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.600
 - Exactly. - You know, you have your clay

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.920
 and then you've set it on fire and it makes,

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.840
 it becomes hard.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.320
 But I think I read one thing saying that might not be true

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.840
 because eventually you would burn it

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.600
 and it would become really, really hard.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.400
 And then if you wanted to build another house on it,

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.720
 it just made it really difficult

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.560
 because you can't put any foundations down

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.800
 because you just can't drill into it.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.360
 Because in those days, they didn't have the tools for it.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.200
 - Yeah.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.960
 - One idea is that it might have been ceremonial

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.280
 while they were burning these down, right?

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.120
 - Yeah.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.480
 - Because if you look at Çatalhöyek in Turkey,

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.640
 which is an area we've spoken about before,

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.000
 which is like a really old town,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.520
 they did this as well.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.040
 And we can find out exactly how they did it.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.440
 And every time they would take all the goods out of the house,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.840
 then they would clean the house,

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.240
 then they would put arrowheads on the floor,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.280
 and then the oven would be deliberately sort of knocked in

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.000
 and broken down, and then they would set fire to it.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.520
 And it seems like they always set fire

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.200
 from the south of the house, no matter when they did it.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.080
 So perhaps seeing as it was always the same

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.920
 in this particular part of Turkey at least,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.800
 maybe there was a ceremonial reason behind it.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.200
 - Yeah, and it does seem to have happened

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.880
 in a few other cultures as well.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.560
 So perhaps that was just the done thing.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.240
 They'd wonder why we don't burn our houses down.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.720
 - It's pretty amazing looking at drawings

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.800
 of what these places, cities, if we use that term, look like,

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.400
 'cause they were massive buildings.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.840
 And I don't place massive buildings to 5,000 BC.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.200
 - How massive are we talking, Dan?

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.200
 - Well, okay. - Virgil Khalifa?

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.120
 - Yeah, no, not that, but multi-story.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.040
 They would have multi-story.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.600
 And some places would be, if you can picture,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.960
 the example that's given is two entire basketball courts

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.280
 would be the size of a place, and that, I don't know.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.960
 Maybe that's my ignorance of history.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.880
 - Certainly, if you had that in central London,

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.480
 we're talking quite a few mills.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.520
 - Oh, definitely.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.440
 - So I couldn't find many examples of Neolithic housing,

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.040
 but Jericho is interesting.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.000
 It's supposed to be the oldest city in the world.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.040
 Did you know that? - No.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.520
 - On the Palestinian West Bank.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.360
 And the Tower of Jericho is the oldest stone building

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.960
 in the world, 8,000 years old.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.000
 - How interesting.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.440
 - And the Neolithic housing in Jericho,

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.560
 they had the doors were in the roof.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.840
 Did you know that?

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.280
 - Oh, so they would enter ladders.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.120
 - You had a ladder, you put a ladder up,

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:20.960
 you went in through the door,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.600
 and there's a ladder inside to go down to the ground floor.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.760
 - That's super fun. - What was the good thing for that?

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.760
 - Because of defence, the whole thing is,

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.640
 what's fascinating about it, I had to look up,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.080
 remind myself, what Neolithic meant.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.440
 And as far as I can gather,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.840
 it basically starts with the invention of farming

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.720
 about 12,000 years ago,

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:45.160
 and ends with when bronze is invented about 4,300 years ago.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.200
 So it's about 8,000 years, so not that long.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.320
 But the first humans came to Britain around 700,000 BC.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.120
 So for 688,000 years,

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.920
 human beings were just sitting about, eating fruit.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.640
 - Or wandering around. - Survive, yes.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.200
 - What they were sitting about, really, just walking.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.920
 - They were wandering, yeah. - Yeah, hunting, gathering.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.760
 - Yeah, and Neolithic basically describes the time

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.120
 that humans became, I suppose, what we are, like, civilisation.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.160
 We settled, we found farming, we discovered farming,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.600
 and so we just started sitting there farming stuff.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.800
 Our diet's got much worse.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.800
 - Jared Diamond says it was the worst thing

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.840
 that humans have ever done, doesn't he?

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.280
 - Inventive farming. - Yeah, I think there's something

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.440
 to be said for that, and everything moves terribly fast.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.200
 So 688,000 years doing nothing,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.360
 and then suddenly you got farming 12,000 years ago,

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.520
 chickens domesticated 10,000 years ago,

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.640
 roasted walnuts first eaten in France 8,000 years ago,

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.360
 6,000 years ago, there were no white people then.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.200
 Everybody was dark-skinned.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.800
 And then the first known pair of shoes is 5,500 years ago,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.080
 so that's, you know... - Oh, my God.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.280
 - And, sorry, the game changer was the invention of the...

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.360
 - Agriculture. - Agriculture is where we're talking about.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.080
 - Yeah, because everything follows in agriculture,

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.120
 because first of all, you get a class system,

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.120
 because somebody's got to be in charge,

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.480
 somebody's got to decide things,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.320
 you get religion starts growing up,

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.880
 and I think it's probably older than that.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.880
 - You start having grain, and so your teeth get bad,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.360
 - That's right. - everybody has terrible teeth.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.720
 - And then you've got property.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.640
 So people, there's defence, there's warfare,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.720
 there's, you know, what we call civilisation.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.360
 - But the problem, the real problem is,

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.160
 it's basically Anna's short-termism of cake versus Renoir,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.560
 is that by farming, you can get lots of calories very easily,

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.840
 so you don't have to work so hard to get your calories.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.560
 But it's really bad in the long term,

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.160
 but it's really good in the short term.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.040
 - One of the unfun things about it

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.960
 was that it introduced overwork, right?

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.920
 So people have looked at the lives of hunter-gatherers,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.240
 and it was dreamy.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.880
 They were only working a few hours a day,

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.280
 and then they would just be lying around in caves or whatever,

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.360
 and it was with agriculture, where suddenly it became

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.720
 all about production and production,

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.600
 that people started working, their arse is off,

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.120
 and we haven't come far since then.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.680
 - How was your month off?

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.880
 So you just had...

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:03.080
 - Yeah, they hadn't invented holidays and weekends yet, sure.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.200
 This particular culture were amazing, though.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.640
 The Cucuteni-Tripulia people.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.480
 I thought an extraordinary thing about them

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.320
 is that there are lots of symbols on their pottery

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.040
 that have been uncovered, they're completely well preserved,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.320
 and they include, and this is from, as I think I said,

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.960
 like 5,000 BC, they include both yin and yang symbols,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.320
 so those perfect yin and yang symbols, and swastikas.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.280
 - And swastikas, yeah, I saw that as well.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.680
 - They seemed to have come up with both,

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.200
 and I can't really find out.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.120
 - So they had Nazis.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.400
 - Yeah, it's very tense at the time.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.080
 That's why they kept burning each other's houses down.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.320
 - Isn't the swastika one of those sort of universal symbols

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.000
 that's found all over the world, isn't it?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.480
 - What commonly people think it came from the East,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.720
 like, you know, in Indochina, yeah, in Hinduism,

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.480
 but it seems to have come from here,

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.080
 but I don't know if they did come about independently,

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.400
 but it's quite a specific shape.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.960
 - Yeah, and I think what they're saying about this one is,

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.080
 it's the earliest examples of consistent usage,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.360
 and so other places, they're quite sporadic,

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.760
 and maybe just pull them through the--

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.160
 - I kind of think it is a thing

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.960
 that is quite a natural thing.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.080
 Like, if I'm just kind of sitting here,

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.960
 sort of scribbling on a piece of paper,

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.760
 sometimes I'll look down and I'll have drawn a swastika.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.000
 - It's really worrying when we see that change.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.840
 (all laughing)

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.480
 - And I just think it's 'cause it's like a geometric figure,

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.160
 it's just like a few crosses and whatever,

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.480
 and you're like, "Oh, I'm gonna cross that out."

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.720
 (all laughing)

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.680
 - Do write in anyone if you have the same thing as me.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.760
 I can't say I find myself so consciously

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.880
 drawing swastikas.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.440
 - Well, it's a sour sticker as well, isn't it?

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.280
 It's a--

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.040
 - That's a back to front one, is it?

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.480
 That's what James always tells people.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.320
 (all laughing)

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.160
 Don't worry.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.000
 - There's an interesting guy.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.760
 Did you come across Sir John Lubbock in your--

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.600
 - No.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.040
 - So he was the guy who coined the word Neolithic.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.760
 And Paleolithic, actually.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.880
 Extraordinary guy, I never heard of him before.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.640
 Amazing scientist.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.880
 And when he was about 12, his father came home and said,

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.880
 "I've got some very good news, Johnny.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.920
 "Very, very good news."

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.520
 And he thought, "Oh, I'm getting a new pony."

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.480
 But it was actually the idea that Charles Darwin

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.320
 was gonna come and live in the next village.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.160
 So--

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.000
 - Oh, really?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.600
 - So they became very close friends.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.520
 And Lubbock was the guy who persuaded the Dean of Westminster

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.920
 that Darwin should be buried in Westminster Abbey.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.760
 - Really?

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.600
 - And was one of his pool barris.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.440
 I thought that was rather charming.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.280
 - Really?

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.960
 That's very interesting because in a weird mirroring

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.000
 of that, a couple of generations later,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.480
 the person who came up with the term Neolithic Revolution

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.840
 was an Australian called Veer Gordon Child.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.400
 And he was very good friends with another Charles Darwin,

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.560
 the grandson of Charles Darwin.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.400
 - Oh, really?

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.560
 - And they both heavily influenced each other as well.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.360
 And he was a very interesting child.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.880
 He was a person who excavated Scarabray,

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.560
 which is an extraordinary--

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.640
 - Oh, where they found the village.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.480
 They found it, yeah.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.320
 - Yes, yeah.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.400
 - That's kind of the oldest Neolithic village in the UK, right?

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.520
 - One of the Orkneys, isn't it?

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.800
 - Yeah, it's in Orkney.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.960
 And it is, I have actually been there.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.200
 And it's an amazing place because it's so well preserved.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.680
 And it's about nine houses.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.480
 And they're 1,000 years older than Stonehenge.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.280
 And they're all still furnished.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.360
 It was all stone furniture

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.320
 'cause famously not really any trees on Orkney.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.280
 So everything was stone.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.240
 And they have, as you walk in through the doorway,

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.840
 you've got a fire in the middle.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.560
 You've got a chest of drawers opposite.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.960
 And you've got two beds on either side.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.320
 - What were the chest of drawers made of?

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.600
 - I was going to say that stone chest of drawers.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.440
 That's pretty cool.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.280
 - Yeah.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.880
 - Yeah, I've used chest of drawers.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.000
 It's a place where you put your stuff.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:28.840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.160
 Yeah, you've done the estate agent.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.960
 (all laughing)

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.200
 - Exactly.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.320
 It looks like a rock, but if used correctly.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.160
 - Imagine this rock.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.800
 It could be your office.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.480
 It could be an exercise room.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.480
 - And they also all had limpets soaking tanks.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.800
 That's the other group that they furnished with.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.800
 - It could be an exercise room.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.600
 It could be a limpets soaking tank.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.800
 (all laughing)

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.920
 - Whatever you're into.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.160
 - What do you, I mean,

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.480
 obviously the answer is to soak your limpets.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.040
 But what is a limpets soaking tank for?

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.280
 - Apparently, as you've correctly assumed,

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.440
 it is for limpets soaking.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.280
 And the reason they limpets soaked was not,

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.760
 as you might think, 'cause they ate limpets.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.600
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.240
 - We believe they use limpets as bait.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.360
 And if it soaked them, they would soften a bit

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.600
 and be better bait.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.680
 And then they tracked other things.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.800
 - There's another theory, by the way,

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.440
 just jumping back to these,

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.080
 the Burnt House horizon as it's been coined.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.400
 - Oh, the Trigelian ones.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.120
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.200
 There are many theories as to why they were Burnt.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.320
 We've already mentioned a few.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.280
 One other theory is that--

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.480
 - I can just hear it sometimes when Dan

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:39.000
 is coming up with a time-traveler-y alien-y.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.240
 That's what it's gonna be today.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.040
 - It's not any of that.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:42.880
 - Go on.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.320
 - So there's a theory that Bigfoot was--

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.640
 (all laughing)

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.400
 What it is, is that it's thought that if someone died

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.760
 in the house, then the house has gone

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.600
 from a house of the living to the house of the dead.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.840
 And so you burn it down to respect the dead.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.680
 I mean, there's so many--

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.280
 - That's a rational theory, actually.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280
 I take it back, Dan.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.360
 No Bigfoot involved.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.600
 - Talking of spooky mysteries,

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.640
 shouldn't we talk about Stonehenge a bit?

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.360
 Because that is really one of the big mysteries in that.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.080
 That's sort of late Neolithic, isn't it?

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:07.920
 What's it about?

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.880
 Between 3,100 and 1,600 B.C.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:11.720
 - Yeah.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.120
 - 1,500 years, it took them to fish.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.120
 - I think it was late Neolithic for the world,

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.200
 but we were actually quite slow to farm in Britain,

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.040
 weren't we?

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.160
 - Yeah, so yes, we were.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.880
 Everything took, you know, it took thousands of years

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.720
 to reach farming for the least.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.920
 - Well, you know, it's just like a European thing, isn't it?

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.240
 We don't really like to do that.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.600
 (laughing)

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.120
 - They recently, they think, almost certainly,

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.840
 that Stonehenge was built by the Welsh.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.680
 Did you know this?

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.520
 - Hmm.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.880
 - They knew the stones came from Priselli Hills in Wales.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.960
 But they assumed that the English went there,

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.800
 collected the stones and brought them back in.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.560
 But now they think the thing was actually built in Wales.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.040
 - Hang on, so it built in Wales

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.440
 and then they did an Ikea style,

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.080
 took it down and shipped it over.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.080
 - Yes, absolutely.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.400
 - Wow.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.880
 - I went to Stonehenge.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.200
 Like, there was a thing where you could go like early

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.680
 in the morning before it opened for the tourists.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.440
 And we did that and they do not like it

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.800
 if you touch the stones.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.720
 - Hmm.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.560
 - That's just a tip.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.400
 - Did you touch it?

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.240
 - No.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.080
 (laughing)

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.240
 - It could have done when I was a child,

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.080
 you definitely couldn't touch it.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.600
 - I know, well, you used to be able to, right?

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.520
 Like, you used to even be able to chip bits off them,

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.080
 I think we might have said, but yeah.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.120
 - How did they feel when you scratched

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.280
 that swastika on here?

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.280
 (laughing)

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.280
 - I love that story, then in 1915,

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.960
 a wealthy barrister called Sir Cecil Chubb,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.720
 he went to an auction in Salisbury

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.000
 intending to buy a pair of curtains at a knockdown price

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.600
 and ended up buying Stonehenge.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.440
 (laughing)

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.080
 - Darling, don't be angry.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.560
 (laughing)

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.920
 - This reminds me, John, of that time

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.320
 that you bought the life-size Barbie doll.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.360
 - The Christmas tree Barbie for my daughters, yeah.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.920
 (laughing)

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.160
 It was a Save the Children auction.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.320
 And I was directing ads at the time,

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.480
 we had plenty of spare money,

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.400
 and I bought this seven-foot tall Barbie

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.880
 dressed as a Christmas tree for the girls.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.480
 And Sarah came back from the loo,

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.080
 I just bought this thing, she was so angry,

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.800
 she'd speak to me for three months.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.760
 (laughing)

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.200
 - You should have been like, it could have been worse,

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.560
 it could have been Stonehenge, yeah.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.400
 (laughing)

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.600
 - It could have been, because similarly,

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.040
 Cecil Chubb bought this thing,

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.640
 he came home so dulling and he told his wife

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.040
 that he'd bought it as a birthday present for her.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:16.880
 - Right.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.880
 - He was improvising, but she didn't want it.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.240
 He said, "Well, what the hell do I want those for?

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.080
 "Where's my--"

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.080
 - They're not gonna keep the light out?

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.440
 (laughing)

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.600
 - So that's how it gave it to the nation in 1918.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.760
 He gave it to it. - Wow.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.600
 That's great.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.920
 - Now, whatever happened to the curtains,

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.160
 that's what I wanted to do. - Exactly, that's the question.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.000
 - Yeah.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.580
 (upbeat music)

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.560
 and that is my fact.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.080
 My fact this week is that despite warning us

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.760
 that everything we say would be recorded,

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.920
 we have lost all the recordings of everything

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.080
 that George Orwell said.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.120
 - Ironic.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:52.960
 - Yeah.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.800
 - All right, I'll add as far as that.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.960
 - There's nothing on YouTube at all, no clips.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.960
 - There's literally nothing.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.920
 He was a BBC broadcaster.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.400
 He was famous in his day, obviously, as a writer.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.360
 - Of course he was, yeah.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.060
 - Yeah, he did multiple, multiple panels.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.680
 He was always on broadcast,

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.160
 so we should have his voice somewhere.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.440
 - This is, thank God Alex Bell is not on this podcast,

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.840
 'cause he gets very upset

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.800
 about the BBC's cataloging system.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.360
 - And you can understand it when you hear things like this.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.440
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.000
 And actually we have no video of him as well,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.720
 except in 2003, some footage of him was unearthed of him.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.200
 When he was, I believe he was 18 years old.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.360
 You see him at a school sort of like sports field,

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.520
 and he's the fourth kid in a line of kids

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.280
 who are holding arms linked up.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.240
 And that's the only footage that we have of him

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.840
 before he was actually famous.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.520
 So we don't have any footage.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.120
 We got photos, obviously.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.320
 And he was someone who was being monitored as well,

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.480
 because he was saying a lot of contentious stuff.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.720
 So you figure just something would have survived.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.160
 - Yeah, and it's such a shame it hasn't,

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.320
 because I think his voice would have been hilarious.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.080
 - It sounds like it was, yeah.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.560
 - Well, 'cause he was super posh.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.280
 And you know how when you watch old films,

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.320
 like Brief Encounter, about kind of not even

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.840
 that posh people, and they all were at 12,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.600
 you can barely understand them?

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.960
 And George Orwell at the time, even his posh friend said,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.080
 "This guy sounds incredibly posh."

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.360
 So I think he would have been virtually

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.000
 incomprehensible to us.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.080
 - Yeah, there's quite a few people

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.640
 who described what his voice was like.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.560
 And something to take into account

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.560
 is the fact that when he was a soldier in the Spanish War,

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.600
 he was literally shot through the neck.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.360
 Like a bullet went in one side and out the back.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.880
 It somehow missed all the main arteries

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.720
 that would have killed him.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.000
 He survived, but that affected his voice forever on.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.400
 In terms of volume, so he could never talk loud.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.600
 It was hugely exhausting.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.960
 He'd been at dinner parties and he'd try to say something.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.840
 And everyone's like, "What?"

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.080
 And he's just like, "Ugh."

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.440
 And he just couldn't get the volume right enough.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.000
 - Do you think maybe we do have some recordings of him,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.080
 but it's just very badly leveled?

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.280
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.320
 - I did not read somewhere that a BBC researcher intervened,

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.960
 said he sounded like Alan Rickman.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.880
 - Alan Rickman, yeah, that's what they said.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:00.440
 Yeah, 'cause so the thought is there is one bit of audio

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.560
 of him out there, 'cause it's this BBC researcher

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.960
 who found it in the archives, but then kind of lost it.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.280
 And one day we will get it.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.840
 These things do turn up.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.360
 - Yeah, well, that's very exciting.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.760
 In a way, this actually is a fitting fact,

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.440
 because he actually said in 1984

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.600
 that every record is destroyed, right?

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.000
 It was like the end of history.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.840
 - He did actually.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.160
 - So this is like history has been wiped out.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.240
 Winston Smith says everything had been destroyed or falsified.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.040
 So now all we need is for an Alan Rickman

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.880
 to come along and like fake his voice

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.680
 and create that as the new tree.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.520
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.360
 - And then you put his prediction.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.760
 - He also used to fake his voice,

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.960
 which was really interesting,

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.760
 when he was living in various guises during his life.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.200
 So one of his most famous books,

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.840
 Down and Out in Paris in London,

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.080
 so he decided he wanted to live as someone on the streets

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:47.000
 and sort of put himself into the real people's world.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.600
 And he would put on, apparently,

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.480
 a sort of cockney accent that he would sort of...

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.960
 - Yeah, well, you wouldn't say that, right?

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.840
 If he's talking like Jacob Rees-Mogg,

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.320
 he's not gonna like work out well in Paris

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.240
 with the criminals, is he?

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.920
 - Yeah, that's true, that's true.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.320
 - I've got some ironic facts about 1984,

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.840
 'cause I love the core fact.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.920
 Within 200 yards of the flat in Islington,

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.840
 where Orwell had the idea for 1984,

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.880
 there are now 32 CCTV cameras.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.120
 - That's very good.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.360
 - And the most common book people lie about having read

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.040
 is Orwell's 1984.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:21.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.880
 - Why would they do that?

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.520
 - Well, James, you used to...

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.680
 - You used to lie a lot, didn't you?

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.360
 - But in our live fish shows,

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.640
 you had a thing about people with the top 10 books

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.560
 that people lied about and Tolstoy was on there.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.600
 - Yeah, but 1984 is the top one.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.440
 I've heard that before, yeah, yeah.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.080
 - No one's lying about, you know, J.K. Rowling, are they?

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.920
 No one's lying about having read the Chamber of Seekers.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.240
 - Do you know what I think it is?

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.760
 I think it's quite easy to lie about,

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.000
 'cause Big Brother as a concept is quite easy to understand.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.480
 Room 101 is quite easy to understand.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.840
 If people say, "Have you read it?"

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.160
 you can kind of get away with it, I think.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.880
 - Maybe you sort of think you have.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.520
 In Thailand, you know you can be arrested in Thailand

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.960
 for reading 1984.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.800
 - Really?

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.000
 - And for having picnics.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.720
 Those are the two really serious things in Thailand.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.800
 - What was the second one, sorry?

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.760
 - Having picnics.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.720
 - Oh, gosh.

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.560
 - I thought you said, I slightly myself,

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.800
 thought you said at-family picnics.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.080
 You could only be arrested for reading it

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.960
 if you had really at-family picnics.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.840
 It's very rude and you should be interacting.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.400
 - It's interesting you said about where he got the idea

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.720
 was in Islington.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.040
 I think he's partly got the idea from his wife,

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.200
 Eileen, who'd already written and published a poem

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.280
 about 1984, 15 years earlier.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.120
 - Really?

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:30.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.800
 - Cool.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.120
 - About 1984, the year, like her predictions.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.200
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.080
 Now hers was a bit more optimistic.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.120
 It was about that the world was sort of sought itself out

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.440
 and she thought the knowledge of the past

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.680
 can't be wiped out.

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.320
 So 1984 that he wrote was almost the opposite

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.160
 of what she wrote.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.000
 - Right.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.240
 - Her one was written in 1934.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.440
 So it was exactly 50 years behind.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.840
 And she, yeah, wrote about what the future would be like.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.160
 - And she thought it would be great.

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.160
 Well, she's saying-

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.480
 - Yeah, kind of.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.040
 - You know, things might go downhill,

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.120
 things might be a bit bad,

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.240
 but in the end, everything will work itself out.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.080
 - Really?

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:04.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.720
 And he also based it on a Soviet book called "Mui",

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.120
 which was written by Yefgeny Zamyatin.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.120
 - Yes.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.560
 - Which is basically the same story.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.400
 - Is it?

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.240
 - Well, kind of.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.280
 It's like, it's all about mass surveillance

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.680
 and stuff like that.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.440
 And it was banned by the Soviet Union,

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.800
 but Orwell read it.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.840
 And he did say that his next book would be similar

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.240
 to this "Mui".

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.080
 - Fair enough.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:28.920
 - Sure enough it was.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.480
 So he kind of, I wouldn't say plagiarized it

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.240
 'cause he put lots of his own ideas in.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.960
 - But I think like if you take his wife's poem about 1984

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.440
 and this Soviet book and put them together,

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.280
 it wasn't a huge leap to come up

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.120
 with what he came up with.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.360
 - Yeah.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.440
 I read "1984" when I was at school.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.480
 - Well, so you claim.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.760
 - Oh yeah, yeah, big brother and the rooms,

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.400
 101 rooms and something, yeah.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.600
 (laughing)

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.840
 But it absolutely altered my life.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.200
 I do remember it being a game changer.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.720
 And then the other book, they changed my view of things.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.280
 And it was part of the module we were doing at school

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.760
 was "Brave New World" by Aldous, hopefully.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.760
 - Yeah, definitely, me too.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.120
 - Those two were always paired together

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.920
 as these kind of dystopian books.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.560
 So it was the most joyous thing to discover

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.480
 that Orwell studied under Huxley at school.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.320
 - Oh yeah.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.160
 - Had eaten.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.000
 He taught him French.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.840
 - Yes.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.520
 - I mean, that is just incredible.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.320
 And Huxley wasn't an author yet.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.000
 He wasn't, well, he certainly wasn't published and famous.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.440
 So these were just two guys who would go on

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.640
 to change the world.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.760
 - It was a delight, isn't it?

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.880
 It's an echo of the impressionists really

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.880
 because not just that extraordinary co-incidence,

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.480
 but Orwell was a contemporary at Eaton

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.680
 of Cyril Connolly, Anthony Powell, and Ian Fleming.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.520
 They were all contemporaries.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.320
 So it's like a sort of nexus,

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.400
 like the fact that Renoir and Emile Zola and Baudelaire

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.000
 and people all famous were just young people in Paris.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.360
 - Who would have thought it would turn out?

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.920
 - I know, just successful people.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.560
 - Just kind of help when you're of extremely rich,

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.320
 posh, white people.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.360
 - Although to be fair to Orwell, yeah, it wasn't,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.000
 you know, he sort of got a scholarship or something,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:36:59.840
 didn't he?

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.680
 - He did.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.280
 His mother was, she had a really exotic name.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.400
 She was called Ida Limousane.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.000
 She was born in Penge.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 - That's where I used to live.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.840
 - Yeah.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.680
 - Wow, cool.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.240
 - Well, I was actually just saying

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.160
 that Penge is not a very exotic sounding place.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.000
 - It's not.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.200
 And they tried to change that in Penge

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.520
 by calling it 'Ponge'.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.360
 (all laughing)

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.200
 I'd get genuinely.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.040
 - They did.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:21.880
 - Genuinely, yeah.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.720
 - I live in Ponge.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.120
 - But to be fair, she was only on holiday in Ponge.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:26.960
 - Right.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.840
 - She was actually grew up in More Lameen in Myanmar.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.960
 - On 1984, the process of writing it sounds really horrible.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.320
 Fun though it is to read.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.960
 He was really sick, wasn't he?

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.920
 So he had terrible TB

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.240
 and he went to the Island of Jura,

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.240
 very, very remote spot on the Scottish Island of Jura

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.120
 to write 1984 after he'd been widowed.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.760
 Apostle Eileen had died very unexpectedly.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.080
 And so very sad time.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.880
 He'd taken the sun, he'd just adopted.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.040
 I think they adopted a son about six months before she died.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.080
 So he took the sun, went to Jura,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.120
 and it just sounds like agony.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.240
 And he'd write that TB was gradually killing him

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.360
 as he forced out this awful book.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.400
 But he's, again, he sounds a little bit like Monet

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.160
 so determined and kind of gutsy.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.520
 So he did things like once a bunch of cousins came to visit

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.240
 and he took them all on this fishing trip.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.280
 And, you know, he's got a bad TB.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.200
 The boat capsized, they really nearly drowned.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.800
 I think he just managed to scramble him and his son to a rock

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.040
 and drag them out.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.080
 So every nearly died, but made his TB a bit worse.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.800
 But, yeah, it sounds like he's really living the awful life

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.600
 that they lived in 1984, at least suffering-wise.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.840
 Yeah, because he had TB all his life, didn't he?

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.200
 Suffered it from all the time.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.040
 Very sickly.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.840
 But, again, like Monet, incredibly determined,

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.320
 you know, going to the Spanish Civil War as a reporter

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.520
 and then joining up on the socialist side.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.920
 And then in the Second World War,

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.840
 he really tried to get into the Army,

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.640
 but they wouldn't let him because of his TB.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.320
 In fact, one friend said he tried harder to get into the Army

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.200
 than most people tried to get out of it.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.720
 And so, instead, he joined the Home Guard famously, you know,

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.200
 because he thought that once Hitler had been defeated,

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.600
 it might be transformed into a Catalan-style,

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.800
 revolutionary militia to overthrow the British ruling classes.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.520
 Wow. The Home Guard were going to have a coup.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.160
 Considering he was so anti-fascist,

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.000
 he did have a Hitler mustache when he was young.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.920
 Yes. But he was also an anti-communist.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.800
 Did you know that? Yeah, he was.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.840
 Because he hated the communists,

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.120
 having met them, the Russians in the Spanish Civil War,

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.840
 April they were. He was a socialist,

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.440
 but he didn't like the communists. Yes, that's right.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.080
 So he kept a list. Well, I always thought 1984 was about

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.240
 how communism had gone wrong a bit, wasn't it?

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.880
 Yeah. I think. Anyway, good one, sorry.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.600
 He kept a sort of McCarthyite list of people

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.280
 who were communists or fellow travellers,

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.000
 which he then, just before he died,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.480
 he gave it to the Foreign Office.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.200
 That's right. Did he? Yes, that's right.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.440
 A dog, sneaky dogger.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.280
 He was kept secret for 54 years,

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.920
 and on that list are J.B. Priestley, Michael Redgrave,

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.840
 the actor, and Charlie Chaplin.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.800
 Are we sure he didn't just not like these people?

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.360
 Maybe, yeah, maybe. Yeah?

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.240
 He also is responsible for weather spoons.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.760
 Yes, I read that. Oh, yes.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.600
 You've forgotten this essay on the perfect pub, didn't you?

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.600
 He wrote his essay on a perfect pub, and he said...

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.080
 And it's called "Moon on the Water" or something?

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.560
 The Moon on the Water, yeah.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.640
 There is a weather spoon, so it's called that, I think, isn't it?

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.960
 There's a lot, actually. There's a lot.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.160
 He's won a pinch. He said that...

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.920
 Do you want to punish me? Sorry.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.240
 He said that it should have a very convenient location.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.880
 It should have a very good atmosphere without any loud music

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.520
 so you can chat to each other.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.920
 There should be fights every Saturday night.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.800
 No, he didn't say that one.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.120
 He said that you should be able to get a variety of different beverages,

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.320
 including non-alcoholic ones.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.440
 But then, having said that, some of his friends said

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.840
 that whenever he went to the pub with them,

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.880
 he would only allow them to drink dark ale no matter what they ordered.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.560
 They would say, "Oh, I'll have a gin and tonic."

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.520
 And then he'd come back from the pub with some dark ale

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.720
 and say, "Well, that's what you're having."

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.080
 I'll gather around. What are you? What are you having?

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.280
 Jimmy's on, I think? Yeah, what are you having?

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.800
 Roman Coke? Yeah, go ahead.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.040
 Oh, don't let George get it in.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.200
 Oh, George, yeah.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.640
 12 dark ales, please.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.760
 They're like a crisps now.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.320
 He did say, "This is what of him reminds me of you, John."

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.040
 Which is... No.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.840
 He belitt... This was according to the ODMB.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.680
 He believed that no meaningful idea was too difficult

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.160
 to be explained in simple terms to ordinary people,

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.800
 which is basically the QI style of writing, isn't it?

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.000
 I think that's very true. I think he's a very QI person, actually,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.360
 because here's one.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.960
 To see what is in front of one's nose requires constant struggle.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.760
 That's very QI, I think.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.320
 There are some ideas so wrong

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.240
 that only a very intelligent person could believe in them.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.080
 That's great.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.000
 So, John, I wonder if you have any insight into this,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.240
 but Orwell historians have claimed that they believe Room 101

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.080
 was based off his experience at the BBC

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:59.480
 and being in such torturous conference rooms and meetings.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.440
 Really, he went to the Spanish Civil War,

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.640
 suffered from TB the years of his life's struggle,

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.840
 lived down in Paris and London, but working at the BBC.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.400
 Yeah.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.560
 This is really interesting. Down and out since Studio One.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.600
 There's a particular echo for this to me,

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.440
 because I used to have the next-door office, Douglas Adams,

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.080
 where we were both young radio producers,

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.760
 and we looked across at Broadcasting House, but the back of it.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.360
 OK. From 16 Langham Street.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.360
 And there was a window in there that was all blacked out,

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.120
 and we thought that must be Room 101 in there.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.560
 We fantasised about all this,

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.880
 and we were going to write a story about how the BBC had a coup in London,

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.400
 because you remember how weird things were in the '70s,

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.760
 the three-day week, and the Labour government empowered everyone,

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.880
 and thought it was going to be a sort of counter-revolution.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.520
 I think James would have stretched my mind to remember that

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.960
 if he remembers the first six months of his life.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.440
 But other than that, no.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.200
 I didn't even do three days' work in those days.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.880
 But wait, so what?

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.280
 It felt like Big Brother was happening, Big Auntie.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.320
 Yes, but we thought there was going to be some sort of counter-revolution.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.720
 Right.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.600
 And the idea was the BBC were going to lead this from this secret room,

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.560
 and they're basically going to take down all the telephone lines

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.240
 and done it as a drama.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.160
 They've cut tanks in Trafalgar Square.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.160
 It was all a completely faked coup, where nothing had to be taken.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.080
 But we thought it had, so they all stayed home.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.160
 Right.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.160
 As it was, the blacked-out window was just David Attenborough's dressing room.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:25.320
 The spookiness goes on, because about that age,

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.920
 I was 24 or something like that,

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.120
 I had a call from a very senior BBC executive.

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.480
 He had a strange voice like that. It was very ha-ha.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.200
 And asked if I'd like to go to dinner.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.480
 So I went to my head of department,

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.280
 just having come out of an English public school,

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.400
 that a man 30 years old of me had asked me to dinner.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.520
 I said, "Do you think this is all right?"

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.520
 He said, "We'll be very careful what you say.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.400
 "That's the managing director's hitman."

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.960
 I thought, "What?"

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.360
 Because it was well-known that everybody in BBC had a file on them,

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.080
 and if you were a communist at a Christmas tree in the corner,

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.280
 if you were a lefty.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.600
 So I went out for dinner with this bloke,

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.880
 and I had too much to drink before I was terribly nervous

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.080
 that I was going to say something wrong.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.720
 And he would say, "Do you like football?"

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.200
 And I go, "Not really, do you?"

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.800
 "No, do you enjoy opera?"

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.600
 And I say, "Not really, do you enjoy it?"

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.600
 So it was a very uncomfortable dinner.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.160
 And I went home and nothing happened.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.400
 And years later, I was told that the guy had started Channel 4,

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.400
 and I told him this story.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.400
 He said, "Oh, that was...

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.000
 "You were definitely being recruited for MI5, and you blew it."

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.160
 If only you said you supported Wolves, happily.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.280
 That was the key.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.680
 So I was actually being recruited for the Secret Service,

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.480
 and I didn't realise it.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.600
 Wow!

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.880
 But Blackadder wouldn't have existed if you had been.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:38.600
 So, you know, what's better

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.840
 that you ended the Cold War ten years early, or...?

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.920
 If you had been recruited, you wouldn't tell us.

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.680
 You might tell us the story, and then it might end with,

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.240
 "And then I was never recruited."

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.240
 Mm-hmm.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.400
 (LAUGHS)

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.240
 That's...

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.440
 Dun-dun-dun.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.440
 (ELECTRONIC MUSIC)

00:44:54.440 --> 00:45:00.240
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.520
 and that is James.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.960
 OK, my fact this week is that in 14th century London,

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.080
 one punishment for selling unclean spices

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.920
 was to be put in the pillory

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.520
 and have the spices set on fire beneath your nose.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.760
 (LAUGHS)

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.920
 What would that do? Like, do we know how it would matter?

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.240
 'Cause it sounds like you'd be quite nice.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.920
 Is it like one of those scented sticks you get in your house sometimes

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.160
 that releases a nice smell?

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.840
 No, no. Have you ever seen on the internet

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.760
 when they do, like, the Nutmeg challenge,

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.720
 or the Cinnamon challenge, or whatever it is,

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.360
 and they try and eat one spoonful of spices,

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.400
 and it all goes terribly wrong?

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.320
 Yeah. I reckon it's that times a thousand.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.040
 Yeah. You're just going to get it in your sinuses,

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.440
 in your eyes as... It would burn like a thousand.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.680
 It would burn like mad in your face. Yeah, it would be awful.

00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:44.840
 So, I read this when I was trying to nail something

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:47.960
 about eating fish on a Friday for QI this year.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.760
 I reckon that people in the UK eat fish on a Friday

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.320
 for economic reasons, not for religious reasons.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.800
 I can't work out if that's true, so if you know this,

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.040
 if you're a historian, you know this, get in touch with me.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.560
 But while I was doing that research,

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.240
 I found a paper called Butchering in Medieval London

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.800
 by Ernest L. Sabine, and I read that,

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.960
 and he gave loads of good info about the food trade

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.480
 in the 14th century.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.600
 And in 1393, when John Hadley was the mayor,

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.200
 he was a grocer, he came up with this new law.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.200
 You said when John Hadley was the mayor like...

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.480
 Do you remember when John Hadley was the mayor in 1393?

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.280
 You must remember that. The John Hadley era, of course.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.920
 Hadley years. Yeah. Sorry, go on.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.160
 So, he was a grocer, as we all know,

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.800
 and obviously had lots of ideas about the grossing trade.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.880
 I mean, I'm telling a lot of people what they already know here,

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.640
 but I'm going to go through the basics.

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.640
 He came up with a law about adulterated spices

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.680
 and said that basically you should be not selling spice

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:46.000
 which isn't pure, and there was one particular guy,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.120
 a foreign merchant, who had come over to London

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.080
 and was selling dodgy spices,

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.840
 and he was sent to the pillory and had his false powders

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.200
 burned underneath him. Wow.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.160
 And that pillory, by the way, is where you put your head in...

00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.800
 It's like stocks, in a way. It's like stocks.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.440
 Yeah, people might throw tomatoes at you,

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.320
 but in this case, he was being burned.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.480
 Yeah, the stocks are different, because the stocks are just your feet.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.840
 They're better because you can dodge the missiles,

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.600
 because you can move, you're upper body.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.320
 Yeah, yeah. You're doomed with the pillory.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.760
 And Hadley, as well, he prescribed that all spices

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.440
 must henceforth be garbled by an official garbola.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.760
 Oh! Oh, that's wrong!

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.320
 Oh! Oh, my God!

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.800
 Pum-pum-pum.

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.400
 So, garbola. Do you want to do it all?

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.200
 LAUGHTER

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.240
 Imagine. So, I didn't know what this was, garbling.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.920
 So, a garbling is where you sift through a spice

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.200
 to get rid of all the stuff that isn't a spice.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.440
 Oh! So, let's say you've got a load of peppercorns,

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.360
 but there's loads of, like, little ant legs

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.440
 and little bits of flies and stuff in there.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.080
 You sift through it, and you just get the good stuff,

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.400
 and that's garbling.

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.440
 And it comes from an old Anglo-Norman word "garbolae" meaning "to sift".

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.880
 And the garbling that you were doing, Anna,

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.560
 comes from an old thing where you would get a text

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.920
 and you would take out all of the bits that you don't want to say,

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.480
 and you would just include the bits that you do want to say.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.400
 So, let's say you took something from the Bible.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.560
 You might say, "Well, actually, I quite like the adultery part,

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.720
 "so I'm not going to mention that, but I will mention the stuff

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.000
 "about not coveting my neighbour's ox."

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.200
 And that was known as garbling because you were sifting through the words.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.320
 And then it eventually became like "garbling your voice" and "garbling your voice".

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.640
 So, it's almost become the opposite,

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.000
 because now, garbling is more like including extraneous stuff.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.440
 It's certainly not the direct kind of communication that...

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.840
 Exactly. Yeah.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.280
 Weird.

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.240
 This seems to be a bit of a theme,

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.040
 this means of punishment for adulterating spices.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.160
 I actually read that in 1444, in Nuremberg,

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.960
 an adulterator of saffron was burned at the stake over a fire of his own saffron.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:42.640
 Yeah. Wow.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.040
 It's been an incredibly expensive fire.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.240
 Yeah.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.800
 Yes, it's the most expensive spire saffron, I think, isn't it?

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.600
 Yeah, it is, because you can only get it a tiny bit from each saffron flower, can't you?

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.960
 So, you have to get, like, 200,000 saffron flowers.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.880
 And then you can't taste it anywhere, guys.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.640
 They used to. Yeah, might win a huge time, right, guys?

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.840
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:07.040
 This was the saffron shell code, wasn't it, in Nuremberg, about saffron.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.160
 Sounds like it.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:14.880
 And you could be hung drawn and quartered for selling dodgy saffron.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.800
 Really?

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.880
 They were really hard on saffron, I guess, because it is so pricey.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.680
 Yeah, but if you were a woman, you wouldn't be hung drawn and quartered,

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.560
 because it was seen as bad to hang draw and quarter women,

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.600
 because you might be able to see their belly

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.840
 as you're pulling out the innards.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.320
 Maybe someone might get turned on by that, I don't know.

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.800
 But you weren't allowed to show someone a woman's stomach,

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.640
 so you couldn't hang draw and quarter someone,

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.640
 and so they would be buried alive instead.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.160
 It had a special kind of pillory for women,

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.000
 did you know that? No?

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.800
 A few, T-H-E-W-E, which is a...

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.800
 Is it with beef holes?

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.800
 ...stocks, and it was just...

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.880
 Sorry, it was the stocks that kept the legs together.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:52.920
 Oh, really?

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:53.800
 Really.

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.680
 Fascinating.

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.960
 So funny.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.320
 And I thought this is like... Really interesting.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:02.680
 There's a company called Spices Pillory in Nantwich, Cheshire.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.600
 Yeah, I just couldn't believe that.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.440
 It's now just called Spices, it's now just called Spices,

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.680
 but it's in 38 Pillory Street, Nantwich.

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.840
 Really? That is so funny.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.440
 And so I was just checking this out on Wikipedia,

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.640
 and it says on the pillory entry

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.360
 that people who were put in pillories were called "pillocks."

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:24.480
 Citation-needed Wikipedia, I think.

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.480
 It does say "pillock-needed."

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.040
 That's never going to last.

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.840
 I think "pillock" comes from "bollock," basically, doesn't it?

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.120
 Yeah, I think.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:36.040
 So do you think that people with the spices burning under the nose

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.240
 were also pelted with fruit and things?

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.200
 Oh, I would think so, yeah.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.320
 'Cause one of the things I liked about the pillory

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.320
 was that it was kind of quite a democratic thing,

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.320
 so the crowd decided what they threw.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.640
 So if it was a minor offence, you'd get soft fruit or whatever,

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.720
 and if they really didn't like it, if you'd done something horrible,

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.160
 they'd throw stones and saucepans,

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.240
 and people were actually killed in the pillory.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.640
 Dead dogs and stuff like that. Dead dogs, yeah. Really?

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:08.560
 There was one guy who, in 1727, was convicted of attempted sodomy.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.080
 He's called Charles Hitchin,

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.360
 and he went into the stocks wearing a suit of armour

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.240
 'cause he was so worried that people would throw heavy, hard things at him.

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.760
 That's amazing. And did you read about Daniel Defoe,

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.720
 the guy who wrote "Robinson Crusoe"? Yeah.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.760
 He did a satirical pamphlet,

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.120
 which somebody took literally,

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.120
 and he was put in the pillory for seditious libel,

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.800
 which is a really serious political offence.

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.000
 And the crowd all turned up, and they thought he was absolutely great,

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.600
 so they just threw flowers at him.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.600
 Oh, nice. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, that's very cool.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.560
 It's really interesting, this is a punishment that fits the crime, I suppose,

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.640
 which quite often happened in the olden days.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:53.640
 So, in 1482, in Bebrick, which I think was a village in Germany,

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.360
 there was a vintner who'd adulterated his wine with something else,

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.960
 and he was condemned to drink six quarts of it, of his own wine,

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.720
 which is six litres. That is a lot.

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:07.640
 It's a lot... Well, the article about it, which was written in 1952,

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.760
 just said, "From this, he died."

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.560
 Oh, wow.

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.760
 What a way to go. Yeah.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:16.200
 That's so interesting.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.880
 People think, you know, you sort of think,

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.960
 "Oh, that's the sort of thing they did in the Middle Ages."

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.080
 They cheat it by making... Instead of saffron, they did turmeric.

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.440
 But it still goes on today, adulteration of spices.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:31.160
 Mm, yeah. And I'm just reading in Tata, the big Indian multinational,

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.640
 the insurance branch, has a thing on that,

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.960
 of typical adulteration of spices in India,

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:40.040
 such as you put sand or powdered chalk in sugar,

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.760
 brick powder is added to red chilli powder,

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.600
 pire seeds to black pepper, chicory to coffee,

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.040
 sawdust to ground cumin seeds,

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.840
 and used tea leaves to tea.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.840
 So that's how they do it.

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.320
 And in the... I don't like that one.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:57.880
 They also put mud, stones, pebbles, marbles and filth, apparently,

00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.160
 in some spices.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:02.760
 Marbles are never going to fit through those tiny holes.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:06.520
 The rules from the US Food and Drug Administration

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.960
 on filth in adulterated spices are really specific.

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:15.680
 So, for example, the maximum amount of filth permitted by the FDA

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.600
 in 50 grams of ground paprika

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.960
 is 150 insect fragments and 22 rodent hairs.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.880
 In all spices, 300 insect fragments and 10 rodent hairs.

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.360
 Somebody checks all these.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:32.640
 And in cinnamon, it's 400 insect fragments and 11 rodent hairs.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.480
 What you really want to get into if you're a food adulterer

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.480
 is canned or frozen spinach,

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:41.400
 because they're much more generous with their limits there.

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:44.080
 So, for every 100 grams of canned or frozen spinach,

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:50.160
 you're allowed 50 aphids and/or thrips and/or mites for 100 grams,

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:54.000
 or two or more, three millimetre or longer larvae

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 or larval fragments, or spinach worms,

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.880
 whose aggregate length exceeds 12 millilitres per 24 pounds.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.480
 That's how much spinach...

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.760
 You get a lot of mites, mites and thrips in there.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.160
 Spinach is very light, though, isn't it?

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.720
 Yeah. Like, how many kilos of spinach was it?

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:15.160
 That was 100 grams. Oh, yeah, OK, that's quite a lot of ant.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:20.880
 The most adulterated spice/herb in the EU,

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:26.560
 according to a 2022 reporter's oregano or oregano, if you're American.

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.560
 It's the most adulterated? Yeah, it is.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:33.160
 48% of samples that were checked were contaminated with...

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.760
 Oh, um... sage.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.000
 Sage, I think you'd be able to taste that.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.360
 Do you think? If there's some of us to say... Time? No.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.720
 Marijuana.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:45.560
 Grass. No, it is olive leaves.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:49.000
 So, they just basically add olive leaves to the oregano leaves

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.480
 and then mush it up.

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.520
 I mean, if you're not noticing, sod it.

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.680
 You know, people can even taste herbs and spices anyway.

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.560
 They're just for show, aren't they?

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.360
 Like, there was this huge thing.

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:04.960
 They're just to make your covers look fancy.

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.360
 Just get some ketchup and mayonnaise and stop being such a snob.

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.800
 No, there was this just...

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.760
 I'm just saying this because there was a big sting in 2021

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.360
 of a criminal gang in Spain.

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:19.560
 Oh, I thought that was something they found in some spinach.

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.760
 How much of a bee is there, Stings?

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.720
 Just the sting, it's fine.

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.680
 Yeah, add spice as it goes down.

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.480
 No, this was... 2021, there was a criminal gang in Spain

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.760
 that was done for making fake saffron.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.960
 So, Spanish saffron is the incredibly expensive

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.600
 sort after saffron.

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.840
 And there were 17 people arrested,

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.360
 and it was found that a huge proportion of it was actually fake,

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.080
 so it was mixed up with other stuff. Yeah.

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.440
 But mostly mixed up with Iranian saffron,

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.560
 which had been imported, feels OK,

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.400
 and which I think does taste the same.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.840
 I'd be amazed if people could tell the difference.

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.760
 So, there was one Parisian chef who said that making sure

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.200
 you've got legitimate saffron is as time-consuming

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:01.720
 as checking all the other produce in your food combined.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.200
 And I would say, don't worry about it.

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:06.080
 No, I don't think I'm going to go to a restaurant and go,

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:08.080
 "This is Iranian saffron!"

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:12.320
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:15.040
 Bread is one that was adulterated a lot in history, wasn't there?

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.240
 And you could be really badly punished for being a baker and...

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.800
 Hence, bakers doesn't, I guess.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:23.360
 Yes, so the idea you make a 13th bun

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.520
 so that the weight of your 12 buns is...

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.920
 Is actually... So, it was like, yeah, for non-English,

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.800
 because exactly you make a 13th bun,

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.880
 and that's what bakers doesn't, as opposed to 12,

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.760
 because you're in so much trouble if you'd made 12 buns,

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.280
 but they were just a little bit light.

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.800
 It's like, to be safe, chuck another one.

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.920
 But it's a serious matter, because bread is what people live on,

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.400
 and, you know, you can't cheat on that.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.440
 Whereas in 2017, I think it was,

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:50.920
 they censured a Massachusetts bakery for listing love

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.160
 as an ingredient of their granola.

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.360
 They said, "Made with love," and they took them to court.

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.680
 I think that's fair enough.

00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:01.520
 Me too. I hope they got life sentences.

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.560
 Chuck a dog at them.

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:09.680
 So, just on baking, as well, in the 18th century in Turkey,

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:13.080
 if you undersold your bread, you would get in trouble,

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.960
 and you might get hanged.

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.280
 And that was common enough that if you were a master baker...

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:21.200
 I said master baker. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.200
 You might employ an assistant who got more wages,

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.320
 but they were the one who would take the fall if you got in trouble.

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.080
 Right. Tense, isn't it?

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.720
 Yeah, would you take that job?

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.560
 Worthy extra money.

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.320
 I'd be more concerned if I saw a master baker list love

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.120
 as part of the ingredient.

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:48.080
 OK, that's it. That is all of our facts.

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.360

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.440
 which is the private members club of our podcast,

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.080
 and there's also lots of bits of merch and so on.

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.680
 Do check it out or just come back here for another episode.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.040
 We'll be back again next week.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.840
 We'll see you then. Goodbye.

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:39.720
 I just like to draw geometric figures on bits of paper.

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.840
 That's my doodles are always geometric figures.

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:45.760
 And OK, I need to explain yourself to her.

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.400
 Explain yourself at Nuremberg.

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.660
 (laughing)

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.740
 (laughs)
