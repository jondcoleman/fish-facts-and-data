00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:17,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:17,00:00:19,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:19,00:00:21,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:21,00:00:22,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:22,00:00:24,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:24,00:00:26,James Harkin and John Lloyd.
00:00:26,00:00:28,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:28,00:00:31,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:31,00:00:34,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:34,00:00:37,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Johnny."
00:00:37,00:00:42,"- My fact is, when the impressionist Claude Monet"
00:00:42,00:00:45,"lived at Giverny, he had six gardeners,"
00:00:45,00:00:50,one of whose whole job was to dust and wash the water lilies
00:00:50,00:00:52,and clean the surface of the water.
00:00:52,00:00:57,"- Wow, I guess if you're famous for painting water lilies,"
00:00:57,00:00:59,"you want them to look as good as possible, don't you?"
00:00:59,00:00:59,It makes sense.
00:00:59,00:01:00,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:01:00,00:01:01,They need to be picturesque.
00:01:01,00:01:03,- Although maybe you wouldn't paint
00:01:03,00:01:05,"the bits of dust on them anyway, would you?"
00:01:05,00:01:06,How do you dust a water lily?
00:01:06,00:01:09,"- What are you using for that, a Hoover?"
00:01:09,00:01:10,"- I think you just wet it, right?"
00:01:10,00:01:11,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:01:11,00:01:12,But these were very special water lilies.
00:01:12,00:01:15,They were specially imported from Japan.
00:01:15,00:01:17,"Monet was crazy about Japanese art,"
00:01:17,00:01:20,which you probably know had just arrived in France
00:01:20,00:01:23,when Japan opened up in the 1850s to the West.
00:01:23,00:01:25,All these prints started arriving
00:01:25,00:01:27,and all the impressionists were crazy about them.
00:01:27,00:01:29,And Monet got a real bargain.
00:01:29,00:01:32,"In Zandarm, he was in Holland for a bit."
00:01:32,00:01:34,And there was a porcelain dealer
00:01:34,00:01:36,who didn't know that these Japanese prints
00:01:36,00:01:37,were going to come from World Finance
00:01:37,00:01:39,and he wrapped all his china in them.
00:01:39,00:01:41,And so Monet bought some cheap china
00:01:41,00:01:43,with these amazing prints by Hokusai
00:01:43,00:01:44,and Hiroshige and all that.
00:01:44,00:01:46,"- Oh, wow, cool."
00:01:46,00:01:48,- And I'm wearing the Hokusai jumper today.
00:01:48,00:01:49,"- Oh, wow."
00:01:49,00:01:50,- So you are.
00:01:50,00:01:51,- Is that deliberate?
00:01:51,00:01:52,- No.
00:01:52,00:01:57,- So Hokusai is famous for this wave painting.
00:01:57,00:01:58,People will know it.
00:01:58,00:02:00,"Well, it's on my jumper and it's around."
00:02:00,00:02:03,"And it comes from a set of paintings called,"
00:02:03,00:02:06,I think it's called 36 Views of Mount Fuji.
00:02:06,00:02:10,But there's actually 46 Views of Mount Fuji in that set
00:02:10,00:02:13,because he did 36 and they were so popular.
00:02:13,00:02:15,"He did another 10, but he didn't change the name."
00:02:15,00:02:16,- That's great.
00:02:16,00:02:17,- Too much effort.
00:02:17,00:02:19,Did he run out of energy just to the end?
00:02:19,00:02:20,- That's interesting.
00:02:20,00:02:23,Monet also was famous for doing lots of paintings
00:02:23,00:02:25,"of the same thing, not just Waterloo's."
00:02:25,00:02:28,"Steam trains he did, poplars."
00:02:28,00:02:30,Haystacks was very popular.
00:02:30,00:02:33,"Same with Cézanne, who was a great mate of Monet's."
00:02:33,00:02:37,"And Cézanne painted Molson Victoire, I think 200 times"
00:02:37,00:02:38,and never felt he got it quite right.
00:02:38,00:02:39,It was an extraordinary life
00:02:39,00:02:42,because he struggled hugely with poverty
00:02:42,00:02:45,and depression all his life.
00:02:45,00:02:47,"But by the time we were talking about the Waterloo's,"
00:02:47,00:02:49,he'd suddenly got rich.
00:02:49,00:02:51,I think the thing that really kicked it off
00:02:51,00:02:55,was the heiress to the singer-sewing machine fortune.
00:02:55,00:02:57,"I think her name was something like Waynetta,"
00:02:57,00:02:58,something like what?
00:02:58,00:02:59,- Waynetta Slop.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- Waynetta singer, what was she called?"
00:03:01,00:03:02,"Winaretta Singer, she was called."
00:03:02,00:03:03,- Wow.
00:03:03,00:03:06,- And she came to see Monet in 1886
00:03:06,00:03:08,and she loved his stuff and bought a painting.
00:03:08,00:03:10,And suddenly the whole place is full of Americans
00:03:10,00:03:11,coming to see him.
00:03:11,00:03:12,"- It was Americans, wasn't it?"
00:03:12,00:03:14,It was American money that came in.
00:03:14,00:03:16,And is it Cassat?
00:03:16,00:03:19,"Marie Cassat, who was one of the impressionists."
00:03:19,00:03:21,And she was arguably the most important one
00:03:21,00:03:23,because she was the one who got all the Americans
00:03:23,00:03:25,really interested in it.
00:03:25,00:03:28,And then the Americans started buying all this stuff
00:03:28,00:03:30,and then the impressionists just had loads of money
00:03:30,00:03:32,and could do what they wanted.
00:03:32,00:03:34,"- Yeah, I found a real offensive"
00:03:34,00:03:36,because I actually been to Zandarm.
00:03:36,00:03:38,"In fact, I bought a boat in Zandarm"
00:03:38,00:03:39,and I rode it there for a year.
00:03:39,00:03:42,- An every man kind of story.
00:03:42,00:03:44,(all laughing)
00:03:44,00:03:48,"- 'Cause I often quote Monet, who had this great line,"
00:03:48,00:03:51,"""After 20 years, the wall is still there,"""
00:03:51,00:03:53,by which he meant to do things really well.
00:03:53,00:03:55,You've got to get the other side of this block
00:03:55,00:03:58,"into the zone, into the settlement."
00:03:58,00:04:01,And I often quote that as something that I feel very upset.
00:04:01,00:04:03,"But this is a guy who, age 28,"
00:04:03,00:04:05,he threw himself into the sain
00:04:05,00:04:07,and attempted to drown himself.
00:04:07,00:04:09,"- Yes, why, what was his plan there?"
00:04:09,00:04:11,"Because it was unsuccessful, of course."
00:04:11,00:04:13,"And if you can swim, I think it is quite hard."
00:04:13,00:04:14,"- Well, that was the problem."
00:04:14,00:04:16,He jumped in and then regretted it and made it.
00:04:16,00:04:18,"And remember, he was an incredibly good swimmer."
00:04:18,00:04:20,"- All right, to the shore."
00:04:20,00:04:21,"- It's currents, currents take you under"
00:04:21,00:04:22,and stop you from getting back up.
00:04:22,00:04:24,"- I know, but you've got to pick your bit."
00:04:24,00:04:26,"Like, if you can swim,"
00:04:26,00:04:29,and I think it's quite hard to just not move your body.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"- In order to paint a water lily,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,you need to be a water lily.
00:04:32,00:04:33,- Right.
00:04:33,00:04:34,- Perhaps that's what was going on there.
00:04:34,00:04:36,- He was that committed.
00:04:36,00:04:37,"He was, that's really interesting"
00:04:37,00:04:39,"that you say you identify with him, John."
00:04:39,00:04:42,"'Cause he kind of reminded me of you as I was reading this,"
00:04:42,00:04:46,"because as you say, he was such a perfectionist"
00:04:46,00:04:48,and obsessive and did seem to have this conviction
00:04:48,00:04:49,he wasn't doing well enough.
00:04:49,00:04:51,"He had another quote that was,"
00:04:51,00:04:53,"""My life has been nothing but a failure"
00:04:53,00:04:54,"""and all that's left for me to do"
00:04:54,00:04:57,"""is to destroy my paintings before I disappear."""
00:04:57,00:04:58,"- Oh, yeah, that's you, John."
00:04:58,00:05:00,(all laughing)
00:05:00,00:05:04,"- He did, he destroyed 500 of his paintings."
00:05:04,00:05:05,"- Wow. - In 1908,"
00:05:05,00:05:06,they had to cancel an exhibition
00:05:06,00:05:09,'cause he'd slashed 15 of the paintings with a knife.
00:05:09,00:05:10,- Must have been seriously annoying
00:05:10,00:05:12,for the gallery curators.
00:05:12,00:05:13,"- But this is worrying, Hannah, because--"
00:05:13,00:05:15,- I took my halfway through that theory.
00:05:15,00:05:17,"I was like, ""Why have I said this to my boss?"""
00:05:17,00:05:19,But go on. (all laughing)
00:05:19,00:05:20,"- John, no, no, don't go down to the tent"
00:05:20,00:05:22,"to throw yourself in, for God's sake."
00:05:22,00:05:26,- Have you read Steve Jobs's biography by Walter--
00:05:26,00:05:27,- Walter Isaacson? - Yes.
00:05:27,00:05:30,It's a searing book about this terribly complicated
00:05:30,00:05:33,and really sort of mad person.
00:05:33,00:05:36,"And I suddenly thought Jobs's perfection's a bit like me,"
00:05:36,00:05:37,"and I came back and I said to a friend,"
00:05:37,00:05:39,"""Have you read the Steve Jobs bio?"""
00:05:39,00:05:39,"And he said, ""Yes."""
00:05:39,00:05:42,"I said, ""Do you think I'm a bit like Steve Jobs?"""
00:05:42,00:05:44,"And he went, ""Um..."""
00:05:44,00:05:48,(all laughing)
00:05:48,00:05:49,- You did genuinely go through a period
00:05:49,00:05:51,of wearing polo-neck shirts.
00:05:51,00:05:53,Was that after that biography?
00:05:53,00:05:54,"- Oh, yeah. - No, I've always worn them."
00:05:54,00:05:56,"Have you, I guess. - He got it from you,"
00:05:56,00:05:57,"didn't he? - He's a navy thing, yeah."
00:05:57,00:05:59,"- Oh, yeah. - All right."
00:05:59,00:06:01,"The thing about the number,"
00:06:01,00:06:04,"the volume of paintings that he did, back to Monet,"
00:06:04,00:06:07,there's accounts of where he'd be painting a scene
00:06:07,00:06:11,and almost like filming a movie where your lighting changes
00:06:11,00:06:12,and that's it for the day.
00:06:12,00:06:15,"He'd go, ""Get me another canvas."""
00:06:15,00:06:17,And they might bring another canvas
00:06:17,00:06:19,"that he was painting yesterday at that exact time,"
00:06:19,00:06:20,so then he could continue on that.
00:06:20,00:06:23,So he was constantly swapping in and out canvases
00:06:23,00:06:24,of work and progress.
00:06:24,00:06:26,"- And he also used, because he had so many children,"
00:06:26,00:06:28,because a very complicated private life
00:06:28,00:06:29,is not sure you've discovered.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"- Yeah, so it's similar to you again, John."
00:06:31,00:06:33,(all laughing)
00:06:33,00:06:37,"- That's so not true, so unfair."
00:06:37,00:06:42,"- But yeah, and there were eight children in the house."
00:06:42,00:06:45,And he would get a swarm of them each to carry a canvas
00:06:45,00:06:47,and he'd trot off to the beach with all these children
00:06:47,00:06:49,and work on all the canvases at once.
00:06:49,00:06:51,- It sounds like chaos.
00:06:51,00:06:52,"And actually, this element of his life"
00:06:52,00:06:54,reminds me more of Dan Shriver in fact.
00:06:54,00:06:57,(all laughing)
00:06:57,00:06:58,- Too many kids.
00:06:58,00:07:01,- The next insult is level this way.
00:07:01,00:07:03,"It's just the chaotic number of children,"
00:07:03,00:07:06,"because yes, he was quite poverty stricken for a long time."
00:07:06,00:07:08,- Yeah. - And then hit it.
00:07:08,00:07:10,(all laughing)
00:07:10,00:07:12,"- But then the art dealer who sold his art,"
00:07:12,00:07:13,"who was Ernest Hoshaday,"
00:07:13,00:07:16,"he was also poverty stricken, went bankrupt,"
00:07:16,00:07:19,"so moved in with Monet, Ernest brought his wife,"
00:07:19,00:07:20,and I believe there's six children.
00:07:20,00:07:21,"- Six children, yeah."
00:07:21,00:07:23,"- In with Monet and Monet's wife and their two children,"
00:07:23,00:07:27,"and then Monet fell in love with Ernest's wife,"
00:07:27,00:07:29,"and they're all, they can't pay rent,"
00:07:29,00:07:31,"and it just sounds like hell, God knows how he was putting"
00:07:31,00:07:34,"together these really peaceful, blissful paintings."
00:07:34,00:07:34,- Dear dad.
00:07:34,00:07:38,- Where am I in those things that's where I'm at?
00:07:38,00:07:40,- I imagine stepping into that household
00:07:40,00:07:41,would fill me with the same sense of anxiety
00:07:41,00:07:43,as like stepping into your house
00:07:43,00:07:45,on a normal Saturday afternoon.
00:07:45,00:07:48,"- Fair call, fair call."
00:07:48,00:07:50,- We should say his gardens were unpopular
00:07:50,00:07:53,"with a certain cohort, basically his neighbors, right?"
00:07:53,00:07:55,"Who were not fans,"
00:07:55,00:07:57,"'cause he subsumed everything to his art,"
00:07:57,00:08:01,which went to the extent of him re-routing a local river
00:08:01,00:08:04,"to feed his, his, yes, to feed his pond."
00:08:04,00:08:05,And so all the neighbors who needed the river
00:08:05,00:08:07,"for their cattle farming and other things,"
00:08:07,00:08:09,"were like, well, this is our water."
00:08:09,00:08:11,"And then they all panicked, 'cause they thought"
00:08:11,00:08:13,"the lilies would poison the water supply,"
00:08:13,00:08:15,'cause they were foreign and exotic.
00:08:15,00:08:16,- They were.
00:08:16,00:08:17,"- And, yeah."
00:08:17,00:08:18,"- The lilies are really interesting,"
00:08:18,00:08:21,"because they had been invented very recently,"
00:08:21,00:08:23,"'cause all the lilies in France were white,"
00:08:23,00:08:27,"and there's a guy called Boris Latour Malliac,"
00:08:27,00:08:31,who came up with the idea of crossing French lilies
00:08:31,00:08:32,"with Japanese lilies,"
00:08:32,00:08:34,and he kind of crossed two together
00:08:34,00:08:36,"and came up with this new version,"
00:08:36,00:08:38,and then he crossed that new version
00:08:38,00:08:39,with some from North America
00:08:39,00:08:41,to make all these different colors of lilies.
00:08:41,00:08:44,"And actually, the in-between version of lily"
00:08:44,00:08:45,"that he made is now extinct,"
00:08:45,00:08:49,"so we can't make that bit of science that he did ever again,"
00:08:49,00:08:51,because the in-between step has gone.
00:08:51,00:08:52,- Wow.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"- But Monet's first order from this guy, we have it,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,"and he ordered a load of water lilies from him,"
00:08:57,00:09:01,"but he also ordered some water smart weed,"
00:09:01,00:09:05,"a horn nut, and some broad-leaved bog cotton."
00:09:05,00:09:07,So those paintings could have been paintings
00:09:07,00:09:09,"of broad-leaved bog cotton,"
00:09:09,00:09:12,if that had taken better than his water lilies.
00:09:12,00:09:13,- Yeah.
00:09:13,00:09:15,- The thing about him was that he was such
00:09:15,00:09:16,an incredibly determined person.
00:09:16,00:09:18,"Renoir said, ""If it wasn't for Monet,"
00:09:18,00:09:19,"""we'd have all given up,"""
00:09:19,00:09:23,'cause he went on beyond the pain barrier all the time.
00:09:23,00:09:25,- They weren't massively late to the very start
00:09:25,00:09:26,where they'd be Impressionists.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"- No, no, it was incredibly unpopular."
00:09:28,00:09:30,There were booed and laughed at.
00:09:30,00:09:32,"- Yeah, the word Impressionism came as an insult."
00:09:32,00:09:36,It was one of Monet's paintings was called
00:09:36,00:09:37,Sunset and Impressionism.
00:09:37,00:09:38,"- Impression Sunrise, yeah."
00:09:38,00:09:40,"- Yeah, yeah, but then one of the critics"
00:09:40,00:09:42,made some funny joke about it.
00:09:42,00:09:43,I haven't written it down already.
00:09:43,00:09:45,"- All right, I have is, he was called Louis Leroy,"
00:09:45,00:09:48,"and one of his lines on Impression Sunrise was,"
00:09:48,00:09:51,"""Wallpaper in its original state"
00:09:51,00:09:53,"""is more finished than this seascape."""
00:09:53,00:09:54,- Wow.
00:09:54,00:09:55,Oh my goodness.
00:09:55,00:09:57,"- And then when the Impressionists became famous,"
00:09:57,00:09:59,he then took all the credit for it.
00:09:59,00:10:01,"He was very proud that he'd invented the name,"
00:10:01,00:10:02,but he'd rubbish them at the time.
00:10:02,00:10:03,"- Oh, really?"
00:10:03,00:10:04,"- Yeah, he was really rude about them."
00:10:04,00:10:07,"And then the second time they did an exhibition,"
00:10:07,00:10:09,it was described by a critic called Albert Wolfe
00:10:09,00:10:11,"as a horrifying spectacle,"
00:10:11,00:10:14,"five or six lunatics, one of whom is a woman."
00:10:14,00:10:16,(all laughing)
00:10:16,00:10:19,"And the woman he's talking about is Bertha Moriso,"
00:10:19,00:10:23,and she's really interesting because she and her sisters
00:10:23,00:10:25,"were learning to paint,"
00:10:25,00:10:28,"and they had a private tutor called Joseph Guichard,"
00:10:28,00:10:30,"and he won their mother,"
00:10:30,00:10:32,"considering the characters of your daughters,"
00:10:32,00:10:34,they will become painters.
00:10:34,00:10:35,Do you realise what this means?
00:10:35,00:10:38,"In the upper class milieu to which you belong,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,"this will be revolutionary,"
00:10:40,00:10:43,I might say almost catastrophic.
00:10:43,00:10:45,The idea that one of these girls
00:10:45,00:10:47,might become a professional painter
00:10:47,00:10:50,was just seen as not an acceptable profession.
00:10:50,00:10:53,"- Yeah, people said they have declared war on beauty."
00:10:53,00:10:55,That was the kind of idea of what they were doing.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"And Zola said they shouldn't be called Impressionists,"
00:10:57,00:10:59,"they should be called actualists,"
00:10:59,00:11:00,because that's what they were doing.
00:11:00,00:11:02,They were painting the actual thing.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"Kind of like losing a beauty filter, I guess."
00:11:04,00:11:05,"- They're not actually,"
00:11:05,00:11:07,"because if water lilies look like that,"
00:11:07,00:11:09,then I think I've got something wrong with my eyesight.
00:11:09,00:11:12,"It's blurry, aren't they painting their impression of it?"
00:11:12,00:11:14,- I think you are used to seeing dusty water lilies.
00:11:14,00:11:16,(all laughing)
00:11:16,00:11:18,"- 'Cause actually that painting that we named,"
00:11:18,00:11:20,"which was the Impression Sunrise,"
00:11:20,00:11:23,"I think he didn't have a name,"
00:11:23,00:11:25,"and he was gonna call it like Sunrise,"
00:11:25,00:11:26,"and someone said to him,"
00:11:26,00:11:27,"""Well, you can't really call it a Sunrise,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,"""because it doesn't really look like a Sunrise."""
00:11:29,00:11:31,"And he said, ""Okay, we'll just put Impression Sunrise then."""
00:11:31,00:11:32,"And that's kind of eventually,"
00:11:32,00:11:34,after the insult where Impressionists came from.
00:11:34,00:11:35,"- Yeah, right."
00:11:35,00:11:37,- The thing about Monet is that he was famous
00:11:37,00:11:39,"and immensely rich in his lifetime,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,"quite unlike Van Gogh, for example."
00:11:41,00:11:44,"But you wouldn't forget that he was so,"
00:11:44,00:11:46,it was such a disaster at the beginning.
00:11:46,00:11:50,"So that exhibition that Louis Leroy commented on,"
00:11:50,00:11:52,"when all the figures came in,"
00:11:52,00:11:55,the Impressionists found they each owed 184 francs
00:11:55,00:11:56,to the gallery.
00:11:56,00:11:57,- Wow.
00:11:57,00:11:59,- They actually lost money.
00:11:59,00:12:00,- It's like the Edinburgh Festival.
00:12:00,00:12:01,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:12:01,00:12:03,- And so they had another go.
00:12:03,00:12:06,One of their few financial supporters decided
00:12:06,00:12:10,to hold a lottery in which the first prize was
00:12:10,00:12:13,one of Monet's friend Renoir's paintings.
00:12:13,00:12:14,"And they had this lottery,"
00:12:14,00:12:17,and a local servant girl won the big prize.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"She didn't want the painting,"
00:12:19,00:12:20,"'cause she just heard everyone boo it,"
00:12:20,00:12:21,so she got a cake.
00:12:21,00:12:22,- I don't know.
00:12:22,00:12:24,"If you offered me a painting,"
00:12:24,00:12:26,"be it Impressionists or not, or a cake,"
00:12:26,00:12:27,I know there are days when I'd go for the cake.
00:12:27,00:12:28,- Yeah.
00:12:28,00:12:30,"- It's like a short termism, isn't it?"
00:12:30,00:12:31,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:12:31,00:12:33,'Cause you have to go to the trouble of selling the painting
00:12:33,00:12:34,"in order to get the money to buy lots of cake,"
00:12:34,00:12:35,if that's how you wanna do it.
00:12:35,00:12:36,"- Yeah, good point."
00:12:36,00:12:37,- And it's quicker just to get the cake.
00:12:37,00:12:38,- Really good point.
00:12:38,00:12:39,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:39,00:12:40,"- The thing I love most about Monet,"
00:12:40,00:12:42,and I didn't really know anything about
00:12:42,00:12:43,what he was painting.
00:12:43,00:12:44,"I knew the water lilies,"
00:12:44,00:12:45,but I didn't know about this garden.
00:12:45,00:12:47,And the maintenance of the garden
00:12:47,00:12:50,was so that he had the perfect thing to paint.
00:12:50,00:12:51,There was nothing left to the imagination.
00:12:51,00:12:52,So it wasn't even just the water lilies.
00:12:52,00:12:54,If trees that he were painting
00:12:54,00:12:56,"suddenly came into bloom and foliage was there,"
00:12:56,00:12:58,he'd hire gardeners to chop it away.
00:12:58,00:12:59,'Cause it's getting in the way
00:12:59,00:13:01,of what I had as the perfect painting.
00:13:01,00:13:02,- I've been to the garden.
00:13:02,00:13:03,- Have you?
00:13:03,00:13:06,"- Yeah, it's just a garden with lots of tourists in it."
00:13:06,00:13:07,But it's like...
00:13:07,00:13:09,"- It's weird, he always painted the tourists"
00:13:09,00:13:11,"out to the pictures, didn't he?"
00:13:11,00:13:13,"- But it was like, it was a Japanese garden."
00:13:13,00:13:14,"That's what he called it, I think."
00:13:14,00:13:17,"Or that's what he was aiming for, a Japanese garden."
00:13:17,00:13:19,"'Cause it's got a Japanese bridge, like you say."
00:13:19,00:13:21,"And there's now, if you go to Japan,"
00:13:21,00:13:23,"I can't remember which town it's in,"
00:13:23,00:13:25,but there's like a replica of it
00:13:25,00:13:26,called the Monet Pond.
00:13:26,00:13:30,"And so it's like, he copied the Japanese gardens"
00:13:30,00:13:31,and now Japan has copied his garden
00:13:31,00:13:33,and called it the Monet Garden.
00:13:33,00:13:34,- That seems great.
00:13:34,00:13:38,So the garden itself didn't immediately become
00:13:38,00:13:39,a public place.
00:13:39,00:13:41,It was many years in the family.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"And then the sun, when he passed away in 1966,"
00:13:43,00:13:46,he handed it over and it became part of a museum
00:13:46,00:13:47,and then opened to the public.
00:13:47,00:13:49,And they've had these amazing gardeners
00:13:49,00:13:50,that have been working there ever since
00:13:50,00:13:53,to preserve as close as possible to what he had.
00:13:53,00:13:55,"And so, as you said, James, they can't manufacture"
00:13:55,00:13:57,some of the plants anymore because a step is missing.
00:13:57,00:13:59,And so they have to find alternatives.
00:13:59,00:14:01,"But it's just, it's so wonderful reading the accounts"
00:14:01,00:14:03,of how they go through all his letters.
00:14:03,00:14:05,They take the paintings and they hold them up
00:14:05,00:14:07,exactly in the spot at the right distance
00:14:07,00:14:10,and try and match the ponds to what is in the painting.
00:14:10,00:14:12,"- So they're doing the exact same thing that he did,"
00:14:12,00:14:13,"but in reverse again. - In reverse, yeah."
00:14:13,00:14:15,- It's a really nice place to go.
00:14:15,00:14:17,"It's almost like Disneyland, I would say."
00:14:17,00:14:20,"It's quite fake, but it's like, it's really, really beautiful."
00:14:20,00:14:21,And it's definitely worth visiting.
00:14:21,00:14:25,- He was almost killed in 1865 while painting.
00:14:25,00:14:26,- Oh yeah?
00:14:26,00:14:28,"- Yeah, a rogue discus knocked him out."
00:14:28,00:14:31,"- No, I do it. - 1865, you see?"
00:14:31,00:14:32,"- Yeah, 1865. - Houseland."
00:14:32,00:14:34,- He was painting in the open
00:14:34,00:14:38,and there were a bunch of picnickers and some children.
00:14:38,00:14:40,And a discus suddenly caved to shot.
00:14:40,00:14:42,- Who brings a discus to a picnic?
00:14:42,00:14:43,- English tourists.
00:14:43,00:14:44,- That's amazing. - It says.
00:14:44,00:14:46,"And so he ran to protect the kids,"
00:14:46,00:14:49,"but in doing so, it's kind of like a secret server sage"
00:14:49,00:14:52,and jumping out of the president and taking the bullet.
00:14:52,00:14:53,He took the discus. - That's so funny.
00:14:53,00:14:55,"- They say if it had hit him any higher,"
00:14:55,00:14:58,"it might have killed him, but it knocked him out"
00:14:58,00:15:00,and he was bedridden for a while.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"- So that exactly illustrates the QI principle, Dan,"
00:15:03,00:15:05,"because I have read an entire book on Monet,"
00:15:05,00:15:08,"a 300-page book on Monet, in great detail"
00:15:08,00:15:10,to research this thing.
00:15:10,00:15:11,And I didn't know that thing about the discus.
00:15:11,00:15:12,- Really? - Yeah.
00:15:12,00:15:15,- And Dan got it from Buzzfeed to Top 10 Facebook.
00:15:15,00:15:18,(all laughing)
00:15:18,00:15:21,"- Which impressionist are you most likely to be, Quiz?"
00:15:21,00:15:22,(all laughing)
00:15:22,00:15:25,(upbeat music)
00:15:25,00:15:31,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:15:31,00:15:34,- My fact this week is that Neolithic Europeans
00:15:34,00:15:38,regularly burn their houses down for no apparent reason.
00:15:38,00:15:40,- Wow. - That's amazing.
00:15:40,00:15:42,- It is unbelievable.
00:15:42,00:15:47,So this is a culture called the Cucuteni-Triplia culture.
00:15:48,00:15:50,Which is usually Neolithic cultures
00:15:50,00:15:52,"that are sort of named often, at least,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,on where the evidence of them is found.
00:15:54,00:15:56,"And they lived in southeast in Europe,"
00:15:56,00:15:58,"in like Romania, Moldova, Ukraine,"
00:15:58,00:16:03,"that kind of area between about 5,100 BC and 2,800 BC"
00:16:03,00:16:07,with lots of variation in how it's dated.
00:16:07,00:16:09,"But the bizarre thing about them is,"
00:16:09,00:16:13,"from all the evidence we have, every 60 to 80 years,"
00:16:13,00:16:15,they just burn down all their houses.
00:16:15,00:16:16,- So weird. - Yeah.
00:16:16,00:16:18,"- And entire towns, really."
00:16:18,00:16:21,So a lot of people think they were like the first civilization
00:16:21,00:16:23,because they suddenly had these huge towns.
00:16:23,00:16:26,The settlement sizes increased by 20 times.
00:16:26,00:16:28,"- They sometimes call them cities, don't they?"
00:16:28,00:16:30,"- Yes, yeah. - I think it's a slightly"
00:16:30,00:16:31,optimistic. - How do you know it was them
00:16:31,00:16:33,burning them down rather than the neighbors
00:16:33,00:16:34,coming along the end of the week?
00:16:34,00:16:37,"- Yeah, Anna, well, well, do I know,"
00:16:37,00:16:39,"I've done some extensive archaeology,"
00:16:39,00:16:41,and I have learned a few things.
00:16:41,00:16:43,So a lot of people have said it might be that.
00:16:43,00:16:45,I think the reason they say it's not
00:16:45,00:16:47,is that it would have taken such a huge amount
00:16:47,00:16:49,of fuel to do it.
00:16:49,00:16:51,So a settlement of 100 houses would require
00:16:51,00:16:53,like four square miles of forest.
00:16:53,00:16:55,And also it's so regular.
00:16:55,00:16:57,It's this weird 60 to 80 cycle.
00:16:57,00:16:59,- There's a weird theory as well that they were actually
00:16:59,00:17:03,reinforcing the structures when they were burning it
00:17:03,00:17:05,because they found the walls actually hardened.
00:17:05,00:17:07,"Just like, let's reset our houses."
00:17:07,00:17:10,"Get everything out, let's burn the house down, and then--"
00:17:10,00:17:11,"- Well, almost like firing a pot."
00:17:11,00:17:13,"- Exactly. - You know, you have your clay"
00:17:13,00:17:15,"and then you've set it on fire and it makes,"
00:17:15,00:17:16,it becomes hard.
00:17:16,00:17:20,But I think I read one thing saying that might not be true
00:17:20,00:17:22,because eventually you would burn it
00:17:22,00:17:24,"and it would become really, really hard."
00:17:24,00:17:26,"And then if you wanted to build another house on it,"
00:17:26,00:17:27,it just made it really difficult
00:17:27,00:17:29,because you can't put any foundations down
00:17:29,00:17:30,because you just can't drill into it.
00:17:30,00:17:33,"Because in those days, they didn't have the tools for it."
00:17:33,00:17:34,- Yeah.
00:17:34,00:17:35,- One idea is that it might have been ceremonial
00:17:35,00:17:37,"while they were burning these down, right?"
00:17:37,00:17:38,- Yeah.
00:17:38,00:17:41,"- Because if you look at Çatalhöyek in Turkey,"
00:17:41,00:17:43,"which is an area we've spoken about before,"
00:17:43,00:17:46,"which is like a really old town,"
00:17:46,00:17:47,they did this as well.
00:17:47,00:17:50,And we can find out exactly how they did it.
00:17:50,00:17:53,"And every time they would take all the goods out of the house,"
00:17:53,00:17:54,"then they would clean the house,"
00:17:54,00:17:57,"then they would put arrowheads on the floor,"
00:17:57,00:18:00,and then the oven would be deliberately sort of knocked in
00:18:00,00:18:03,"and broken down, and then they would set fire to it."
00:18:03,00:18:04,And it seems like they always set fire
00:18:04,00:18:07,"from the south of the house, no matter when they did it."
00:18:07,00:18:10,So perhaps seeing as it was always the same
00:18:10,00:18:11,"in this particular part of Turkey at least,"
00:18:11,00:18:13,maybe there was a ceremonial reason behind it.
00:18:13,00:18:15,"- Yeah, and it does seem to have happened"
00:18:15,00:18:16,in a few other cultures as well.
00:18:16,00:18:19,So perhaps that was just the done thing.
00:18:19,00:18:22,They'd wonder why we don't burn our houses down.
00:18:22,00:18:24,- It's pretty amazing looking at drawings
00:18:24,00:18:27,"of what these places, cities, if we use that term, look like,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,'cause they were massive buildings.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"And I don't place massive buildings to 5,000 BC."
00:18:32,00:18:34,"- How massive are we talking, Dan?"
00:18:34,00:18:36,"- Well, okay. - Virgil Khalifa?"
00:18:36,00:18:38,"- Yeah, no, not that, but multi-story."
00:18:38,00:18:39,They would have multi-story.
00:18:39,00:18:41,"And some places would be, if you can picture,"
00:18:41,00:18:44,the example that's given is two entire basketball courts
00:18:44,00:18:48,"would be the size of a place, and that, I don't know."
00:18:48,00:18:49,Maybe that's my ignorance of history.
00:18:49,00:18:51,"- Certainly, if you had that in central London,"
00:18:51,00:18:53,we're talking quite a few mills.
00:18:53,00:18:55,"- Oh, definitely."
00:18:55,00:18:58,"- So I couldn't find many examples of Neolithic housing,"
00:18:58,00:19:00,but Jericho is interesting.
00:19:00,00:19:02,It's supposed to be the oldest city in the world.
00:19:02,00:19:03,Did you know that? - No.
00:19:03,00:19:04,- On the Palestinian West Bank.
00:19:04,00:19:08,And the Tower of Jericho is the oldest stone building
00:19:08,00:19:09,"in the world, 8,000 years old."
00:19:09,00:19:11,- How interesting.
00:19:11,00:19:13,"- And the Neolithic housing in Jericho,"
00:19:13,00:19:15,they had the doors were in the roof.
00:19:15,00:19:16,Did you know that?
00:19:16,00:19:18,"- Oh, so they would enter ladders."
00:19:18,00:19:20,"- You had a ladder, you put a ladder up,"
00:19:20,00:19:20,"you went in through the door,"
00:19:20,00:19:23,and there's a ladder inside to go down to the ground floor.
00:19:23,00:19:25,- That's super fun. - What was the good thing for that?
00:19:25,00:19:27,"- Because of defence, the whole thing is,"
00:19:27,00:19:30,"what's fascinating about it, I had to look up,"
00:19:30,00:19:33,"remind myself, what Neolithic meant."
00:19:33,00:19:35,"And as far as I can gather,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,it basically starts with the invention of farming
00:19:37,00:19:39,"about 12,000 years ago,"
00:19:39,00:19:45,"and ends with when bronze is invented about 4,300 years ago."
00:19:45,00:19:49,"So it's about 8,000 years, so not that long."
00:19:49,00:19:54,"But the first humans came to Britain around 700,000 BC."
00:19:54,00:19:59,"So for 688,000 years,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,"human beings were just sitting about, eating fruit."
00:20:01,00:20:03,"- Or wandering around. - Survive, yes."
00:20:03,00:20:05,"- What they were sitting about, really, just walking."
00:20:05,00:20:07,"- They were wandering, yeah. - Yeah, hunting, gathering."
00:20:07,00:20:10,"- Yeah, and Neolithic basically describes the time"
00:20:10,00:20:14,"that humans became, I suppose, what we are, like, civilisation."
00:20:14,00:20:17,"We settled, we found farming, we discovered farming,"
00:20:17,00:20:19,and so we just started sitting there farming stuff.
00:20:19,00:20:21,Our diet's got much worse.
00:20:21,00:20:23,- Jared Diamond says it was the worst thing
00:20:23,00:20:25,"that humans have ever done, doesn't he?"
00:20:25,00:20:27,"- Inventive farming. - Yeah, I think there's something"
00:20:27,00:20:29,"to be said for that, and everything moves terribly fast."
00:20:29,00:20:32,"So 688,000 years doing nothing,"
00:20:32,00:20:35,"and then suddenly you got farming 12,000 years ago,"
00:20:35,00:20:37,"chickens domesticated 10,000 years ago,"
00:20:37,00:20:41,"roasted walnuts first eaten in France 8,000 years ago,"
00:20:41,00:20:44,"6,000 years ago, there were no white people then."
00:20:44,00:20:47,Everybody was dark-skinned.
00:20:47,00:20:51,"And then the first known pair of shoes is 5,500 years ago,"
00:20:51,00:20:53,"so that's, you know... - Oh, my God."
00:20:53,00:20:55,"- And, sorry, the game changer was the invention of the..."
00:20:55,00:20:57,- Agriculture. - Agriculture is where we're talking about.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"- Yeah, because everything follows in agriculture,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,"because first of all, you get a class system,"
00:21:01,00:21:03,"because somebody's got to be in charge,"
00:21:03,00:21:04,"somebody's got to decide things,"
00:21:04,00:21:06,"you get religion starts growing up,"
00:21:06,00:21:07,and I think it's probably older than that.
00:21:07,00:21:09,"- You start having grain, and so your teeth get bad,"
00:21:09,00:21:11,- That's right. - everybody has terrible teeth.
00:21:11,00:21:12,- And then you've got property.
00:21:12,00:21:14,"So people, there's defence, there's warfare,"
00:21:14,00:21:16,"there's, you know, what we call civilisation."
00:21:16,00:21:18,"- But the problem, the real problem is,"
00:21:18,00:21:22,"it's basically Anna's short-termism of cake versus Renoir,"
00:21:22,00:21:26,"is that by farming, you can get lots of calories very easily,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,so you don't have to work so hard to get your calories.
00:21:28,00:21:30,"But it's really bad in the long term,"
00:21:30,00:21:32,but it's really good in the short term.
00:21:32,00:21:34,- One of the unfun things about it
00:21:34,00:21:36,"was that it introduced overwork, right?"
00:21:36,00:21:38,"So people have looked at the lives of hunter-gatherers,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,and it was dreamy.
00:21:40,00:21:41,"They were only working a few hours a day,"
00:21:41,00:21:44,"and then they would just be lying around in caves or whatever,"
00:21:44,00:21:46,"and it was with agriculture, where suddenly it became"
00:21:46,00:21:47,"all about production and production,"
00:21:47,00:21:50,"that people started working, their arse is off,"
00:21:50,00:21:53,and we haven't come far since then.
00:21:53,00:21:56,- How was your month off?
00:21:56,00:21:57,So you just had...
00:21:57,00:22:03,"- Yeah, they hadn't invented holidays and weekends yet, sure."
00:22:04,00:22:06,"This particular culture were amazing, though."
00:22:06,00:22:09,The Cucuteni-Tripulia people.
00:22:09,00:22:11,I thought an extraordinary thing about them
00:22:11,00:22:14,is that there are lots of symbols on their pottery
00:22:14,00:22:17,"that have been uncovered, they're completely well preserved,"
00:22:17,00:22:21,"and they include, and this is from, as I think I said,"
00:22:21,00:22:24,"like 5,000 BC, they include both yin and yang symbols,"
00:22:24,00:22:27,"so those perfect yin and yang symbols, and swastikas."
00:22:27,00:22:29,"- And swastikas, yeah, I saw that as well."
00:22:29,00:22:30,"- They seemed to have come up with both,"
00:22:30,00:22:32,and I can't really find out.
00:22:32,00:22:34,- So they had Nazis.
00:22:34,00:22:37,"- Yeah, it's very tense at the time."
00:22:37,00:22:39,That's why they kept burning each other's houses down.
00:22:39,00:22:41,- Isn't the swastika one of those sort of universal symbols
00:22:41,00:22:43,"that's found all over the world, isn't it?"
00:22:43,00:22:46,"- What commonly people think it came from the East,"
00:22:46,00:22:49,"like, you know, in Indochina, yeah, in Hinduism,"
00:22:49,00:22:51,"but it seems to have come from here,"
00:22:51,00:22:54,"but I don't know if they did come about independently,"
00:22:54,00:22:55,but it's quite a specific shape.
00:22:55,00:22:56,"- Yeah, and I think what they're saying about this one is,"
00:22:56,00:23:00,"it's the earliest examples of consistent usage,"
00:23:00,00:23:02,"and so other places, they're quite sporadic,"
00:23:02,00:23:03,and maybe just pull them through the--
00:23:03,00:23:05,- I kind of think it is a thing
00:23:05,00:23:06,that is quite a natural thing.
00:23:06,00:23:09,"Like, if I'm just kind of sitting here,"
00:23:09,00:23:10,"sort of scribbling on a piece of paper,"
00:23:10,00:23:13,sometimes I'll look down and I'll have drawn a swastika.
00:23:13,00:23:16,- It's really worrying when we see that change.
00:23:16,00:23:17,(all laughing)
00:23:17,00:23:20,"- And I just think it's 'cause it's like a geometric figure,"
00:23:20,00:23:22,"it's just like a few crosses and whatever,"
00:23:22,00:23:24,"and you're like, ""Oh, I'm gonna cross that out."""
00:23:24,00:23:25,(all laughing)
00:23:25,00:23:28,- Do write in anyone if you have the same thing as me.
00:23:28,00:23:30,I can't say I find myself so consciously
00:23:30,00:23:31,drawing swastikas.
00:23:31,00:23:33,"- Well, it's a sour sticker as well, isn't it?"
00:23:33,00:23:34,It's a--
00:23:34,00:23:36,"- That's a back to front one, is it?"
00:23:36,00:23:37,That's what James always tells people.
00:23:37,00:23:38,(all laughing)
00:23:38,00:23:39,Don't worry.
00:23:39,00:23:40,- There's an interesting guy.
00:23:40,00:23:42,Did you come across Sir John Lubbock in your--
00:23:42,00:23:43,- No.
00:23:43,00:23:47,- So he was the guy who coined the word Neolithic.
00:23:47,00:23:48,"And Paleolithic, actually."
00:23:48,00:23:50,"Extraordinary guy, I never heard of him before."
00:23:50,00:23:52,Amazing scientist.
00:23:52,00:23:56,"And when he was about 12, his father came home and said,"
00:23:56,00:23:58,"""I've got some very good news, Johnny."
00:23:58,00:23:59,"""Very, very good news."""
00:23:59,00:24:02,"And he thought, ""Oh, I'm getting a new pony."""
00:24:02,00:24:05,But it was actually the idea that Charles Darwin
00:24:05,00:24:07,was gonna come and live in the next village.
00:24:07,00:24:08,So--
00:24:08,00:24:09,"- Oh, really?"
00:24:09,00:24:10,- So they became very close friends.
00:24:10,00:24:14,And Lubbock was the guy who persuaded the Dean of Westminster
00:24:14,00:24:16,that Darwin should be buried in Westminster Abbey.
00:24:16,00:24:17,- Really?
00:24:17,00:24:18,- And was one of his pool barris.
00:24:18,00:24:19,I thought that was rather charming.
00:24:19,00:24:20,- Really?
00:24:20,00:24:22,That's very interesting because in a weird mirroring
00:24:22,00:24:25,"of that, a couple of generations later,"
00:24:25,00:24:28,the person who came up with the term Neolithic Revolution
00:24:28,00:24:31,was an Australian called Veer Gordon Child.
00:24:31,00:24:35,"And he was very good friends with another Charles Darwin,"
00:24:35,00:24:37,the grandson of Charles Darwin.
00:24:37,00:24:38,"- Oh, really?"
00:24:38,00:24:40,- And they both heavily influenced each other as well.
00:24:40,00:24:42,And he was a very interesting child.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"He was a person who excavated Scarabray,"
00:24:44,00:24:46,which is an extraordinary--
00:24:46,00:24:47,"- Oh, where they found the village."
00:24:47,00:24:48,"They found it, yeah."
00:24:48,00:24:49,"- Yes, yeah."
00:24:49,00:24:52,"- That's kind of the oldest Neolithic village in the UK, right?"
00:24:52,00:24:53,"- One of the Orkneys, isn't it?"
00:24:53,00:24:54,"- Yeah, it's in Orkney."
00:24:54,00:24:56,"And it is, I have actually been there."
00:24:56,00:25:00,And it's an amazing place because it's so well preserved.
00:25:00,00:25:02,And it's about nine houses.
00:25:02,00:25:05,"And they're 1,000 years older than Stonehenge."
00:25:05,00:25:07,And they're all still furnished.
00:25:07,00:25:08,It was all stone furniture
00:25:08,00:25:10,'cause famously not really any trees on Orkney.
00:25:10,00:25:12,So everything was stone.
00:25:12,00:25:15,"And they have, as you walk in through the doorway,"
00:25:15,00:25:16,you've got a fire in the middle.
00:25:16,00:25:18,You've got a chest of drawers opposite.
00:25:18,00:25:19,And you've got two beds on either side.
00:25:19,00:25:21,- What were the chest of drawers made of?
00:25:21,00:25:23,- I was going to say that stone chest of drawers.
00:25:23,00:25:24,That's pretty cool.
00:25:24,00:25:25,- Yeah.
00:25:25,00:25:26,"- Yeah, I've used chest of drawers."
00:25:26,00:25:28,It's a place where you put your stuff.
00:25:28,00:25:28,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:28,00:25:31,"Yeah, you've done the estate agent."
00:25:31,00:25:33,(all laughing)
00:25:33,00:25:35,- Exactly.
00:25:35,00:25:38,"It looks like a rock, but if used correctly."
00:25:38,00:25:39,- Imagine this rock.
00:25:39,00:25:40,It could be your office.
00:25:40,00:25:42,It could be an exercise room.
00:25:42,00:25:47,- And they also all had limpets soaking tanks.
00:25:47,00:25:48,That's the other group that they furnished with.
00:25:48,00:25:49,- It could be an exercise room.
00:25:49,00:25:51,It could be a limpets soaking tank.
00:25:51,00:25:53,(all laughing)
00:25:53,00:25:54,- Whatever you're into.
00:25:54,00:25:57,"- What do you, I mean,"
00:25:57,00:25:59,obviously the answer is to soak your limpets.
00:25:59,00:26:02,But what is a limpets soaking tank for?
00:26:02,00:26:05,"- Apparently, as you've correctly assumed,"
00:26:05,00:26:06,it is for limpets soaking.
00:26:06,00:26:08,"And the reason they limpets soaked was not,"
00:26:08,00:26:09,"as you might think, 'cause they ate limpets."
00:26:09,00:26:10,"- Yeah, that's right."
00:26:10,00:26:12,- We believe they use limpets as bait.
00:26:12,00:26:14,"And if it soaked them, they would soften a bit"
00:26:14,00:26:15,and be better bait.
00:26:15,00:26:17,And then they tracked other things.
00:26:17,00:26:18,"- There's another theory, by the way,"
00:26:18,00:26:20,"just jumping back to these,"
00:26:20,00:26:23,the Burnt House horizon as it's been coined.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"- Oh, the Trigelian ones."
00:26:24,00:26:26,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:26:26,00:26:29,There are many theories as to why they were Burnt.
00:26:29,00:26:30,We've already mentioned a few.
00:26:30,00:26:32,One other theory is that--
00:26:32,00:26:34,- I can just hear it sometimes when Dan
00:26:34,00:26:39,is coming up with a time-traveler-y alien-y.
00:26:39,00:26:40,That's what it's gonna be today.
00:26:40,00:26:42,- It's not any of that.
00:26:42,00:26:42,- Go on.
00:26:42,00:26:44,- So there's a theory that Bigfoot was--
00:26:44,00:26:45,(all laughing)
00:26:45,00:26:48,"What it is, is that it's thought that if someone died"
00:26:48,00:26:50,"in the house, then the house has gone"
00:26:50,00:26:52,from a house of the living to the house of the dead.
00:26:52,00:26:54,And so you burn it down to respect the dead.
00:26:54,00:26:55,"I mean, there's so many--"
00:26:55,00:26:57,"- That's a rational theory, actually."
00:26:57,00:26:58,"I take it back, Dan."
00:26:58,00:26:59,No Bigfoot involved.
00:26:59,00:27:00,"- Talking of spooky mysteries,"
00:27:00,00:27:02,shouldn't we talk about Stonehenge a bit?
00:27:02,00:27:05,Because that is really one of the big mysteries in that.
00:27:05,00:27:07,"That's sort of late Neolithic, isn't it?"
00:27:07,00:27:07,What's it about?
00:27:07,00:27:10,"Between 3,100 and 1,600 B.C."
00:27:10,00:27:11,- Yeah.
00:27:11,00:27:13,"- 1,500 years, it took them to fish."
00:27:13,00:27:15,"- I think it was late Neolithic for the world,"
00:27:15,00:27:18,"but we were actually quite slow to farm in Britain,"
00:27:18,00:27:19,weren't we?
00:27:19,00:27:21,"- Yeah, so yes, we were."
00:27:21,00:27:23,"Everything took, you know, it took thousands of years"
00:27:23,00:27:25,to reach farming for the least.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"- Well, you know, it's just like a European thing, isn't it?"
00:27:27,00:27:29,We don't really like to do that.
00:27:29,00:27:30,(laughing)
00:27:30,00:27:33,"- They recently, they think, almost certainly,"
00:27:33,00:27:34,that Stonehenge was built by the Welsh.
00:27:34,00:27:35,Did you know this?
00:27:35,00:27:36,- Hmm.
00:27:36,00:27:39,- They knew the stones came from Priselli Hills in Wales.
00:27:39,00:27:42,"But they assumed that the English went there,"
00:27:42,00:27:44,collected the stones and brought them back in.
00:27:44,00:27:47,But now they think the thing was actually built in Wales.
00:27:47,00:27:49,"- Hang on, so it built in Wales"
00:27:49,00:27:50,"and then they did an Ikea style,"
00:27:50,00:27:52,took it down and shipped it over.
00:27:52,00:27:53,"- Yes, absolutely."
00:27:53,00:27:54,- Wow.
00:27:54,00:27:56,- I went to Stonehenge.
00:27:56,00:27:59,"Like, there was a thing where you could go like early"
00:27:59,00:28:01,in the morning before it opened for the tourists.
00:28:01,00:28:03,And we did that and they do not like it
00:28:03,00:28:04,if you touch the stones.
00:28:04,00:28:05,- Hmm.
00:28:05,00:28:06,- That's just a tip.
00:28:06,00:28:07,- Did you touch it?
00:28:07,00:28:08,- No.
00:28:08,00:28:09,(laughing)
00:28:09,00:28:10,"- It could have done when I was a child,"
00:28:10,00:28:11,you definitely couldn't touch it.
00:28:11,00:28:12,"- I know, well, you used to be able to, right?"
00:28:12,00:28:14,"Like, you used to even be able to chip bits off them,"
00:28:14,00:28:16,"I think we might have said, but yeah."
00:28:16,00:28:17,- How did they feel when you scratched
00:28:17,00:28:18,that swastika on here?
00:28:18,00:28:20,(laughing)
00:28:20,00:28:23,"- I love that story, then in 1915,"
00:28:23,00:28:25,"a wealthy barrister called Sir Cecil Chubb,"
00:28:25,00:28:27,he went to an auction in Salisbury
00:28:27,00:28:31,intending to buy a pair of curtains at a knockdown price
00:28:31,00:28:32,and ended up buying Stonehenge.
00:28:32,00:28:34,(laughing)
00:28:34,00:28:36,"- Darling, don't be angry."
00:28:36,00:28:37,(laughing)
00:28:37,00:28:38,"- This reminds me, John, of that time"
00:28:38,00:28:41,that you bought the life-size Barbie doll.
00:28:41,00:28:43,"- The Christmas tree Barbie for my daughters, yeah."
00:28:43,00:28:44,(laughing)
00:28:44,00:28:47,It was a Save the Children auction.
00:28:47,00:28:49,"And I was directing ads at the time,"
00:28:49,00:28:50,"we had plenty of spare money,"
00:28:50,00:28:53,and I bought this seven-foot tall Barbie
00:28:53,00:28:55,dressed as a Christmas tree for the girls.
00:28:55,00:28:57,"And Sarah came back from the loo,"
00:28:57,00:29:00,"I just bought this thing, she was so angry,"
00:29:00,00:29:01,she'd speak to me for three months.
00:29:01,00:29:02,(laughing)
00:29:02,00:29:04,"- You should have been like, it could have been worse,"
00:29:04,00:29:05,"it could have been Stonehenge, yeah."
00:29:05,00:29:06,(laughing)
00:29:06,00:29:08,"- It could have been, because similarly,"
00:29:08,00:29:10,"Cecil Chubb bought this thing,"
00:29:10,00:29:13,he came home so dulling and he told his wife
00:29:13,00:29:16,that he'd bought it as a birthday present for her.
00:29:16,00:29:16,- Right.
00:29:16,00:29:17,"- He was improvising, but she didn't want it."
00:29:17,00:29:20,"He said, ""Well, what the hell do I want those for?"
00:29:20,00:29:21,"""Where's my--"""
00:29:21,00:29:22,- They're not gonna keep the light out?
00:29:22,00:29:23,(laughing)
00:29:23,00:29:26,- So that's how it gave it to the nation in 1918.
00:29:26,00:29:27,He gave it to it. - Wow.
00:29:27,00:29:28,That's great.
00:29:28,00:29:29,"- Now, whatever happened to the curtains,"
00:29:29,00:29:32,"that's what I wanted to do. - Exactly, that's the question."
00:29:32,00:29:33,- Yeah.
00:29:33,00:29:35,(upbeat music)
00:29:35,00:29:39,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:29:39,00:29:40,and that is my fact.
00:29:40,00:29:43,My fact this week is that despite warning us
00:29:43,00:29:45,"that everything we say would be recorded,"
00:29:45,00:29:48,we have lost all the recordings of everything
00:29:48,00:29:51,that George Orwell said.
00:29:51,00:29:52,- Ironic.
00:29:52,00:29:52,- Yeah.
00:29:52,00:29:53,"- All right, I'll add as far as that."
00:29:53,00:29:55,"- There's nothing on YouTube at all, no clips."
00:29:55,00:29:56,- There's literally nothing.
00:29:56,00:29:58,He was a BBC broadcaster.
00:29:58,00:30:01,"He was famous in his day, obviously, as a writer."
00:30:01,00:30:02,"- Of course he was, yeah."
00:30:02,00:30:05,"- Yeah, he did multiple, multiple panels."
00:30:05,00:30:06,"He was always on broadcast,"
00:30:06,00:30:09,so we should have his voice somewhere.
00:30:09,00:30:11,"- This is, thank God Alex Bell is not on this podcast,"
00:30:11,00:30:12,'cause he gets very upset
00:30:12,00:30:14,about the BBC's cataloging system.
00:30:14,00:30:17,- And you can understand it when you hear things like this.
00:30:17,00:30:18,"- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:30:18,00:30:21,"And actually we have no video of him as well,"
00:30:21,00:30:25,"except in 2003, some footage of him was unearthed of him."
00:30:25,00:30:28,"When he was, I believe he was 18 years old."
00:30:28,00:30:31,"You see him at a school sort of like sports field,"
00:30:31,00:30:33,and he's the fourth kid in a line of kids
00:30:33,00:30:35,who are holding arms linked up.
00:30:35,00:30:37,And that's the only footage that we have of him
00:30:37,00:30:38,before he was actually famous.
00:30:38,00:30:40,So we don't have any footage.
00:30:40,00:30:42,"We got photos, obviously."
00:30:42,00:30:44,"And he was someone who was being monitored as well,"
00:30:44,00:30:46,because he was saying a lot of contentious stuff.
00:30:46,00:30:48,So you figure just something would have survived.
00:30:48,00:30:50,"- Yeah, and it's such a shame it hasn't,"
00:30:50,00:30:52,because I think his voice would have been hilarious.
00:30:52,00:30:54,"- It sounds like it was, yeah."
00:30:54,00:30:56,"- Well, 'cause he was super posh."
00:30:56,00:30:59,"And you know how when you watch old films,"
00:30:59,00:31:01,"like Brief Encounter, about kind of not even"
00:31:01,00:31:03,"that posh people, and they all were at 12,"
00:31:03,00:31:05,you can barely understand them?
00:31:05,00:31:07,"And George Orwell at the time, even his posh friend said,"
00:31:07,00:31:10,"""This guy sounds incredibly posh."""
00:31:10,00:31:11,So I think he would have been virtually
00:31:11,00:31:13,incomprehensible to us.
00:31:13,00:31:14,"- Yeah, there's quite a few people"
00:31:14,00:31:15,who described what his voice was like.
00:31:15,00:31:17,And something to take into account
00:31:17,00:31:21,"is the fact that when he was a soldier in the Spanish War,"
00:31:21,00:31:24,he was literally shot through the neck.
00:31:24,00:31:27,Like a bullet went in one side and out the back.
00:31:27,00:31:29,It somehow missed all the main arteries
00:31:29,00:31:30,that would have killed him.
00:31:30,00:31:33,"He survived, but that affected his voice forever on."
00:31:33,00:31:35,"In terms of volume, so he could never talk loud."
00:31:35,00:31:36,It was hugely exhausting.
00:31:36,00:31:38,He'd been at dinner parties and he'd try to say something.
00:31:38,00:31:39,"And everyone's like, ""What?"""
00:31:39,00:31:41,"And he's just like, ""Ugh."""
00:31:41,00:31:42,And he just couldn't get the volume right enough.
00:31:42,00:31:45,"- Do you think maybe we do have some recordings of him,"
00:31:45,00:31:47,but it's just very badly leveled?
00:31:47,00:31:49,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:31:49,00:31:52,"- I did not read somewhere that a BBC researcher intervened,"
00:31:52,00:31:53,said he sounded like Alan Rickman.
00:31:53,00:31:55,"- Alan Rickman, yeah, that's what they said."
00:31:55,00:32:00,"Yeah, 'cause so the thought is there is one bit of audio"
00:32:00,00:32:02,"of him out there, 'cause it's this BBC researcher"
00:32:02,00:32:04,"who found it in the archives, but then kind of lost it."
00:32:04,00:32:06,And one day we will get it.
00:32:06,00:32:07,These things do turn up.
00:32:07,00:32:10,"- Yeah, well, that's very exciting."
00:32:10,00:32:12,"In a way, this actually is a fitting fact,"
00:32:12,00:32:14,because he actually said in 1984
00:32:14,00:32:16,"that every record is destroyed, right?"
00:32:16,00:32:18,It was like the end of history.
00:32:18,00:32:18,- He did actually.
00:32:18,00:32:21,- So this is like history has been wiped out.
00:32:21,00:32:24,Winston Smith says everything had been destroyed or falsified.
00:32:24,00:32:26,So now all we need is for an Alan Rickman
00:32:26,00:32:27,to come along and like fake his voice
00:32:27,00:32:29,and create that as the new tree.
00:32:29,00:32:30,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:32:30,00:32:31,- And then you put his prediction.
00:32:31,00:32:32,"- He also used to fake his voice,"
00:32:32,00:32:33,"which was really interesting,"
00:32:33,00:32:36,when he was living in various guises during his life.
00:32:36,00:32:38,"So one of his most famous books,"
00:32:38,00:32:39,"Down and Out in Paris in London,"
00:32:39,00:32:43,so he decided he wanted to live as someone on the streets
00:32:43,00:32:47,and sort of put himself into the real people's world.
00:32:47,00:32:48,"And he would put on, apparently,"
00:32:48,00:32:50,a sort of cockney accent that he would sort of...
00:32:50,00:32:51,"- Yeah, well, you wouldn't say that, right?"
00:32:51,00:32:54,"If he's talking like Jacob Rees-Mogg,"
00:32:54,00:32:57,he's not gonna like work out well in Paris
00:32:57,00:32:58,"with the criminals, is he?"
00:32:58,00:32:59,"- Yeah, that's true, that's true."
00:32:59,00:33:03,"- I've got some ironic facts about 1984,"
00:33:03,00:33:05,'cause I love the core fact.
00:33:05,00:33:08,"Within 200 yards of the flat in Islington,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,"where Orwell had the idea for 1984,"
00:33:11,00:33:14,there are now 32 CCTV cameras.
00:33:14,00:33:16,- That's very good.
00:33:16,00:33:19,- And the most common book people lie about having read
00:33:19,00:33:21,is Orwell's 1984.
00:33:21,00:33:21,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:33:21,00:33:23,- Why would they do that?
00:33:23,00:33:25,"- Well, James, you used to..."
00:33:25,00:33:27,"- You used to lie a lot, didn't you?"
00:33:27,00:33:29,"- But in our live fish shows,"
00:33:29,00:33:31,you had a thing about people with the top 10 books
00:33:31,00:33:33,that people lied about and Tolstoy was on there.
00:33:33,00:33:35,"- Yeah, but 1984 is the top one."
00:33:35,00:33:37,"I've heard that before, yeah, yeah."
00:33:37,00:33:40,"- No one's lying about, you know, J.K. Rowling, are they?"
00:33:40,00:33:41,No one's lying about having read the Chamber of Seekers.
00:33:41,00:33:43,- Do you know what I think it is?
00:33:43,00:33:45,"I think it's quite easy to lie about,"
00:33:45,00:33:49,'cause Big Brother as a concept is quite easy to understand.
00:33:49,00:33:51,Room 101 is quite easy to understand.
00:33:51,00:33:52,"If people say, ""Have you read it?"""
00:33:52,00:33:55,"you can kind of get away with it, I think."
00:33:55,00:33:56,- Maybe you sort of think you have.
00:33:56,00:33:59,"In Thailand, you know you can be arrested in Thailand"
00:33:59,00:34:00,for reading 1984.
00:34:00,00:34:01,- Really?
00:34:01,00:34:03,- And for having picnics.
00:34:03,00:34:05,Those are the two really serious things in Thailand.
00:34:05,00:34:06,"- What was the second one, sorry?"
00:34:06,00:34:07,- Having picnics.
00:34:07,00:34:08,"- Oh, gosh."
00:34:08,00:34:10,"- I thought you said, I slightly myself,"
00:34:10,00:34:11,thought you said at-family picnics.
00:34:11,00:34:13,You could only be arrested for reading it
00:34:13,00:34:14,if you had really at-family picnics.
00:34:14,00:34:16,It's very rude and you should be interacting.
00:34:16,00:34:19,- It's interesting you said about where he got the idea
00:34:19,00:34:20,was in Islington.
00:34:20,00:34:24,"I think he's partly got the idea from his wife,"
00:34:24,00:34:27,"Eileen, who'd already written and published a poem"
00:34:27,00:34:29,"about 1984, 15 years earlier."
00:34:29,00:34:30,- Really?
00:34:30,00:34:30,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:34:30,00:34:31,- Cool.
00:34:31,00:34:34,"- About 1984, the year, like her predictions."
00:34:34,00:34:35,"- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:34:35,00:34:37,Now hers was a bit more optimistic.
00:34:37,00:34:40,It was about that the world was sort of sought itself out
00:34:40,00:34:42,and she thought the knowledge of the past
00:34:42,00:34:43,can't be wiped out.
00:34:43,00:34:46,So 1984 that he wrote was almost the opposite
00:34:46,00:34:47,of what she wrote.
00:34:47,00:34:48,- Right.
00:34:48,00:34:50,- Her one was written in 1934.
00:34:50,00:34:52,So it was exactly 50 years behind.
00:34:52,00:34:54,"And she, yeah, wrote about what the future would be like."
00:34:54,00:34:56,- And she thought it would be great.
00:34:56,00:34:57,"Well, she's saying-"
00:34:57,00:34:58,"- Yeah, kind of."
00:34:58,00:35:00,"- You know, things might go downhill,"
00:35:00,00:35:01,"things might be a bit bad,"
00:35:01,00:35:03,"but in the end, everything will work itself out."
00:35:03,00:35:04,- Really?
00:35:04,00:35:04,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:35:04,00:35:08,"And he also based it on a Soviet book called ""Mui"","
00:35:08,00:35:11,which was written by Yefgeny Zamyatin.
00:35:11,00:35:12,- Yes.
00:35:12,00:35:14,- Which is basically the same story.
00:35:14,00:35:15,- Is it?
00:35:15,00:35:16,"- Well, kind of."
00:35:16,00:35:18,"It's like, it's all about mass surveillance"
00:35:18,00:35:19,and stuff like that.
00:35:19,00:35:21,"And it was banned by the Soviet Union,"
00:35:21,00:35:22,but Orwell read it.
00:35:22,00:35:25,And he did say that his next book would be similar
00:35:25,00:35:27,"to this ""Mui""."
00:35:27,00:35:28,- Fair enough.
00:35:28,00:35:28,- Sure enough it was.
00:35:28,00:35:30,"So he kind of, I wouldn't say plagiarized it"
00:35:30,00:35:32,'cause he put lots of his own ideas in.
00:35:32,00:35:35,- But I think like if you take his wife's poem about 1984
00:35:35,00:35:38,"and this Soviet book and put them together,"
00:35:38,00:35:40,it wasn't a huge leap to come up
00:35:40,00:35:41,with what he came up with.
00:35:41,00:35:42,- Yeah.
00:35:42,00:35:44,"I read ""1984"" when I was at school."
00:35:44,00:35:45,"- Well, so you claim."
00:35:45,00:35:47,"- Oh yeah, yeah, big brother and the rooms,"
00:35:47,00:35:49,"101 rooms and something, yeah."
00:35:49,00:35:50,(laughing)
00:35:50,00:35:52,But it absolutely altered my life.
00:35:52,00:35:54,I do remember it being a game changer.
00:35:54,00:35:56,"And then the other book, they changed my view of things."
00:35:56,00:35:58,And it was part of the module we were doing at school
00:35:58,00:35:59,"was ""Brave New World"" by Aldous, hopefully."
00:35:59,00:36:00,"- Yeah, definitely, me too."
00:36:00,00:36:02,- Those two were always paired together
00:36:02,00:36:03,as these kind of dystopian books.
00:36:03,00:36:06,So it was the most joyous thing to discover
00:36:06,00:36:10,that Orwell studied under Huxley at school.
00:36:10,00:36:11,- Oh yeah.
00:36:11,00:36:12,- Had eaten.
00:36:12,00:36:13,He taught him French.
00:36:13,00:36:13,- Yes.
00:36:13,00:36:15,"- I mean, that is just incredible."
00:36:15,00:36:17,And Huxley wasn't an author yet.
00:36:17,00:36:20,"He wasn't, well, he certainly wasn't published and famous."
00:36:20,00:36:21,So these were just two guys who would go on
00:36:21,00:36:22,to change the world.
00:36:22,00:36:24,"- It was a delight, isn't it?"
00:36:24,00:36:26,It's an echo of the impressionists really
00:36:26,00:36:30,"because not just that extraordinary co-incidence,"
00:36:30,00:36:33,but Orwell was a contemporary at Eaton
00:36:33,00:36:37,"of Cyril Connolly, Anthony Powell, and Ian Fleming."
00:36:37,00:36:38,They were all contemporaries.
00:36:38,00:36:40,"So it's like a sort of nexus,"
00:36:40,00:36:44,like the fact that Renoir and Emile Zola and Baudelaire
00:36:44,00:36:48,and people all famous were just young people in Paris.
00:36:48,00:36:49,- Who would have thought it would turn out?
00:36:49,00:36:50,"- I know, just successful people."
00:36:50,00:36:53,"- Just kind of help when you're of extremely rich,"
00:36:53,00:36:55,"posh, white people."
00:36:55,00:36:57,"- Although to be fair to Orwell, yeah, it wasn't,"
00:36:57,00:36:59,"you know, he sort of got a scholarship or something,"
00:36:59,00:36:59,didn't he?
00:36:59,00:37:00,- He did.
00:37:00,00:37:03,"His mother was, she had a really exotic name."
00:37:03,00:37:05,She was called Ida Limousane.
00:37:05,00:37:08,She was born in Penge.
00:37:08,00:37:09,- That's where I used to live.
00:37:09,00:37:09,- Yeah.
00:37:09,00:37:10,"- Wow, cool."
00:37:10,00:37:12,"- Well, I was actually just saying"
00:37:12,00:37:15,that Penge is not a very exotic sounding place.
00:37:15,00:37:16,- It's not.
00:37:16,00:37:17,And they tried to change that in Penge
00:37:17,00:37:18,by calling it 'Ponge'.
00:37:18,00:37:19,(all laughing)
00:37:19,00:37:20,I'd get genuinely.
00:37:20,00:37:21,- They did.
00:37:21,00:37:21,"- Genuinely, yeah."
00:37:21,00:37:22,- I live in Ponge.
00:37:22,00:37:26,"- But to be fair, she was only on holiday in Ponge."
00:37:26,00:37:26,- Right.
00:37:26,00:37:31,- She was actually grew up in More Lameen in Myanmar.
00:37:31,00:37:35,"- On 1984, the process of writing it sounds really horrible."
00:37:35,00:37:37,Fun though it is to read.
00:37:37,00:37:38,"He was really sick, wasn't he?"
00:37:38,00:37:41,So he had terrible TB
00:37:41,00:37:44,"and he went to the Island of Jura,"
00:37:44,00:37:47,"very, very remote spot on the Scottish Island of Jura"
00:37:47,00:37:51,to write 1984 after he'd been widowed.
00:37:51,00:37:53,Apostle Eileen had died very unexpectedly.
00:37:53,00:37:55,And so very sad time.
00:37:55,00:37:56,"He'd taken the sun, he'd just adopted."
00:37:56,00:38:00,I think they adopted a son about six months before she died.
00:38:00,00:38:02,"So he took the sun, went to Jura,"
00:38:02,00:38:04,and it just sounds like agony.
00:38:04,00:38:06,And he'd write that TB was gradually killing him
00:38:06,00:38:09,as he forced out this awful book.
00:38:09,00:38:11,"But he's, again, he sounds a little bit like Monet"
00:38:11,00:38:15,so determined and kind of gutsy.
00:38:15,00:38:19,So he did things like once a bunch of cousins came to visit
00:38:19,00:38:22,and he took them all on this fishing trip.
00:38:22,00:38:24,"And, you know, he's got a bad TB."
00:38:24,00:38:27,"The boat capsized, they really nearly drowned."
00:38:27,00:38:30,I think he just managed to scramble him and his son to a rock
00:38:30,00:38:32,and drag them out.
00:38:32,00:38:36,"So every nearly died, but made his TB a bit worse."
00:38:36,00:38:39,"But, yeah, it sounds like he's really living the awful life"
00:38:39,00:38:42,"that they lived in 1984, at least suffering-wise."
00:38:42,00:38:44,"Yeah, because he had TB all his life, didn't he?"
00:38:44,00:38:46,Suffered it from all the time.
00:38:46,00:38:47,Very sickly.
00:38:47,00:38:49,"But, again, like Monet, incredibly determined,"
00:38:49,00:38:52,"you know, going to the Spanish Civil War as a reporter"
00:38:52,00:38:55,and then joining up on the socialist side.
00:38:55,00:38:56,"And then in the Second World War,"
00:38:56,00:38:58,"he really tried to get into the Army,"
00:38:58,00:39:00,but they wouldn't let him because of his TB.
00:39:00,00:39:04,"In fact, one friend said he tried harder to get into the Army"
00:39:04,00:39:08,than most people tried to get out of it.
00:39:08,00:39:11,"And so, instead, he joined the Home Guard famously, you know,"
00:39:11,00:39:14,"because he thought that once Hitler had been defeated,"
00:39:14,00:39:16,"it might be transformed into a Catalan-style,"
00:39:16,00:39:19,revolutionary militia to overthrow the British ruling classes.
00:39:19,00:39:22,Wow. The Home Guard were going to have a coup.
00:39:22,00:39:24,"Considering he was so anti-fascist,"
00:39:24,00:39:27,he did have a Hitler mustache when he was young.
00:39:27,00:39:29,Yes. But he was also an anti-communist.
00:39:29,00:39:31,"Did you know that? Yeah, he was."
00:39:31,00:39:32,"Because he hated the communists,"
00:39:32,00:39:35,"having met them, the Russians in the Spanish Civil War,"
00:39:35,00:39:36,"April they were. He was a socialist,"
00:39:36,00:39:38,"but he didn't like the communists. Yes, that's right."
00:39:38,00:39:40,"So he kept a list. Well, I always thought 1984 was about"
00:39:40,00:39:42,"how communism had gone wrong a bit, wasn't it?"
00:39:42,00:39:43,"Yeah. I think. Anyway, good one, sorry."
00:39:43,00:39:46,He kept a sort of McCarthyite list of people
00:39:46,00:39:48,"who were communists or fellow travellers,"
00:39:48,00:39:50,"which he then, just before he died,"
00:39:50,00:39:51,he gave it to the Foreign Office.
00:39:51,00:39:53,"That's right. Did he? Yes, that's right."
00:39:53,00:39:54,"A dog, sneaky dogger."
00:39:54,00:39:57,"He was kept secret for 54 years,"
00:39:57,00:40:00,"and on that list are J.B. Priestley, Michael Redgrave,"
00:40:00,00:40:02,"the actor, and Charlie Chaplin."
00:40:02,00:40:04,Are we sure he didn't just not like these people?
00:40:04,00:40:06,"Maybe, yeah, maybe. Yeah?"
00:40:06,00:40:09,He also is responsible for weather spoons.
00:40:09,00:40:10,"Yes, I read that. Oh, yes."
00:40:10,00:40:13,"You've forgotten this essay on the perfect pub, didn't you?"
00:40:13,00:40:15,"He wrote his essay on a perfect pub, and he said..."
00:40:15,00:40:17,"And it's called ""Moon on the Water"" or something?"
00:40:17,00:40:18,"The Moon on the Water, yeah."
00:40:18,00:40:20,"There is a weather spoon, so it's called that, I think, isn't it?"
00:40:20,00:40:21,"There's a lot, actually. There's a lot."
00:40:21,00:40:24,He's won a pinch. He said that...
00:40:24,00:40:25,Do you want to punish me? Sorry.
00:40:25,00:40:29,He said that it should have a very convenient location.
00:40:29,00:40:31,It should have a very good atmosphere without any loud music
00:40:31,00:40:33,so you can chat to each other.
00:40:33,00:40:35,There should be fights every Saturday night.
00:40:35,00:40:37,"No, he didn't say that one."
00:40:37,00:40:41,"He said that you should be able to get a variety of different beverages,"
00:40:41,00:40:43,including non-alcoholic ones.
00:40:43,00:40:45,"But then, having said that, some of his friends said"
00:40:45,00:40:46,"that whenever he went to the pub with them,"
00:40:46,00:40:50,he would only allow them to drink dark ale no matter what they ordered.
00:40:50,00:40:53,"They would say, ""Oh, I'll have a gin and tonic."""
00:40:53,00:40:55,And then he'd come back from the pub with some dark ale
00:40:55,00:40:57,"and say, ""Well, that's what you're having."""
00:40:57,00:40:59,I'll gather around. What are you? What are you having?
00:40:59,00:41:00,"Jimmy's on, I think? Yeah, what are you having?"
00:41:00,00:41:01,"Roman Coke? Yeah, go ahead."
00:41:01,00:41:03,"Oh, don't let George get it in."
00:41:03,00:41:04,"Oh, George, yeah."
00:41:04,00:41:06,"12 dark ales, please."
00:41:06,00:41:09,They're like a crisps now.
00:41:09,00:41:13,"He did say, ""This is what of him reminds me of you, John."""
00:41:13,00:41:15,Which is... No.
00:41:15,00:41:17,He belitt... This was according to the ODMB.
00:41:17,00:41:20,He believed that no meaningful idea was too difficult
00:41:20,00:41:24,"to be explained in simple terms to ordinary people,"
00:41:24,00:41:26,"which is basically the QI style of writing, isn't it?"
00:41:26,00:41:30,"I think that's very true. I think he's a very QI person, actually,"
00:41:30,00:41:31,because here's one.
00:41:31,00:41:34,To see what is in front of one's nose requires constant struggle.
00:41:34,00:41:36,"That's very QI, I think."
00:41:36,00:41:38,There are some ideas so wrong
00:41:38,00:41:41,that only a very intelligent person could believe in them.
00:41:41,00:41:43,That's great.
00:41:43,00:41:47,"So, John, I wonder if you have any insight into this,"
00:41:47,00:41:52,but Orwell historians have claimed that they believe Room 101
00:41:52,00:41:55,was based off his experience at the BBC
00:41:55,00:41:59,and being in such torturous conference rooms and meetings.
00:41:59,00:42:01,"Really, he went to the Spanish Civil War,"
00:42:01,00:42:05,"suffered from TB the years of his life's struggle,"
00:42:05,00:42:08,"lived down in Paris and London, but working at the BBC."
00:42:08,00:42:10,Yeah.
00:42:10,00:42:12,This is really interesting. Down and out since Studio One.
00:42:12,00:42:14,"There's a particular echo for this to me,"
00:42:14,00:42:17,"because I used to have the next-door office, Douglas Adams,"
00:42:17,00:42:19,"where we were both young radio producers,"
00:42:19,00:42:21,"and we looked across at Broadcasting House, but the back of it."
00:42:21,00:42:24,OK. From 16 Langham Street.
00:42:24,00:42:28,"And there was a window in there that was all blacked out,"
00:42:28,00:42:31,and we thought that must be Room 101 in there.
00:42:31,00:42:32,"We fantasised about all this,"
00:42:32,00:42:36,"and we were going to write a story about how the BBC had a coup in London,"
00:42:36,00:42:39,"because you remember how weird things were in the '70s,"
00:42:39,00:42:41,"the three-day week, and the Labour government empowered everyone,"
00:42:41,00:42:43,and thought it was going to be a sort of counter-revolution.
00:42:43,00:42:45,I think James would have stretched my mind to remember that
00:42:45,00:42:46,if he remembers the first six months of his life.
00:42:46,00:42:48,"But other than that, no."
00:42:48,00:42:51,I didn't even do three days' work in those days.
00:42:51,00:42:52,"But wait, so what?"
00:42:52,00:42:56,"It felt like Big Brother was happening, Big Auntie."
00:42:56,00:42:59,"Yes, but we thought there was going to be some sort of counter-revolution."
00:42:59,00:43:00,Right.
00:43:00,00:43:03,"And the idea was the BBC were going to lead this from this secret room,"
00:43:03,00:43:07,and they're basically going to take down all the telephone lines
00:43:07,00:43:09,and done it as a drama.
00:43:09,00:43:11,They've cut tanks in Trafalgar Square.
00:43:11,00:43:14,"It was all a completely faked coup, where nothing had to be taken."
00:43:14,00:43:16,"But we thought it had, so they all stayed home."
00:43:16,00:43:17,Right.
00:43:17,00:43:21,"As it was, the blacked-out window was just David Attenborough's dressing room."
00:43:21,00:43:25,"The spookiness goes on, because about that age,"
00:43:25,00:43:26,"I was 24 or something like that,"
00:43:26,00:43:30,I had a call from a very senior BBC executive.
00:43:30,00:43:33,He had a strange voice like that. It was very ha-ha.
00:43:33,00:43:35,And asked if I'd like to go to dinner.
00:43:35,00:43:36,"So I went to my head of department,"
00:43:36,00:43:38,"just having come out of an English public school,"
00:43:38,00:43:40,that a man 30 years old of me had asked me to dinner.
00:43:40,00:43:41,"I said, ""Do you think this is all right?"""
00:43:41,00:43:43,"He said, ""We'll be very careful what you say."
00:43:43,00:43:45,"""That's the managing director's hitman."""
00:43:45,00:43:46,"I thought, ""What?"""
00:43:46,00:43:51,"Because it was well-known that everybody in BBC had a file on them,"
00:43:51,00:43:54,"and if you were a communist at a Christmas tree in the corner,"
00:43:54,00:43:56,if you were a lefty.
00:43:56,00:43:57,"So I went out for dinner with this bloke,"
00:43:57,00:44:00,and I had too much to drink before I was terribly nervous
00:44:00,00:44:03,that I was going to say something wrong.
00:44:03,00:44:05,"And he would say, ""Do you like football?"""
00:44:05,00:44:08,"And I go, ""Not really, do you?"""
00:44:08,00:44:09,"""No, do you enjoy opera?"""
00:44:09,00:44:13,"And I say, ""Not really, do you enjoy it?"""
00:44:13,00:44:16,So it was a very uncomfortable dinner.
00:44:16,00:44:18,And I went home and nothing happened.
00:44:18,00:44:21,"And years later, I was told that the guy had started Channel 4,"
00:44:21,00:44:22,and I told him this story.
00:44:22,00:44:23,"He said, ""Oh, that was..."
00:44:23,00:44:26,"""You were definitely being recruited for MI5, and you blew it."""
00:44:26,00:44:29,"If only you said you supported Wolves, happily."
00:44:29,00:44:30,That was the key.
00:44:30,00:44:32,"So I was actually being recruited for the Secret Service,"
00:44:32,00:44:33,and I didn't realise it.
00:44:33,00:44:34,Wow!
00:44:34,00:44:36,But Blackadder wouldn't have existed if you had been.
00:44:36,00:44:38,"So, you know, what's better"
00:44:38,00:44:40,"that you ended the Cold War ten years early, or...?"
00:44:40,00:44:43,"If you had been recruited, you wouldn't tell us."
00:44:43,00:44:46,"You might tell us the story, and then it might end with,"
00:44:46,00:44:48,"""And then I was never recruited."""
00:44:48,00:44:49,Mm-hmm.
00:44:49,00:44:50,(LAUGHS)
00:44:50,00:44:51,That's...
00:44:51,00:44:52,Dun-dun-dun.
00:44:52,00:44:54,(ELECTRONIC MUSIC)
00:44:54,00:45:00,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:45:00,00:45:01,and that is James.
00:45:01,00:45:04,"OK, my fact this week is that in 14th century London,"
00:45:04,00:45:08,one punishment for selling unclean spices
00:45:08,00:45:09,was to be put in the pillory
00:45:09,00:45:13,and have the spices set on fire beneath your nose.
00:45:13,00:45:14,(LAUGHS)
00:45:14,00:45:16,"What would that do? Like, do we know how it would matter?"
00:45:16,00:45:18,'Cause it sounds like you'd be quite nice.
00:45:18,00:45:20,Is it like one of those scented sticks you get in your house sometimes
00:45:20,00:45:22,that releases a nice smell?
00:45:22,00:45:23,"No, no. Have you ever seen on the internet"
00:45:23,00:45:25,"when they do, like, the Nutmeg challenge,"
00:45:25,00:45:27,"or the Cinnamon challenge, or whatever it is,"
00:45:27,00:45:30,"and they try and eat one spoonful of spices,"
00:45:30,00:45:32,and it all goes terribly wrong?
00:45:32,00:45:34,Yeah. I reckon it's that times a thousand.
00:45:34,00:45:37,"Yeah. You're just going to get it in your sinuses,"
00:45:37,00:45:39,in your eyes as... It would burn like a thousand.
00:45:39,00:45:42,"It would burn like mad in your face. Yeah, it would be awful."
00:45:42,00:45:44,"So, I read this when I was trying to nail something"
00:45:44,00:45:47,about eating fish on a Friday for QI this year.
00:45:47,00:45:51,I reckon that people in the UK eat fish on a Friday
00:45:51,00:45:54,"for economic reasons, not for religious reasons."
00:45:54,00:45:56,"I can't work out if that's true, so if you know this,"
00:45:56,00:45:59,"if you're a historian, you know this, get in touch with me."
00:45:59,00:46:00,"But while I was doing that research,"
00:46:00,00:46:03,I found a paper called Butchering in Medieval London
00:46:03,00:46:05,"by Ernest L. Sabine, and I read that,"
00:46:05,00:46:07,and he gave loads of good info about the food trade
00:46:07,00:46:09,in the 14th century.
00:46:09,00:46:13,"And in 1393, when John Hadley was the mayor,"
00:46:13,00:46:16,"he was a grocer, he came up with this new law."
00:46:16,00:46:18,You said when John Hadley was the mayor like...
00:46:18,00:46:20,Do you remember when John Hadley was the mayor in 1393?
00:46:20,00:46:23,"You must remember that. The John Hadley era, of course."
00:46:23,00:46:25,"Hadley years. Yeah. Sorry, go on."
00:46:25,00:46:28,"So, he was a grocer, as we all know,"
00:46:28,00:46:31,and obviously had lots of ideas about the grossing trade.
00:46:31,00:46:34,"I mean, I'm telling a lot of people what they already know here,"
00:46:34,00:46:36,but I'm going to go through the basics.
00:46:36,00:46:39,He came up with a law about adulterated spices
00:46:39,00:46:42,and said that basically you should be not selling spice
00:46:42,00:46:46,"which isn't pure, and there was one particular guy,"
00:46:46,00:46:48,"a foreign merchant, who had come over to London"
00:46:48,00:46:50,"and was selling dodgy spices,"
00:46:50,00:46:52,and he was sent to the pillory and had his false powders
00:46:52,00:46:55,burned underneath him. Wow.
00:46:55,00:46:58,"And that pillory, by the way, is where you put your head in..."
00:46:58,00:46:59,"It's like stocks, in a way. It's like stocks."
00:46:59,00:47:01,"Yeah, people might throw tomatoes at you,"
00:47:01,00:47:03,"but in this case, he was being burned."
00:47:03,00:47:06,"Yeah, the stocks are different, because the stocks are just your feet."
00:47:06,00:47:08,"They're better because you can dodge the missiles,"
00:47:08,00:47:10,"because you can move, you're upper body."
00:47:10,00:47:12,"Yeah, yeah. You're doomed with the pillory."
00:47:12,00:47:15,"And Hadley, as well, he prescribed that all spices"
00:47:15,00:47:19,must henceforth be garbled by an official garbola.
00:47:19,00:47:20,"Oh! Oh, that's wrong!"
00:47:20,00:47:23,"Oh! Oh, my God!"
00:47:23,00:47:24,Pum-pum-pum.
00:47:24,00:47:26,"So, garbola. Do you want to do it all?"
00:47:26,00:47:28,LAUGHTER
00:47:28,00:47:31,"Imagine. So, I didn't know what this was, garbling."
00:47:31,00:47:33,"So, a garbling is where you sift through a spice"
00:47:33,00:47:36,to get rid of all the stuff that isn't a spice.
00:47:36,00:47:38,"Oh! So, let's say you've got a load of peppercorns,"
00:47:38,00:47:40,"but there's loads of, like, little ant legs"
00:47:40,00:47:42,and little bits of flies and stuff in there.
00:47:42,00:47:45,"You sift through it, and you just get the good stuff,"
00:47:45,00:47:46,and that's garbling.
00:47:46,00:47:50,"And it comes from an old Anglo-Norman word ""garbolae"" meaning ""to sift""."
00:47:50,00:47:52,"And the garbling that you were doing, Anna,"
00:47:52,00:47:56,comes from an old thing where you would get a text
00:47:56,00:47:59,"and you would take out all of the bits that you don't want to say,"
00:47:59,00:48:02,and you would just include the bits that you do want to say.
00:48:02,00:48:05,"So, let's say you took something from the Bible."
00:48:05,00:48:08,"You might say, ""Well, actually, I quite like the adultery part,"
00:48:08,00:48:10,"""so I'm not going to mention that, but I will mention the stuff"
00:48:10,00:48:13,"""about not coveting my neighbour's ox."""
00:48:13,00:48:16,And that was known as garbling because you were sifting through the words.
00:48:16,00:48:19,"And then it eventually became like ""garbling your voice"" and ""garbling your voice""."
00:48:19,00:48:20,"So, it's almost become the opposite,"
00:48:20,00:48:24,"because now, garbling is more like including extraneous stuff."
00:48:24,00:48:26,It's certainly not the direct kind of communication that...
00:48:26,00:48:27,Exactly. Yeah.
00:48:27,00:48:29,Weird.
00:48:29,00:48:31,"This seems to be a bit of a theme,"
00:48:31,00:48:34,this means of punishment for adulterating spices.
00:48:34,00:48:37,"I actually read that in 1444, in Nuremberg,"
00:48:37,00:48:41,an adulterator of saffron was burned at the stake over a fire of his own saffron.
00:48:41,00:48:42,Yeah. Wow.
00:48:42,00:48:44,It's been an incredibly expensive fire.
00:48:44,00:48:45,Yeah.
00:48:45,00:48:48,"Yes, it's the most expensive spire saffron, I think, isn't it?"
00:48:48,00:48:53,"Yeah, it is, because you can only get it a tiny bit from each saffron flower, can't you?"
00:48:53,00:48:56,"So, you have to get, like, 200,000 saffron flowers."
00:48:56,00:48:58,"And then you can't taste it anywhere, guys."
00:48:58,00:49:00,"They used to. Yeah, might win a huge time, right, guys?"
00:49:00,00:49:01,"Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:49:01,00:49:07,"This was the saffron shell code, wasn't it, in Nuremberg, about saffron."
00:49:07,00:49:09,Sounds like it.
00:49:09,00:49:14,And you could be hung drawn and quartered for selling dodgy saffron.
00:49:14,00:49:15,Really?
00:49:15,00:49:18,"They were really hard on saffron, I guess, because it is so pricey."
00:49:18,00:49:22,"Yeah, but if you were a woman, you wouldn't be hung drawn and quartered,"
00:49:22,00:49:26,"because it was seen as bad to hang draw and quarter women,"
00:49:26,00:49:28,because you might be able to see their belly
00:49:28,00:49:30,as you're pulling out the innards.
00:49:30,00:49:33,"Maybe someone might get turned on by that, I don't know."
00:49:33,00:49:35,"But you weren't allowed to show someone a woman's stomach,"
00:49:35,00:49:37,"so you couldn't hang draw and quarter someone,"
00:49:37,00:49:39,and so they would be buried alive instead.
00:49:39,00:49:42,"It had a special kind of pillory for women,"
00:49:42,00:49:43,did you know that? No?
00:49:43,00:49:45,"A few, T-H-E-W-E, which is a..."
00:49:45,00:49:46,Is it with beef holes?
00:49:46,00:49:48,"...stocks, and it was just..."
00:49:48,00:49:51,"Sorry, it was the stocks that kept the legs together."
00:49:51,00:49:52,"Oh, really?"
00:49:52,00:49:53,Really.
00:49:53,00:49:54,Fascinating.
00:49:54,00:49:55,So funny.
00:49:55,00:49:58,And I thought this is like... Really interesting.
00:49:58,00:50:02,"There's a company called Spices Pillory in Nantwich, Cheshire."
00:50:02,00:50:04,"Yeah, I just couldn't believe that."
00:50:04,00:50:07,"It's now just called Spices, it's now just called Spices,"
00:50:07,00:50:09,"but it's in 38 Pillory Street, Nantwich."
00:50:09,00:50:11,Really? That is so funny.
00:50:11,00:50:14,"And so I was just checking this out on Wikipedia,"
00:50:14,00:50:17,and it says on the pillory entry
00:50:17,00:50:20,"that people who were put in pillories were called ""pillocks."""
00:50:20,00:50:24,"Citation-needed Wikipedia, I think."
00:50:24,00:50:26,"It does say ""pillock-needed."""
00:50:26,00:50:29,That's never going to last.
00:50:29,00:50:31,"I think ""pillock"" comes from ""bollock,"" basically, doesn't it?"
00:50:31,00:50:33,"Yeah, I think."
00:50:33,00:50:36,So do you think that people with the spices burning under the nose
00:50:36,00:50:38,were also pelted with fruit and things?
00:50:38,00:50:40,"Oh, I would think so, yeah."
00:50:40,00:50:43,'Cause one of the things I liked about the pillory
00:50:43,00:50:45,"was that it was kind of quite a democratic thing,"
00:50:45,00:50:48,so the crowd decided what they threw.
00:50:48,00:50:52,"So if it was a minor offence, you'd get soft fruit or whatever,"
00:50:52,00:50:55,"and if they really didn't like it, if you'd done something horrible,"
00:50:55,00:50:58,"they'd throw stones and saucepans,"
00:50:58,00:51:00,and people were actually killed in the pillory.
00:51:00,00:51:02,"Dead dogs and stuff like that. Dead dogs, yeah. Really?"
00:51:02,00:51:08,"There was one guy who, in 1727, was convicted of attempted sodomy."
00:51:08,00:51:10,"He's called Charles Hitchin,"
00:51:10,00:51:12,and he went into the stocks wearing a suit of armour
00:51:12,00:51:15,"'cause he was so worried that people would throw heavy, hard things at him."
00:51:15,00:51:17,"That's amazing. And did you read about Daniel Defoe,"
00:51:17,00:51:19,"the guy who wrote ""Robinson Crusoe""? Yeah."
00:51:19,00:51:21,"He did a satirical pamphlet,"
00:51:21,00:51:23,"which somebody took literally,"
00:51:23,00:51:27,"and he was put in the pillory for seditious libel,"
00:51:27,00:51:29,which is a really serious political offence.
00:51:29,00:51:33,"And the crowd all turned up, and they thought he was absolutely great,"
00:51:33,00:51:34,so they just threw flowers at him.
00:51:34,00:51:37,"Oh, nice. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, that's very cool."
00:51:37,00:51:42,"It's really interesting, this is a punishment that fits the crime, I suppose,"
00:51:42,00:51:47,which quite often happened in the olden days.
00:51:47,00:51:53,"So, in 1482, in Bebrick, which I think was a village in Germany,"
00:51:53,00:51:57,"there was a vintner who'd adulterated his wine with something else,"
00:51:57,00:52:00,"and he was condemned to drink six quarts of it, of his own wine,"
00:52:00,00:52:03,which is six litres. That is a lot.
00:52:03,00:52:07,"It's a lot... Well, the article about it, which was written in 1952,"
00:52:07,00:52:09,"just said, ""From this, he died."""
00:52:09,00:52:12,"Oh, wow."
00:52:12,00:52:14,What a way to go. Yeah.
00:52:14,00:52:16,That's so interesting.
00:52:16,00:52:17,"People think, you know, you sort of think,"
00:52:17,00:52:19,"""Oh, that's the sort of thing they did in the Middle Ages."""
00:52:19,00:52:23,"They cheat it by making... Instead of saffron, they did turmeric."
00:52:23,00:52:25,"But it still goes on today, adulteration of spices."
00:52:25,00:52:31,"Mm, yeah. And I'm just reading in Tata, the big Indian multinational,"
00:52:31,00:52:33,"the insurance branch, has a thing on that,"
00:52:33,00:52:35,"of typical adulteration of spices in India,"
00:52:35,00:52:40,"such as you put sand or powdered chalk in sugar,"
00:52:40,00:52:42,"brick powder is added to red chilli powder,"
00:52:42,00:52:45,"pire seeds to black pepper, chicory to coffee,"
00:52:45,00:52:48,"sawdust to ground cumin seeds,"
00:52:48,00:52:49,and used tea leaves to tea.
00:52:49,00:52:51,So that's how they do it.
00:52:51,00:52:53,And in the... I don't like that one.
00:52:53,00:52:57,"They also put mud, stones, pebbles, marbles and filth, apparently,"
00:52:57,00:52:59,in some spices.
00:52:59,00:53:02,Marbles are never going to fit through those tiny holes.
00:53:02,00:53:06,The rules from the US Food and Drug Administration
00:53:06,00:53:10,on filth in adulterated spices are really specific.
00:53:10,00:53:15,"So, for example, the maximum amount of filth permitted by the FDA"
00:53:15,00:53:18,in 50 grams of ground paprika
00:53:18,00:53:22,is 150 insect fragments and 22 rodent hairs.
00:53:22,00:53:26,"In all spices, 300 insect fragments and 10 rodent hairs."
00:53:26,00:53:28,Somebody checks all these.
00:53:28,00:53:32,"And in cinnamon, it's 400 insect fragments and 11 rodent hairs."
00:53:32,00:53:35,What you really want to get into if you're a food adulterer
00:53:35,00:53:38,"is canned or frozen spinach,"
00:53:38,00:53:41,because they're much more generous with their limits there.
00:53:41,00:53:44,"So, for every 100 grams of canned or frozen spinach,"
00:53:44,00:53:50,"you're allowed 50 aphids and/or thrips and/or mites for 100 grams,"
00:53:50,00:53:54,"or two or more, three millimetre or longer larvae"
00:53:54,00:53:57,"or larval fragments, or spinach worms,"
00:53:57,00:54:00,whose aggregate length exceeds 12 millilitres per 24 pounds.
00:54:00,00:54:02,That's how much spinach...
00:54:02,00:54:04,"You get a lot of mites, mites and thrips in there."
00:54:04,00:54:07,"Spinach is very light, though, isn't it?"
00:54:07,00:54:09,"Yeah. Like, how many kilos of spinach was it?"
00:54:09,00:54:15,"That was 100 grams. Oh, yeah, OK, that's quite a lot of ant."
00:54:15,00:54:20,"The most adulterated spice/herb in the EU,"
00:54:20,00:54:26,"according to a 2022 reporter's oregano or oregano, if you're American."
00:54:26,00:54:28,"It's the most adulterated? Yeah, it is."
00:54:28,00:54:33,48% of samples that were checked were contaminated with...
00:54:33,00:54:35,"Oh, um... sage."
00:54:35,00:54:38,"Sage, I think you'd be able to taste that."
00:54:38,00:54:40,Do you think? If there's some of us to say... Time? No.
00:54:40,00:54:41,Marijuana.
00:54:41,00:54:45,"Grass. No, it is olive leaves."
00:54:45,00:54:49,"So, they just basically add olive leaves to the oregano leaves"
00:54:49,00:54:50,and then mush it up.
00:54:50,00:54:52,"I mean, if you're not noticing, sod it."
00:54:52,00:54:55,"You know, people can even taste herbs and spices anyway."
00:54:55,00:54:58,"They're just for show, aren't they?"
00:54:58,00:55:01,"Like, there was this huge thing."
00:55:01,00:55:04,They're just to make your covers look fancy.
00:55:04,00:55:08,Just get some ketchup and mayonnaise and stop being such a snob.
00:55:08,00:55:10,"No, there was this just..."
00:55:10,00:55:14,I'm just saying this because there was a big sting in 2021
00:55:14,00:55:16,of a criminal gang in Spain.
00:55:16,00:55:19,"Oh, I thought that was something they found in some spinach."
00:55:19,00:55:22,"How much of a bee is there, Stings?"
00:55:22,00:55:24,"Just the sting, it's fine."
00:55:24,00:55:26,"Yeah, add spice as it goes down."
00:55:26,00:55:29,"No, this was... 2021, there was a criminal gang in Spain"
00:55:29,00:55:31,that was done for making fake saffron.
00:55:31,00:55:33,"So, Spanish saffron is the incredibly expensive"
00:55:33,00:55:35,sort after saffron.
00:55:35,00:55:37,"And there were 17 people arrested,"
00:55:37,00:55:41,"and it was found that a huge proportion of it was actually fake,"
00:55:41,00:55:43,so it was mixed up with other stuff. Yeah.
00:55:43,00:55:46,"But mostly mixed up with Iranian saffron,"
00:55:46,00:55:48,"which had been imported, feels OK,"
00:55:48,00:55:50,and which I think does taste the same.
00:55:50,00:55:52,I'd be amazed if people could tell the difference.
00:55:52,00:55:55,"So, there was one Parisian chef who said that making sure"
00:55:55,00:55:58,you've got legitimate saffron is as time-consuming
00:55:58,00:56:01,as checking all the other produce in your food combined.
00:56:01,00:56:03,"And I would say, don't worry about it."
00:56:03,00:56:06,"No, I don't think I'm going to go to a restaurant and go,"
00:56:06,00:56:08,"""This is Iranian saffron!"""
00:56:08,00:56:12,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:56:12,00:56:15,"Bread is one that was adulterated a lot in history, wasn't there?"
00:56:15,00:56:18,And you could be really badly punished for being a baker and...
00:56:18,00:56:19,"Hence, bakers doesn't, I guess."
00:56:19,00:56:23,"Yes, so the idea you make a 13th bun"
00:56:23,00:56:26,so that the weight of your 12 buns is...
00:56:26,00:56:28,"Is actually... So, it was like, yeah, for non-English,"
00:56:28,00:56:30,"because exactly you make a 13th bun,"
00:56:30,00:56:32,"and that's what bakers doesn't, as opposed to 12,"
00:56:32,00:56:35,"because you're in so much trouble if you'd made 12 buns,"
00:56:35,00:56:37,but they were just a little bit light.
00:56:37,00:56:38,"It's like, to be safe, chuck another one."
00:56:38,00:56:41,"But it's a serious matter, because bread is what people live on,"
00:56:41,00:56:43,"and, you know, you can't cheat on that."
00:56:43,00:56:46,"Whereas in 2017, I think it was,"
00:56:46,00:56:50,they censured a Massachusetts bakery for listing love
00:56:50,00:56:53,as an ingredient of their granola.
00:56:53,00:56:56,"They said, ""Made with love,"" and they took them to court."
00:56:56,00:56:57,I think that's fair enough.
00:56:57,00:57:01,Me too. I hope they got life sentences.
00:57:01,00:57:03,Chuck a dog at them.
00:57:03,00:57:09,"So, just on baking, as well, in the 18th century in Turkey,"
00:57:09,00:57:13,"if you undersold your bread, you would get in trouble,"
00:57:13,00:57:14,and you might get hanged.
00:57:14,00:57:18,And that was common enough that if you were a master baker...
00:57:18,00:57:21,"I said master baker. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:57:21,00:57:25,"You might employ an assistant who got more wages,"
00:57:25,00:57:28,but they were the one who would take the fall if you got in trouble.
00:57:28,00:57:30,"Right. Tense, isn't it?"
00:57:30,00:57:31,"Yeah, would you take that job?"
00:57:31,00:57:33,Worthy extra money.
00:57:33,00:57:36,I'd be more concerned if I saw a master baker list love
00:57:36,00:57:38,as part of the ingredient.
00:57:38,00:57:48,"OK, that's it. That is all of our facts."
