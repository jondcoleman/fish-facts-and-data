00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,400
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,600
 Daniel Shriver is away this week.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,400
 I thought it was because his wife was having a baby,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,400
 but he's just sent an email saying,

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,900
 "Tell them it's something to do with, by brand new book, The Theory of Everything Else,

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,700
 available in all good bookshops."

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,400
 And I'm like, well, look, whatever reason he's away,

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,100
 we have a very exciting guest that is in his stead,

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,200
 and that is the wonderful comedian Angela Barnes.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,200
 You will have seen her on your televisions most notably on the TV show Mock the Week,

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,700
 but she does all sorts of other stuff.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,700
 I appeared on her radio show a couple of years ago

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,200
 and immediately knew that she would be perfect for fish.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,400
 She is the most inquisitive, interested person.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,300
 You're going to absolutely love her.

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,700
 And once you've heard the show, you are going to want to go and see her live in her upcoming tour,

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,400
 called Hot Mess, and tickets for that are currently available on her website,

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,300
 which is angelabarnescomedy.co.uk.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,700
 If you can't wait to see her live, then why not go and check out her podcast.

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,000
 It is called We Are History Podcast, which she does with John O'Farrell,

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,700
 and it is all about history.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,400
 It's really funny. It's really great.

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,300
 You've got to go and listen.

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,400
 It's available wherever you get your podcasts.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,900
 Anyway, Dan will be back next week.

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,400
 But in the meantime, on with the podcast.

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:45,800
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,600
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,000
 My name is Anna Tyshinski, and I am joined today by Andrew Hunter-Murray,

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,400
 James Hawkin, and our very special guest, Dan Schreiber Replacement,

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,000
 a hopefully permanent Angela Barnes.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,700
 Hello.

34
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,100
 Hello.

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,500
 Okay, once again, we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,400
 and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Angela.

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
 Okay, so I've always wanted to say this.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,700
 My fact this week is that in communist East Germany in the 1950s,

39
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,000
 the state came up with a sanctioned dance for their teenagers to do.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,900
 They were a bit worried about the influence of rock and roll from the West.

41
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,200
 Elvis Presley was doing his military service in West Germany.

42
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,000
 So they were picking up all the Elvis on their radios and their TVs.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,300
 Elvis sang while he was doing his service to me.

44
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,300
 Really loudly over the wall.

45
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,300
 And so they were all the youngsters, they were worried about their hip-fusting movements.

46
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,300
 And the state felt that dancing on your own was subversive, that you should dance in a couple.

47
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,000
 Yeah.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,100
 But when you did dance in a couple, you shouldn't be gyrating like Elvis.

49
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,700
 Fair enough.

50
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,400
 And what I know about teenagers is not very much.

51
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,100
 Right.

52
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,100
 Probably that they wouldn't necessarily do what the government told them are.

53
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,400
 Well, no.

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,500
 But it was the dance in question, the lipsy dance.

55
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,300
 The lipsy.

56
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,100
 It would have to be unbelievably good for teenagers to want to do it.

57
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,400
 It'd have to be Agadou.

58
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,800
 Was it Agadou?

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,100
 And was it Agadou?

60
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,200
 It definitely wasn't Agadou.

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,600
 What was it? Was it good? I haven't seen this dance.

62
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,800
 So it was two choreographers came up with the dance, Krista and Helmut Seifert.

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,700
 And they came up the steps and it was an East German composer called RenÃ© Dubianski who came up with the music.

64
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,000
 And it was basically it was a fast waltz.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,800
 So he merged two waltz beats into a six-four beat because there's nothing that teenagers like more than waltz.

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 A double waltz.

67
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,400
 And the idea was that they would dance together, but their hips wouldn't wiggle.

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,200
 So there's footage of it on YouTube and it just at first it looks like a normal sort of Latin-y kind of dance.

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,700
 And then you realize that their hips don't move.

70
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,300
 Weird.

71
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,500
 And it just looks old.

72
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,600
 It feels like a reverse Irish dance kind of.

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,300
 Is that not right?

74
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,700
 Is Irish dancing just hips moving but the rest of the world?

75
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,200
 It's just like the bottom half moving.

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,600
 Yeah, I suppose it is.

77
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,400
 No, it's not like that.

78
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,800
 Even Irish dance doesn't move your hips around much.

79
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,700
 I've taken Irish dancing classes in my time.

80
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,100
 Yeah, I can really picture that.

81
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,600
 Can you?

82
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,100
 It's a Michael flatly about you.

83
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,400
 Yeah, as a boy I learned some river dance.

84
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,300
 Actually, what we never noticed because we always record around the table is that you're always river dancing.

85
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,900
 Yep.

86
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,200
 I wonder why I kept getting bruised shins.

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,800
 The effort in the edit to remove the constant clackity-clack of me dancing away.

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,100
 I actually had a doctor say to me once, so I have something called periodic limb movement disorder which means in my sleep my legs flail.

89
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,900
 Oh, really?

90
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,500
 And I did a sleep study once at Guy's Hospital and in the official report he said two things.

91
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,500
 One was that my snoring was and I quote heroic, which I was very proud of.

92
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,100
 And the other was that like watching me sleep was like watching horizontal river dance.

93
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,900
 That's in my official.

94
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,900
 They really sound like compliments, both of those things.

95
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,300
 I know, right?

96
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,300
 That's pretty thoughtful.

97
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,800
 I was such a lucky man.

98
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,900
 Do you have to sort of have a mini sleeping bag for your legs alone or?

99
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,300
 Well, I don't think it can take.

100
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,200
 So whenever I have slept in a sleeping bag, I've woken up with it on the floor.

101
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,900
 You can't be contained.

102
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,200
 So I just can't be contained.

103
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,900
 The energy.

104
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,300
 If I could wire it up to the national grid in this energy crisis, we'd be all right.

105
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,200
 What were we talking about?

106
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,500
 Dancing.

107
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
 Dancing, yes.

108
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,600
 Dancing, yes.

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
 I didn't realise how what a threat Elvis was at the time.

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,300
 God, people went nuts over Elvis.

111
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,800
 They thought he was going to impregnate every woman on earth.

112
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,600
 Well, riots in East Germany in 1959 in in about 14 East German cities and towns.

113
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
 And they then had to be crackdowns.

114
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,500
 So Leipzig had a crackdown.

115
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,200
 Leipzig is where the Lipsy dance.

116
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,600
 The state one is from the Latin name for Cypsey.

117
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,200
 Yeah, and they sentenced 15 demonstrators to prison sentences of between six months

118
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,300
 and four and a half years for going to pro Elvis protests.

119
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,000
 Really?

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,600
 Yeah.

121
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
 But it was everywhere.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,400
 We shouldn't tar East Germany with this solitary brush.

123
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,600
 Rock 'n' Roll was sort of vilified in a way that I don't think any legitimate music ever has been.

124
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,100
 There's plenty of Americans that were frightened about the influence of Elvis as well.

125
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,400
 There was a state-sponsored Rock 'n' Roll festival in the US.

126
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,500
 In the US?

127
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,300
 Yeah, in America, which like hated Rock 'n' Roll as well.

128
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,900
 But it was called Vortex One.

129
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,800
 It sounds like the saddest thing ever, but Paranoia was quite popular.

130
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,600
 Do you remember the Festival of Brexit?

131
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,500
 Oh, no!

132
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,400
 This was like if that had been a success.

133
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,300
 Yeah, okay.

134
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,100
 This is that.

135
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
 It was in Oregon.

136
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:48,800
 And I'm surprised that the hippies agreed to go to it because it was basically because Nixon was going to visit Portland, Oregon in 1970, I believe.

137
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:57,100
 And this was obviously at a time of extreme anti-war protests and extreme government crackdowns on those protests in America.

138
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,200
 And there was a fear that the hippies would start protesting or the peace protest would start protesting.

139
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,700
 So to get rid of them, basically, the state government said, "Guys, do you want to give you a festival?"

140
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:13,300
 And they all went for it because they really wanted peace, but more than that, they wanted a rock festival where they had license to take drugs.

141
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,500
 Like the state was like, "Look, we'll turn a blind eye to all the drug-taking and the nudity."

142
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
 Just to get, sorry, is it just to get them out of town when Nixon's in town?

143
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
 Sounds like it.

144
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,000
 That's basically it.

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Sounds like a sitcom.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
 It does.

147
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,700
 Oh no, we've accidentally got them crossing paths.

148
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,200
 And he didn't even turn up in the end.

149
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
 No.

150
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
 So they just got a festival for nothing.

151
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
 That's amazing.

152
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
 It's awesome.

153
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,200
 So I've read a book we see about the Stasi Poetry Circle.

154
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
 Sounds fun.

155
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
 I know, right?

156
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,200
 Your work and leisure was really tied up in East Germany.

157
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,700
 So you would go on holiday with the people you were with.

158
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,700
 Sounds awful.

159
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,700
 And all your leisure activities were bound up with the company that you worked for and stuff.

160
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,200
 And it was the same with the Stasi.

161
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,700
 And so they would have these sort of art circles.

162
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,700
 And one of them, they had a poetry circle.

163
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,700
 But the guy who ran it, Uwe Berger, I think his name was, he wasn't a member of the party,

164
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,200
 but he was one of the hundreds of thousands of misarbiters they called.

165
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
 So these unofficial collaborators.

166
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
 The Stasi.

167
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,700
 So he would get all the poetry.

168
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,200
 These young Stasi officers would be writing their poetry in their poetry circle.

169
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,700
 And then he'd be looking for dissidents among them and feeding it back.

170
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,200
 And was he looking through the medium of the poetry?

171
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
 Yeah.

172
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,700
 Oh, so he was looking for maybe dissident users of meter or half rhymes.

173
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,700
 Or just anybody that basically wasn't socialist realism or showed any sort of freedom of thought.

174
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
 How interesting.

175
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,700
 Yeah.

176
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,700
 Because they did also, they infiltrated punk groups.

177
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,200
 They were very threatened by punk music when it came in in East Germany.

178
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
 And so the Stasi infiltrated.

179
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
 I feel threatened by that still.

180
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
 Sure.

181
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,700
 I mean, they infiltrated everybody.

182
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,200
 That's the thing about the Stasi.

183
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,700
 And they were the biggest administrators of any.

184
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,700
 So out of the whole of German history from the Middle Ages to World War Two, there were

185
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,200
 more written records kept in the 40 years of the German Democratic Republic than the

186
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
 rest of German history put together.

187
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
 Really?

188
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
 Yeah.

189
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
 But it's all bad poetry.

190
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
 It's mostly bad poetry.

191
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,700
 So when the war came down and then in January 1990, the people stormed the Stasi headquarters

192
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,200
 in Leipzig, a place called Rundert Ecke, the round corner, to their offices.

193
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,100
 And they rescued these sacks of, I think there's 15,500 sacks of shredded documents.

194
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,700
 And there's these people that are called the puzzlers.

195
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
 Who piece them back together?

196
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,700
 Who piece them back together.

197
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,700
 And they've been doing that since 1991.

198
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,700
 They're still doing it?

199
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
 They're still doing it.

200
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,900
 So there were millions of shredded bits of paper and it will take centuries to put them

201
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
 all back together.

202
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:44,600
 I just feel like, you know, you've got an old lady in Leipzig doing her little jigsaw.

203
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,620
 And then she gets a tap on the shoulder, "Mr. Schmidt, we have a job for you."

204
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,140
 You heard about the Schwartzer Canal.

205
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,740
 So in East Germany, they could pick up Western television because obviously it's not far

206
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,740
 away.

207
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,500
 But you could be arrested if your TV area was pointing west.

208
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,940
 So you had to be a bit careful.

209
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,620
 They eased off on that as time went on.

210
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,260
 But there were two East German channels and on one of them there was a program that was

211
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,100
 on every Monday night and it was called the Schwartzer Canal and what it was, it was 20

212
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:20,000
 minutes of clips of West German TV programs with a Communist commentary saying why they

213
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 were so bad.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Say why it was so bad.

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,360
 I'd watch programs that had a commentary over the top explaining why they were so bad.

216
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
 You should get on Twitter.

217
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,360
 It's just Gogglebox, isn't it?

218
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
 What you've described is basically...

219
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,360
 Yeah, it's like Gogglebox.

220
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:42,680
 There had been a program in West Germany called Die Horte Optik, which is the red viewpoints.

221
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,620
 So which was sort of slagging off what was happening in East Germany.

222
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,340
 So that was their sort of retort to that was the Black Channel.

223
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,900
 And also it's called the Black Channel because that was like a plumbing slang for a sewer.

224
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,900
 Oh, that's clever.

225
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,900
 Yeah, yeah.

226
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,280
 So it was like a little pun as well.

227
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
 Is the red...

228
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
 Die Rote...

229
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
 Do you call it?

230
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
 Die Rote Optik.

231
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
 The red viewpoint.

232
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,840
 Is that a joke on Rose Tinted Spectacles?

233
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,920
 Like, oh, in the East, they're all seeing, you know, they're probably not.

234
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,560
 Do you think they came up with the titles before the concepts and all things like this?

235
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,760
 You know, the BBC had studios in nuclear bunkers in the Cold War.

236
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,600
 So I mean, I'll have to reign it in because I could go on forever about nuclear bunkers.

237
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
 That's my little obsession.

238
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,520
 But in the regional seats of government, nuclear bunkers, of which there were 12 in the Cold

239
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:36,520
 War period in Britain, they were for politicians for offices of state and things like that.

240
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,480
 And each of them would have a BBC studio inside.

241
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
 Really?

242
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
 Yeah.

243
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
 So you can visit the one at...

244
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,720
 There's one at Kelverton Hatch in Essex, which is open to the public, one at Hack Green

245
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,840
 in Cheshire, which is, and you can see the BBC studio in there.

246
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,120
 And they have, in Kelverton Hatch, I think they have playing the actual BBC broadcast

247
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
 that would have been...

248
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
 Cool.

249
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
 Playing the hats.

250
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,040
 You know, so when you kind of go to the nuclear bunker, like all your politicians go there

251
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,040
 or whatever, all your important people, would they have had to take a BBC sound engineer

252
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,700
 with them because it's going to be quite echoey in those places.

253
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
 Yeah, yeah.

254
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,480
 So you had a BBC sound engineer and presenters, like heating engineers and, you know, electrical

255
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,280
 engineers and various different specialties would need to be in this bunker to keep it

256
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
 maintained.

257
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
 How interesting.

258
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,120
 So if you were selected, you'd sign the official secret tax, you wouldn't tell anyone.

259
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,760
 That's so funny because obviously I'm sure you know a lot of BBC sound engineers like

260
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
 I do.

261
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
 Well.

262
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,000
 And I just, yeah, I wonder if they all got this job thinking, well, if it all goes

263
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,640
 south, at least we can...

264
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,960
 But these days, if that happened, do you think there'd be any room in the bunker for podcasters?

265
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,240
 Well, I know, I'm not sure how much of this I'm allowed to say because I...

266
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,960
 Oh my God, you're on the list.

267
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
 You're on the list.

268
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
 Yeah.

269
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
 I'm not on the list.

270
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
 I promise I'm not on the list.

271
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
 But I do know that they still do...

272
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,200
 You were until not the week finish.

273
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
 Yeah.

274
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,560
 I do know that they still do drills and that they still take a BBC presenter.

275
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,240
 Which BBC presenter would you take to your nuclear bunker?

276
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
 BBC.

277
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
 It has to be BBC.

278
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
 Yeah.

279
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,800
 I'd probably go for Hugh Edwards.

280
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
 Would you?

281
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,560
 I just want stability and continuity and he provides it.

282
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
 That's interesting.

283
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,960
 I was thinking, does Dion Dublin do houses under the hammer or something?

284
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
 Yeah.

285
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
 He could do a great guide to the bunker, couldn't he?

286
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
 Yeah.

287
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
 To improve your bunker.

288
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,800
 But here, that's a solid wall.

289
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
 That's not...

290
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
 Yeah, that's a solid wall too.

291
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,440
 Lots of solid walls in here, very few partition walls.

292
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,080
 I've got one fact about Agadu, just because Angela mentioned it earlier.

293
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,400
 So the singer of Agadu...

294
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
 Black lace.

295
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
 Black lace, right?

296
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
 You're right.

297
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
 And the guy is Dean Michael.

298
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
 So he was sent to prison in 2016.

299
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
 What was he?

300
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
 Not for the dance.

301
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
 And not for the usual...

302
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 He was pushing pineapples, wasn't he?

303
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
 Shaking trees.

304
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
 Brandy coffee.

305
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,400
 It was for benefits fraud.

306
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,560
 It doesn't come up in the song anywhere.

307
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
 But he was in for 10 weeks.

308
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,600
 He claimed he couldn't walk but then he was also doing gigs on stage where he was dancing

309
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
 very vigorously.

310
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,680
 I know, we got put away for 10 weeks and anyway, he says, after he came out, he said that

311
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:12,680
 while he was in prison, he got through the tough times by leading a giant conga of prisoners.

312
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,280
 That's how they all escaped, isn't it?

313
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
 That's so funny.

314
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:25,000
 At night, the entire wing was singing in chorus, "Aggadu, dude."

315
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,240
 I sort of missed those days when dances had really clear instructions.

316
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,160
 I'm not one of nature's dancers.

317
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,720
 So when they tell me what to do, that superman that was that place as well, wasn't it?

318
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
 I knew what to do then.

319
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,000
 That was why we all loved the Macarena.

320
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Exactly.

321
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,400
 You knew what to do.

322
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,000
 There was a movie in 1984 which I'm sure you all know called Footloose.

323
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,320
 And it's a story of a teenager who goes to a small town where dancing has been banned

324
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,340
 by the local government, so that's why I'm talking about that.

325
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,440
 One of the people who was in this movie was the actor Kevin Bacon.

326
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,200
 He was 24 at the time, but to get himself into the role, he enrolled into a local high

327
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:12,000
 school pretending to be a 17-year-old, isn't that amazing?

328
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Wow.

329
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,560
 Was he rumbled?

330
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
 He was not rumbled.

331
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,820
 How old was he at the time, sorry?

332
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,200
 He was 24 and he was pretending to be 17.

333
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,240
 The principal apparently knew about it, but no one else knew about it at all.

334
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
 Oh my God.

335
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,040
 And he fell in love with Drew Barrymore at the end.

336
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,440
 Well, the amazing thing is he got really badly bullied.

337
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
 Really?

338
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,520
 He went to the school and he thought, like, his character was that he'd come from the

339
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,720
 city and he was in like a small town school, and so he was wearing clothes that he imagined

340
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,280
 a 17-year-old would wear if they'd come from, you know, Philadelphia and gone into a school.

341
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,160
 Obviously, he looked very different than all the other kids and so they just really, really

342
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,320
 bullied him quite badly until one of the kids kind of came and sort of took him under his

343
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,720
 wing and apparently that's kind of something that happens in the movie, although I haven't

344
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,880
 seen it, so I don't know.

345
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,720
 I don't believe that Never Been Kiss was not just entirely based on this story.

346
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,960
 I mean, that is the whole plot.

347
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
 Is it?

348
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
 I don't know.

349
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
 Is Never Been Kiss someone goes back into a school?

350
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
 Guys, Drew Barrymore.

351
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
 She's about 24.

352
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
 She's a reporter.

353
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,320
 She disguises herself as 17-year-old to go back into a school where she gets badly bullied

354
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,200
 until someone takes her under their wing.

355
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,120
 Was it laid after 1984?

356
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
 It certainly was, yeah.

357
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
 Oh, yeah.

358
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
 It's 21 Jump Street.

359
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
 That's that as well, isn't it?

360
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
 Is it 21 Jump Street?

361
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
 Yeah, they do that.

362
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
 Cops go back to school.

363
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,320
 All I know is, is that the one where there's a meme where he goes, "How do you do fellow

364
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
 kids?"

365
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
 It's what, is that?

366
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
 Is that really what the meme?

367
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 I only know the meme.

368
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
 The meme must come from that.

369
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,360
 And very weirdly, I've got something about banned or official dancers in the USA.

370
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
 Okay.

371
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,320
 So, and it relates to Hollywood as well.

372
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
 Right.

373
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,880
 So, the four U.S. states have passed laws designating square dancing the official state

374
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
 folk dance.

375
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
 Right?

376
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
 I thought you were going to say it was banned.

377
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
 No, no, no.

378
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
 Far from it.

379
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
 Far from it.

380
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,360
 There have been so many attempts to make square dancing the national folk dance.

381
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,760
 And people keep saying at the national level, "Look, this is not really a national thing.

382
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,320
 We don't, you know, there's lots going on.

383
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
 We don't care."

384
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
 So, there are other ones.

385
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,440
 So, like, Hawaii has the hula, obviously.

386
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,120
 Kentucky has clogging.

387
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,480
 It didn't look into you very much.

388
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,000
 Because North Carolina has the Carolina Shag and that's the official dance.

389
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,160
 And there is a 1989 movie starring Bridget Fonda, which is simply called Shag.

390
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,840
 And it's about four high school students on a road trip.

391
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,040
 I was really disappointed when I went to the movie.

392
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,800
 I was expecting a documentary about carpets and I went as a bird lover.

393
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,600
 It culminates in a shagging contest, basically.

394
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
 Shag dancing contest.

395
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
 Is the dance anything like a shag?

396
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
 I mean, dance though.

397
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,280
 It depends how you do it.

398
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,360
 Any dance can be, can't it?

399
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:01,000
 OK, it's time for fact number two and that is Andes.

400
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,840
 My fact is that in the 7th century, one of the most impressive things you could be buried

401
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,800
 with was a folding chair.

402
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,280
 That was hot, hot stuff.

403
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,520
 Is that because they were from the future, when you had a time machine?

404
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,800
 It was not because of that, but that was...

405
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,720
 Usually it's like things that you were buried with as for use in the afterlife.

406
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,760
 Maybe, you know, might want to now sit down.

407
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
 Always.

408
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,400
 Well, the woman they was found with was in a, they think was in her 40s or 50s.

409
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,880
 And as a woman in her 40s, I could relate to carrying a chair around.

410
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,360
 Where are you going?

411
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,000
 Yeah, this is the thing.

412
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,280
 They're normally found in women's graves, the kind of grave goods.

413
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,600
 And about 30 medieval gravesites have been found with chair burials, as they call them.

414
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
 This latest one, it's quite a recent find.

415
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,520
 It dates back to about 600 AD.

416
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,200
 And it's kind of, it might not be that they were very, very powerful, wealthy people in

417
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
 life.

418
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,160
 It's kind of because they're often buried with lots of humble grave goods as well.

419
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,640
 But they seem to be kind of spiritually significant.

420
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
 Oh, really?

421
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
 They're having a folding chair.

422
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
 It seems, yeah.

423
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
 Like a wise woman kind of thing.

424
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
 Exactly.

425
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
 A healer or a magician.

426
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
 I think, I've misunderstood.

427
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,080
 So they were buried sat on the chair?

428
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,960
 No, I think the chair was just included.

429
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,920
 It was just included, like, as their favorite chair.

430
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,200
 I wouldn't have the image of it, I'm lowered on a chair.

431
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
 No.

432
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,160
 There's an archaeologist called Bettina Pfaff.

433
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,600
 And who, she thinks that these women, it's mostly women, belong to a kind of spiritual

434
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
 elite.

435
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
 How interesting.

436
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
 Yeah.

437
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,160
 So in life, they would sit on the chair whilst reading someone's palm or something, presumably.

438
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,160
 Maybe, yeah, or leading a ceremony or something, and they were buried with it.

439
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
 Yeah.

440
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,160
 Cool.

441
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
 And where was this?

442
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
 In Europe?

443
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
 Across lots of Europe, yeah.

444
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
 Germany, especially, I think.

445
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
 Quite a lot in Germany.

446
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
 Oh, really?

447
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
 Yeah.

448
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
 Yeah, big deal.

449
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,640
 So I did a series called "You Can't Take It With You" on Radio 4, which is about, it started

450
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,440
 off being about when my dad died, we went a bit mad putting stuff in the coffin to the

451
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,720
 point we thought we might have to take him out.

452
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,640
 Just filled it up with stuff.

453
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,560
 And so I got really into sort of reading about grave goods a bit, and one of my favorite

454
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,680
 things I found was a website where you can buy a coffin with drawers in so that you can

455
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,600
 put the goods for the person in the drawers.

456
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,040
 And my favorite line on this website says, "If you do choose to bury the deceased with

457
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,320
 some personal items, it's important to remember that these are items you will not get back."

458
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
 That is useful.

459
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,080
 He's putting their car keys in there.

460
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
 Wow.

461
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
 That's amazing.

462
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,840
 I didn't even think that was like a modern thing to put grave goods in.

463
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
 No.

464
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,200
 The drawers at the bottom, sort of under the body, are they?

465
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
 Yeah.

466
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,440
 I think it's a bit cruel, because if they do go to an afterlife, have they got access

467
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
 to those drawers?

468
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,160
 Yeah, because they're all, I've got my favorite things, but I can't get them.

469
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,280
 I think it started with when my dad died, he had his head was on this sort of lacy pillow.

470
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
 It just wasn't right.

471
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,640
 My dad ran a sex shop for a living.

472
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
 It didn't look right.

473
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,920
 It sounds like it could fit by running to a sex shop.

474
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,560
 His girlfriend replaced it with some inflatable breasts.

475
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
 Wow.

476
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
 That is brilliant.

477
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,960
 Imagine the archeologists in such a place.

478
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,760
 I love imagining that.

479
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,040
 And they'll jump to such conclusions about our entire society.

480
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,320
 He thinks it's sex wizard, we think.

481
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,080
 Well, actually, he was cremated, so, and that's the other thing.

482
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,720
 So I started asking people, A, about what they would want buried with them, and B, what

483
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,040
 they would put in my coffin, because I just thought you don't get a say, do you, at that

484
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
 point?

485
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,160
 Someone else is deciding what you want to say with you.

486
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,840
 And of course, most people I spoke to were going to be cremated, and so everyone would

487
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
 say popcorn kernels.

488
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,120
 So I'm going to build my coffin with.

489
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
 That's fun.

490
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
 That's fun.

491
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
 A little fireworks.

492
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,200
 Yeah, fireworks or cannabis, something just to make it a bit more fun.

493
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,760
 So yeah, chairs, folding chairs that go back a long way, which makes sense, actually.

494
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:55,640
 There's a book on chairs by a guy called Rittold Rybsinski, and I always come back to this

495
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
 in my research.

496
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,640
 It's such a good book, but he says he thinks the oldest chairs ever will have been folding.

497
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,080
 It's a cracker, I'm telling you.

498
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,680
 I disagree with Mr. Rybsinski or whatever he was called.

499
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,080
 You don't think the oldest chairs are folding?

500
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,800
 I don't really, because I think the oldest chair would be literally just a box.

501
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,080
 And I think it requires something extra to.

502
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,480
 I think once you've made it into, once you've used some human skill rather than just sitting

503
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,280
 on a flat rock and claiming it's a chair, because it would be nomadic societies.

504
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,920
 So I think the oldest evidence of folding chairs we have might be ancient Mongolian

505
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,600
 societies who were nomadic.

506
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,560
 So the important people would take a chair with them.

507
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
 And that's.

508
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
 That's great.

509
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,600
 And they looked exactly like those beach chairs that you get, you know, the old people sitting

510
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
 on beaches.

511
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,840
 There are eight folding stools in the British Museum.

512
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
 Wow.

513
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
 Wow.

514
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 And the earliest one is.

515
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
 What for just people to sit in.

516
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,040
 Such a good point, because they have those people who sit and make sure you don't steal

517
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
 anything.

518
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
 Don't you?

519
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
 And they sit on little stools.

520
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
 Also very old, those people.

521
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
 A lot of the time.

522
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:03,880
 The oldest one they have is from the 18th Dynasty of Egypt, which is 1500 BC to 1800

523
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
 BC.

524
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
 So that's pretty old.

525
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
 Wow.

526
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
 And how, what do they look like?

527
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,400
 How easily foldable are they?

528
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,480
 They just look like an X with a pivot in where the two lines of the X meet and then a little

529
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,920
 bit of cloth on the top, although the cloth is rotted away because that's.

530
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
 Yeah.

531
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,920
 Perished.

532
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,320
 So easier than a beach deck chair, which I still can't do.

533
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
 No.

534
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,760
 Stripey beach deck chairs are just there to torment me.

535
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
 They're a struggle.

536
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
 It's like a Brompton.

537
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
 Your fingers won't survive.

538
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,280
 Um, lots of folding chairs are big for lots of people.

539
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,880
 So I mean, James, you mentioned the Egyptian ones.

540
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,880
 Tutankhamun had one.

541
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,160
 Tutankhamun had a couple in this tomb, I think.

542
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,960
 One was Ebony and Ivory.

543
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
 Pretty cool.

544
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,280
 Bishops had a folding chair in medieval times.

545
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
 That was a huge deal.

546
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,040
 And, um, there was a thing called the Cathedral, which is the bishop's official throne.

547
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,560
 But if you were traveling around your diocese or whatever it was, you'd have to have a

548
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
 traveling.

549
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
 A travel phone.

550
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
 A travel phone.

551
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
 Pretty much.

552
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
 That's amazing.

553
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
 A traveling cathedral.

554
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
 Yeah, yeah.

555
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
 Travel through.

556
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,040
 Speaking of religion and chairs, not a folding chair as such, but is it a myth, the papal

557
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,680
 chair, the hole in the papal chair?

558
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
 That is a myth.

559
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
 That is a myth.

560
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
 The hole.

561
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,800
 So the whole Pope Joan thing, isn't it?

562
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,360
 Like, Pope Joan, the supposed ninth century lady pope who probably didn't exist.

563
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,480
 And that they then, the papal chair, had a hole in it so that their genitalia could

564
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,040
 be inspected from beneath to check they weren't a woman.

565
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
 And then they'd shout.

566
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,920
 There'd be some cry when they're like, he's got knackers in Latin, and then we can continue

567
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,240
 with the Catholic Church.

568
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,440
 It's like, yeah, I think that definitely is a myth.

569
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
 It's a myth.

570
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
 Yeah, yeah.

571
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,240
 And that's what happened these days for real.

572
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,320
 I was, there seemed to be a spate of people getting their testicles trapped in folding

573
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
 chair.

574
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
 Oh God.

575
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,080
 I didn't even have some of my eyes watered.

576
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,000
 I didn't read about any popes doing it, maybe those just didn't make the news.

577
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 It's so common.

578
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,360
 Well, I looked, I thought, I think I was just looking at the chair accidents.

579
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,520
 And I came across like a just a 60-something year old man in 2018 who was sitting in his

580
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,920
 folding chair, which had little slats before we got to the shower.

581
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,560
 And they fell through and couldn't get them out, had to have the fibregaine come.

582
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,600
 His testicles is that because they do, they do hang lower in older men, don't they?

583
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
 Where?

584
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,080
 It's interesting you say that because all the stories I found, which were then, I think

585
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,360
 I found five different stories, they were all older men.

586
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,600
 The rubber perishes as time goes on, and there's a certain.

587
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
 Like a worn out slinky.

588
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,160
 Yeah, there's more given system.

589
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
 Yeah, it's tough.

590
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,560
 There are some great photos there if you want to look at them.

591
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,440
 What are the photos of?

592
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,120
 It's mostly like there's a man lying on a stretcher, but he's obviously still sitting

593
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,120
 on the chair.

594
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,360
 Actually, if you go to Blackpool, you know those cutouts where you can put your head

595
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
 in.

596
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
 There's one of those.

597
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,400
 A dangling pair of testicles stuck through a deck chair.

598
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,240
 They have to have the fibregaine on hand at all times.

599
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,920
 Because it's scary when the fibregaine turn up, because they've got things like angle

600
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,840
 grinders and they've got all sorts of big kit, haven't they?

601
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,080
 It doesn't really go for the fibregaine, I would have thought.

602
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,800
 It goes for a delicate.

603
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 Surgeon.

604
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 A massaging.

605
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
 Yeah.

606
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
 Some oils.

607
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,040
 They have to cut the chairs.

608
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,000
 I think there's sometimes no mass and level of massaging you can do, which is a bit frightening.

609
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Yeah.

610
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,960
 And I have to say I respected the fire, it was firemen, two firemen so much in one photo

611
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,960
 I saw who had such grave looks on their faces, which I imagine took a huge amount of effort

612
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,240
 to try to free some of those testicles from a chair.

613
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,160
 We used to call it, so I used to be a nurse and you'd call it the nurses mask or the,

614
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,280
 and I think firemen had the same thing.

615
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,880
 Because sometimes you'd see things that were funny or that were horrific and you can't,

616
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,800
 you know, you can't take a bandage off and go, oh my God, you know, you have to just

617
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,880
 sort of maintain this kind of nurses mask and they call it, yeah.

618
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,840
 Is it a sort of a creepy grin?

619
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
 Amazing.

620
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,920
 Do you know who the first person to use the word deck chair was?

621
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,280
 We're going to say invented the word deck chair, but famous person, famous person.

622
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
 So it's gettable.

623
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
 Oh, no.

624
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,480
 I'd be astonished if you guys use the word deck chair.

625
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
 Give us a century.

626
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,480
 1880s, author of a children's book, often ran a service car.

627
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
 Oh, Louis Carlsson.

628
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
 No, that's not 1880s.

629
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
 1880s.

630
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,840
 Oh, Kenneth Graham, who wrote The Wind and the Willows.

631
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
 All good one, but no.

632
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
 British?

633
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
 British, yeah.

634
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,840
 British children's of the 1880s.

635
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
 1880s.

636
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
 It's tough.

637
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
 Robert Louis Stevenson.

638
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
 No.

639
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,840
 You like it because you wrote the pirate books?

640
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
 Yeah, yeah.

641
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
 Think of that surname.

642
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
 Stevenson.

643
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,400
 I think of what else Stevenson's are related to.

644
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,840
 That's Stevenson's rocket was the first train.

645
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
 Oh, Nesbit.

646
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
 Oh, Nesbit.

647
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,840
 Yeah, yeah, I wrote my place.

648
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
 That was good.

649
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
 That was stunningly good.

650
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,840
 Ian Nesbit, who wrote The Railway Children, deck chair was first used in that book.

651
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
 Also, great clue giving from Stevenson.

652
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
 Yeah, that was.

653
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
 It was a great throw and a great catch.

654
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
 I enjoyed that very much.

655
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
 It was good part of the audience.

656
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
 On either side.

657
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,840
 Some other words invented by Ian Nesbit in the OED.

658
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,840
 Brecky, snarky and zooming.

659
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
 Wow.

660
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,840
 Zooming as in moving around quickly.

661
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,840
 My dog gets the zoomies.

662
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

663
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
 Zooming, yeah.

664
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
 Wait, what does the dog do?

665
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
 It's called a zoomie.

666
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,840
 Yeah, she gets some zoomie.

667
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
 Of course, my mum.

668
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,840
 You know, when dogs just get really hyper excited, they just run about.

669
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
 They call it the zoomies.

670
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
 Is that what the zoomies is?

671
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
 Yeah.

672
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
 I thought the zoomies was a drug thing.

673
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,840
 It might also be that.

674
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,840
 It's drug paraphernalia, your honour.

675
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,840
 Wow.

676
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,840
 Do they ban the deck chairs on Bournemouth Beach?

677
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
 I think it was last year.

678
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,840
 There was, so, oh, they stopped renting them out.

679
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
 You didn't get a rescue if you bought your own deck chair.

680
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,840
 Wouldn't immediate climb down from a promising little hill.

681
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
 It's a molehill now.

682
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
 It was a government thing, or a council thing.

683
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
 It was a council thing.

684
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

685
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,840
 Because they were afraid they were going to be used as weapons.

686
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
 Really?

687
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
 I couldn't really find any evidence that they have been used as weapons.

688
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,840
 It feels like a pretext, doesn't it?

689
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
 It does, but for what, why?

690
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
 Why didn't they want to rent them out?

691
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
 It lost the council about 200 grand that year.

692
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
 Really?

693
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,840
 How would they think that you'd go around and sort of snap old men's testicles on them?

694
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,840
 I suppose chairs as weapons is, like, every time there's any sort of football violence, whatever,

695
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,840
 it's always plastic chairs being thrown around, isn't it?

696
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
 Oh, it's plastic one.

697
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
 And in wrestling, of course, they have the steel chair,

698
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
 but it's very rarely the deck chair.

699
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
 He's getting out the deck chair.

700
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
 Oh, he's still getting it out.

701
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
 He wants it out.

702
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,840
 You're in trouble.

703
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,840
 You talked about Bournemouth, Anna, I think.

704
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,840
 There was an article in 2021 in the Telegraph about deck chairs in Scarborough.

705
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,840
 This was a 58-year-old woman called Dawn Avison,

706
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,840
 who runs the last remaining deck chair concession in Scarborough.

707
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,840
 She's got what they described as a deep mahogany tan,

708
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,840
 and apparently locally it's known as Scarborough Rust,

709
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,840
 which is if you work on the beach.

710
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
 That's your tan that you have.

711
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,840
 And she said that last summer,

712
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
 former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson

713
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,840
 sat down on one of her deck chairs for a selfie

714
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
 and then left without paying.

715
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
 What?

716
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,840
 And now he's a minister without portfolio,

717
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
 so I think that just says, you know...

718
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
 Wow.

719
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
 He's a man who I genuinely don't think could put up a deck chair.

720
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
 Gavin Williamson, no.

721
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,840
 I don't think any of them could, because they're the current cabinet.

722
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
 Can I tell you one bit of folding chair news?

723
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
 Yeah.

724
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,840
 Are you guys familiar with Sidney Jo, the 27-year-old tiktoker?

725
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
 Of course.

726
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
 There you go.

727
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
 I knew you would be...

728
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
 27-year-old tiktoker.

729
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,840
 I don't know anything about tiktok, but that feels old.

730
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,840
 Well, she's appealing to the youth.

731
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,840
 So she got stuck in a folding chair,

732
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
 which is kind of amazing.

733
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
 There's a picture and she's looking at her body

734
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
 through the middle of it, it's folded around her,

735
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,840
 and she had to be removed by the fire brigade.

736
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
 I think this was last year,

737
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
 and they used jaws of life,

738
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
 the hydraulic things that you used

739
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,840
 to extract people from crashed cars and stuff,

740
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
 which sounds quite frightening.

741
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
 And the reason that she'd got stuck

742
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,840
 is because she has a $199 per minute channel

743
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,840
 where she gets stuck in things and then frees herself,

744
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
 and it went wrong.

745
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,840
 Oh, what do you mean?

746
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,840
 It's like people pay to watch their escape from stuff.

747
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,840
 Yes, I think we're all asking, is this a sex thing?

748
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
 Yeah, yeah.

749
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,840
 Look, it says it's a fetish channel.

750
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
 That sounds like sex.

751
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
 I'm not down with all the lingo,

752
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
 but I think that is a sex thing.

753
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,840
 God, the poor, bloody fire brigade in her local area.

754
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
 Hello, it's me.

755
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
 This is me again.

756
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
 Yes.

757
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
 No, a washing machine this time, yeah.

758
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:51,840
 Okay, it's time for fact number three,

759
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
 and that is my fact.

760
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,840
 This week is that most people dislike kale

761
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,840
 before they're even born.

762
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,840
 That's how long lasting the loathing is.

763
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
 This is this weird thing that came out recently,

764
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
 and it's quite a small study,

765
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,840
 but it looked at ultrasound scans in 70,

766
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,840
 about 70 pregnant women in the late in the third trimester,

767
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,840
 and then they got the pregnant women to take capsules

768
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,840
 of either powdered kale or powdered carrot or nothing.

769
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,840
 And then they looked at what the fetuses were doing,

770
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,840
 and the fetuses made the facial expressions

771
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
 that, well, when they had the kale,

772
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
 they made the facial expression they make when they cry.

773
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,840
 An unmistakable kind of wint of displeasure.

774
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
 I mean, we're not 100%,

775
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,840
 and that's what a fetus means when it makes that face,

776
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
 but come on.

777
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
 It feels like ethical issues here, right?

778
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
 If you're making your fetus unhappy, making it cry.

779
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
 You're right.

780
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
 The ethical issues with feeding people kale,

781
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,840
 that's every parent who makes their kid eat vegetables.

782
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
 So at what point is the baby crying?

783
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
 Because obviously the mother's eating the, takes the capsule,

784
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
 so they're waiting for it to,

785
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
 how do they know that that, at that point,

786
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
 that the baby's receiving the kale?

787
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,840
 I think it was, they waited 20 minutes,

788
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
 and I think by that point,

789
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
 whatever you've eaten has filtered through

790
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
 to the amniotic fluid, whatever it is.

791
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,840
 So the flavor, they know the chemical is in there at that point.

792
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
 Right.

793
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
 And they can compare it to the people who've had the carrot

794
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
 or the nothing and see at an exact moment

795
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
 when their expression changes.

796
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,840
 But it might be a benevolent thing, actually,

797
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,840
 because if theoretically you eat lots of kale in pregnancy,

798
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,840
 you might then be able to stop your child hating kale

799
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,840
 in outside pregnancy, in childhood.

800
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,840
 I think that works.

801
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
 That does work a bit, I think.

802
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,840
 It's possible that you can prevent fussy eating, basically,

803
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,840
 by just exposing the child to as many flavors as possible early on.

804
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
 Right.

805
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
 It's a bit less unfamiliar later on

806
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,840
 when you're giving them whatever for the first time.

807
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
 Obviously the problem being that you'll feel so ill

808
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,840
 for most of your pregnancy that you will only eat bread and biscuit.

809
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,840
 Okay, I think my mum must have mostly eaten refined sugar jelly.

810
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
 But they actually like the carrots,

811
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
 which I find quite surprising.

812
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,840
 I know carrots are sweet, everyone always says,

813
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
 but they're no whisper bar, are they?

814
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,840
 If you've never had a whisper bar,

815
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840
 if all you've got to compare it to is kale,

816
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
 then carrots are pretty good.

817
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
 You're absolutely right.

818
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
 Yeah, they did a little sort of smile,

819
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
 sort of fetus equivalent of a smile

820
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,840
 when they tasted the carrot twice as often

821
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,840
 as when they tasted nothing.

822
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
 I wonder if that's because the carrots help them see

823
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,840
 in the dark and then it's like, "Oh, I can see where I am!"

824
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,840
 Oh, and it's gross.

825
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
 But yeah, it is...

826
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
 I don't think kale's that bad.

827
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
 I think I can't taste bitterness as much as some people.

828
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
 It's all right.

829
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,840
 I had some in research for this podcast

830
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,840
 when I knew we were going to be talking about kale.

831
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,840
 I went and had a sort of salad and...

832
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
 Then as in you searched out the kale,

833
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
 because I don't have kale in the house anyway.

834
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
 Right, so I never do.

835
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
 No, no, no.

836
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,840
 I went to a cafe.

837
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,840
 I was like, "I'll have that kale salad, please."

838
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
 I was pleasantly surprised.

839
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
 I thought it was horrible and I don't mind it.

840
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
 I feel like kale was only invented

841
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
 sort of about 10 years ago.

842
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
 I wasn't eating kale in my childhood.

843
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
 I was eating cabbage.

844
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
 It was pretty much 2012 when it kicked off,

845
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
 2011, 2012.

846
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
 And before that, literally no one ate it.

847
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,840
 I think kale was invented in 1976.

848
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
 This was...

849
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,840
 It was the year I was invented.

850
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,840
 You had a twin, kale.

851
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
 This was...

852
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
 I didn't eat it in the womb.

853
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
 Unlike my other twin.

854
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,840
 This was New York Times food critic Mimi Sheraton.

855
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840
 In fact, she was the first female restaurant critic

856
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
 at the New York Times.

857
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
 And she wrote about how great kale was.

858
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
 And at that time, literally no one ate kale

859
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
 in the United States,

860
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
 but she helped to make it popular.

861
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
 But they interviewed her a couple of years ago

862
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,840
 and she said she really regrets now making kale popular.

863
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
 She says...

864
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,840
 Well, she says she read through the article

865
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,840
 and she realizes that in those days she liked kale

866
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
 because it was cooked properly.

867
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
 And in these days, people serve it raw.

868
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,840
 They kind of roast it like I often have roasted kale,

869
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
 which is, you know, it does taste quite burnt

870
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
 and not the way I cook anyway.

871
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,840
 Do you make kale crisps?

872
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
 I've tried so many times to do that.

873
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
 And every time I went up, we just burnt kale.

874
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840
 I think that's just how it's meant to be.

875
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
 You've just been confused by the word crisps and the fact that...

876
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
 Right.

877
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
 I thought it was going to come out like golden wonder.

878
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
 All the recipes claim it's heaven.

879
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
 It's kind of okay.

880
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,840
 But Mimi Sheraton says if you eat it like you're supposed to eat it,

881
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
 which is like a winter vegetable,

882
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
 like you might have cabbage or something like that,

883
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
 quite often boiled or stewed or stuff like that,

884
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
 then it's really delicious.

885
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
 But these days, the way that people cook it is wrong

886
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
 and she feels quite responsible for that.

887
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
 That's so interesting.

888
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840
 That is the one thing I think my Nan might have got it right,

889
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
 that you do have to boil it for three days.

890
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
 Yeah.

891
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,840
 Oh, well, do you know what you're supposed to do

892
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,840
 if you don't have three days?

893
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
 You're supposed to massage it.

894
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,840
 Which I did not know.

895
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,840
 And this completely transforms kale.

896
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,840
 A, it stops it making you fart.

897
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,840
 And B, it stops it tasting bitter.

898
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,840
 And this is if you...

899
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,840
 Before you do anything to it, you just give it...

900
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,840
 If you massage it with a whisper bar.

901
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,840
 No, it's because it has a lot of sugars that don't get broken down

902
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840
 until they're waved through your digestive system

903
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
 and your large intestine.

904
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
 So A, then that gives you lots of bad gas.

905
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,840
 B, that means that on the way through, you're not tasting those sugars

906
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
 and so it tastes bitter.

907
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,840
 But if you massage, and I meant to try this,

908
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,840
 but I didn't do the first time research,

909
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
 but I'm sure people will write in.

910
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
 But yeah, if you squeeze it properly,

911
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,840
 just like you're rubbing it in before you cook it,

912
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,840
 then it tastes much sweeter and much nicer.

913
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
 So not with oil or anything, just with...

914
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
 With your fingers, yeah.

915
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
 I mean, I'm giving it a full-on massage.

916
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
 Like some candles, yeah.

917
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
 It's romantic music on.

918
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,840
 I've got to say, I also thought it had been invented in 2012

919
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,840
 and I didn't realise it was really huge in previous centuries,

920
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,840
 especially in Scotland.

921
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
 And I didn't know this at all.

922
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,840
 And it was because it can grow for a start

923
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,840
 in quite tough Northern climates, which is a good thing.

924
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,840
 And also it grows over the January to April period,

925
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
 which got called the Hungry Gap,

926
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,840
 which is where lots of previous crops might be running a bit low.

927
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,840
 And so it's a very useful staple food.

928
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,840
 And it's all this Scots dialect about kale.

929
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,840
 All these words, like a kale bell is a dinner bell.

930
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,840
 Kale was used interchangeably with food,

931
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,840
 as in kale might just mean food.

932
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,840
 And there were sayings as well.

933
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,840
 Have you heard called kale het again?

934
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840
 Called kale het again.

935
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,840
 No, what does that mean?

936
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840
 Cold kale heated up again.

937
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
 Oh, it's that simple.

938
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
 What does that mean as a say?

939
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840
 Oh, I see.

940
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
 It means that he's washed up.

941
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,840
 Yeah, later in life, it's a comeback almost.

942
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,840
 That's nice. That's much more positive than the real meaning,

943
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,840
 which is that I've heard this story dozens of times before.

944
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
 This is called kale het again.

945
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,840
 Oh, God, that's useful.

946
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,840
 Start using that constant.

947
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
 A lot of my relations.

948
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,840
 I'll give him his kale through the reek.

949
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,840
 Through the reek. What is a reek?

950
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,840
 Through the reek.

951
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
 The old reek he is Edinburgh.

952
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,840
 Through the nose, through the nose.

953
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,840
 Yeah, because reek means smell.

954
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,840
 It means what you say when someone farts.

955
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,840
 As if someone's farts in the room, you don't know who it is,

956
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,840
 and you're like, "Oh, I'll give some more kale through the reek."

957
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
 All lovely guesses.

958
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,840
 So reek is smoke.

959
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,840
 And basically, I'll give him his kale through the reek.

960
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
 It means I'm going to treat someone badly.

961
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,840
 I'm going to hand you your kale for dinner through the smoke of the fire,

962
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
 so it tastes gross.

963
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,840
 Oh, so it's roasted instead of massaged.

964
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,840
 Exactly, yeah, yeah.

965
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,840
 The word for garden was kale yard, really, wasn't it?

966
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,840
 For a small vegetable garden, it was kale yard from about 14th century.

967
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,840
 And then it morphed into kale yard fiction,

968
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
 which I was not familiar with.

969
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,840
 But this is, well, can you guess what kale yard fiction is?

970
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,840
 It makes you cry. It makes you grimace.

971
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
 It's sob stories.

972
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,840
 It makes you do all of those things.

973
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
 Written since 2012.

974
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,840
 And it makes you fart.

975
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,840
 OK, I don't know if it does any of those things.

976
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,840
 It's just a derogatory term for sort of a really bucolic, overly sentimentalised,

977
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:06,840
 rural, rustic fiction, because, you know, it's like old-fashioned kale yards in Scotland.

978
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,840
 And J.M. Barrie was accused of being a kale yard writer.

979
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,840
 For his books like, "Old Lich Iddils."

980
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:20,840
 I read an article on Atlas Obscura about Halloween in Scotland.

981
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,840
 I don't know if you saw this, about how kale was quite popular in that time.

982
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,840
 Because it was kind of the growing season of kale.

983
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,840
 Like you said, it was more of a winter vegetable.

984
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,840
 But apparently, youths would blindfold each other,

985
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,840
 pull stalks of kale from the ground, and then analyse their length and girth,

986
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,840
 and the amount of dirt caked onto them,

987
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,840
 and it would tell them what kind of partner they'll marry.

988
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,840
 Why do they have to be blindfolded?

989
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:53,840
 And then you could say, "Oh, I think I'll marry that tall, girthy, non-soiled girl."

990
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
 No one wants a soiled girl.

991
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
 But I guess that's what you would do then.

992
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,840
 You'd go around the bars looking for a soiled, girthy woman.

993
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,840
 The first one you said kale used in Halloween,

994
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,840
 I thought it was going to be the world's most disappointing trick or treat.

995
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,840
 Have you never bobbed for kale?

996
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,840
 When I was a young girl in the '80s,

997
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,840
 trick or treat wasn't a thing, really.

998
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,840
 When it started to come in, I remember my mum.

999
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,840
 There was a ring at the doorbell, and these two kids said trick or treat,

1000
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
 and my mum didn't know what it meant at all.

1001
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
 It just hadn't been a thing here.

1002
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,840
 And so my mum went, "Oh, treat! Two of this week!"

1003
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
 She shot the doorbell.

1004
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
 Amazing.

1005
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
 That's the choice she was making.

1006
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
 That's great.

1007
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:38,840
 I was really disappointed to read that kale is very high in vitamins K, A and E,

1008
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,840
 but not L.

1009
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,840
 Is there a vitamin L?

1010
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,840
 Well, there is.

1011
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,840
 There's a guy called Dr. W. Nakahara,

1012
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,840
 who in the 1930s discovered something that he called vitamin L,

1013
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:57,840
 but it turned out to be a couple of chemicals which are not vitamins at all

1014
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,840
 and which aren't in kale.

1015
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,840
 But he called it vitamin L because he thought it was good for lactation

1016
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,840
 in rats in particular.

1017
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,840
 But it turns out that, yeah, not only is it not a vitamin,

1018
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,840
 it's not particularly good for lactation either.

1019
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,840
 But it is a thing, vitamin L.

1020
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,840
 It's vitamin L, but the L stands for lie.

1021
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,840
 Yes, exactly.

1022
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:24,840
 But 130 grams of kale contains 1,000% of your daily vitamin K nutrition.

1023
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
 Wow.

1024
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,840
 What does vitamin K do? You get stiff bones, really.

1025
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,840
 Stiff bones?

1026
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,840
 Do make sure to try and get your bones as stiff as you possibly can.

1027
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,840
 I just hear if it's vitamin K, it just feels like a euphemism for ketamine.

1028
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
 Yes.

1029
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
 How much kale was that?

1030
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
 130 grams, not much.

1031
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
 I was about to say the opposite.

1032
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,840
 That's quite light, isn't it, kale?

1033
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,840
 It's light, I suppose.

1034
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,840
 Truth is, it's 1,000%.

1035
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,840
 So you only need 13 grams.

1036
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,840
 But people who take blood thinners should be careful with kale

1037
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,840
 because if you have too much vitamin K,

1038
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,840
 it can be a problem with your clotting of your blood.

1039
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:12,840
 And also, if you have iodine deficiency and you eat an enormous amount of kale,

1040
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,840
 you can get hypothyroidism, where you make too much of your thyroid hormone.

1041
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,840
 You can get a nice goiter on your neck.

1042
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,840
 An 88-year-old woman got severe hypothyroidism and went into a coma after eating.

1043
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,840
 But she was eating between 1 and 1.5 kilograms a day.

1044
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,840
 This is actually bok choy, which has a similar property, raw bok choy for several months.

1045
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,840
 But that's more than 10,000% of her daily fit of kale.

1046
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,840
 So she was overdoing it.

1047
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,840
 And how can you physically eat that much bok choy?

1048
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,840
 It's really light.

1049
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,840
 She can't have been doing much else with her days.

1050
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,840
 It's like a panda, just all day, just chewing on bok choy.

1051
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:59,840
 That's a hipster panda, isn't it?

1052
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:08,840
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the week, and that is James's fact.

1053
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,840
 Okay, my fact this week is that Goldfinger was such a difficult boss

1054
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,840
 that he once fired someone who didn't even work for him.

1055
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,840
 You don't want a fictional Goldfinger here.

1056
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,840
 Goldfinger!

1057
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,840
 No, I deliberately missed out.

1058
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,840
 The start of this fact, which is Brutalist Architect, Erno Goldfinger, did all this stuff.

1059
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,840
 We knew Angela was coming on the show, and we know you like a bit of Brutalism architecture.

1060
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:40,840
 And so I dug out my book Concretopia, which was written by a good friend, John Grindrod,

1061
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,840
 all about Brutalist architecture.

1062
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,840
 And I thought I'd find some facts about Erno Goldfinger.

1063
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,840
 And he was a very angry man, apparently.

1064
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,840
 Maybe he was stuck in a texture.

1065
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,840
 Yes.

1066
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,840
 He'd have to be a big dexter, he was a big man.

1067
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,840
 Was he?

1068
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,840
 Yeah.

1069
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,840
 He used to show his strength to the people in his office by using a hole punch

1070
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,840
 to punch through stacks of card that no one else was strong enough to do.

1071
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,840
 And that was his way of going, don't mess with me, look how many bits of card I can punch a hole through.

1072
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,840
 What's the threat there? I can punch a hole through your torso?

1073
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,840
 It's weird that in World's Strongest Man they don't have this ability.

1074
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,840
 They're missing a trick.

1075
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,840
 It'd be great, because an office-based World's Strongest Man would be very funny.

1076
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
 Yeah.

1077
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,840
 And fun.

1078
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,840
 So Erno Goldfinger, people, especially who live in London, will know some of his buildings.

1079
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,840
 Trelik Tower, I think, is his most famous one, which is only because I used to live near.

1080
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:39,840
 But yeah, he did a lot of these concrete buildings, very popular for about three years,

1081
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,840
 but they're all still here.

1082
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:49,840
 And John Grindroth, who wrote this book Concretopia, he spoke to James Dunnett, who worked with Erno Goldfinger,

1083
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,840
 and then Dunnett sort of related this story, that he was a very fiery character.

1084
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,840
 And whenever you came to work for Goldfinger, a lot of people only lasted less than a day,

1085
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,840
 and they'd be fired at lunchtime.

1086
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,840
 And apparently one day, Goldfinger was in one of his rages, you know,

1087
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,840
 probably he didn't get his hole punch working properly, and he stormed through a reception,

1088
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,840
 and there was a guy just waiting in reception, and he just went, "You're fired!"

1089
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,840
 And he didn't even work for them.

1090
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:22,840
 He apparently, between 1954 and 1955, in that year, he lost 26 employees in a small office,

1091
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,840
 either through sacking them or they left because of stress.

1092
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,840
 That was just in one year.

1093
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:33,840
 And you know, obviously, the actual Ian Fleming Goldfinger connection with Goldfinger.

1094
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,840
 So Ian Fleming named the character Goldfinger after Erno Goldfinger.

1095
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:45,840
 So Erno Goldfinger, the architect, was married to Isabel Blackwell from, yeah, from Cossum Blackwell family,

1096
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,840
 and her cousin played golf with Ian Fleming.

1097
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,840
 And the family all hated Erno Goldfinger because he was so mean and nasty.

1098
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:59,840
 And Ian Fleming didn't like him because he'd demolished some houses in Hampstead

1099
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,840
 to build the Willow Avenue, is it, Willow Road?

1100
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,840
 Two Willow Road, his house, yeah, in Hampstead.

1101
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,840
 And so Ian Fleming was angry that he'd demolished these cottages that had been there before,

1102
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,840
 and so that's why he called him Goldfinger.

1103
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,840
 And Erno Goldfinger sort of got his lawyers involved to sort of try and stop it,

1104
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:25,840
 and Ian Fleming suggested that what he would be prepared to do was put a slip in every copy of the book

1105
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,840
 that said, actually, his name is Goldprick.

1106
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,840
 But in the end, they settled and it was fine.

1107
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:38,840
 Didn't they settle because Ian said, OK, I'll use Alrick Goldfinger as in his first name

1108
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,840
 in every mention of him in the book?

1109
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,840
 To clarify the full name is, yeah, he did do that.

1110
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,840
 It's nothing to do with you, it's a complete coincidence.

1111
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,840
 The story doesn't reflect very well on Ian Fleming, I think,

1112
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:55,840
 because between the destruction of these cottages in Hampstead and the writing of the book,

1113
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,840
 I think it was about 20 years.

1114
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,840
 I think it's a long grudge that was held.

1115
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,840
 Well, the thing is with Fleming is, so Pierce Fletcher, who's the producer of QI,

1116
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,840
 he says he knows someone called Scaramanga,

1117
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,840
 and this guy called Scaramanga, his father went to school with Ian Fleming, right?

1118
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,840
 And I've met, I don't know if you've met, blow felt the cricket commentator.

1119
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,840
 Surely that character is not based on the cricket commentator blow felt.

1120
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,840
 I can't see any similarities.

1121
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,840
 It's based on his father, apparently.

1122
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,840
 And according to blowers, he says that they went to the same club,

1123
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,840
 and Fleming saw the name in the club list and stuff like that.

1124
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,840
 We're not quite sure.

1125
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,840
 But basically, I mean, Ian Fleming just knew so many people with amazing names.

1126
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,840
 Incredible.

1127
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,840
 Because I looked at all my Facebook friends yesterday to see if any of my friends

1128
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,840
 had good enough names to be Bond villains, and none of them do.

1129
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,840
 Like, literally, I don't have a single friend who has a funny surname.

1130
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,840
 But the settlement they came to was that the publisher would pay Goldfingers,

1131
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,840
 I think some of his legal costs, and they would also provide six copies of the book.

1132
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,840
 That's all right then.

1133
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,840
 As long as I've got six copies of the book that's hanging me off, I don't mind.

1134
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,840
 But I think it probably didn't pay off for Goldfinger in the end because for years afterwards,

1135
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,840
 or for years after the movie came out, the James Bond film,

1136
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,840
 people would ring him up and do a Sean Connery voice and say,

1137
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,840
 "Goldfinger, this is double all seven."

1138
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,840
 Well, you shouldn't have made your address so public with this famous house you built.

1139
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,840
 That's true.

1140
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,840
 He was a lifelong Marxist as well, and he used to sell...

1141
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,840
 He had art sales for...

1142
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:29,840
 Him and his wife used to hold these art sales to raise money for the Red Army.

1143
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,840
 Oh, did they?

1144
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,840
 Yeah, and we're friends with...

1145
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,840
 I think Barbara Hepworth used to sell stuff with him.

1146
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,840
 Yeah.

1147
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:41,840
 I guess his kind of architecture, brutalist architecture, gets associated with left-wing ideology.

1148
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,840
 And I think the anti-brutalism movement of saying,

1149
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,840
 "We really hate these buildings. They're so ugly.

1150
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,840
 Can we get some more classical Roman stuff up, please?"

1151
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,840
 is more associated with conservative hypes.

1152
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,840
 It's very eastern block.

1153
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,840
 The concrete...

1154
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,840
 It puts the block in eastern block.

1155
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,840
 It's very strong.

1156
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,840
 It's a function over form, isn't it?

1157
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,840
 The whole idea of modernist showing you're working, which I think is beautiful.

1158
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,840
 I have a concrete wedding ring and a concrete engagement ring.

1159
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,840
 I'm showing this. That's my concrete engagement ring, which I'm showing you.

1160
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,840
 It's like a square of concrete.

1161
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,840
 And that is my concrete wedding ring.

1162
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,840
 My husband has one the same, and the aggregate is pebbles from Brighton Beach,

1163
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,840
 because we live in Brighton.

1164
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,840
 So, yeah, I'm a little obsessed with concrete as a medium.

1165
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,840
 It's the most attractive I've ever seen concrete be, actually.

1166
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,840
 Well, I've got a little theory about that.

1167
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,840
 I wrote an article about this in The Independent a little while ago

1168
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:38,840
 about this idea of, you know, like, I was going to say Prince Charles, King Charles,

1169
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,840
 or as Dara O'Brien keeps calling him, what the week, King Prince Charles, which...

1170
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:47,840
 He obviously spoke out against Brutus architecture quite a lot.

1171
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,840
 He described the National Theatre as something like a clever way

1172
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,840
 of disguising a nuclear power station in the centre of London or something like that.

1173
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,840
 And the monstrous carbon cores and all of that.

1174
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,840
 But my theory is that we're sort of triggered by nostalgia human beings,

1175
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,840
 you know, about things that make us think about home.

1176
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,840
 If you grew up in Buckingham Palace, then yes, the National Theatre is going to look quite ugly.

1177
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,840
 But if you grew up like I did on an estate, you know, where there's lots of concrete

1178
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,840
 about concrete subways, concrete, then those buildings make me feel nostalgic

1179
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,840
 and warm and, you know, so it's all relative.

1180
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:21,840
 Like, for example, Wellbeck Street Car Park was a famous Brutus structure in Soho

1181
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,840
 that got demolished a few years ago.

1182
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,840
 That beautiful sort of...

1183
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
 Oh, yeah, I go past it all the time.

1184
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,840
 It sort of looks like they pour concrete into a beehive,

1185
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,840
 that kind of sort of tessellated, beautiful structure and they knocked it down.

1186
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
 I just think, well, where's the difference there?

1187
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,840
 Like, people will preserve, say, old coaching-ins.

1188
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,840
 Yeah.

1189
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,840
 Because Charles I stayed there once or whatever.

1190
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,840
 You go, well, who parked their car in that car park?

1191
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,840
 I bet a load of really famous people did.

1192
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,840
 Because of where it is in Soho.

1193
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,840
 You've got to get the blue past down.

1194
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,840
 But you know, this idea that things that seem modern to us and ugly,

1195
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,840
 well, in the future we'll have historic values. Stop knocking them down.

1196
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,840
 Yeah, I agree.

1197
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,840
 I would love a car park plaque scheme.

1198
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,840
 You know, if you found out Gary Lernicker parked here in 1996,

1199
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,840
 it would change the way I felt about that in space.

1200
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,840
 Because basically every Indian restaurant in the country

1201
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,840
 has a picture of Gary Lernicker.

1202
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,840
 Does that make you feel different about those?

1203
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,840
 It's, I can't believe...

1204
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,840
 He must have parked somewhere.

1205
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,840
 He must have gone to so many Indian restaurants around the country

1206
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,840
 because they are, it's everywhere.

1207
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,840
 There's one right near here, right near where we're recording this now.

1208
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,840
 And it's, I just can't imagine how he had the time as a top-class footballer

1209
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,840
 to be plowing through that many curries.

1210
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,840
 I can't imagine what it's like to share a bathroom with him.

1211
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,840
 Slightly related, I saw Gary Lernicker once in a service station.

1212
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,840
 I can't remember which one, like a proper sort of motorway service station.

1213
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,840
 And I was with the comedian John Robbins, we were now waiting for a gig somewhere.

1214
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,840
 And he's only like, nice to be with Gary Lernicker ahead of us in the queue.

1215
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,840
 And the thing that just amazed us most was he'd obviously been travelling

1216
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,840
 from somewhere to somewhere and was wearing the most crisp white shirt

1217
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,840
 without a crease in it.

1218
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,840
 Oh, really?

1219
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,840
 So you've obviously got out of a car.

1220
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,840
 How are you looking so amazing?

1221
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,840
 That's interesting.

1222
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,840
 Nice. Well done, Gary.

1223
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,840
 Was he absolutely going to town on a Cormor or something like this?

1224
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,840
 Not in Starbucks, no.

1225
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,840
 He was signing a cup for them, though.

1226
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,840
 So I guess they were going to put that on the way.

1227
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,840
 Well, see, all celebrities get around a lot.

1228
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,840
 Gary's the only one who comes with his own marker pen.

1229
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,840
 But yeah, you're right.

1230
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,840
 Going back to this architecture,

1231
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,840
 which we're talking about, I think,

1232
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,840
 there is this assumption that it's bad for a community.

1233
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,840
 People get very depressed.

1234
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,840
 It has a negative impact on mental health.

1235
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,840
 There was lots of chat in the '80s, which, like, in Thatcher Zero,

1236
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,840
 there was this big pushback against all this brutalist architecture.

1237
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,840
 And people were saying, like, Thatcher's favourite housing expert,

1238
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,840
 who was a woman called Alice Coleman,

1239
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,840
 saying it's increasing levels of crime and antisocial behaviour

1240
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,840
 in all these areas, partly because I think there's less surveillance.

1241
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,840
 If you've got those big tower blocks,

1242
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,840
 you can get away with a lot, she said.

1243
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,840
 And people do assume that.

1244
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,840
 And I couldn't really find any evidence of any studies

1245
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,840
 that say people's mental health is affected.

1246
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,840
 And also, I think, what happened?

1247
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,840
 So, post-war, when there was a housing shortage, you know,

1248
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,840
 after the Blitz and everything, you had to build quickly.

1249
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,840
 And there was this fashion in Europe

1250
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,840
 for building up these modernist architects.

1251
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,840
 So, Le Corbusier, who built UnitÃ© d'Abertation,

1252
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,840
 all these grand ideas.

1253
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,840
 But what we tried to do here is do it cheaply.

1254
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,840
 Because you had, when Churchill's government came back in '51,

1255
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,840
 and you then had, I think the housing minister then was Macmillan,

1256
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,840
 and the idea was to build quickly and cheaply.

1257
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,840
 And so, there was the disaster that happened at Ronan Point,

1258
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,840
 which was a tower block in Newham.

1259
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,840
 And it was built 16 stories higher than it should have been.

1260
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,840
 So, the designs were for it to be 16 stories lower.

1261
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,840
 That's a lot. That's a lot to add.

1262
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,840
 And they used what was called an LPS system,

1263
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,840
 which is a large panel system.

1264
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,840
 So, it's precast concrete panels that are then slotted together in situ.

1265
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,840
 And what happened?

1266
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,840
 Apparently, in this particular building,

1267
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,840
 some of the gaps between the panels were so big,

1268
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,840
 you could put a coin through them.

1269
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,840
 And they just stuffed them with newspaper.

1270
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,840
 And then a gas explosion happened.

1271
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,840
 And one corner, the pictures all over the papers,

1272
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,840
 this corner blowing off of this thing.

1273
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,840
 But of course, it spread really quickly because of the gaps

1274
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,840
 in the panel system and all of this.

1275
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,840
 So, it was all kind of set up to fail in this country.

1276
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,840
 Because there were tower blocks in Europe that worked perfectly well.

1277
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,840
 And obviously, what happened as well is that when Right to Buy came in,

1278
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,840
 people would buy their council homes,

1279
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,840
 and then they'd move up the property ladder, move out,

1280
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,840
 and then private landlords would let them...

1281
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,840
 So, you end up with this situation where it's the poorest people in society

1282
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,840
 all packed together in places without a concierge,

1283
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,840
 without any proper management,

1284
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,840
 and with nooks and crannies where drug dealers or whatever could...

1285
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,840
 So, they were set up to fail from the off, really.

1286
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,840
 So, it's not the building's fault.

1287
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,840
 It's the funding and the government, you know, at the time.

1288
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,840
 These big ideas cost money.

1289
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,840
 Architects that came up with these big ideas never had to live in them.

1290
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,840
 - Yeah. - Although, old Goldfinger did.

1291
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,840
 - Oh, he did live in Balfront Tower, didn't he? - He did.

1292
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,840
 I mean, only for a couple of months.

1293
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,840
 He did say of his... of Balfront Tower,

1294
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,840
 which was like the first big thing that he built in London.

1295
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,840
 And he said, "Everything I did, I did as if it was done for me."

1296
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,840
 And to show that he went and moved in with his wife.

1297
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,840
 And he used to host champagne receptions for all the residents

1298
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,840
 where they would come and tell him what they thought of the building

1299
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,840
 and what they liked and didn't like about it.

1300
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,840
 Although, if you do, after two months, just move to your swanky pad in London.

1301
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,840
 - Yeah, yeah. - You can go back to Hampstead.

1302
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,840
 - Is it worth saying something about the word "brutalism"? - Yeah, definitely.

1303
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,840
 Because "brutalism", I think people think, is because it looks brutal.

1304
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,840
 But it's actually from BÃ©ton Brut, which is French for raw concrete.

1305
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,840
 - OK. - So, that's where...

1306
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,840
 And the term "brutalism" came from...

1307
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,840
 There's a couple called Alison and Peter Smithson,

1308
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,840
 who were sort of pioneers of new brutalism.

1309
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,840
 They were the kind of radical young architects in the '50s.

1310
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,840
 And they wrote an essay where they mentioned new brutalism

1311
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,840
 as this new form over function...

1312
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,840
 Sorry, function over form, ascetic.

1313
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,840
 Which we should say, because it's confused me for a long time researching.

1314
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,840
 You'll definitely know it. New brutalism was just brutalism.

1315
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,840
 - There was no old brutalism. - No, no.

1316
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,840
 - They just started. - But they're new.

1317
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,840
 I think Sweden or somewhere, it's called Nybrutalism,

1318
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,840
 was the sort of original in the late '40s, I think.

1319
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,840
 And then they sort of picked up that and ran with it.

1320
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,840
 And then there was an architectural journalist, Peter Raynabanam,

1321
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,840
 who then wrote about it in the architectural review.

1322
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,840
 And they described it as an ethic, not an aesthetic.

1323
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,840
 So, this idea that buildings should be for functional purposes

1324
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,840
 for people to live in, rather than to just look pretty.

1325
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:28,840
 So, it was Raynabanam who kind of brought brutalism as a word, right?

1326
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,840
 It was kind of... They talked about new brutalism,

1327
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,840
 and then he was the one who kind of made a joke

1328
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,840
 about the brute concrete in France. Is that right?

1329
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,840
 - Yeah, I think so, yeah. - 'Cause I wrote to John Grindroth,

1330
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,840
 and he sent me some facts, and he said that the brute in brutalism,

1331
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,840
 because it comes from the same root as Breton Brute,

1332
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,840
 it's the same brute as you get in Champagne.

1333
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,840
 - Really? - So, yeah, Brute Champagne means dry,

1334
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,840
 it also means raw, I think, in French.

1335
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,840
 Concrete, would you like a glass of concrete to celebrate?

1336
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,840
 - That's what we had at our wedding. - No.

1337
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,840
 Although we did have, actually, the tables at our wedding

1338
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,840
 were named after either whiskeys, 'cause my husband's a big whisky fan,

1339
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,840
 - or Brutalist buildings. - That's right.

1340
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,840
 So, we had a Wellbeck Street car park table.

1341
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,840
 - That's so good. - We had a number one Croydon table.

1342
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,840
 We had... My favourite structures, one of them,

1343
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,840
 is the Pennine Tower at Lancaster Services.

1344
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:28,840
 I love that structure so much, we had a table named after that.

1345
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,840
 I used to live there, I used to live near there,

1346
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,840
 and I moved to a town, it's called Silverdale,

1347
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,840
 and just to try and get in with the locals,

1348
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,840
 I did a pub quiz there, and they had a question,

1349
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,840
 it was around where they gave you ten clues,

1350
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,840
 and if you got the right answer,

1351
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,840
 if you got it in the first clue, you get ten points,

1352
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,840
 and it'd go all the way down.

1353
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,840
 The first question was, this building was designed by whoever it was...

1354
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,840
 - Oh, God, now you've got a TP something. - Whatever it's called.

1355
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,840
 Every other team in the quiz ran to him saying,

1356
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,840
 "We've got the answer, we've got the answer."

1357
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,840
 And me and my partner at the time were sat in the corner,

1358
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,840
 "No, okay, next clue, next clue, next clue."

1359
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,840
 They got all the way down to the last clue,

1360
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,840
 which was like, it can be seen on the M6 just outside Silverdale,

1361
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,840
 and we guessed that it must be that service station.

1362
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,840
 And yeah, that was a typical kind of quiz in that town

1363
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,840
 where all the locals knew all the answers,

1364
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,840
 but if you weren't local, you had no chance.

1365
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,840
 - That's so funny. - It's a beautiful structure,

1366
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:32,840
 it's a kind of like a space age, a kind of like a flying saucer on a pole.

1367
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,840
 - Fortin Tower. - You would have got on, I think, quite well with Thomas Edison,

1368
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,840
 who was also, do you know about his concrete obsession?

1369
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,840
 - I don't think I do, no. - Oh, God, I think you might have married him in a different life.

1370
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,840
 He was obsessed with it. He set up Edison Portland Cement Company,

1371
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,840
 and he wanted to make houses and all of their interiors entirely out of concrete.

1372
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,840
 And he actually, I think it was because he had lots of sand left over

1373
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,840
 from other stuff he was trying, so...

1374
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,840
 I don't know why he was making sand castles.

1375
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,840
 And he imagined houses made entirely of concrete,

1376
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,840
 but then inside they would have concrete tables and chairs

1377
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,840
 and bath towers made of concrete, fridges made of concrete pianos.

1378
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,840
 And he built, I think he built a little version, a little concrete cottage,

1379
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,840
 and it does look like someone's taken a normal house,

1380
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,840
 and then they've poured concrete over all the items in it.

1381
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,840
 - I think that was kind of his idea, right?

1382
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,840
 He would just get this kind of shape of a house,

1383
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,840
 and all you would have to do is pour concrete in,

1384
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,840
 and eventually it was set, you'd take off the mould,

1385
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,840
 and you'd have a house, and it would have all the tables in and everything.

1386
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,840
 But I think that's, does that still exist, that building?

1387
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,840
 - There might be one. - I think that original one might still exist.

1388
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,840
 - They probably have tried to get rid of it, but found it impossible to destroy.

1389
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:45,840
 - It's a place called Hermits Castle, which is in Scotland somewhere,

1390
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,840
 and I can't remember exactly where, but it was an early sort of,

1391
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,840
 I think in the early '50s, maybe, this architect, David, someone, I can't remember his name.

1392
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,840
 This is just full of me trying to remember people's names.

1393
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:01,840
 But he built this little, out of concrete, this little castle,

1394
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:05,840
 and the idea was that anyone walking could then just sleep in it, and people do.

1395
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,840
 But he did exactly that, like the beds all moulded into it,

1396
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,840
 and the little shelves and things, it's all moulded into it.

1397
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:17,840
 It's called shuttering, so you use wooden panels,

1398
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,840
 or wooden moulds to pour the concrete into.

1399
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:24,840
 You sort of line them with resin, and then move them away.

1400
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,840
 So that's why concrete is so exciting, because you can make any shape out of it.

1401
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,840
 - It's like plastic, I guess, right? - Yeah.

1402
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,840
 - Not comfortable, though, to sleep on.

1403
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,840
 - You wish that someone had made a bouncy castle.

1404
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,840
 A house made of doovies.

1405
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,840
 - Angela, have you seen the film 'Lock'?

1406
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,840
 It's Tom Hardy. - Oh, in the car? Yes, I have.

1407
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,840
 I forgot it was called that, about the big concrete port.

1408
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:52,840
 So I did British Brutalist Architecture for Mastermind a few months ago,

1409
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,840
 and I just found myself down this YouTube rabbit hole,

1410
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,840
 and about four in the morning I was watching videos of concrete pours,

1411
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,840
 going, "This isn't what I'm doing!"

1412
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,840
 "This is not going to come up!"

1413
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,840
 You should start a festive site.

1414
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:14,840
 OK, that is it, that is all of our facts.

1415
