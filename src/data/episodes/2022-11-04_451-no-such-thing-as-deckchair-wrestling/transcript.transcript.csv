00:00:01,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish."
00:00:05,00:00:08,Daniel Shriver is away this week.
00:00:08,00:00:12,"I thought it was because his wife was having a baby,"
00:00:12,00:00:14,"but he's just sent an email saying,"
00:00:14,00:00:18,"""Tell them it's something to do with, by brand new book, The Theory of Everything Else,"
00:00:18,00:00:20,"available in all good bookshops."""
00:00:20,00:00:23,"And I'm like, well, look, whatever reason he's away,"
00:00:23,00:00:26,"we have a very exciting guest that is in his stead,"
00:00:26,00:00:30,and that is the wonderful comedian Angela Barnes.
00:00:30,00:00:35,"You will have seen her on your televisions most notably on the TV show Mock the Week,"
00:00:35,00:00:36,but she does all sorts of other stuff.
00:00:36,00:00:39,I appeared on her radio show a couple of years ago
00:00:39,00:00:43,and immediately knew that she would be perfect for fish.
00:00:43,00:00:46,"She is the most inquisitive, interested person."
00:00:46,00:00:48,You're going to absolutely love her.
00:00:48,00:00:53,"And once you've heard the show, you are going to want to go and see her live in her upcoming tour,"
00:00:53,00:00:59,"called Hot Mess, and tickets for that are currently available on her website,"
00:00:59,00:01:03,which is angelabarnescomedy.co.uk.
00:01:03,00:01:07,"If you can't wait to see her live, then why not go and check out her podcast."
00:01:07,00:01:13,"It is called We Are History Podcast, which she does with John O'Farrell,"
00:01:13,00:01:14,and it is all about history.
00:01:14,00:01:16,It's really funny. It's really great.
00:01:16,00:01:17,You've got to go and listen.
00:01:17,00:01:20,It's available wherever you get your podcasts.
00:01:20,00:01:22,"Anyway, Dan will be back next week."
00:01:22,00:01:25,"But in the meantime, on with the podcast."
00:01:25,00:01:45,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:01:45,00:01:50,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:01:50,00:01:56,"My name is Anna Tyshinski, and I am joined today by Andrew Hunter-Murray,"
00:01:56,00:02:01,"James Hawkin, and our very special guest, Dan Schreiber Replacement,"
00:02:01,00:02:04,a hopefully permanent Angela Barnes.
00:02:04,00:02:04,Hello.
00:02:04,00:02:06,Hello.
00:02:06,00:02:10,"Okay, once again, we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:02:10,00:02:15,"and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Angela."
00:02:15,00:02:17,"Okay, so I've always wanted to say this."
00:02:17,00:02:23,"My fact this week is that in communist East Germany in the 1950s,"
00:02:23,00:02:30,the state came up with a sanctioned dance for their teenagers to do.
00:02:30,00:02:32,They were a bit worried about the influence of rock and roll from the West.
00:02:32,00:02:36,Elvis Presley was doing his military service in West Germany.
00:02:36,00:02:40,So they were picking up all the Elvis on their radios and their TVs.
00:02:40,00:02:42,Elvis sang while he was doing his service to me.
00:02:42,00:02:44,Really loudly over the wall.
00:02:44,00:02:49,"And so they were all the youngsters, they were worried about their hip-fusting movements."
00:02:49,00:02:55,"And the state felt that dancing on your own was subversive, that you should dance in a couple."
00:02:55,00:02:56,Yeah.
00:02:56,00:03:00,"But when you did dance in a couple, you shouldn't be gyrating like Elvis."
00:03:00,00:03:00,Fair enough.
00:03:00,00:03:03,And what I know about teenagers is not very much.
00:03:03,00:03:04,Right.
00:03:04,00:03:08,Probably that they wouldn't necessarily do what the government told them are.
00:03:08,00:03:09,"Well, no."
00:03:09,00:03:12,"But it was the dance in question, the lipsy dance."
00:03:12,00:03:13,The lipsy.
00:03:13,00:03:16,It would have to be unbelievably good for teenagers to want to do it.
00:03:16,00:03:17,It'd have to be Agadou.
00:03:17,00:03:19,Was it Agadou?
00:03:19,00:03:21,And was it Agadou?
00:03:21,00:03:23,It definitely wasn't Agadou.
00:03:23,00:03:25,What was it? Was it good? I haven't seen this dance.
00:03:25,00:03:31,"So it was two choreographers came up with the dance, Krista and Helmut Seifert."
00:03:31,00:03:37,And they came up the steps and it was an East German composer called Ren√© Dubianski who came up with the music.
00:03:37,00:03:40,And it was basically it was a fast waltz.
00:03:40,00:03:45,So he merged two waltz beats into a six-four beat because there's nothing that teenagers like more than waltz.
00:03:45,00:03:46,A double waltz.
00:03:46,00:03:52,"And the idea was that they would dance together, but their hips wouldn't wiggle."
00:03:52,00:03:59,So there's footage of it on YouTube and it just at first it looks like a normal sort of Latin-y kind of dance.
00:03:59,00:04:01,And then you realize that their hips don't move.
00:04:01,00:04:02,Weird.
00:04:02,00:04:03,And it just looks old.
00:04:03,00:04:07,It feels like a reverse Irish dance kind of.
00:04:07,00:04:08,Is that not right?
00:04:08,00:04:11,Is Irish dancing just hips moving but the rest of the world?
00:04:11,00:04:14,It's just like the bottom half moving.
00:04:14,00:04:15,"Yeah, I suppose it is."
00:04:15,00:04:16,"No, it's not like that."
00:04:16,00:04:19,Even Irish dance doesn't move your hips around much.
00:04:19,00:04:22,I've taken Irish dancing classes in my time.
00:04:22,00:04:24,"Yeah, I can really picture that."
00:04:24,00:04:24,Can you?
00:04:24,00:04:28,It's a Michael flatly about you.
00:04:28,00:04:31,"Yeah, as a boy I learned some river dance."
00:04:31,00:04:36,"Actually, what we never noticed because we always record around the table is that you're always river dancing."
00:04:36,00:04:36,Yep.
00:04:36,00:04:40,I wonder why I kept getting bruised shins.
00:04:40,00:04:44,The effort in the edit to remove the constant clackity-clack of me dancing away.
00:04:44,00:04:51,"I actually had a doctor say to me once, so I have something called periodic limb movement disorder which means in my sleep my legs flail."
00:04:51,00:04:51,"Oh, really?"
00:04:51,00:04:56,And I did a sleep study once at Guy's Hospital and in the official report he said two things.
00:04:56,00:05:01,"One was that my snoring was and I quote heroic, which I was very proud of."
00:05:01,00:05:05,And the other was that like watching me sleep was like watching horizontal river dance.
00:05:05,00:05:06,That's in my official.
00:05:06,00:05:08,"They really sound like compliments, both of those things."
00:05:08,00:05:09,"I know, right?"
00:05:09,00:05:10,That's pretty thoughtful.
00:05:10,00:05:11,I was such a lucky man.
00:05:11,00:05:15,Do you have to sort of have a mini sleeping bag for your legs alone or?
00:05:15,00:05:17,"Well, I don't think it can take."
00:05:17,00:05:20,"So whenever I have slept in a sleeping bag, I've woken up with it on the floor."
00:05:20,00:05:20,You can't be contained.
00:05:20,00:05:22,So I just can't be contained.
00:05:22,00:05:22,The energy.
00:05:22,00:05:27,"If I could wire it up to the national grid in this energy crisis, we'd be all right."
00:05:27,00:05:28,What were we talking about?
00:05:28,00:05:28,Dancing.
00:05:28,00:05:29,"Dancing, yes."
00:05:29,00:05:30,"Dancing, yes."
00:05:30,00:05:34,I didn't realise how what a threat Elvis was at the time.
00:05:34,00:05:36,"God, people went nuts over Elvis."
00:05:36,00:05:39,They thought he was going to impregnate every woman on earth.
00:05:39,00:05:46,"Well, riots in East Germany in 1959 in in about 14 East German cities and towns."
00:05:46,00:05:48,And they then had to be crackdowns.
00:05:48,00:05:50,So Leipzig had a crackdown.
00:05:50,00:05:52,Leipzig is where the Lipsy dance.
00:05:52,00:05:55,The state one is from the Latin name for Cypsey.
00:05:55,00:06:01,"Yeah, and they sentenced 15 demonstrators to prison sentences of between six months"
00:06:01,00:06:04,and four and a half years for going to pro Elvis protests.
00:06:04,00:06:05,Really?
00:06:05,00:06:05,Yeah.
00:06:05,00:06:06,But it was everywhere.
00:06:06,00:06:09,We shouldn't tar East Germany with this solitary brush.
00:06:09,00:06:14,Rock 'n' Roll was sort of vilified in a way that I don't think any legitimate music ever has been.
00:06:14,00:06:19,There's plenty of Americans that were frightened about the influence of Elvis as well.
00:06:19,00:06:23,There was a state-sponsored Rock 'n' Roll festival in the US.
00:06:23,00:06:24,In the US?
00:06:24,00:06:28,"Yeah, in America, which like hated Rock 'n' Roll as well."
00:06:28,00:06:29,But it was called Vortex One.
00:06:29,00:06:32,"It sounds like the saddest thing ever, but Paranoia was quite popular."
00:06:32,00:06:34,Do you remember the Festival of Brexit?
00:06:34,00:06:36,"Oh, no!"
00:06:36,00:06:38,This was like if that had been a success.
00:06:38,00:06:39,"Yeah, okay."
00:06:39,00:06:40,This is that.
00:06:40,00:06:41,It was in Oregon.
00:06:41,00:06:48,"And I'm surprised that the hippies agreed to go to it because it was basically because Nixon was going to visit Portland, Oregon in 1970, I believe."
00:06:48,00:06:57,And this was obviously at a time of extreme anti-war protests and extreme government crackdowns on those protests in America.
00:06:57,00:07:01,And there was a fear that the hippies would start protesting or the peace protest would start protesting.
00:07:01,00:07:06,"So to get rid of them, basically, the state government said, ""Guys, do you want to give you a festival?"""
00:07:06,00:07:13,"And they all went for it because they really wanted peace, but more than that, they wanted a rock festival where they had license to take drugs."
00:07:13,00:07:17,"Like the state was like, ""Look, we'll turn a blind eye to all the drug-taking and the nudity."""
00:07:17,00:07:20,"Just to get, sorry, is it just to get them out of town when Nixon's in town?"
00:07:20,00:07:21,Sounds like it.
00:07:21,00:07:22,That's basically it.
00:07:22,00:07:23,Sounds like a sitcom.
00:07:23,00:07:24,It does.
00:07:24,00:07:26,"Oh no, we've accidentally got them crossing paths."
00:07:26,00:07:30,And he didn't even turn up in the end.
00:07:30,00:07:31,No.
00:07:31,00:07:33,So they just got a festival for nothing.
00:07:33,00:07:34,That's amazing.
00:07:34,00:07:35,It's awesome.
00:07:35,00:07:38,So I've read a book we see about the Stasi Poetry Circle.
00:07:38,00:07:39,Sounds fun.
00:07:39,00:07:40,"I know, right?"
00:07:40,00:07:43,Your work and leisure was really tied up in East Germany.
00:07:43,00:07:45,So you would go on holiday with the people you were with.
00:07:45,00:07:46,Sounds awful.
00:07:46,00:07:52,And all your leisure activities were bound up with the company that you worked for and stuff.
00:07:52,00:07:54,And it was the same with the Stasi.
00:07:54,00:07:57,And so they would have these sort of art circles.
00:07:57,00:07:59,"And one of them, they had a poetry circle."
00:07:59,00:08:04,"But the guy who ran it, Uwe Berger, I think his name was, he wasn't a member of the party,"
00:08:04,00:08:10,but he was one of the hundreds of thousands of misarbiters they called.
00:08:10,00:08:12,So these unofficial collaborators.
00:08:12,00:08:13,The Stasi.
00:08:13,00:08:14,So he would get all the poetry.
00:08:14,00:08:19,These young Stasi officers would be writing their poetry in their poetry circle.
00:08:19,00:08:21,And then he'd be looking for dissidents among them and feeding it back.
00:08:21,00:08:23,And was he looking through the medium of the poetry?
00:08:23,00:08:24,Yeah.
00:08:24,00:08:29,"Oh, so he was looking for maybe dissident users of meter or half rhymes."
00:08:29,00:08:34,Or just anybody that basically wasn't socialist realism or showed any sort of freedom of thought.
00:08:34,00:08:35,How interesting.
00:08:35,00:08:36,Yeah.
00:08:36,00:08:39,"Because they did also, they infiltrated punk groups."
00:08:39,00:08:42,They were very threatened by punk music when it came in in East Germany.
00:08:42,00:08:43,And so the Stasi infiltrated.
00:08:43,00:08:44,I feel threatened by that still.
00:08:44,00:08:45,Sure.
00:08:45,00:08:46,"I mean, they infiltrated everybody."
00:08:46,00:08:48,That's the thing about the Stasi.
00:08:48,00:08:50,And they were the biggest administrators of any.
00:08:50,00:08:56,"So out of the whole of German history from the Middle Ages to World War Two, there were"
00:08:56,00:09:02,more written records kept in the 40 years of the German Democratic Republic than the
00:09:02,00:09:04,rest of German history put together.
00:09:04,00:09:05,Really?
00:09:05,00:09:06,Yeah.
00:09:06,00:09:07,But it's all bad poetry.
00:09:07,00:09:08,It's mostly bad poetry.
00:09:08,00:09:14,"So when the war came down and then in January 1990, the people stormed the Stasi headquarters"
00:09:14,00:09:18,"in Leipzig, a place called Rundert Ecke, the round corner, to their offices."
00:09:18,00:09:25,"And they rescued these sacks of, I think there's 15,500 sacks of shredded documents."
00:09:25,00:09:26,And there's these people that are called the puzzlers.
00:09:26,00:09:28,Who piece them back together?
00:09:28,00:09:29,Who piece them back together.
00:09:29,00:09:30,And they've been doing that since 1991.
00:09:30,00:09:31,They're still doing it?
00:09:31,00:09:32,They're still doing it.
00:09:32,00:09:36,So there were millions of shredded bits of paper and it will take centuries to put them
00:09:36,00:09:37,all back together.
00:09:37,00:09:44,"I just feel like, you know, you've got an old lady in Leipzig doing her little jigsaw."
00:09:44,00:09:48,"And then she gets a tap on the shoulder, ""Mr. Schmidt, we have a job for you."""
00:09:48,00:09:51,You heard about the Schwartzer Canal.
00:09:51,00:09:55,"So in East Germany, they could pick up Western television because obviously it's not far"
00:09:55,00:09:57,away.
00:09:57,00:10:00,But you could be arrested if your TV area was pointing west.
00:10:00,00:10:01,So you had to be a bit careful.
00:10:01,00:10:03,They eased off on that as time went on.
00:10:03,00:10:08,But there were two East German channels and on one of them there was a program that was
00:10:08,00:10:13,"on every Monday night and it was called the Schwartzer Canal and what it was, it was 20"
00:10:13,00:10:20,minutes of clips of West German TV programs with a Communist commentary saying why they
00:10:20,00:10:21,were so bad.
00:10:21,00:10:22,Say why it was so bad.
00:10:22,00:10:25,I'd watch programs that had a commentary over the top explaining why they were so bad.
00:10:25,00:10:26,You should get on Twitter.
00:10:26,00:10:28,"It's just Gogglebox, isn't it?"
00:10:28,00:10:30,What you've described is basically...
00:10:30,00:10:34,"Yeah, it's like Gogglebox."
00:10:34,00:10:42,"There had been a program in West Germany called Die Horte Optik, which is the red viewpoints."
00:10:42,00:10:46,So which was sort of slagging off what was happening in East Germany.
00:10:46,00:10:49,So that was their sort of retort to that was the Black Channel.
00:10:49,00:10:53,And also it's called the Black Channel because that was like a plumbing slang for a sewer.
00:10:53,00:10:54,"Oh, that's clever."
00:10:54,00:10:55,"Yeah, yeah."
00:10:55,00:10:58,So it was like a little pun as well.
00:10:58,00:10:59,Is the red...
00:10:59,00:11:00,Die Rote...
00:11:00,00:11:01,Do you call it?
00:11:01,00:11:02,Die Rote Optik.
00:11:02,00:11:03,The red viewpoint.
00:11:03,00:11:04,Is that a joke on Rose Tinted Spectacles?
00:11:04,00:11:08,"Like, oh, in the East, they're all seeing, you know, they're probably not."
00:11:08,00:11:14,Do you think they came up with the titles before the concepts and all things like this?
00:11:14,00:11:19,"You know, the BBC had studios in nuclear bunkers in the Cold War."
00:11:19,00:11:24,"So I mean, I'll have to reign it in because I could go on forever about nuclear bunkers."
00:11:24,00:11:25,That's my little obsession.
00:11:25,00:11:30,"But in the regional seats of government, nuclear bunkers, of which there were 12 in the Cold"
00:11:30,00:11:36,"War period in Britain, they were for politicians for offices of state and things like that."
00:11:36,00:11:39,And each of them would have a BBC studio inside.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Really?
00:11:40,00:11:41,Yeah.
00:11:41,00:11:42,So you can visit the one at...
00:11:42,00:11:45,"There's one at Kelverton Hatch in Essex, which is open to the public, one at Hack Green"
00:11:45,00:11:48,"in Cheshire, which is, and you can see the BBC studio in there."
00:11:48,00:11:54,"And they have, in Kelverton Hatch, I think they have playing the actual BBC broadcast"
00:11:54,00:11:55,that would have been...
00:11:55,00:11:56,Cool.
00:11:56,00:11:57,Playing the hats.
00:11:57,00:12:01,"You know, so when you kind of go to the nuclear bunker, like all your politicians go there"
00:12:01,00:12:05,"or whatever, all your important people, would they have had to take a BBC sound engineer"
00:12:05,00:12:07,with them because it's going to be quite echoey in those places.
00:12:07,00:12:08,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:08,00:12:14,"So you had a BBC sound engineer and presenters, like heating engineers and, you know, electrical"
00:12:14,00:12:18,engineers and various different specialties would need to be in this bunker to keep it
00:12:18,00:12:19,maintained.
00:12:19,00:12:20,How interesting.
00:12:20,00:12:23,"So if you were selected, you'd sign the official secret tax, you wouldn't tell anyone."
00:12:23,00:12:26,That's so funny because obviously I'm sure you know a lot of BBC sound engineers like
00:12:26,00:12:27,I do.
00:12:27,00:12:28,Well.
00:12:28,00:12:32,"And I just, yeah, I wonder if they all got this job thinking, well, if it all goes"
00:12:32,00:12:33,"south, at least we can..."
00:12:33,00:12:38,"But these days, if that happened, do you think there'd be any room in the bunker for podcasters?"
00:12:38,00:12:43,"Well, I know, I'm not sure how much of this I'm allowed to say because I..."
00:12:43,00:12:45,"Oh my God, you're on the list."
00:12:45,00:12:46,You're on the list.
00:12:46,00:12:47,Yeah.
00:12:47,00:12:48,I'm not on the list.
00:12:48,00:12:49,I promise I'm not on the list.
00:12:49,00:12:50,But I do know that they still do...
00:12:50,00:12:52,You were until not the week finish.
00:12:52,00:12:53,Yeah.
00:12:53,00:12:57,I do know that they still do drills and that they still take a BBC presenter.
00:12:57,00:13:01,Which BBC presenter would you take to your nuclear bunker?
00:13:01,00:13:02,BBC.
00:13:02,00:13:03,It has to be BBC.
00:13:03,00:13:04,Yeah.
00:13:04,00:13:05,I'd probably go for Hugh Edwards.
00:13:05,00:13:06,Would you?
00:13:06,00:13:09,I just want stability and continuity and he provides it.
00:13:09,00:13:10,That's interesting.
00:13:10,00:13:13,"I was thinking, does Dion Dublin do houses under the hammer or something?"
00:13:13,00:13:14,Yeah.
00:13:14,00:13:15,"He could do a great guide to the bunker, couldn't he?"
00:13:15,00:13:16,Yeah.
00:13:16,00:13:17,To improve your bunker.
00:13:17,00:13:19,"But here, that's a solid wall."
00:13:19,00:13:20,That's not...
00:13:20,00:13:21,"Yeah, that's a solid wall too."
00:13:21,00:13:26,"Lots of solid walls in here, very few partition walls."
00:13:26,00:13:30,"I've got one fact about Agadu, just because Angela mentioned it earlier."
00:13:30,00:13:32,So the singer of Agadu...
00:13:32,00:13:33,Black lace.
00:13:33,00:13:34,"Black lace, right?"
00:13:34,00:13:35,You're right.
00:13:35,00:13:36,And the guy is Dean Michael.
00:13:36,00:13:37,So he was sent to prison in 2016.
00:13:37,00:13:38,What was he?
00:13:38,00:13:39,Not for the dance.
00:13:39,00:13:40,And not for the usual...
00:13:40,00:13:42,"He was pushing pineapples, wasn't he?"
00:13:42,00:13:43,Shaking trees.
00:13:43,00:13:44,Brandy coffee.
00:13:44,00:13:47,It was for benefits fraud.
00:13:47,00:13:51,It doesn't come up in the song anywhere.
00:13:51,00:13:52,But he was in for 10 weeks.
00:13:52,00:13:57,He claimed he couldn't walk but then he was also doing gigs on stage where he was dancing
00:13:57,00:13:58,very vigorously.
00:13:58,00:14:04,"I know, we got put away for 10 weeks and anyway, he says, after he came out, he said that"
00:14:04,00:14:12,"while he was in prison, he got through the tough times by leading a giant conga of prisoners."
00:14:12,00:14:18,"That's how they all escaped, isn't it?"
00:14:18,00:14:19,That's so funny.
00:14:19,00:14:25,"At night, the entire wing was singing in chorus, ""Aggadu, dude."""
00:14:25,00:14:29,I sort of missed those days when dances had really clear instructions.
00:14:29,00:14:31,I'm not one of nature's dancers.
00:14:31,00:14:34,"So when they tell me what to do, that superman that was that place as well, wasn't it?"
00:14:34,00:14:35,I knew what to do then.
00:14:35,00:14:38,That was why we all loved the Macarena.
00:14:38,00:14:39,Exactly.
00:14:39,00:14:41,You knew what to do.
00:14:41,00:14:47,There was a movie in 1984 which I'm sure you all know called Footloose.
00:14:47,00:14:52,And it's a story of a teenager who goes to a small town where dancing has been banned
00:14:52,00:14:56,"by the local government, so that's why I'm talking about that."
00:14:56,00:15:00,One of the people who was in this movie was the actor Kevin Bacon.
00:15:00,00:15:06,"He was 24 at the time, but to get himself into the role, he enrolled into a local high"
00:15:06,00:15:12,"school pretending to be a 17-year-old, isn't that amazing?"
00:15:12,00:15:13,Wow.
00:15:13,00:15:14,Was he rumbled?
00:15:14,00:15:15,He was not rumbled.
00:15:15,00:15:16,"How old was he at the time, sorry?"
00:15:16,00:15:20,He was 24 and he was pretending to be 17.
00:15:20,00:15:24,"The principal apparently knew about it, but no one else knew about it at all."
00:15:24,00:15:25,Oh my God.
00:15:25,00:15:28,And he fell in love with Drew Barrymore at the end.
00:15:28,00:15:31,"Well, the amazing thing is he got really badly bullied."
00:15:31,00:15:32,Really?
00:15:32,00:15:36,"He went to the school and he thought, like, his character was that he'd come from the"
00:15:36,00:15:41,"city and he was in like a small town school, and so he was wearing clothes that he imagined"
00:15:41,00:15:47,"a 17-year-old would wear if they'd come from, you know, Philadelphia and gone into a school."
00:15:47,00:15:51,"Obviously, he looked very different than all the other kids and so they just really, really"
00:15:51,00:15:57,bullied him quite badly until one of the kids kind of came and sort of took him under his
00:15:57,00:16:00,"wing and apparently that's kind of something that happens in the movie, although I haven't"
00:16:00,00:16:01,"seen it, so I don't know."
00:16:01,00:16:05,I don't believe that Never Been Kiss was not just entirely based on this story.
00:16:05,00:16:06,"I mean, that is the whole plot."
00:16:06,00:16:07,Is it?
00:16:07,00:16:08,I don't know.
00:16:08,00:16:09,Is Never Been Kiss someone goes back into a school?
00:16:09,00:16:10,"Guys, Drew Barrymore."
00:16:10,00:16:11,She's about 24.
00:16:11,00:16:12,She's a reporter.
00:16:12,00:16:16,She disguises herself as 17-year-old to go back into a school where she gets badly bullied
00:16:16,00:16:18,until someone takes her under their wing.
00:16:18,00:16:20,Was it laid after 1984?
00:16:20,00:16:21,"It certainly was, yeah."
00:16:21,00:16:22,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:22,00:16:23,It's 21 Jump Street.
00:16:23,00:16:24,"That's that as well, isn't it?"
00:16:24,00:16:25,Is it 21 Jump Street?
00:16:25,00:16:26,"Yeah, they do that."
00:16:26,00:16:27,Cops go back to school.
00:16:27,00:16:30,"All I know is, is that the one where there's a meme where he goes, ""How do you do fellow"
00:16:30,00:16:31,"kids?"""
00:16:31,00:16:32,"It's what, is that?"
00:16:32,00:16:33,Is that really what the meme?
00:16:33,00:16:34,I only know the meme.
00:16:34,00:16:35,The meme must come from that.
00:16:35,00:16:40,"And very weirdly, I've got something about banned or official dancers in the USA."
00:16:40,00:16:41,Okay.
00:16:41,00:16:43,"So, and it relates to Hollywood as well."
00:16:43,00:16:44,Right.
00:16:44,00:16:49,"So, the four U.S. states have passed laws designating square dancing the official state"
00:16:49,00:16:50,folk dance.
00:16:50,00:16:51,Right?
00:16:51,00:16:52,I thought you were going to say it was banned.
00:16:52,00:16:53,"No, no, no."
00:16:53,00:16:54,Far from it.
00:16:54,00:16:55,Far from it.
00:16:55,00:17:00,There have been so many attempts to make square dancing the national folk dance.
00:17:00,00:17:03,"And people keep saying at the national level, ""Look, this is not really a national thing."
00:17:03,00:17:05,"We don't, you know, there's lots going on."
00:17:05,00:17:06,"We don't care."""
00:17:06,00:17:07,"So, there are other ones."
00:17:07,00:17:09,"So, like, Hawaii has the hula, obviously."
00:17:09,00:17:11,Kentucky has clogging.
00:17:11,00:17:14,It didn't look into you very much.
00:17:14,00:17:20,Because North Carolina has the Carolina Shag and that's the official dance.
00:17:20,00:17:25,"And there is a 1989 movie starring Bridget Fonda, which is simply called Shag."
00:17:25,00:17:28,And it's about four high school students on a road trip.
00:17:28,00:17:31,I was really disappointed when I went to the movie.
00:17:31,00:17:36,I was expecting a documentary about carpets and I went as a bird lover.
00:17:36,00:17:42,"It culminates in a shagging contest, basically."
00:17:42,00:17:43,Shag dancing contest.
00:17:43,00:17:45,Is the dance anything like a shag?
00:17:45,00:17:46,"I mean, dance though."
00:17:46,00:17:49,It depends how you do it.
00:17:49,00:17:54,"Any dance can be, can't it?"
00:17:54,00:18:01,"OK, it's time for fact number two and that is Andes."
00:18:01,00:18:04,"My fact is that in the 7th century, one of the most impressive things you could be buried"
00:18:04,00:18:08,with was a folding chair.
00:18:08,00:18:10,"That was hot, hot stuff."
00:18:10,00:18:14,"Is that because they were from the future, when you had a time machine?"
00:18:14,00:18:17,"It was not because of that, but that was..."
00:18:17,00:18:21,Usually it's like things that you were buried with as for use in the afterlife.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"Maybe, you know, might want to now sit down."
00:18:24,00:18:25,Always.
00:18:25,00:18:29,"Well, the woman they was found with was in a, they think was in her 40s or 50s."
00:18:29,00:18:32,"And as a woman in her 40s, I could relate to carrying a chair around."
00:18:32,00:18:34,Where are you going?
00:18:34,00:18:37,"Yeah, this is the thing."
00:18:37,00:18:40,"They're normally found in women's graves, the kind of grave goods."
00:18:40,00:18:45,"And about 30 medieval gravesites have been found with chair burials, as they call them."
00:18:45,00:18:47,"This latest one, it's quite a recent find."
00:18:47,00:18:49,It dates back to about 600 AD.
00:18:49,00:18:55,"And it's kind of, it might not be that they were very, very powerful, wealthy people in"
00:18:55,00:18:56,life.
00:18:56,00:18:59,It's kind of because they're often buried with lots of humble grave goods as well.
00:18:59,00:19:01,But they seem to be kind of spiritually significant.
00:19:01,00:19:02,"Oh, really?"
00:19:02,00:19:03,They're having a folding chair.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"It seems, yeah."
00:19:04,00:19:06,Like a wise woman kind of thing.
00:19:06,00:19:07,Exactly.
00:19:07,00:19:08,A healer or a magician.
00:19:08,00:19:09,"I think, I've misunderstood."
00:19:09,00:19:11,So they were buried sat on the chair?
00:19:11,00:19:12,"No, I think the chair was just included."
00:19:12,00:19:14,"It was just included, like, as their favorite chair."
00:19:14,00:19:18,"I wouldn't have the image of it, I'm lowered on a chair."
00:19:18,00:19:19,No.
00:19:19,00:19:22,There's an archaeologist called Bettina Pfaff.
00:19:22,00:19:26,"And who, she thinks that these women, it's mostly women, belong to a kind of spiritual"
00:19:26,00:19:27,elite.
00:19:27,00:19:28,How interesting.
00:19:28,00:19:29,Yeah.
00:19:29,00:19:32,"So in life, they would sit on the chair whilst reading someone's palm or something, presumably."
00:19:32,00:19:36,"Maybe, yeah, or leading a ceremony or something, and they were buried with it."
00:19:36,00:19:37,Yeah.
00:19:37,00:19:38,Cool.
00:19:38,00:19:39,And where was this?
00:19:39,00:19:40,In Europe?
00:19:40,00:19:41,"Across lots of Europe, yeah."
00:19:41,00:19:42,"Germany, especially, I think."
00:19:42,00:19:43,Quite a lot in Germany.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"Oh, really?"
00:19:44,00:19:45,Yeah.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"Yeah, big deal."
00:19:46,00:19:50,"So I did a series called ""You Can't Take It With You"" on Radio 4, which is about, it started"
00:19:50,00:19:55,"off being about when my dad died, we went a bit mad putting stuff in the coffin to the"
00:19:55,00:19:57,point we thought we might have to take him out.
00:19:57,00:20:02,Just filled it up with stuff.
00:20:02,00:20:06,"And so I got really into sort of reading about grave goods a bit, and one of my favorite"
00:20:06,00:20:12,things I found was a website where you can buy a coffin with drawers in so that you can
00:20:12,00:20:15,put the goods for the person in the drawers.
00:20:15,00:20:20,"And my favorite line on this website says, ""If you do choose to bury the deceased with"
00:20:20,00:20:24,"some personal items, it's important to remember that these are items you will not get back."""
00:20:24,00:20:25,That is useful.
00:20:25,00:20:29,He's putting their car keys in there.
00:20:29,00:20:30,Wow.
00:20:30,00:20:31,That's amazing.
00:20:31,00:20:34,I didn't even think that was like a modern thing to put grave goods in.
00:20:34,00:20:35,No.
00:20:35,00:20:38,"The drawers at the bottom, sort of under the body, are they?"
00:20:38,00:20:39,Yeah.
00:20:39,00:20:42,"I think it's a bit cruel, because if they do go to an afterlife, have they got access"
00:20:42,00:20:43,to those drawers?
00:20:43,00:20:47,"Yeah, because they're all, I've got my favorite things, but I can't get them."
00:20:47,00:20:52,"I think it started with when my dad died, he had his head was on this sort of lacy pillow."
00:20:52,00:20:53,It just wasn't right.
00:20:53,00:20:54,My dad ran a sex shop for a living.
00:20:54,00:20:55,It didn't look right.
00:20:55,00:20:58,It sounds like it could fit by running to a sex shop.
00:20:58,00:21:01,His girlfriend replaced it with some inflatable breasts.
00:21:01,00:21:02,Wow.
00:21:02,00:21:03,That is brilliant.
00:21:03,00:21:07,Imagine the archeologists in such a place.
00:21:07,00:21:09,I love imagining that.
00:21:09,00:21:13,And they'll jump to such conclusions about our entire society.
00:21:13,00:21:15,"He thinks it's sex wizard, we think."
00:21:15,00:21:19,"Well, actually, he was cremated, so, and that's the other thing."
00:21:19,00:21:23,"So I started asking people, A, about what they would want buried with them, and B, what"
00:21:23,00:21:27,"they would put in my coffin, because I just thought you don't get a say, do you, at that"
00:21:27,00:21:28,point?
00:21:28,00:21:30,Someone else is deciding what you want to say with you.
00:21:30,00:21:33,"And of course, most people I spoke to were going to be cremated, and so everyone would"
00:21:33,00:21:34,say popcorn kernels.
00:21:34,00:21:37,So I'm going to build my coffin with.
00:21:37,00:21:38,That's fun.
00:21:38,00:21:39,That's fun.
00:21:39,00:21:40,A little fireworks.
00:21:40,00:21:43,"Yeah, fireworks or cannabis, something just to make it a bit more fun."
00:21:43,00:21:48,"So yeah, chairs, folding chairs that go back a long way, which makes sense, actually."
00:21:48,00:21:55,"There's a book on chairs by a guy called Rittold Rybsinski, and I always come back to this"
00:21:55,00:21:56,in my research.
00:21:56,00:22:00,"It's such a good book, but he says he thinks the oldest chairs ever will have been folding."
00:22:00,00:22:03,"It's a cracker, I'm telling you."
00:22:03,00:22:06,I disagree with Mr. Rybsinski or whatever he was called.
00:22:06,00:22:08,You don't think the oldest chairs are folding?
00:22:08,00:22:11,"I don't really, because I think the oldest chair would be literally just a box."
00:22:11,00:22:14,And I think it requires something extra to.
00:22:14,00:22:18,"I think once you've made it into, once you've used some human skill rather than just sitting"
00:22:18,00:22:23,"on a flat rock and claiming it's a chair, because it would be nomadic societies."
00:22:23,00:22:27,So I think the oldest evidence of folding chairs we have might be ancient Mongolian
00:22:27,00:22:30,societies who were nomadic.
00:22:30,00:22:33,So the important people would take a chair with them.
00:22:33,00:22:34,And that's.
00:22:34,00:22:35,That's great.
00:22:35,00:22:39,"And they looked exactly like those beach chairs that you get, you know, the old people sitting"
00:22:39,00:22:40,on beaches.
00:22:40,00:22:42,There are eight folding stools in the British Museum.
00:22:42,00:22:43,Wow.
00:22:43,00:22:44,Wow.
00:22:44,00:22:45,And the earliest one is.
00:22:45,00:22:46,What for just people to sit in.
00:22:46,00:22:52,"Such a good point, because they have those people who sit and make sure you don't steal"
00:22:52,00:22:53,anything.
00:22:53,00:22:54,Don't you?
00:22:54,00:22:55,And they sit on little stools.
00:22:55,00:22:56,"Also very old, those people."
00:22:56,00:22:57,A lot of the time.
00:22:57,00:23:03,"The oldest one they have is from the 18th Dynasty of Egypt, which is 1500 BC to 1800"
00:23:03,00:23:04,BC.
00:23:04,00:23:05,So that's pretty old.
00:23:05,00:23:06,Wow.
00:23:06,00:23:07,"And how, what do they look like?"
00:23:07,00:23:09,How easily foldable are they?
00:23:09,00:23:15,They just look like an X with a pivot in where the two lines of the X meet and then a little
00:23:15,00:23:18,"bit of cloth on the top, although the cloth is rotted away because that's."
00:23:18,00:23:19,Yeah.
00:23:19,00:23:20,Perished.
00:23:20,00:23:23,"So easier than a beach deck chair, which I still can't do."
00:23:23,00:23:24,No.
00:23:24,00:23:26,Stripey beach deck chairs are just there to torment me.
00:23:26,00:23:27,They're a struggle.
00:23:27,00:23:28,It's like a Brompton.
00:23:28,00:23:29,Your fingers won't survive.
00:23:29,00:23:34,"Um, lots of folding chairs are big for lots of people."
00:23:34,00:23:35,"So I mean, James, you mentioned the Egyptian ones."
00:23:35,00:23:36,Tutankhamun had one.
00:23:36,00:23:39,"Tutankhamun had a couple in this tomb, I think."
00:23:39,00:23:40,One was Ebony and Ivory.
00:23:40,00:23:41,Pretty cool.
00:23:41,00:23:44,Bishops had a folding chair in medieval times.
00:23:44,00:23:45,That was a huge deal.
00:23:45,00:23:50,"And, um, there was a thing called the Cathedral, which is the bishop's official throne."
00:23:50,00:23:53,"But if you were traveling around your diocese or whatever it was, you'd have to have a"
00:23:53,00:23:54,traveling.
00:23:54,00:23:55,A travel phone.
00:23:55,00:23:56,A travel phone.
00:23:56,00:23:57,Pretty much.
00:23:57,00:23:58,That's amazing.
00:23:58,00:23:59,A traveling cathedral.
00:23:59,00:24:00,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:00,00:24:01,Travel through.
00:24:01,00:24:07,"Speaking of religion and chairs, not a folding chair as such, but is it a myth, the papal"
00:24:07,00:24:09,"chair, the hole in the papal chair?"
00:24:09,00:24:10,That is a myth.
00:24:10,00:24:11,That is a myth.
00:24:11,00:24:12,The hole.
00:24:12,00:24:14,"So the whole Pope Joan thing, isn't it?"
00:24:14,00:24:20,"Like, Pope Joan, the supposed ninth century lady pope who probably didn't exist."
00:24:20,00:24:24,"And that they then, the papal chair, had a hole in it so that their genitalia could"
00:24:24,00:24:27,be inspected from beneath to check they weren't a woman.
00:24:27,00:24:28,And then they'd shout.
00:24:28,00:24:33,"There'd be some cry when they're like, he's got knackers in Latin, and then we can continue"
00:24:33,00:24:35,with the Catholic Church.
00:24:35,00:24:38,"It's like, yeah, I think that definitely is a myth."
00:24:38,00:24:39,It's a myth.
00:24:39,00:24:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:40,00:24:43,And that's what happened these days for real.
00:24:43,00:24:47,"I was, there seemed to be a spate of people getting their testicles trapped in folding"
00:24:47,00:24:48,chair.
00:24:48,00:24:49,Oh God.
00:24:49,00:24:51,I didn't even have some of my eyes watered.
00:24:51,00:24:55,"I didn't read about any popes doing it, maybe those just didn't make the news."
00:24:55,00:24:56,It's so common.
00:24:56,00:24:59,"Well, I looked, I thought, I think I was just looking at the chair accidents."
00:24:59,00:25:04,And I came across like a just a 60-something year old man in 2018 who was sitting in his
00:25:04,00:25:08,"folding chair, which had little slats before we got to the shower."
00:25:08,00:25:13,"And they fell through and couldn't get them out, had to have the fibregaine come."
00:25:13,00:25:16,"His testicles is that because they do, they do hang lower in older men, don't they?"
00:25:16,00:25:17,Where?
00:25:17,00:25:20,"It's interesting you say that because all the stories I found, which were then, I think"
00:25:20,00:25:23,"I found five different stories, they were all older men."
00:25:23,00:25:27,"The rubber perishes as time goes on, and there's a certain."
00:25:27,00:25:28,Like a worn out slinky.
00:25:28,00:25:33,"Yeah, there's more given system."
00:25:33,00:25:34,"Yeah, it's tough."
00:25:34,00:25:37,There are some great photos there if you want to look at them.
00:25:37,00:25:39,What are the photos of?
00:25:39,00:25:44,"It's mostly like there's a man lying on a stretcher, but he's obviously still sitting"
00:25:44,00:25:46,on the chair.
00:25:46,00:25:50,"Actually, if you go to Blackpool, you know those cutouts where you can put your head"
00:25:50,00:25:51,in.
00:25:51,00:25:52,There's one of those.
00:25:52,00:25:56,A dangling pair of testicles stuck through a deck chair.
00:25:56,00:25:59,They have to have the fibregaine on hand at all times.
00:25:59,00:26:02,"Because it's scary when the fibregaine turn up, because they've got things like angle"
00:26:02,00:26:05,"grinders and they've got all sorts of big kit, haven't they?"
00:26:05,00:26:08,"It doesn't really go for the fibregaine, I would have thought."
00:26:08,00:26:09,It goes for a delicate.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Surgeon.
00:26:10,00:26:11,A massaging.
00:26:11,00:26:12,Yeah.
00:26:12,00:26:13,Some oils.
00:26:13,00:26:15,They have to cut the chairs.
00:26:15,00:26:19,"I think there's sometimes no mass and level of massaging you can do, which is a bit frightening."
00:26:19,00:26:20,Yeah.
00:26:20,00:26:23,"And I have to say I respected the fire, it was firemen, two firemen so much in one photo"
00:26:23,00:26:28,"I saw who had such grave looks on their faces, which I imagine took a huge amount of effort"
00:26:28,00:26:31,to try to free some of those testicles from a chair.
00:26:31,00:26:35,"We used to call it, so I used to be a nurse and you'd call it the nurses mask or the,"
00:26:35,00:26:37,and I think firemen had the same thing.
00:26:37,00:26:41,"Because sometimes you'd see things that were funny or that were horrific and you can't,"
00:26:41,00:26:44,"you know, you can't take a bandage off and go, oh my God, you know, you have to just"
00:26:44,00:26:48,"sort of maintain this kind of nurses mask and they call it, yeah."
00:26:48,00:26:50,Is it a sort of a creepy grin?
00:26:50,00:26:51,Amazing.
00:26:51,00:26:56,Do you know who the first person to use the word deck chair was?
00:26:56,00:27:00,"We're going to say invented the word deck chair, but famous person, famous person."
00:27:00,00:27:01,So it's gettable.
00:27:01,00:27:02,"Oh, no."
00:27:02,00:27:06,I'd be astonished if you guys use the word deck chair.
00:27:06,00:27:07,Give us a century.
00:27:07,00:27:13,"1880s, author of a children's book, often ran a service car."
00:27:13,00:27:14,"Oh, Louis Carlsson."
00:27:14,00:27:15,"No, that's not 1880s."
00:27:15,00:27:16,1880s.
00:27:16,00:27:19,"Oh, Kenneth Graham, who wrote The Wind and the Willows."
00:27:19,00:27:20,"All good one, but no."
00:27:20,00:27:21,British?
00:27:21,00:27:22,"British, yeah."
00:27:22,00:27:24,British children's of the 1880s.
00:27:24,00:27:25,1880s.
00:27:25,00:27:26,It's tough.
00:27:26,00:27:27,Robert Louis Stevenson.
00:27:27,00:27:28,No.
00:27:28,00:27:30,You like it because you wrote the pirate books?
00:27:30,00:27:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:27:31,00:27:32,Think of that surname.
00:27:32,00:27:33,Stevenson.
00:27:33,00:27:36,I think of what else Stevenson's are related to.
00:27:36,00:27:38,That's Stevenson's rocket was the first train.
00:27:38,00:27:39,"Oh, Nesbit."
00:27:39,00:27:40,"Oh, Nesbit."
00:27:40,00:27:42,"Yeah, yeah, I wrote my place."
00:27:42,00:27:43,That was good.
00:27:43,00:27:45,That was stunningly good.
00:27:45,00:27:51,"Ian Nesbit, who wrote The Railway Children, deck chair was first used in that book."
00:27:51,00:27:53,"Also, great clue giving from Stevenson."
00:27:53,00:27:54,"Yeah, that was."
00:27:54,00:27:56,It was a great throw and a great catch.
00:27:56,00:27:58,I enjoyed that very much.
00:27:58,00:28:00,It was good part of the audience.
00:28:00,00:28:01,On either side.
00:28:01,00:28:04,Some other words invented by Ian Nesbit in the OED.
00:28:04,00:28:07,"Brecky, snarky and zooming."
00:28:07,00:28:08,Wow.
00:28:08,00:28:10,Zooming as in moving around quickly.
00:28:10,00:28:11,My dog gets the zoomies.
00:28:11,00:28:12,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:12,00:28:13,"Zooming, yeah."
00:28:13,00:28:14,"Wait, what does the dog do?"
00:28:14,00:28:16,It's called a zoomie.
00:28:16,00:28:18,"Yeah, she gets some zoomie."
00:28:18,00:28:19,"Of course, my mum."
00:28:19,00:28:23,"You know, when dogs just get really hyper excited, they just run about."
00:28:23,00:28:24,They call it the zoomies.
00:28:24,00:28:25,Is that what the zoomies is?
00:28:25,00:28:26,Yeah.
00:28:26,00:28:28,I thought the zoomies was a drug thing.
00:28:28,00:28:30,It might also be that.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"It's drug paraphernalia, your honour."
00:28:32,00:28:34,Wow.
00:28:34,00:28:37,Do they ban the deck chairs on Bournemouth Beach?
00:28:37,00:28:39,I think it was last year.
00:28:39,00:28:42,"There was, so, oh, they stopped renting them out."
00:28:42,00:28:45,You didn't get a rescue if you bought your own deck chair.
00:28:45,00:28:49,Wouldn't immediate climb down from a promising little hill.
00:28:49,00:28:51,It's a molehill now.
00:28:51,00:28:53,"It was a government thing, or a council thing."
00:28:53,00:28:54,It was a council thing.
00:28:54,00:28:55,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:55,00:28:57,Because they were afraid they were going to be used as weapons.
00:28:57,00:28:58,Really?
00:28:58,00:29:00,I couldn't really find any evidence that they have been used as weapons.
00:29:00,00:29:02,"It feels like a pretext, doesn't it?"
00:29:02,00:29:03,"It does, but for what, why?"
00:29:03,00:29:04,Why didn't they want to rent them out?
00:29:04,00:29:06,It lost the council about 200 grand that year.
00:29:06,00:29:07,Really?
00:29:07,00:29:13,How would they think that you'd go around and sort of snap old men's testicles on them?
00:29:13,00:29:19,"I suppose chairs as weapons is, like, every time there's any sort of football violence, whatever,"
00:29:19,00:29:22,"it's always plastic chairs being thrown around, isn't it?"
00:29:22,00:29:23,"Oh, it's plastic one."
00:29:23,00:29:25,"And in wrestling, of course, they have the steel chair,"
00:29:25,00:29:27,but it's very rarely the deck chair.
00:29:27,00:29:29,He's getting out the deck chair.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"Oh, he's still getting it out."
00:29:31,00:29:33,He wants it out.
00:29:33,00:29:36,You're in trouble.
00:29:36,00:29:39,"You talked about Bournemouth, Anna, I think."
00:29:39,00:29:43,There was an article in 2021 in the Telegraph about deck chairs in Scarborough.
00:29:43,00:29:46,"This was a 58-year-old woman called Dawn Avison,"
00:29:46,00:29:50,who runs the last remaining deck chair concession in Scarborough.
00:29:50,00:29:54,"She's got what they described as a deep mahogany tan,"
00:29:54,00:29:57,"and apparently locally it's known as Scarborough Rust,"
00:29:57,00:30:01,which is if you work on the beach.
00:30:01,00:30:03,That's your tan that you have.
00:30:03,00:30:06,"And she said that last summer,"
00:30:06,00:30:09,former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson
00:30:09,00:30:12,sat down on one of her deck chairs for a selfie
00:30:12,00:30:14,and then left without paying.
00:30:14,00:30:15,What?
00:30:15,00:30:17,"And now he's a minister without portfolio,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,"so I think that just says, you know..."
00:30:19,00:30:20,Wow.
00:30:20,00:30:22,He's a man who I genuinely don't think could put up a deck chair.
00:30:22,00:30:24,"Gavin Williamson, no."
00:30:24,00:30:27,"I don't think any of them could, because they're the current cabinet."
00:30:27,00:30:29,Can I tell you one bit of folding chair news?
00:30:29,00:30:30,Yeah.
00:30:30,00:30:33,"Are you guys familiar with Sidney Jo, the 27-year-old tiktoker?"
00:30:33,00:30:34,Of course.
00:30:34,00:30:35,There you go.
00:30:35,00:30:36,I knew you would be...
00:30:36,00:30:37,27-year-old tiktoker.
00:30:37,00:30:40,"I don't know anything about tiktok, but that feels old."
00:30:40,00:30:43,"Well, she's appealing to the youth."
00:30:43,00:30:46,"So she got stuck in a folding chair,"
00:30:46,00:30:48,which is kind of amazing.
00:30:48,00:30:50,There's a picture and she's looking at her body
00:30:50,00:30:52,"through the middle of it, it's folded around her,"
00:30:52,00:30:54,and she had to be removed by the fire brigade.
00:30:54,00:30:56,"I think this was last year,"
00:30:56,00:30:58,"and they used jaws of life,"
00:30:58,00:31:00,the hydraulic things that you used
00:31:00,00:31:03,"to extract people from crashed cars and stuff,"
00:31:03,00:31:05,which sounds quite frightening.
00:31:05,00:31:07,And the reason that she'd got stuck
00:31:07,00:31:11,is because she has a $199 per minute channel
00:31:11,00:31:14,"where she gets stuck in things and then frees herself,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,and it went wrong.
00:31:16,00:31:18,"Oh, what do you mean?"
00:31:18,00:31:21,It's like people pay to watch their escape from stuff.
00:31:21,00:31:24,"Yes, I think we're all asking, is this a sex thing?"
00:31:24,00:31:25,"Yeah, yeah."
00:31:25,00:31:28,"Look, it says it's a fetish channel."
00:31:28,00:31:30,That sounds like sex.
00:31:30,00:31:32,"I'm not down with all the lingo,"
00:31:32,00:31:34,but I think that is a sex thing.
00:31:34,00:31:37,"God, the poor, bloody fire brigade in her local area."
00:31:37,00:31:38,"Hello, it's me."
00:31:38,00:31:39,This is me again.
00:31:39,00:31:40,Yes.
00:31:40,00:31:42,"No, a washing machine this time, yeah."
00:31:42,00:31:51,"Okay, it's time for fact number three,"
00:31:51,00:31:53,and that is my fact.
00:31:53,00:31:56,This week is that most people dislike kale
00:31:56,00:31:59,before they're even born.
00:31:59,00:32:02,That's how long lasting the loathing is.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"This is this weird thing that came out recently,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,"and it's quite a small study,"
00:32:06,00:32:09,"but it looked at ultrasound scans in 70,"
00:32:09,00:32:13,"about 70 pregnant women in the late in the third trimester,"
00:32:13,00:32:16,and then they got the pregnant women to take capsules
00:32:16,00:32:21,of either powdered kale or powdered carrot or nothing.
00:32:21,00:32:24,"And then they looked at what the fetuses were doing,"
00:32:24,00:32:27,and the fetuses made the facial expressions
00:32:27,00:32:29,"that, well, when they had the kale,"
00:32:29,00:32:31,they made the facial expression they make when they cry.
00:32:31,00:32:35,An unmistakable kind of wint of displeasure.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"I mean, we're not 100%,"
00:32:37,00:32:39,"and that's what a fetus means when it makes that face,"
00:32:39,00:32:40,but come on.
00:32:40,00:32:42,"It feels like ethical issues here, right?"
00:32:42,00:32:44,"If you're making your fetus unhappy, making it cry."
00:32:44,00:32:45,You're right.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"The ethical issues with feeding people kale,"
00:32:47,00:32:50,that's every parent who makes their kid eat vegetables.
00:32:50,00:32:52,So at what point is the baby crying?
00:32:52,00:32:54,"Because obviously the mother's eating the, takes the capsule,"
00:32:54,00:32:56,"so they're waiting for it to,"
00:32:56,00:32:58,"how do they know that that, at that point,"
00:32:58,00:33:00,that the baby's receiving the kale?
00:33:00,00:33:02,"I think it was, they waited 20 minutes,"
00:33:02,00:33:03,"and I think by that point,"
00:33:03,00:33:05,whatever you've eaten has filtered through
00:33:05,00:33:07,"to the amniotic fluid, whatever it is."
00:33:07,00:33:10,"So the flavor, they know the chemical is in there at that point."
00:33:10,00:33:11,Right.
00:33:11,00:33:13,And they can compare it to the people who've had the carrot
00:33:13,00:33:15,or the nothing and see at an exact moment
00:33:15,00:33:16,when their expression changes.
00:33:16,00:33:19,"But it might be a benevolent thing, actually,"
00:33:19,00:33:23,"because if theoretically you eat lots of kale in pregnancy,"
00:33:23,00:33:27,you might then be able to stop your child hating kale
00:33:27,00:33:31,"in outside pregnancy, in childhood."
00:33:31,00:33:32,I think that works.
00:33:32,00:33:33,"That does work a bit, I think."
00:33:33,00:33:37,"It's possible that you can prevent fussy eating, basically,"
00:33:37,00:33:40,by just exposing the child to as many flavors as possible early on.
00:33:40,00:33:41,Right.
00:33:41,00:33:42,It's a bit less unfamiliar later on
00:33:42,00:33:44,when you're giving them whatever for the first time.
00:33:44,00:33:46,Obviously the problem being that you'll feel so ill
00:33:46,00:33:49,for most of your pregnancy that you will only eat bread and biscuit.
00:33:49,00:33:53,"Okay, I think my mum must have mostly eaten refined sugar jelly."
00:33:53,00:33:55,"But they actually like the carrots,"
00:33:55,00:33:56,which I find quite surprising.
00:33:56,00:33:58,"I know carrots are sweet, everyone always says,"
00:33:58,00:34:00,"but they're no whisper bar, are they?"
00:34:00,00:34:02,"If you've never had a whisper bar,"
00:34:02,00:34:04,"if all you've got to compare it to is kale,"
00:34:04,00:34:05,then carrots are pretty good.
00:34:05,00:34:06,You're absolutely right.
00:34:06,00:34:08,"Yeah, they did a little sort of smile,"
00:34:08,00:34:10,sort of fetus equivalent of a smile
00:34:10,00:34:12,when they tasted the carrot twice as often
00:34:12,00:34:13,as when they tasted nothing.
00:34:13,00:34:15,I wonder if that's because the carrots help them see
00:34:15,00:34:18,"in the dark and then it's like, ""Oh, I can see where I am!"""
00:34:18,00:34:21,"Oh, and it's gross."
00:34:21,00:34:23,"But yeah, it is..."
00:34:23,00:34:24,I don't think kale's that bad.
00:34:24,00:34:26,I think I can't taste bitterness as much as some people.
00:34:26,00:34:27,It's all right.
00:34:27,00:34:30,I had some in research for this podcast
00:34:30,00:34:32,when I knew we were going to be talking about kale.
00:34:32,00:34:35,I went and had a sort of salad and...
00:34:35,00:34:37,"Then as in you searched out the kale,"
00:34:37,00:34:39,because I don't have kale in the house anyway.
00:34:39,00:34:41,"Right, so I never do."
00:34:41,00:34:42,"No, no, no."
00:34:42,00:34:44,I went to a cafe.
00:34:44,00:34:47,"I was like, ""I'll have that kale salad, please."""
00:34:47,00:34:49,I was pleasantly surprised.
00:34:49,00:34:51,I thought it was horrible and I don't mind it.
00:34:51,00:34:53,I feel like kale was only invented
00:34:53,00:34:55,sort of about 10 years ago.
00:34:55,00:34:57,I wasn't eating kale in my childhood.
00:34:57,00:34:58,I was eating cabbage.
00:34:58,00:35:00,"It was pretty much 2012 when it kicked off,"
00:35:00,00:35:01,"2011, 2012."
00:35:01,00:35:03,"And before that, literally no one ate it."
00:35:03,00:35:06,I think kale was invented in 1976.
00:35:06,00:35:07,This was...
00:35:07,00:35:10,It was the year I was invented.
00:35:10,00:35:13,"You had a twin, kale."
00:35:13,00:35:14,This was...
00:35:14,00:35:16,I didn't eat it in the womb.
00:35:16,00:35:18,Unlike my other twin.
00:35:18,00:35:21,This was New York Times food critic Mimi Sheraton.
00:35:21,00:35:23,"In fact, she was the first female restaurant critic"
00:35:23,00:35:25,at the New York Times.
00:35:25,00:35:27,And she wrote about how great kale was.
00:35:27,00:35:29,"And at that time, literally no one ate kale"
00:35:29,00:35:31,"in the United States,"
00:35:31,00:35:33,but she helped to make it popular.
00:35:33,00:35:35,But they interviewed her a couple of years ago
00:35:35,00:35:39,and she said she really regrets now making kale popular.
00:35:39,00:35:41,She says...
00:35:41,00:35:44,"Well, she says she read through the article"
00:35:44,00:35:47,and she realizes that in those days she liked kale
00:35:47,00:35:49,because it was cooked properly.
00:35:49,00:35:51,"And in these days, people serve it raw."
00:35:51,00:35:54,"They kind of roast it like I often have roasted kale,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,"which is, you know, it does taste quite burnt"
00:35:56,00:35:58,and not the way I cook anyway.
00:35:58,00:36:00,Do you make kale crisps?
00:36:00,00:36:01,I've tried so many times to do that.
00:36:01,00:36:03,"And every time I went up, we just burnt kale."
00:36:03,00:36:05,I think that's just how it's meant to be.
00:36:05,00:36:07,You've just been confused by the word crisps and the fact that...
00:36:07,00:36:08,Right.
00:36:08,00:36:10,I thought it was going to come out like golden wonder.
00:36:10,00:36:12,All the recipes claim it's heaven.
00:36:12,00:36:14,It's kind of okay.
00:36:14,00:36:17,"But Mimi Sheraton says if you eat it like you're supposed to eat it,"
00:36:17,00:36:19,"which is like a winter vegetable,"
00:36:19,00:36:21,"like you might have cabbage or something like that,"
00:36:21,00:36:23,"quite often boiled or stewed or stuff like that,"
00:36:23,00:36:25,then it's really delicious.
00:36:25,00:36:27,"But these days, the way that people cook it is wrong"
00:36:27,00:36:29,and she feels quite responsible for that.
00:36:29,00:36:31,That's so interesting.
00:36:31,00:36:33,"That is the one thing I think my Nan might have got it right,"
00:36:33,00:36:35,that you do have to boil it for three days.
00:36:35,00:36:36,Yeah.
00:36:36,00:36:38,"Oh, well, do you know what you're supposed to do"
00:36:38,00:36:40,if you don't have three days?
00:36:40,00:36:42,You're supposed to massage it.
00:36:42,00:36:44,Which I did not know.
00:36:44,00:36:46,And this completely transforms kale.
00:36:46,00:36:48,"A, it stops it making you fart."
00:36:48,00:36:50,"And B, it stops it tasting bitter."
00:36:50,00:36:52,And this is if you...
00:36:52,00:36:54,"Before you do anything to it, you just give it..."
00:36:54,00:36:56,If you massage it with a whisper bar.
00:36:56,00:36:59,"No, it's because it has a lot of sugars that don't get broken down"
00:36:59,00:37:01,until they're waved through your digestive system
00:37:01,00:37:03,and your large intestine.
00:37:03,00:37:05,"So A, then that gives you lots of bad gas."
00:37:05,00:37:08,"B, that means that on the way through, you're not tasting those sugars"
00:37:08,00:37:10,and so it tastes bitter.
00:37:10,00:37:12,"But if you massage, and I meant to try this,"
00:37:12,00:37:14,"but I didn't do the first time research,"
00:37:14,00:37:16,but I'm sure people will write in.
00:37:16,00:37:18,"But yeah, if you squeeze it properly,"
00:37:18,00:37:20,"just like you're rubbing it in before you cook it,"
00:37:20,00:37:22,then it tastes much sweeter and much nicer.
00:37:22,00:37:24,"So not with oil or anything, just with..."
00:37:24,00:37:26,"With your fingers, yeah."
00:37:26,00:37:28,"I mean, I'm giving it a full-on massage."
00:37:28,00:37:30,"Like some candles, yeah."
00:37:30,00:37:32,It's romantic music on.
00:37:32,00:37:35,"I've got to say, I also thought it had been invented in 2012"
00:37:35,00:37:38,"and I didn't realise it was really huge in previous centuries,"
00:37:38,00:37:40,especially in Scotland.
00:37:40,00:37:42,And I didn't know this at all.
00:37:42,00:37:45,And it was because it can grow for a start
00:37:45,00:37:48,"in quite tough Northern climates, which is a good thing."
00:37:48,00:37:51,"And also it grows over the January to April period,"
00:37:51,00:37:53,"which got called the Hungry Gap,"
00:37:53,00:37:56,which is where lots of previous crops might be running a bit low.
00:37:56,00:37:59,And so it's a very useful staple food.
00:37:59,00:38:02,And it's all this Scots dialect about kale.
00:38:02,00:38:05,"All these words, like a kale bell is a dinner bell."
00:38:05,00:38:08,"Kale was used interchangeably with food,"
00:38:08,00:38:10,as in kale might just mean food.
00:38:10,00:38:12,And there were sayings as well.
00:38:12,00:38:15,Have you heard called kale het again?
00:38:15,00:38:17,Called kale het again.
00:38:17,00:38:19,"No, what does that mean?"
00:38:19,00:38:21,Cold kale heated up again.
00:38:21,00:38:23,"Oh, it's that simple."
00:38:23,00:38:25,What does that mean as a say?
00:38:25,00:38:27,"Oh, I see."
00:38:27,00:38:29,It means that he's washed up.
00:38:29,00:38:32,"Yeah, later in life, it's a comeback almost."
00:38:32,00:38:35,"That's nice. That's much more positive than the real meaning,"
00:38:35,00:38:38,which is that I've heard this story dozens of times before.
00:38:38,00:38:40,This is called kale het again.
00:38:40,00:38:42,"Oh, God, that's useful."
00:38:42,00:38:44,Start using that constant.
00:38:44,00:38:46,A lot of my relations.
00:38:46,00:38:48,I'll give him his kale through the reek.
00:38:48,00:38:50,Through the reek. What is a reek?
00:38:50,00:38:52,Through the reek.
00:38:52,00:38:54,The old reek he is Edinburgh.
00:38:54,00:38:57,"Through the nose, through the nose."
00:38:57,00:39:00,"Yeah, because reek means smell."
00:39:00,00:39:03,It means what you say when someone farts.
00:39:03,00:39:06,"As if someone's farts in the room, you don't know who it is,"
00:39:06,00:39:09,"and you're like, ""Oh, I'll give some more kale through the reek."""
00:39:09,00:39:11,All lovely guesses.
00:39:11,00:39:13,So reek is smoke.
00:39:13,00:39:16,"And basically, I'll give him his kale through the reek."
00:39:16,00:39:18,It means I'm going to treat someone badly.
00:39:18,00:39:22,"I'm going to hand you your kale for dinner through the smoke of the fire,"
00:39:22,00:39:24,so it tastes gross.
00:39:24,00:39:27,"Oh, so it's roasted instead of massaged."
00:39:27,00:39:29,"Exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:39:29,00:39:31,"The word for garden was kale yard, really, wasn't it?"
00:39:31,00:39:34,"For a small vegetable garden, it was kale yard from about 14th century."
00:39:34,00:39:37,"And then it morphed into kale yard fiction,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,which I was not familiar with.
00:39:39,00:39:42,"But this is, well, can you guess what kale yard fiction is?"
00:39:42,00:39:45,It makes you cry. It makes you grimace.
00:39:45,00:39:47,It's sob stories.
00:39:47,00:39:49,It makes you do all of those things.
00:39:49,00:39:51,Written since 2012.
00:39:51,00:39:53,And it makes you fart.
00:39:53,00:39:56,"OK, I don't know if it does any of those things."
00:39:56,00:40:00,"It's just a derogatory term for sort of a really bucolic, overly sentimentalised,"
00:40:00,00:40:06,"rural, rustic fiction, because, you know, it's like old-fashioned kale yards in Scotland."
00:40:06,00:40:10,And J.M. Barrie was accused of being a kale yard writer.
00:40:10,00:40:14,"For his books like, ""Old Lich Iddils."""
00:40:14,00:40:20,I read an article on Atlas Obscura about Halloween in Scotland.
00:40:20,00:40:24,"I don't know if you saw this, about how kale was quite popular in that time."
00:40:24,00:40:27,Because it was kind of the growing season of kale.
00:40:27,00:40:29,"Like you said, it was more of a winter vegetable."
00:40:29,00:40:32,"But apparently, youths would blindfold each other,"
00:40:32,00:40:37,"pull stalks of kale from the ground, and then analyse their length and girth,"
00:40:37,00:40:40,"and the amount of dirt caked onto them,"
00:40:40,00:40:43,and it would tell them what kind of partner they'll marry.
00:40:43,00:40:46,Why do they have to be blindfolded?
00:40:46,00:40:53,"And then you could say, ""Oh, I think I'll marry that tall, girthy, non-soiled girl."""
00:40:53,00:40:55,No one wants a soiled girl.
00:40:55,00:40:57,But I guess that's what you would do then.
00:40:57,00:41:01,"You'd go around the bars looking for a soiled, girthy woman."
00:41:01,00:41:03,"The first one you said kale used in Halloween,"
00:41:03,00:41:06,I thought it was going to be the world's most disappointing trick or treat.
00:41:06,00:41:09,Have you never bobbed for kale?
00:41:09,00:41:12,"When I was a young girl in the '80s,"
00:41:12,00:41:14,"trick or treat wasn't a thing, really."
00:41:14,00:41:17,"When it started to come in, I remember my mum."
00:41:17,00:41:20,"There was a ring at the doorbell, and these two kids said trick or treat,"
00:41:20,00:41:22,and my mum didn't know what it meant at all.
00:41:22,00:41:24,It just hadn't been a thing here.
00:41:24,00:41:26,"And so my mum went, ""Oh, treat! Two of this week!"""
00:41:26,00:41:28,She shot the doorbell.
00:41:28,00:41:29,Amazing.
00:41:29,00:41:31,That's the choice she was making.
00:41:31,00:41:32,That's great.
00:41:32,00:41:38,"I was really disappointed to read that kale is very high in vitamins K, A and E,"
00:41:38,00:41:41,but not L.
00:41:41,00:41:43,Is there a vitamin L?
00:41:43,00:41:45,"Well, there is."
00:41:45,00:41:48,"There's a guy called Dr. W. Nakahara,"
00:41:48,00:41:52,"who in the 1930s discovered something that he called vitamin L,"
00:41:52,00:41:57,but it turned out to be a couple of chemicals which are not vitamins at all
00:41:57,00:41:59,and which aren't in kale.
00:41:59,00:42:03,But he called it vitamin L because he thought it was good for lactation
00:42:03,00:42:05,in rats in particular.
00:42:05,00:42:08,"But it turns out that, yeah, not only is it not a vitamin,"
00:42:08,00:42:11,it's not particularly good for lactation either.
00:42:11,00:42:13,"But it is a thing, vitamin L."
00:42:13,00:42:15,"It's vitamin L, but the L stands for lie."
00:42:15,00:42:17,"Yes, exactly."
00:42:17,00:42:24,"But 130 grams of kale contains 1,000% of your daily vitamin K nutrition."
00:42:24,00:42:25,Wow.
00:42:25,00:42:28,"What does vitamin K do? You get stiff bones, really."
00:42:28,00:42:30,Stiff bones?
00:42:30,00:42:35,Do make sure to try and get your bones as stiff as you possibly can.
00:42:35,00:42:39,"I just hear if it's vitamin K, it just feels like a euphemism for ketamine."
00:42:39,00:42:41,Yes.
00:42:41,00:42:43,How much kale was that?
00:42:43,00:42:45,"130 grams, not much."
00:42:45,00:42:47,I was about to say the opposite.
00:42:47,00:42:49,"That's quite light, isn't it, kale?"
00:42:49,00:42:51,"It's light, I suppose."
00:42:51,00:42:53,"Truth is, it's 1,000%."
00:42:53,00:42:56,So you only need 13 grams.
00:42:56,00:43:01,But people who take blood thinners should be careful with kale
00:43:01,00:43:03,"because if you have too much vitamin K,"
00:43:03,00:43:06,it can be a problem with your clotting of your blood.
00:43:06,00:43:12,"And also, if you have iodine deficiency and you eat an enormous amount of kale,"
00:43:12,00:43:16,"you can get hypothyroidism, where you make too much of your thyroid hormone."
00:43:16,00:43:19,You can get a nice goiter on your neck.
00:43:19,00:43:24,An 88-year-old woman got severe hypothyroidism and went into a coma after eating.
00:43:24,00:43:29,But she was eating between 1 and 1.5 kilograms a day.
00:43:29,00:43:34,"This is actually bok choy, which has a similar property, raw bok choy for several months."
00:43:34,00:43:38,"But that's more than 10,000% of her daily fit of kale."
00:43:38,00:43:40,So she was overdoing it.
00:43:40,00:43:42,And how can you physically eat that much bok choy?
00:43:42,00:43:44,It's really light.
00:43:44,00:43:47,She can't have been doing much else with her days.
00:43:47,00:43:53,"It's like a panda, just all day, just chewing on bok choy."
00:43:53,00:43:59,"That's a hipster panda, isn't it?"
00:43:59,00:44:08,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the week, and that is James's fact."
00:44:08,00:44:11,"Okay, my fact this week is that Goldfinger was such a difficult boss"
00:44:11,00:44:15,that he once fired someone who didn't even work for him.
00:44:15,00:44:18,You don't want a fictional Goldfinger here.
00:44:18,00:44:21,Goldfinger!
00:44:21,00:44:24,"No, I deliberately missed out."
00:44:24,00:44:30,"The start of this fact, which is Brutalist Architect, Erno Goldfinger, did all this stuff."
00:44:30,00:44:34,"We knew Angela was coming on the show, and we know you like a bit of Brutalism architecture."
00:44:34,00:44:40,"And so I dug out my book Concretopia, which was written by a good friend, John Grindrod,"
00:44:40,00:44:42,all about Brutalist architecture.
00:44:42,00:44:45,And I thought I'd find some facts about Erno Goldfinger.
00:44:45,00:44:47,"And he was a very angry man, apparently."
00:44:47,00:44:49,Maybe he was stuck in a texture.
00:44:49,00:44:51,Yes.
00:44:51,00:44:53,"He'd have to be a big dexter, he was a big man."
00:44:53,00:44:54,Was he?
00:44:54,00:44:55,Yeah.
00:44:55,00:45:00,He used to show his strength to the people in his office by using a hole punch
00:45:00,00:45:04,to punch through stacks of card that no one else was strong enough to do.
00:45:04,00:45:10,"And that was his way of going, don't mess with me, look how many bits of card I can punch a hole through."
00:45:10,00:45:13,What's the threat there? I can punch a hole through your torso?
00:45:13,00:45:16,It's weird that in World's Strongest Man they don't have this ability.
00:45:16,00:45:18,They're missing a trick.
00:45:18,00:45:21,"It'd be great, because an office-based World's Strongest Man would be very funny."
00:45:21,00:45:22,Yeah.
00:45:22,00:45:23,And fun.
00:45:23,00:45:27,"So Erno Goldfinger, people, especially who live in London, will know some of his buildings."
00:45:27,00:45:33,"Trelik Tower, I think, is his most famous one, which is only because I used to live near."
00:45:33,00:45:39,"But yeah, he did a lot of these concrete buildings, very popular for about three years,"
00:45:39,00:45:42,but they're all still here.
00:45:42,00:45:49,"And John Grindroth, who wrote this book Concretopia, he spoke to James Dunnett, who worked with Erno Goldfinger,"
00:45:49,00:45:53,"and then Dunnett sort of related this story, that he was a very fiery character."
00:45:53,00:45:58,"And whenever you came to work for Goldfinger, a lot of people only lasted less than a day,"
00:45:58,00:46:00,and they'd be fired at lunchtime.
00:46:00,00:46:04,"And apparently one day, Goldfinger was in one of his rages, you know,"
00:46:04,00:46:08,"probably he didn't get his hole punch working properly, and he stormed through a reception,"
00:46:08,00:46:12,"and there was a guy just waiting in reception, and he just went, ""You're fired!"""
00:46:12,00:46:15,And he didn't even work for them.
00:46:15,00:46:22,"He apparently, between 1954 and 1955, in that year, he lost 26 employees in a small office,"
00:46:22,00:46:25,either through sacking them or they left because of stress.
00:46:25,00:46:27,That was just in one year.
00:46:27,00:46:33,"And you know, obviously, the actual Ian Fleming Goldfinger connection with Goldfinger."
00:46:33,00:46:38,So Ian Fleming named the character Goldfinger after Erno Goldfinger.
00:46:38,00:46:45,"So Erno Goldfinger, the architect, was married to Isabel Blackwell from, yeah, from Cossum Blackwell family,"
00:46:45,00:46:49,and her cousin played golf with Ian Fleming.
00:46:49,00:46:53,And the family all hated Erno Goldfinger because he was so mean and nasty.
00:46:53,00:46:59,And Ian Fleming didn't like him because he'd demolished some houses in Hampstead
00:46:59,00:47:02,"to build the Willow Avenue, is it, Willow Road?"
00:47:02,00:47:06,"Two Willow Road, his house, yeah, in Hampstead."
00:47:06,00:47:11,"And so Ian Fleming was angry that he'd demolished these cottages that had been there before,"
00:47:11,00:47:13,and so that's why he called him Goldfinger.
00:47:13,00:47:19,"And Erno Goldfinger sort of got his lawyers involved to sort of try and stop it,"
00:47:19,00:47:25,and Ian Fleming suggested that what he would be prepared to do was put a slip in every copy of the book
00:47:25,00:47:29,"that said, actually, his name is Goldprick."
00:47:29,00:47:32,"But in the end, they settled and it was fine."
00:47:32,00:47:38,"Didn't they settle because Ian said, OK, I'll use Alrick Goldfinger as in his first name"
00:47:38,00:47:40,in every mention of him in the book?
00:47:40,00:47:42,"To clarify the full name is, yeah, he did do that."
00:47:42,00:47:45,"It's nothing to do with you, it's a complete coincidence."
00:47:45,00:47:49,"The story doesn't reflect very well on Ian Fleming, I think,"
00:47:49,00:47:55,"because between the destruction of these cottages in Hampstead and the writing of the book,"
00:47:55,00:47:57,I think it was about 20 years.
00:47:57,00:48:00,I think it's a long grudge that was held.
00:48:00,00:48:04,"Well, the thing is with Fleming is, so Pierce Fletcher, who's the producer of QI,"
00:48:04,00:48:07,"he says he knows someone called Scaramanga,"
00:48:07,00:48:12,"and this guy called Scaramanga, his father went to school with Ian Fleming, right?"
00:48:12,00:48:17,"And I've met, I don't know if you've met, blow felt the cricket commentator."
00:48:17,00:48:20,Surely that character is not based on the cricket commentator blow felt.
00:48:20,00:48:22,I can't see any similarities.
00:48:22,00:48:24,"It's based on his father, apparently."
00:48:24,00:48:27,"And according to blowers, he says that they went to the same club,"
00:48:27,00:48:31,and Fleming saw the name in the club list and stuff like that.
00:48:31,00:48:32,We're not quite sure.
00:48:32,00:48:37,"But basically, I mean, Ian Fleming just knew so many people with amazing names."
00:48:37,00:48:38,Incredible.
00:48:38,00:48:42,Because I looked at all my Facebook friends yesterday to see if any of my friends
00:48:42,00:48:45,"had good enough names to be Bond villains, and none of them do."
00:48:45,00:48:48,"Like, literally, I don't have a single friend who has a funny surname."
00:48:48,00:48:52,"But the settlement they came to was that the publisher would pay Goldfingers,"
00:48:52,00:48:56,"I think some of his legal costs, and they would also provide six copies of the book."
00:48:56,00:48:58,That's all right then.
00:48:58,00:49:01,"As long as I've got six copies of the book that's hanging me off, I don't mind."
00:49:01,00:49:05,"But I think it probably didn't pay off for Goldfinger in the end because for years afterwards,"
00:49:05,00:49:08,"or for years after the movie came out, the James Bond film,"
00:49:08,00:49:10,"people would ring him up and do a Sean Connery voice and say,"
00:49:10,00:49:13,"""Goldfinger, this is double all seven."""
00:49:13,00:49:17,"Well, you shouldn't have made your address so public with this famous house you built."
00:49:17,00:49:18,That's true.
00:49:18,00:49:21,"He was a lifelong Marxist as well, and he used to sell..."
00:49:21,00:49:23,He had art sales for...
00:49:23,00:49:29,Him and his wife used to hold these art sales to raise money for the Red Army.
00:49:29,00:49:30,"Oh, did they?"
00:49:30,00:49:32,"Yeah, and we're friends with..."
00:49:32,00:49:35,I think Barbara Hepworth used to sell stuff with him.
00:49:35,00:49:36,Yeah.
00:49:36,00:49:41,"I guess his kind of architecture, brutalist architecture, gets associated with left-wing ideology."
00:49:41,00:49:44,"And I think the anti-brutalism movement of saying,"
00:49:44,00:49:46,"""We really hate these buildings. They're so ugly."
00:49:46,00:49:49,"Can we get some more classical Roman stuff up, please?"""
00:49:49,00:49:52,is more associated with conservative hypes.
00:49:52,00:49:54,It's very eastern block.
00:49:54,00:49:56,The concrete...
00:49:56,00:49:58,It puts the block in eastern block.
00:49:58,00:50:00,It's very strong.
00:50:00,00:50:02,"It's a function over form, isn't it?"
00:50:02,00:50:07,"The whole idea of modernist showing you're working, which I think is beautiful."
00:50:07,00:50:10,I have a concrete wedding ring and a concrete engagement ring.
00:50:10,00:50:13,"I'm showing this. That's my concrete engagement ring, which I'm showing you."
00:50:13,00:50:14,It's like a square of concrete.
00:50:14,00:50:16,And that is my concrete wedding ring.
00:50:16,00:50:19,"My husband has one the same, and the aggregate is pebbles from Brighton Beach,"
00:50:19,00:50:21,because we live in Brighton.
00:50:21,00:50:24,"So, yeah, I'm a little obsessed with concrete as a medium."
00:50:24,00:50:27,"It's the most attractive I've ever seen concrete be, actually."
00:50:27,00:50:29,"Well, I've got a little theory about that."
00:50:29,00:50:32,I wrote an article about this in The Independent a little while ago
00:50:32,00:50:38,"about this idea of, you know, like, I was going to say Prince Charles, King Charles,"
00:50:38,00:50:42,"or as Dara O'Brien keeps calling him, what the week, King Prince Charles, which..."
00:50:42,00:50:47,He obviously spoke out against Brutus architecture quite a lot.
00:50:47,00:50:50,He described the National Theatre as something like a clever way
00:50:50,00:50:53,of disguising a nuclear power station in the centre of London or something like that.
00:50:53,00:50:56,And the monstrous carbon cores and all of that.
00:50:56,00:51:00,"But my theory is that we're sort of triggered by nostalgia human beings,"
00:51:00,00:51:02,"you know, about things that make us think about home."
00:51:02,00:51:06,"If you grew up in Buckingham Palace, then yes, the National Theatre is going to look quite ugly."
00:51:06,00:51:10,"But if you grew up like I did on an estate, you know, where there's lots of concrete"
00:51:10,00:51:13,"about concrete subways, concrete, then those buildings make me feel nostalgic"
00:51:13,00:51:16,"and warm and, you know, so it's all relative."
00:51:16,00:51:21,"Like, for example, Wellbeck Street Car Park was a famous Brutus structure in Soho"
00:51:21,00:51:23,that got demolished a few years ago.
00:51:23,00:51:25,That beautiful sort of...
00:51:25,00:51:27,"Oh, yeah, I go past it all the time."
00:51:27,00:51:30,"It sort of looks like they pour concrete into a beehive,"
00:51:30,00:51:34,"that kind of sort of tessellated, beautiful structure and they knocked it down."
00:51:34,00:51:36,"I just think, well, where's the difference there?"
00:51:36,00:51:39,"Like, people will preserve, say, old coaching-ins."
00:51:39,00:51:40,Yeah.
00:51:40,00:51:42,Because Charles I stayed there once or whatever.
00:51:42,00:51:44,"You go, well, who parked their car in that car park?"
00:51:44,00:51:46,I bet a load of really famous people did.
00:51:46,00:51:48,Because of where it is in Soho.
00:51:48,00:51:50,You've got to get the blue past down.
00:51:50,00:51:53,"But you know, this idea that things that seem modern to us and ugly,"
00:51:53,00:51:55,"well, in the future we'll have historic values. Stop knocking them down."
00:51:55,00:51:56,"Yeah, I agree."
00:51:56,00:51:59,I would love a car park plaque scheme.
00:51:59,00:52:03,"You know, if you found out Gary Lernicker parked here in 1996,"
00:52:03,00:52:05,it would change the way I felt about that in space.
00:52:05,00:52:07,Because basically every Indian restaurant in the country
00:52:07,00:52:09,has a picture of Gary Lernicker.
00:52:09,00:52:12,Does that make you feel different about those?
00:52:12,00:52:14,"It's, I can't believe..."
00:52:14,00:52:15,He must have parked somewhere.
00:52:15,00:52:18,He must have gone to so many Indian restaurants around the country
00:52:18,00:52:19,"because they are, it's everywhere."
00:52:19,00:52:22,"There's one right near here, right near where we're recording this now."
00:52:22,00:52:26,"And it's, I just can't imagine how he had the time as a top-class footballer"
00:52:26,00:52:29,to be plowing through that many curries.
00:52:29,00:52:32,I can't imagine what it's like to share a bathroom with him.
00:52:32,00:52:36,"Slightly related, I saw Gary Lernicker once in a service station."
00:52:36,00:52:39,"I can't remember which one, like a proper sort of motorway service station."
00:52:39,00:52:42,"And I was with the comedian John Robbins, we were now waiting for a gig somewhere."
00:52:42,00:52:46,"And he's only like, nice to be with Gary Lernicker ahead of us in the queue."
00:52:46,00:52:49,And the thing that just amazed us most was he'd obviously been travelling
00:52:49,00:52:52,from somewhere to somewhere and was wearing the most crisp white shirt
00:52:52,00:52:53,without a crease in it.
00:52:53,00:52:54,"Oh, really?"
00:52:54,00:52:55,So you've obviously got out of a car.
00:52:55,00:52:57,How are you looking so amazing?
00:52:57,00:52:58,That's interesting.
00:52:58,00:52:59,"Nice. Well done, Gary."
00:52:59,00:53:03,Was he absolutely going to town on a Cormor or something like this?
00:53:03,00:53:05,"Not in Starbucks, no."
00:53:05,00:53:07,"He was signing a cup for them, though."
00:53:07,00:53:10,So I guess they were going to put that on the way.
00:53:10,00:53:12,"Well, see, all celebrities get around a lot."
00:53:12,00:53:15,Gary's the only one who comes with his own marker pen.
00:53:15,00:53:18,"But yeah, you're right."
00:53:18,00:53:20,"Going back to this architecture,"
00:53:20,00:53:23,"which we're talking about, I think,"
00:53:23,00:53:26,there is this assumption that it's bad for a community.
00:53:26,00:53:28,People get very depressed.
00:53:28,00:53:30,It has a negative impact on mental health.
00:53:30,00:53:33,"There was lots of chat in the '80s, which, like, in Thatcher Zero,"
00:53:33,00:53:36,there was this big pushback against all this brutalist architecture.
00:53:36,00:53:39,"And people were saying, like, Thatcher's favourite housing expert,"
00:53:39,00:53:41,"who was a woman called Alice Coleman,"
00:53:41,00:53:45,saying it's increasing levels of crime and antisocial behaviour
00:53:45,00:53:48,"in all these areas, partly because I think there's less surveillance."
00:53:48,00:53:50,"If you've got those big tower blocks,"
00:53:50,00:53:52,"you can get away with a lot, she said."
00:53:52,00:53:54,And people do assume that.
00:53:54,00:53:57,And I couldn't really find any evidence of any studies
00:53:57,00:54:00,that say people's mental health is affected.
00:54:00,00:54:02,"And also, I think, what happened?"
00:54:02,00:54:04,"So, post-war, when there was a housing shortage, you know,"
00:54:04,00:54:06,"after the Blitz and everything, you had to build quickly."
00:54:06,00:54:08,And there was this fashion in Europe
00:54:08,00:54:10,for building up these modernist architects.
00:54:10,00:54:13,"So, Le Corbusier, who built Unit√© d'Abertation,"
00:54:13,00:54:15,all these grand ideas.
00:54:15,00:54:17,But what we tried to do here is do it cheaply.
00:54:17,00:54:20,"Because you had, when Churchill's government came back in '51,"
00:54:20,00:54:23,"and you then had, I think the housing minister then was Macmillan,"
00:54:23,00:54:27,and the idea was to build quickly and cheaply.
00:54:27,00:54:30,"And so, there was the disaster that happened at Ronan Point,"
00:54:30,00:54:32,which was a tower block in Newham.
00:54:32,00:54:36,And it was built 16 stories higher than it should have been.
00:54:36,00:54:38,"So, the designs were for it to be 16 stories lower."
00:54:38,00:54:40,That's a lot. That's a lot to add.
00:54:40,00:54:42,"And they used what was called an LPS system,"
00:54:42,00:54:44,which is a large panel system.
00:54:44,00:54:47,"So, it's precast concrete panels that are then slotted together in situ."
00:54:47,00:54:49,And what happened?
00:54:49,00:54:51,"Apparently, in this particular building,"
00:54:51,00:54:54,"some of the gaps between the panels were so big,"
00:54:54,00:54:56,you could put a coin through them.
00:54:56,00:54:58,And they just stuffed them with newspaper.
00:54:58,00:55:01,And then a gas explosion happened.
00:55:01,00:55:04,"And one corner, the pictures all over the papers,"
00:55:04,00:55:06,this corner blowing off of this thing.
00:55:06,00:55:08,"But of course, it spread really quickly because of the gaps"
00:55:08,00:55:10,in the panel system and all of this.
00:55:10,00:55:13,"So, it was all kind of set up to fail in this country."
00:55:13,00:55:16,Because there were tower blocks in Europe that worked perfectly well.
00:55:16,00:55:20,"And obviously, what happened as well is that when Right to Buy came in,"
00:55:20,00:55:22,"people would buy their council homes,"
00:55:22,00:55:24,"and then they'd move up the property ladder, move out,"
00:55:24,00:55:26,and then private landlords would let them...
00:55:26,00:55:29,"So, you end up with this situation where it's the poorest people in society"
00:55:29,00:55:32,"all packed together in places without a concierge,"
00:55:32,00:55:34,"without any proper management,"
00:55:34,00:55:37,and with nooks and crannies where drug dealers or whatever could...
00:55:37,00:55:40,"So, they were set up to fail from the off, really."
00:55:40,00:55:42,"So, it's not the building's fault."
00:55:42,00:55:45,"It's the funding and the government, you know, at the time."
00:55:45,00:55:47,These big ideas cost money.
00:55:47,00:55:50,Architects that came up with these big ideas never had to live in them.
00:55:50,00:55:53,"- Yeah. - Although, old Goldfinger did."
00:55:53,00:55:55,"- Oh, he did live in Balfront Tower, didn't he? - He did."
00:55:55,00:55:56,"I mean, only for a couple of months."
00:55:56,00:55:58,"He did say of his... of Balfront Tower,"
00:55:58,00:56:02,which was like the first big thing that he built in London.
00:56:02,00:56:05,"And he said, ""Everything I did, I did as if it was done for me."""
00:56:05,00:56:08,And to show that he went and moved in with his wife.
00:56:08,00:56:11,And he used to host champagne receptions for all the residents
00:56:11,00:56:13,where they would come and tell him what they thought of the building
00:56:13,00:56:15,and what they liked and didn't like about it.
00:56:15,00:56:18,"Although, if you do, after two months, just move to your swanky pad in London."
00:56:18,00:56:20,"- Yeah, yeah. - You can go back to Hampstead."
00:56:20,00:56:22,"- Is it worth saying something about the word ""brutalism""? - Yeah, definitely."
00:56:22,00:56:26,"Because ""brutalism"", I think people think, is because it looks brutal."
00:56:26,00:56:30,"But it's actually from B√©ton Brut, which is French for raw concrete."
00:56:30,00:56:32,"- OK. - So, that's where..."
00:56:32,00:56:34,"And the term ""brutalism"" came from..."
00:56:34,00:56:36,"There's a couple called Alison and Peter Smithson,"
00:56:36,00:56:38,who were sort of pioneers of new brutalism.
00:56:38,00:56:41,They were the kind of radical young architects in the '50s.
00:56:41,00:56:45,And they wrote an essay where they mentioned new brutalism
00:56:45,00:56:48,as this new form over function...
00:56:48,00:56:50,"Sorry, function over form, ascetic."
00:56:50,00:56:53,"Which we should say, because it's confused me for a long time researching."
00:56:53,00:56:55,You'll definitely know it. New brutalism was just brutalism.
00:56:55,00:56:57,"- There was no old brutalism. - No, no."
00:56:57,00:56:59,- They just started. - But they're new.
00:56:59,00:57:01,"I think Sweden or somewhere, it's called Nybrutalism,"
00:57:01,00:57:04,"was the sort of original in the late '40s, I think."
00:57:04,00:57:07,And then they sort of picked up that and ran with it.
00:57:07,00:57:11,"And then there was an architectural journalist, Peter Raynabanam,"
00:57:11,00:57:14,who then wrote about it in the architectural review.
00:57:14,00:57:17,"And they described it as an ethic, not an aesthetic."
00:57:17,00:57:20,"So, this idea that buildings should be for functional purposes"
00:57:20,00:57:23,"for people to live in, rather than to just look pretty."
00:57:23,00:57:28,"So, it was Raynabanam who kind of brought brutalism as a word, right?"
00:57:28,00:57:31,"It was kind of... They talked about new brutalism,"
00:57:31,00:57:33,and then he was the one who kind of made a joke
00:57:33,00:57:36,about the brute concrete in France. Is that right?
00:57:36,00:57:38,"- Yeah, I think so, yeah. - 'Cause I wrote to John Grindroth,"
00:57:38,00:57:41,"and he sent me some facts, and he said that the brute in brutalism,"
00:57:41,00:57:44,"because it comes from the same root as Breton Brute,"
00:57:44,00:57:46,it's the same brute as you get in Champagne.
00:57:46,00:57:49,"- Really? - So, yeah, Brute Champagne means dry,"
00:57:49,00:57:52,"it also means raw, I think, in French."
00:57:52,00:57:56,"Concrete, would you like a glass of concrete to celebrate?"
00:57:56,00:57:59,- That's what we had at our wedding. - No.
00:57:59,00:58:03,"Although we did have, actually, the tables at our wedding"
00:58:03,00:58:08,"were named after either whiskeys, 'cause my husband's a big whisky fan,"
00:58:08,00:58:10,- or Brutalist buildings. - That's right.
00:58:10,00:58:13,"So, we had a Wellbeck Street car park table."
00:58:13,00:58:16,- That's so good. - We had a number one Croydon table.
00:58:16,00:58:19,"We had... My favourite structures, one of them,"
00:58:19,00:58:23,is the Pennine Tower at Lancaster Services.
00:58:23,00:58:28,"I love that structure so much, we had a table named after that."
00:58:28,00:58:31,"I used to live there, I used to live near there,"
00:58:31,00:58:34,"and I moved to a town, it's called Silverdale,"
00:58:34,00:58:36,"and just to try and get in with the locals,"
00:58:36,00:58:39,"I did a pub quiz there, and they had a question,"
00:58:39,00:58:42,"it was around where they gave you ten clues,"
00:58:42,00:58:44,"and if you got the right answer,"
00:58:44,00:58:46,"if you got it in the first clue, you get ten points,"
00:58:46,00:58:48,and it'd go all the way down.
00:58:48,00:58:52,"The first question was, this building was designed by whoever it was..."
00:58:52,00:58:55,"- Oh, God, now you've got a TP something. - Whatever it's called."
00:58:55,00:58:58,"Every other team in the quiz ran to him saying,"
00:58:58,00:59:00,"""We've got the answer, we've got the answer."""
00:59:00,00:59:03,"And me and my partner at the time were sat in the corner,"
00:59:03,00:59:07,"""No, okay, next clue, next clue, next clue."""
00:59:07,00:59:10,"They got all the way down to the last clue,"
00:59:10,00:59:14,"which was like, it can be seen on the M6 just outside Silverdale,"
00:59:14,00:59:17,and we guessed that it must be that service station.
00:59:17,00:59:20,"And yeah, that was a typical kind of quiz in that town"
00:59:20,00:59:22,"where all the locals knew all the answers,"
00:59:22,00:59:24,"but if you weren't local, you had no chance."
00:59:24,00:59:27,"- That's so funny. - It's a beautiful structure,"
00:59:27,00:59:32,"it's a kind of like a space age, a kind of like a flying saucer on a pole."
00:59:32,00:59:36,"- Fortin Tower. - You would have got on, I think, quite well with Thomas Edison,"
00:59:36,00:59:39,"who was also, do you know about his concrete obsession?"
00:59:39,00:59:43,"- I don't think I do, no. - Oh, God, I think you might have married him in a different life."
00:59:43,00:59:46,"He was obsessed with it. He set up Edison Portland Cement Company,"
00:59:46,00:59:50,and he wanted to make houses and all of their interiors entirely out of concrete.
00:59:50,00:59:53,"And he actually, I think it was because he had lots of sand left over"
00:59:53,00:59:56,"from other stuff he was trying, so..."
00:59:56,00:59:59,I don't know why he was making sand castles.
00:59:59,01:00:02,"And he imagined houses made entirely of concrete,"
01:00:02,01:00:05,but then inside they would have concrete tables and chairs
01:00:05,01:00:10,"and bath towers made of concrete, fridges made of concrete pianos."
01:00:10,01:00:14,"And he built, I think he built a little version, a little concrete cottage,"
01:00:14,01:00:17,"and it does look like someone's taken a normal house,"
01:00:17,01:00:20,and then they've poured concrete over all the items in it.
01:00:20,01:00:22,"- I think that was kind of his idea, right?"
01:00:22,01:00:25,"He would just get this kind of shape of a house,"
01:00:25,01:00:27,"and all you would have to do is pour concrete in,"
01:00:27,01:00:29,"and eventually it was set, you'd take off the mould,"
01:00:29,01:00:32,"and you'd have a house, and it would have all the tables in and everything."
01:00:32,01:00:34,"But I think that's, does that still exist, that building?"
01:00:34,01:00:37,- There might be one. - I think that original one might still exist.
01:00:37,01:00:41,"- They probably have tried to get rid of it, but found it impossible to destroy."
01:00:41,01:00:45,"- It's a place called Hermits Castle, which is in Scotland somewhere,"
01:00:45,01:00:49,"and I can't remember exactly where, but it was an early sort of,"
01:00:49,01:00:53,"I think in the early '50s, maybe, this architect, David, someone, I can't remember his name."
01:00:53,01:00:56,This is just full of me trying to remember people's names.
01:00:56,01:01:01,"But he built this little, out of concrete, this little castle,"
01:01:01,01:01:05,"and the idea was that anyone walking could then just sleep in it, and people do."
01:01:05,01:01:08,"But he did exactly that, like the beds all moulded into it,"
01:01:08,01:01:12,"and the little shelves and things, it's all moulded into it."
01:01:12,01:01:17,"It's called shuttering, so you use wooden panels,"
01:01:17,01:01:20,or wooden moulds to pour the concrete into.
01:01:20,01:01:24,"You sort of line them with resin, and then move them away."
01:01:24,01:01:28,"So that's why concrete is so exciting, because you can make any shape out of it."
01:01:28,01:01:30,"- It's like plastic, I guess, right? - Yeah."
01:01:30,01:01:32,"- Not comfortable, though, to sleep on."
01:01:32,01:01:35,- You wish that someone had made a bouncy castle.
01:01:35,01:01:38,A house made of doovies.
01:01:38,01:01:40,"- Angela, have you seen the film 'Lock'?"
01:01:40,01:01:43,"It's Tom Hardy. - Oh, in the car? Yes, I have."
01:01:43,01:01:46,"I forgot it was called that, about the big concrete port."
01:01:46,01:01:52,"So I did British Brutalist Architecture for Mastermind a few months ago,"
01:01:52,01:01:56,"and I just found myself down this YouTube rabbit hole,"
01:01:56,01:01:59,"and about four in the morning I was watching videos of concrete pours,"
01:01:59,01:02:01,"going, ""This isn't what I'm doing!"""
01:02:01,01:02:03,"""This is not going to come up!"""
01:02:03,01:02:06,You should start a festive site.
