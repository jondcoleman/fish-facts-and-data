00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.600
 Daniel Shriver is away this week.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.400
 I thought it was because his wife was having a baby,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.400
 but he's just sent an email saying,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.900
 "Tell them it's something to do with, by brand new book, The Theory of Everything Else,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.700
 available in all good bookshops."

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.400
 And I'm like, well, look, whatever reason he's away,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.100
 we have a very exciting guest that is in his stead,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.200
 and that is the wonderful comedian Angela Barnes.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.200
 You will have seen her on your televisions most notably on the TV show Mock the Week,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.700
 but she does all sorts of other stuff.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.700
 I appeared on her radio show a couple of years ago

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.200
 and immediately knew that she would be perfect for fish.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.400
 She is the most inquisitive, interested person.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.300
 You're going to absolutely love her.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.700
 And once you've heard the show, you are going to want to go and see her live in her upcoming tour,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.400
 called Hot Mess, and tickets for that are currently available on her website,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.300
 which is angelabarnescomedy.co.uk.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.700
 If you can't wait to see her live, then why not go and check out her podcast.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.000
 It is called We Are History Podcast, which she does with John O'Farrell,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.700
 and it is all about history.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.400
 It's really funny. It's really great.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.300
 You've got to go and listen.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.400
 It's available wherever you get your podcasts.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.900
 Anyway, Dan will be back next week.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.400
 But in the meantime, on with the podcast.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:45.800
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.600
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.000
 My name is Anna Tyshinski, and I am joined today by Andrew Hunter-Murray,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.400
 James Hawkin, and our very special guest, Dan Schreiber Replacement,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.000
 a hopefully permanent Angela Barnes.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.700
 Hello.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.100
 Hello.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.500
 Okay, once again, we've gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.400
 and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Angela.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.200
 Okay, so I've always wanted to say this.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.700
 My fact this week is that in communist East Germany in the 1950s,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.000
 the state came up with a sanctioned dance for their teenagers to do.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.900
 They were a bit worried about the influence of rock and roll from the West.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.200
 Elvis Presley was doing his military service in West Germany.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.000
 So they were picking up all the Elvis on their radios and their TVs.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.300
 Elvis sang while he was doing his service to me.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300
 Really loudly over the wall.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.300
 And so they were all the youngsters, they were worried about their hip-fusting movements.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.300
 And the state felt that dancing on your own was subversive, that you should dance in a couple.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.000
 Yeah.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.100
 But when you did dance in a couple, you shouldn't be gyrating like Elvis.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.700
 Fair enough.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.400
 And what I know about teenagers is not very much.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.100
 Right.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.100
 Probably that they wouldn't necessarily do what the government told them are.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.400
 Well, no.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.500
 But it was the dance in question, the lipsy dance.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.300
 The lipsy.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.100
 It would have to be unbelievably good for teenagers to want to do it.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.400
 It'd have to be Agadou.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.800
 Was it Agadou?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.100
 And was it Agadou?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.200
 It definitely wasn't Agadou.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.600
 What was it? Was it good? I haven't seen this dance.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.800
 So it was two choreographers came up with the dance, Krista and Helmut Seifert.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.700
 And they came up the steps and it was an East German composer called RenÃ© Dubianski who came up with the music.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.000
 And it was basically it was a fast waltz.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.800
 So he merged two waltz beats into a six-four beat because there's nothing that teenagers like more than waltz.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800
 A double waltz.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.400
 And the idea was that they would dance together, but their hips wouldn't wiggle.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.200
 So there's footage of it on YouTube and it just at first it looks like a normal sort of Latin-y kind of dance.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.700
 And then you realize that their hips don't move.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.300
 Weird.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.500
 And it just looks old.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.600
 It feels like a reverse Irish dance kind of.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.300
 Is that not right?

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.700
 Is Irish dancing just hips moving but the rest of the world?

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.200
 It's just like the bottom half moving.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.600
 Yeah, I suppose it is.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.400
 No, it's not like that.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.800
 Even Irish dance doesn't move your hips around much.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.700
 I've taken Irish dancing classes in my time.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.100
 Yeah, I can really picture that.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.600
 Can you?

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.100
 It's a Michael flatly about you.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.400
 Yeah, as a boy I learned some river dance.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.300
 Actually, what we never noticed because we always record around the table is that you're always river dancing.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.900
 Yep.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.200
 I wonder why I kept getting bruised shins.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.800
 The effort in the edit to remove the constant clackity-clack of me dancing away.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.100
 I actually had a doctor say to me once, so I have something called periodic limb movement disorder which means in my sleep my legs flail.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.900
 Oh, really?

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.500
 And I did a sleep study once at Guy's Hospital and in the official report he said two things.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.500
 One was that my snoring was and I quote heroic, which I was very proud of.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.100
 And the other was that like watching me sleep was like watching horizontal river dance.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.900
 That's in my official.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.900
 They really sound like compliments, both of those things.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.300
 I know, right?

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.300
 That's pretty thoughtful.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.800
 I was such a lucky man.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.900
 Do you have to sort of have a mini sleeping bag for your legs alone or?

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.300
 Well, I don't think it can take.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.200
 So whenever I have slept in a sleeping bag, I've woken up with it on the floor.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.900
 You can't be contained.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.200
 So I just can't be contained.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.900
 The energy.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.300
 If I could wire it up to the national grid in this energy crisis, we'd be all right.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.200
 What were we talking about?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.500
 Dancing.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.500
 Dancing, yes.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.600
 Dancing, yes.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.600
 I didn't realise how what a threat Elvis was at the time.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.300
 God, people went nuts over Elvis.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.800
 They thought he was going to impregnate every woman on earth.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.600
 Well, riots in East Germany in 1959 in in about 14 East German cities and towns.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.600
 And they then had to be crackdowns.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.500
 So Leipzig had a crackdown.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.200
 Leipzig is where the Lipsy dance.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.600
 The state one is from the Latin name for Cypsey.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.200
 Yeah, and they sentenced 15 demonstrators to prison sentences of between six months

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.300
 and four and a half years for going to pro Elvis protests.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.000
 Really?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.600
 Yeah.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.800
 But it was everywhere.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.400
 We shouldn't tar East Germany with this solitary brush.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.600
 Rock 'n' Roll was sort of vilified in a way that I don't think any legitimate music ever has been.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.100
 There's plenty of Americans that were frightened about the influence of Elvis as well.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.400
 There was a state-sponsored Rock 'n' Roll festival in the US.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.500
 In the US?

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.300
 Yeah, in America, which like hated Rock 'n' Roll as well.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.900
 But it was called Vortex One.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.800
 It sounds like the saddest thing ever, but Paranoia was quite popular.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.600
 Do you remember the Festival of Brexit?

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.500
 Oh, no!

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.400
 This was like if that had been a success.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.300
 Yeah, okay.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.100
 This is that.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.100
 It was in Oregon.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:48.800
 And I'm surprised that the hippies agreed to go to it because it was basically because Nixon was going to visit Portland, Oregon in 1970, I believe.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:57.100
 And this was obviously at a time of extreme anti-war protests and extreme government crackdowns on those protests in America.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.200
 And there was a fear that the hippies would start protesting or the peace protest would start protesting.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.700
 So to get rid of them, basically, the state government said, "Guys, do you want to give you a festival?"

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:13.300
 And they all went for it because they really wanted peace, but more than that, they wanted a rock festival where they had license to take drugs.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.500
 Like the state was like, "Look, we'll turn a blind eye to all the drug-taking and the nudity."

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.500
 Just to get, sorry, is it just to get them out of town when Nixon's in town?

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.500
 Sounds like it.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.000
 That's basically it.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Sounds like a sitcom.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.500
 It does.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.700
 Oh no, we've accidentally got them crossing paths.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.200
 And he didn't even turn up in the end.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.200
 No.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.200
 So they just got a festival for nothing.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.200
 That's amazing.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.200
 It's awesome.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.200
 So I've read a book we see about the Stasi Poetry Circle.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.200
 Sounds fun.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200
 I know, right?

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.200
 Your work and leisure was really tied up in East Germany.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.700
 So you would go on holiday with the people you were with.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.700
 Sounds awful.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:52.700
 And all your leisure activities were bound up with the company that you worked for and stuff.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.200
 And it was the same with the Stasi.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.700
 And so they would have these sort of art circles.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.700
 And one of them, they had a poetry circle.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.700
 But the guy who ran it, Uwe Berger, I think his name was, he wasn't a member of the party,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.200
 but he was one of the hundreds of thousands of misarbiters they called.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.200
 So these unofficial collaborators.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200
 The Stasi.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.700
 So he would get all the poetry.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.200
 These young Stasi officers would be writing their poetry in their poetry circle.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.700
 And then he'd be looking for dissidents among them and feeding it back.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.200
 And was he looking through the medium of the poetry?

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200
 Yeah.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.700
 Oh, so he was looking for maybe dissident users of meter or half rhymes.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:34.700
 Or just anybody that basically wasn't socialist realism or showed any sort of freedom of thought.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.700
 How interesting.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.700
 Yeah.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.700
 Because they did also, they infiltrated punk groups.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.200
 They were very threatened by punk music when it came in in East Germany.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.200
 And so the Stasi infiltrated.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200
 I feel threatened by that still.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200
 Sure.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.700
 I mean, they infiltrated everybody.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.200
 That's the thing about the Stasi.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.700
 And they were the biggest administrators of any.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:56.700
 So out of the whole of German history from the Middle Ages to World War Two, there were

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.200
 more written records kept in the 40 years of the German Democratic Republic than the

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.200
 rest of German history put together.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200
 Really?

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200
 Yeah.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200
 But it's all bad poetry.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200
 It's mostly bad poetry.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.700
 So when the war came down and then in January 1990, the people stormed the Stasi headquarters

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.200
 in Leipzig, a place called Rundert Ecke, the round corner, to their offices.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:25.100
 And they rescued these sacks of, I think there's 15,500 sacks of shredded documents.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.700
 And there's these people that are called the puzzlers.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.700
 Who piece them back together?

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.700
 Who piece them back together.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.700
 And they've been doing that since 1991.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.700
 They're still doing it?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.700
 They're still doing it.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.900
 So there were millions of shredded bits of paper and it will take centuries to put them

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.900
 all back together.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:44.600
 I just feel like, you know, you've got an old lady in Leipzig doing her little jigsaw.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.620
 And then she gets a tap on the shoulder, "Mr. Schmidt, we have a job for you."

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.140
 You heard about the Schwartzer Canal.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.740
 So in East Germany, they could pick up Western television because obviously it's not far

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.740
 away.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.500
 But you could be arrested if your TV area was pointing west.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.940
 So you had to be a bit careful.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.620
 They eased off on that as time went on.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.260
 But there were two East German channels and on one of them there was a program that was

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:13.100
 on every Monday night and it was called the Schwartzer Canal and what it was, it was 20

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:20.000
 minutes of clips of West German TV programs with a Communist commentary saying why they

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 were so bad.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 Say why it was so bad.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.360
 I'd watch programs that had a commentary over the top explaining why they were so bad.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.360
 You should get on Twitter.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.360
 It's just Gogglebox, isn't it?

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.360
 What you've described is basically...

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.360
 Yeah, it's like Gogglebox.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:42.680
 There had been a program in West Germany called Die Horte Optik, which is the red viewpoints.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.620
 So which was sort of slagging off what was happening in East Germany.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.340
 So that was their sort of retort to that was the Black Channel.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.900
 And also it's called the Black Channel because that was like a plumbing slang for a sewer.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.900
 Oh, that's clever.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.900
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.280
 So it was like a little pun as well.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.280
 Is the red...

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.280
 Die Rote...

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.280
 Do you call it?

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.280
 Die Rote Optik.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.280
 The red viewpoint.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.840
 Is that a joke on Rose Tinted Spectacles?

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.920
 Like, oh, in the East, they're all seeing, you know, they're probably not.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.560
 Do you think they came up with the titles before the concepts and all things like this?

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.760
 You know, the BBC had studios in nuclear bunkers in the Cold War.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.600
 So I mean, I'll have to reign it in because I could go on forever about nuclear bunkers.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.600
 That's my little obsession.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.520
 But in the regional seats of government, nuclear bunkers, of which there were 12 in the Cold

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.520
 War period in Britain, they were for politicians for offices of state and things like that.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.480
 And each of them would have a BBC studio inside.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480
 Really?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480
 Yeah.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.480
 So you can visit the one at...

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.720
 There's one at Kelverton Hatch in Essex, which is open to the public, one at Hack Green

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.840
 in Cheshire, which is, and you can see the BBC studio in there.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:54.120
 And they have, in Kelverton Hatch, I think they have playing the actual BBC broadcast

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.120
 that would have been...

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.120
 Cool.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.120
 Playing the hats.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.040
 You know, so when you kind of go to the nuclear bunker, like all your politicians go there

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.040
 or whatever, all your important people, would they have had to take a BBC sound engineer

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.700
 with them because it's going to be quite echoey in those places.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.700
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:14.480
 So you had a BBC sound engineer and presenters, like heating engineers and, you know, electrical

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.280
 engineers and various different specialties would need to be in this bunker to keep it

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.280
 maintained.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.280
 How interesting.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.120
 So if you were selected, you'd sign the official secret tax, you wouldn't tell anyone.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.760
 That's so funny because obviously I'm sure you know a lot of BBC sound engineers like

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.760
 I do.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.760
 Well.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.000
 And I just, yeah, I wonder if they all got this job thinking, well, if it all goes

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.640
 south, at least we can...

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.960
 But these days, if that happened, do you think there'd be any room in the bunker for podcasters?

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.240
 Well, I know, I'm not sure how much of this I'm allowed to say because I...

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.960
 Oh my God, you're on the list.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960
 You're on the list.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960
 Yeah.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.960
 I'm not on the list.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.960
 I promise I'm not on the list.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.960
 But I do know that they still do...

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.200
 You were until not the week finish.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200
 Yeah.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.560
 I do know that they still do drills and that they still take a BBC presenter.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.240
 Which BBC presenter would you take to your nuclear bunker?

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.240
 BBC.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.240
 It has to be BBC.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.240
 Yeah.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.800
 I'd probably go for Hugh Edwards.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.800
 Would you?

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.560
 I just want stability and continuity and he provides it.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.560
 That's interesting.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.960
 I was thinking, does Dion Dublin do houses under the hammer or something?

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.960
 Yeah.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.960
 He could do a great guide to the bunker, couldn't he?

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960
 Yeah.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.960
 To improve your bunker.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.800
 But here, that's a solid wall.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.800
 That's not...

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.800
 Yeah, that's a solid wall too.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.440
 Lots of solid walls in here, very few partition walls.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.080
 I've got one fact about Agadu, just because Angela mentioned it earlier.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.400
 So the singer of Agadu...

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400
 Black lace.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.400
 Black lace, right?

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400
 You're right.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.400
 And the guy is Dean Michael.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400
 So he was sent to prison in 2016.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.400
 What was he?

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.400
 Not for the dance.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.400
 And not for the usual...

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.400
 He was pushing pineapples, wasn't he?

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400
 Shaking trees.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.400
 Brandy coffee.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.400
 It was for benefits fraud.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.560
 It doesn't come up in the song anywhere.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.560
 But he was in for 10 weeks.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:57.600
 He claimed he couldn't walk but then he was also doing gigs on stage where he was dancing

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.600
 very vigorously.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:04.680
 I know, we got put away for 10 weeks and anyway, he says, after he came out, he said that

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:12.680
 while he was in prison, he got through the tough times by leading a giant conga of prisoners.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:18.280
 That's how they all escaped, isn't it?

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.280
 That's so funny.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.000
 At night, the entire wing was singing in chorus, "Aggadu, dude."

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.240
 I sort of missed those days when dances had really clear instructions.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.160
 I'm not one of nature's dancers.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.720
 So when they tell me what to do, that superman that was that place as well, wasn't it?

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.720
 I knew what to do then.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.000
 That was why we all loved the Macarena.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Exactly.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.400
 You knew what to do.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:47.000
 There was a movie in 1984 which I'm sure you all know called Footloose.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.320
 And it's a story of a teenager who goes to a small town where dancing has been banned

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.340
 by the local government, so that's why I'm talking about that.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.440
 One of the people who was in this movie was the actor Kevin Bacon.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:06.200
 He was 24 at the time, but to get himself into the role, he enrolled into a local high

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:12.000
 school pretending to be a 17-year-old, isn't that amazing?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Wow.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.560
 Was he rumbled?

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.560
 He was not rumbled.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.820
 How old was he at the time, sorry?

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.200
 He was 24 and he was pretending to be 17.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.240
 The principal apparently knew about it, but no one else knew about it at all.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240
 Oh my God.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.040
 And he fell in love with Drew Barrymore at the end.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.440
 Well, the amazing thing is he got really badly bullied.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440
 Really?

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.520
 He went to the school and he thought, like, his character was that he'd come from the

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.720
 city and he was in like a small town school, and so he was wearing clothes that he imagined

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.280
 a 17-year-old would wear if they'd come from, you know, Philadelphia and gone into a school.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.160
 Obviously, he looked very different than all the other kids and so they just really, really

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:57.320
 bullied him quite badly until one of the kids kind of came and sort of took him under his

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.720
 wing and apparently that's kind of something that happens in the movie, although I haven't

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.880
 seen it, so I don't know.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.720
 I don't believe that Never Been Kiss was not just entirely based on this story.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.960
 I mean, that is the whole plot.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.960
 Is it?

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.960
 I don't know.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.960
 Is Never Been Kiss someone goes back into a school?

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.960
 Guys, Drew Barrymore.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.960
 She's about 24.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.960
 She's a reporter.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.320
 She disguises herself as 17-year-old to go back into a school where she gets badly bullied

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.200
 until someone takes her under their wing.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.120
 Was it laid after 1984?

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.120
 It certainly was, yeah.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.120
 It's 21 Jump Street.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.120
 That's that as well, isn't it?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.120
 Is it 21 Jump Street?

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.120
 Yeah, they do that.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.120
 Cops go back to school.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.320
 All I know is, is that the one where there's a meme where he goes, "How do you do fellow

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.320
 kids?"

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.320
 It's what, is that?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.320
 Is that really what the meme?

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.320
 I only know the meme.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.320
 The meme must come from that.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:40.360
 And very weirdly, I've got something about banned or official dancers in the USA.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.360
 Okay.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.320
 So, and it relates to Hollywood as well.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.320
 Right.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.880
 So, the four U.S. states have passed laws designating square dancing the official state

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.880
 folk dance.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.880
 Right?

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.880
 I thought you were going to say it was banned.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.880
 No, no, no.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.880
 Far from it.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.880
 Far from it.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.360
 There have been so many attempts to make square dancing the national folk dance.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.760
 And people keep saying at the national level, "Look, this is not really a national thing.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.320
 We don't, you know, there's lots going on.

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.320
 We don't care."

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.320
 So, there are other ones.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.440
 So, like, Hawaii has the hula, obviously.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.120
 Kentucky has clogging.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.480
 It didn't look into you very much.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.000
 Because North Carolina has the Carolina Shag and that's the official dance.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.160
 And there is a 1989 movie starring Bridget Fonda, which is simply called Shag.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.840
 And it's about four high school students on a road trip.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.040
 I was really disappointed when I went to the movie.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:36.800
 I was expecting a documentary about carpets and I went as a bird lover.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.600
 It culminates in a shagging contest, basically.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.600
 Shag dancing contest.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.600
 Is the dance anything like a shag?

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.600
 I mean, dance though.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.280
 It depends how you do it.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.360
 Any dance can be, can't it?

00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:01.000
 OK, it's time for fact number two and that is Andes.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.840
 My fact is that in the 7th century, one of the most impressive things you could be buried

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.800
 with was a folding chair.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.280
 That was hot, hot stuff.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.520
 Is that because they were from the future, when you had a time machine?

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.800
 It was not because of that, but that was...

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.720
 Usually it's like things that you were buried with as for use in the afterlife.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.760
 Maybe, you know, might want to now sit down.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.760
 Always.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.400
 Well, the woman they was found with was in a, they think was in her 40s or 50s.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.880
 And as a woman in her 40s, I could relate to carrying a chair around.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.360
 Where are you going?

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.000
 Yeah, this is the thing.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.280
 They're normally found in women's graves, the kind of grave goods.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.600
 And about 30 medieval gravesites have been found with chair burials, as they call them.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.120
 This latest one, it's quite a recent find.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.520
 It dates back to about 600 AD.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:55.200
 And it's kind of, it might not be that they were very, very powerful, wealthy people in

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.200
 life.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.160
 It's kind of because they're often buried with lots of humble grave goods as well.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.640
 But they seem to be kind of spiritually significant.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.640
 Oh, really?

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.640
 They're having a folding chair.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.640
 It seems, yeah.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.240
 Like a wise woman kind of thing.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.240
 Exactly.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.240
 A healer or a magician.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.240
 I think, I've misunderstood.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.080
 So they were buried sat on the chair?

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.960
 No, I think the chair was just included.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.920
 It was just included, like, as their favorite chair.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.200
 I wouldn't have the image of it, I'm lowered on a chair.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.200
 No.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.160
 There's an archaeologist called Bettina Pfaff.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.600
 And who, she thinks that these women, it's mostly women, belong to a kind of spiritual

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.600
 elite.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.600
 How interesting.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.600
 Yeah.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.160
 So in life, they would sit on the chair whilst reading someone's palm or something, presumably.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.160
 Maybe, yeah, or leading a ceremony or something, and they were buried with it.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.160
 Yeah.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.160
 Cool.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.160
 And where was this?

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.160
 In Europe?

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.160
 Across lots of Europe, yeah.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160
 Germany, especially, I think.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.160
 Quite a lot in Germany.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.160
 Oh, really?

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.160
 Yeah.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.160
 Yeah, big deal.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.640
 So I did a series called "You Can't Take It With You" on Radio 4, which is about, it started

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.440
 off being about when my dad died, we went a bit mad putting stuff in the coffin to the

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.720
 point we thought we might have to take him out.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.640
 Just filled it up with stuff.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.560
 And so I got really into sort of reading about grave goods a bit, and one of my favorite

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:12.680
 things I found was a website where you can buy a coffin with drawers in so that you can

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.600
 put the goods for the person in the drawers.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.040
 And my favorite line on this website says, "If you do choose to bury the deceased with

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.320
 some personal items, it's important to remember that these are items you will not get back."

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.320
 That is useful.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.080
 He's putting their car keys in there.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.080
 Wow.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.080
 That's amazing.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.840
 I didn't even think that was like a modern thing to put grave goods in.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.840
 No.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.200
 The drawers at the bottom, sort of under the body, are they?

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.200
 Yeah.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.440
 I think it's a bit cruel, because if they do go to an afterlife, have they got access

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.440
 to those drawers?

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.160
 Yeah, because they're all, I've got my favorite things, but I can't get them.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:52.280
 I think it started with when my dad died, he had his head was on this sort of lacy pillow.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.280
 It just wasn't right.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.640
 My dad ran a sex shop for a living.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.640
 It didn't look right.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.920
 It sounds like it could fit by running to a sex shop.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.560
 His girlfriend replaced it with some inflatable breasts.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560
 Wow.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.560
 That is brilliant.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.960
 Imagine the archeologists in such a place.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.760
 I love imagining that.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.040
 And they'll jump to such conclusions about our entire society.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.320
 He thinks it's sex wizard, we think.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.080
 Well, actually, he was cremated, so, and that's the other thing.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.720
 So I started asking people, A, about what they would want buried with them, and B, what

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.040
 they would put in my coffin, because I just thought you don't get a say, do you, at that

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.040
 point?

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.160
 Someone else is deciding what you want to say with you.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.840
 And of course, most people I spoke to were going to be cremated, and so everyone would

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840
 say popcorn kernels.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.120
 So I'm going to build my coffin with.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.120
 That's fun.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.120
 That's fun.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.120
 A little fireworks.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.200
 Yeah, fireworks or cannabis, something just to make it a bit more fun.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.760
 So yeah, chairs, folding chairs that go back a long way, which makes sense, actually.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:55.640
 There's a book on chairs by a guy called Rittold Rybsinski, and I always come back to this

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.640
 in my research.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.640
 It's such a good book, but he says he thinks the oldest chairs ever will have been folding.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.080
 It's a cracker, I'm telling you.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.680
 I disagree with Mr. Rybsinski or whatever he was called.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.080
 You don't think the oldest chairs are folding?

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.800
 I don't really, because I think the oldest chair would be literally just a box.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.080
 And I think it requires something extra to.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.480
 I think once you've made it into, once you've used some human skill rather than just sitting

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.280
 on a flat rock and claiming it's a chair, because it would be nomadic societies.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.920
 So I think the oldest evidence of folding chairs we have might be ancient Mongolian

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.600
 societies who were nomadic.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.560
 So the important people would take a chair with them.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.560
 And that's.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.560
 That's great.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.600
 And they looked exactly like those beach chairs that you get, you know, the old people sitting

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.600
 on beaches.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.840
 There are eight folding stools in the British Museum.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.840
 Wow.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.840
 Wow.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.840
 And the earliest one is.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.840
 What for just people to sit in.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:52.040
 Such a good point, because they have those people who sit and make sure you don't steal

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.040
 anything.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.040
 Don't you?

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.040
 And they sit on little stools.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.040
 Also very old, those people.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.040
 A lot of the time.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:03.880
 The oldest one they have is from the 18th Dynasty of Egypt, which is 1500 BC to 1800

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.880
 BC.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.880
 So that's pretty old.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.880
 Wow.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.880
 And how, what do they look like?

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.400
 How easily foldable are they?

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:15.480
 They just look like an X with a pivot in where the two lines of the X meet and then a little

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.920
 bit of cloth on the top, although the cloth is rotted away because that's.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.920
 Yeah.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.920
 Perished.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.320
 So easier than a beach deck chair, which I still can't do.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.320
 No.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.760
 Stripey beach deck chairs are just there to torment me.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.760
 They're a struggle.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.760
 It's like a Brompton.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.760
 Your fingers won't survive.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.280
 Um, lots of folding chairs are big for lots of people.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.880
 So I mean, James, you mentioned the Egyptian ones.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:36.880
 Tutankhamun had one.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.160
 Tutankhamun had a couple in this tomb, I think.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.960
 One was Ebony and Ivory.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.960
 Pretty cool.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.280
 Bishops had a folding chair in medieval times.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.280
 That was a huge deal.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.040
 And, um, there was a thing called the Cathedral, which is the bishop's official throne.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.560
 But if you were traveling around your diocese or whatever it was, you'd have to have a

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560
 traveling.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.560
 A travel phone.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.560
 A travel phone.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.560
 Pretty much.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.560
 That's amazing.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.560
 A traveling cathedral.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.560
 Travel through.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:07.040
 Speaking of religion and chairs, not a folding chair as such, but is it a myth, the papal

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.680
 chair, the hole in the papal chair?

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.680
 That is a myth.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.680
 That is a myth.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.680
 The hole.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.800
 So the whole Pope Joan thing, isn't it?

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.360
 Like, Pope Joan, the supposed ninth century lady pope who probably didn't exist.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.480
 And that they then, the papal chair, had a hole in it so that their genitalia could

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.040
 be inspected from beneath to check they weren't a woman.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.040
 And then they'd shout.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:33.920
 There'd be some cry when they're like, he's got knackers in Latin, and then we can continue

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.240
 with the Catholic Church.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.440
 It's like, yeah, I think that definitely is a myth.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.440
 It's a myth.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.240
 And that's what happened these days for real.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.320
 I was, there seemed to be a spate of people getting their testicles trapped in folding

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.320
 chair.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.320
 Oh God.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.080
 I didn't even have some of my eyes watered.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.000
 I didn't read about any popes doing it, maybe those just didn't make the news.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 It's so common.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.360
 Well, I looked, I thought, I think I was just looking at the chair accidents.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.520
 And I came across like a just a 60-something year old man in 2018 who was sitting in his

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.920
 folding chair, which had little slats before we got to the shower.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.560
 And they fell through and couldn't get them out, had to have the fibregaine come.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.600
 His testicles is that because they do, they do hang lower in older men, don't they?

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.600
 Where?

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.080
 It's interesting you say that because all the stories I found, which were then, I think

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.360
 I found five different stories, they were all older men.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.600
 The rubber perishes as time goes on, and there's a certain.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.600
 Like a worn out slinky.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.160
 Yeah, there's more given system.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.160
 Yeah, it's tough.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.560
 There are some great photos there if you want to look at them.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.440
 What are the photos of?

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.120
 It's mostly like there's a man lying on a stretcher, but he's obviously still sitting

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.120
 on the chair.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.360
 Actually, if you go to Blackpool, you know those cutouts where you can put your head

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.360
 in.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.360
 There's one of those.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.400
 A dangling pair of testicles stuck through a deck chair.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.240
 They have to have the fibregaine on hand at all times.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.920
 Because it's scary when the fibregaine turn up, because they've got things like angle

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.840
 grinders and they've got all sorts of big kit, haven't they?

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.080
 It doesn't really go for the fibregaine, I would have thought.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.800
 It goes for a delicate.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.800
 Surgeon.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.800
 A massaging.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.800
 Yeah.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.800
 Some oils.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.040
 They have to cut the chairs.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.000
 I think there's sometimes no mass and level of massaging you can do, which is a bit frightening.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Yeah.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.960
 And I have to say I respected the fire, it was firemen, two firemen so much in one photo

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.960
 I saw who had such grave looks on their faces, which I imagine took a huge amount of effort

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.240
 to try to free some of those testicles from a chair.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.160
 We used to call it, so I used to be a nurse and you'd call it the nurses mask or the,

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.280
 and I think firemen had the same thing.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.880
 Because sometimes you'd see things that were funny or that were horrific and you can't,

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.800
 you know, you can't take a bandage off and go, oh my God, you know, you have to just

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.880
 sort of maintain this kind of nurses mask and they call it, yeah.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.840
 Is it a sort of a creepy grin?

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.840
 Amazing.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.920
 Do you know who the first person to use the word deck chair was?

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.280
 We're going to say invented the word deck chair, but famous person, famous person.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.280
 So it's gettable.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.280
 Oh, no.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.480
 I'd be astonished if you guys use the word deck chair.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.480
 Give us a century.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:13.480
 1880s, author of a children's book, often ran a service car.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.480
 Oh, Louis Carlsson.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.480
 No, that's not 1880s.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.480
 1880s.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.840
 Oh, Kenneth Graham, who wrote The Wind and the Willows.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.840
 All good one, but no.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.840
 British?

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.840
 British, yeah.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.840
 British children's of the 1880s.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.840
 1880s.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.840
 It's tough.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.840
 Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.840
 No.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.840
 You like it because you wrote the pirate books?

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.840
 Think of that surname.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.840
 Stevenson.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.400
 I think of what else Stevenson's are related to.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.840
 That's Stevenson's rocket was the first train.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.840
 Oh, Nesbit.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.840
 Oh, Nesbit.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.840
 Yeah, yeah, I wrote my place.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.840
 That was good.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.840
 That was stunningly good.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:51.840
 Ian Nesbit, who wrote The Railway Children, deck chair was first used in that book.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.840
 Also, great clue giving from Stevenson.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.840
 Yeah, that was.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.840
 It was a great throw and a great catch.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.840
 I enjoyed that very much.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.840
 It was good part of the audience.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.840
 On either side.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.840
 Some other words invented by Ian Nesbit in the OED.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.840
 Brecky, snarky and zooming.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.840
 Wow.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.840
 Zooming as in moving around quickly.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.840
 My dog gets the zoomies.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.840
 Zooming, yeah.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840
 Wait, what does the dog do?

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.840
 It's called a zoomie.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.840
 Yeah, she gets some zoomie.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.840
 Of course, my mum.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.840
 You know, when dogs just get really hyper excited, they just run about.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.840
 They call it the zoomies.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.840
 Is that what the zoomies is?

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.840
 Yeah.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.840
 I thought the zoomies was a drug thing.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.840
 It might also be that.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.840
 It's drug paraphernalia, your honour.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.840
 Wow.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.840
 Do they ban the deck chairs on Bournemouth Beach?

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.840
 I think it was last year.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.840
 There was, so, oh, they stopped renting them out.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.840
 You didn't get a rescue if you bought your own deck chair.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.840
 Wouldn't immediate climb down from a promising little hill.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.840
 It's a molehill now.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.840
 It was a government thing, or a council thing.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.840
 It was a council thing.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.840
 Because they were afraid they were going to be used as weapons.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.840
 Really?

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.840
 I couldn't really find any evidence that they have been used as weapons.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.840
 It feels like a pretext, doesn't it?

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.840
 It does, but for what, why?

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.840
 Why didn't they want to rent them out?

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.840
 It lost the council about 200 grand that year.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.840
 Really?

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.840
 How would they think that you'd go around and sort of snap old men's testicles on them?

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:19.840
 I suppose chairs as weapons is, like, every time there's any sort of football violence, whatever,

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.840
 it's always plastic chairs being thrown around, isn't it?

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.840
 Oh, it's plastic one.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.840
 And in wrestling, of course, they have the steel chair,

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.840
 but it's very rarely the deck chair.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.840
 He's getting out the deck chair.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.840
 Oh, he's still getting it out.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.840
 He wants it out.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.840
 You're in trouble.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.840
 You talked about Bournemouth, Anna, I think.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.840
 There was an article in 2021 in the Telegraph about deck chairs in Scarborough.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.840
 This was a 58-year-old woman called Dawn Avison,

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.840
 who runs the last remaining deck chair concession in Scarborough.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.840
 She's got what they described as a deep mahogany tan,

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.840
 and apparently locally it's known as Scarborough Rust,

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.840
 which is if you work on the beach.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.840
 That's your tan that you have.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.840
 And she said that last summer,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.840
 former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.840
 sat down on one of her deck chairs for a selfie

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.840
 and then left without paying.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840
 What?

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.840
 And now he's a minister without portfolio,

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.840
 so I think that just says, you know...

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840
 Wow.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.840
 He's a man who I genuinely don't think could put up a deck chair.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.840
 Gavin Williamson, no.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.840
 I don't think any of them could, because they're the current cabinet.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.840
 Can I tell you one bit of folding chair news?

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.840
 Yeah.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.840
 Are you guys familiar with Sidney Jo, the 27-year-old tiktoker?

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.840
 Of course.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.840
 There you go.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.840
 I knew you would be...

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.840
 27-year-old tiktoker.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.840
 I don't know anything about tiktok, but that feels old.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.840
 Well, she's appealing to the youth.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.840
 So she got stuck in a folding chair,

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.840
 which is kind of amazing.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.840
 There's a picture and she's looking at her body

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.840
 through the middle of it, it's folded around her,

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.840
 and she had to be removed by the fire brigade.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.840
 I think this was last year,

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.840
 and they used jaws of life,

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.840
 the hydraulic things that you used

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.840
 to extract people from crashed cars and stuff,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.840
 which sounds quite frightening.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.840
 And the reason that she'd got stuck

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.840
 is because she has a $199 per minute channel

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.840
 where she gets stuck in things and then frees herself,

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.840
 and it went wrong.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.840
 Oh, what do you mean?

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.840
 It's like people pay to watch their escape from stuff.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.840
 Yes, I think we're all asking, is this a sex thing?

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.840
 Look, it says it's a fetish channel.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.840
 That sounds like sex.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.840
 I'm not down with all the lingo,

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.840
 but I think that is a sex thing.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.840
 God, the poor, bloody fire brigade in her local area.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.840
 Hello, it's me.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.840
 This is me again.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840
 Yes.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.840
 No, a washing machine this time, yeah.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:51.840
 Okay, it's time for fact number three,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.840
 and that is my fact.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.840
 This week is that most people dislike kale

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.840
 before they're even born.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.840
 That's how long lasting the loathing is.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.840
 This is this weird thing that came out recently,

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.840
 and it's quite a small study,

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.840
 but it looked at ultrasound scans in 70,

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.840
 about 70 pregnant women in the late in the third trimester,

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.840
 and then they got the pregnant women to take capsules

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.840
 of either powdered kale or powdered carrot or nothing.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.840
 And then they looked at what the fetuses were doing,

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.840
 and the fetuses made the facial expressions

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.840
 that, well, when they had the kale,

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.840
 they made the facial expression they make when they cry.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.840
 An unmistakable kind of wint of displeasure.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.840
 I mean, we're not 100%,

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.840
 and that's what a fetus means when it makes that face,

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.840
 but come on.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.840
 It feels like ethical issues here, right?

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.840
 If you're making your fetus unhappy, making it cry.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.840
 You're right.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.840
 The ethical issues with feeding people kale,

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.840
 that's every parent who makes their kid eat vegetables.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.840
 So at what point is the baby crying?

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.840
 Because obviously the mother's eating the, takes the capsule,

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.840
 so they're waiting for it to,

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.840
 how do they know that that, at that point,

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.840
 that the baby's receiving the kale?

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.840
 I think it was, they waited 20 minutes,

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.840
 and I think by that point,

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.840
 whatever you've eaten has filtered through

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.840
 to the amniotic fluid, whatever it is.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.840
 So the flavor, they know the chemical is in there at that point.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.840
 Right.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.840
 And they can compare it to the people who've had the carrot

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.840
 or the nothing and see at an exact moment

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.840
 when their expression changes.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.840
 But it might be a benevolent thing, actually,

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.840
 because if theoretically you eat lots of kale in pregnancy,

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.840
 you might then be able to stop your child hating kale

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.840
 in outside pregnancy, in childhood.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.840
 I think that works.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.840
 That does work a bit, I think.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.840
 It's possible that you can prevent fussy eating, basically,

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.840
 by just exposing the child to as many flavors as possible early on.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:41.840
 Right.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.840
 It's a bit less unfamiliar later on

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.840
 when you're giving them whatever for the first time.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.840
 Obviously the problem being that you'll feel so ill

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.840
 for most of your pregnancy that you will only eat bread and biscuit.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.840
 Okay, I think my mum must have mostly eaten refined sugar jelly.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.840
 But they actually like the carrots,

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.840
 which I find quite surprising.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.840
 I know carrots are sweet, everyone always says,

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.840
 but they're no whisper bar, are they?

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.840
 If you've never had a whisper bar,

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.840
 if all you've got to compare it to is kale,

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.840
 then carrots are pretty good.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.840
 You're absolutely right.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.840
 Yeah, they did a little sort of smile,

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.840
 sort of fetus equivalent of a smile

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.840
 when they tasted the carrot twice as often

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.840
 as when they tasted nothing.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.840
 I wonder if that's because the carrots help them see

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.840
 in the dark and then it's like, "Oh, I can see where I am!"

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:21.840
 Oh, and it's gross.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.840
 But yeah, it is...

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.840
 I don't think kale's that bad.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.840
 I think I can't taste bitterness as much as some people.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.840
 It's all right.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.840
 I had some in research for this podcast

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.840
 when I knew we were going to be talking about kale.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.840
 I went and had a sort of salad and...

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.840
 Then as in you searched out the kale,

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.840
 because I don't have kale in the house anyway.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.840
 Right, so I never do.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.840
 No, no, no.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.840
 I went to a cafe.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.840
 I was like, "I'll have that kale salad, please."

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.840
 I was pleasantly surprised.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.840
 I thought it was horrible and I don't mind it.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.840
 I feel like kale was only invented

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.840
 sort of about 10 years ago.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.840
 I wasn't eating kale in my childhood.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.840
 I was eating cabbage.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.840
 It was pretty much 2012 when it kicked off,

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.840
 2011, 2012.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.840
 And before that, literally no one ate it.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.840
 I think kale was invented in 1976.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.840
 This was...

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.840
 It was the year I was invented.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.840
 You had a twin, kale.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.840
 This was...

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.840
 I didn't eat it in the womb.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.840
 Unlike my other twin.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.840
 This was New York Times food critic Mimi Sheraton.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.840
 In fact, she was the first female restaurant critic

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.840
 at the New York Times.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.840
 And she wrote about how great kale was.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.840
 And at that time, literally no one ate kale

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.840
 in the United States,

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.840
 but she helped to make it popular.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.840
 But they interviewed her a couple of years ago

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.840
 and she said she really regrets now making kale popular.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.840
 She says...

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.840
 Well, she says she read through the article

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.840
 and she realizes that in those days she liked kale

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.840
 because it was cooked properly.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.840
 And in these days, people serve it raw.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.840
 They kind of roast it like I often have roasted kale,

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.840
 which is, you know, it does taste quite burnt

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.840
 and not the way I cook anyway.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.840
 Do you make kale crisps?

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840
 I've tried so many times to do that.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.840
 And every time I went up, we just burnt kale.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.840
 I think that's just how it's meant to be.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.840
 You've just been confused by the word crisps and the fact that...

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.840
 Right.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.840
 I thought it was going to come out like golden wonder.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.840
 All the recipes claim it's heaven.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.840
 It's kind of okay.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.840
 But Mimi Sheraton says if you eat it like you're supposed to eat it,

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.840
 which is like a winter vegetable,

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.840
 like you might have cabbage or something like that,

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.840
 quite often boiled or stewed or stuff like that,

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.840
 then it's really delicious.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.840
 But these days, the way that people cook it is wrong

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.840
 and she feels quite responsible for that.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.840
 That's so interesting.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.840
 That is the one thing I think my Nan might have got it right,

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.840
 that you do have to boil it for three days.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.840
 Yeah.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.840
 Oh, well, do you know what you're supposed to do

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.840
 if you don't have three days?

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.840
 You're supposed to massage it.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.840
 Which I did not know.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.840
 And this completely transforms kale.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.840
 A, it stops it making you fart.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.840
 And B, it stops it tasting bitter.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.840
 And this is if you...

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.840
 Before you do anything to it, you just give it...

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.840
 If you massage it with a whisper bar.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.840
 No, it's because it has a lot of sugars that don't get broken down

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.840
 until they're waved through your digestive system

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.840
 and your large intestine.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.840
 So A, then that gives you lots of bad gas.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.840
 B, that means that on the way through, you're not tasting those sugars

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.840
 and so it tastes bitter.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.840
 But if you massage, and I meant to try this,

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.840
 but I didn't do the first time research,

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.840
 but I'm sure people will write in.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.840
 But yeah, if you squeeze it properly,

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.840
 just like you're rubbing it in before you cook it,

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.840
 then it tastes much sweeter and much nicer.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.840
 So not with oil or anything, just with...

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.840
 With your fingers, yeah.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.840
 I mean, I'm giving it a full-on massage.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.840
 Like some candles, yeah.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.840
 It's romantic music on.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.840
 I've got to say, I also thought it had been invented in 2012

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.840
 and I didn't realise it was really huge in previous centuries,

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.840
 especially in Scotland.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.840
 And I didn't know this at all.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.840
 And it was because it can grow for a start

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.840
 in quite tough Northern climates, which is a good thing.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.840
 And also it grows over the January to April period,

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.840
 which got called the Hungry Gap,

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.840
 which is where lots of previous crops might be running a bit low.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.840
 And so it's a very useful staple food.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.840
 And it's all this Scots dialect about kale.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.840
 All these words, like a kale bell is a dinner bell.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.840
 Kale was used interchangeably with food,

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.840
 as in kale might just mean food.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.840
 And there were sayings as well.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.840
 Have you heard called kale het again?

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.840
 Called kale het again.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.840
 No, what does that mean?

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.840
 Cold kale heated up again.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.840
 Oh, it's that simple.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.840
 What does that mean as a say?

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.840
 Oh, I see.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.840
 It means that he's washed up.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.840
 Yeah, later in life, it's a comeback almost.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.840
 That's nice. That's much more positive than the real meaning,

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.840
 which is that I've heard this story dozens of times before.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.840
 This is called kale het again.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.840
 Oh, God, that's useful.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.840
 Start using that constant.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.840
 A lot of my relations.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.840
 I'll give him his kale through the reek.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.840
 Through the reek. What is a reek?

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.840
 Through the reek.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.840
 The old reek he is Edinburgh.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.840
 Through the nose, through the nose.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.840
 Yeah, because reek means smell.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.840
 It means what you say when someone farts.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.840
 As if someone's farts in the room, you don't know who it is,

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.840
 and you're like, "Oh, I'll give some more kale through the reek."

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.840
 All lovely guesses.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.840
 So reek is smoke.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.840
 And basically, I'll give him his kale through the reek.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.840
 It means I'm going to treat someone badly.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.840
 I'm going to hand you your kale for dinner through the smoke of the fire,

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.840
 so it tastes gross.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.840
 Oh, so it's roasted instead of massaged.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.840
 Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.840
 The word for garden was kale yard, really, wasn't it?

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.840
 For a small vegetable garden, it was kale yard from about 14th century.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:37.840
 And then it morphed into kale yard fiction,

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.840
 which I was not familiar with.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.840
 But this is, well, can you guess what kale yard fiction is?

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.840
 It makes you cry. It makes you grimace.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.840
 It's sob stories.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.840
 It makes you do all of those things.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.840
 Written since 2012.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.840
 And it makes you fart.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.840
 OK, I don't know if it does any of those things.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.840
 It's just a derogatory term for sort of a really bucolic, overly sentimentalised,

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:06.840
 rural, rustic fiction, because, you know, it's like old-fashioned kale yards in Scotland.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.840
 And J.M. Barrie was accused of being a kale yard writer.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.840
 For his books like, "Old Lich Iddils."

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:20.840
 I read an article on Atlas Obscura about Halloween in Scotland.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.840
 I don't know if you saw this, about how kale was quite popular in that time.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.840
 Because it was kind of the growing season of kale.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.840
 Like you said, it was more of a winter vegetable.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.840
 But apparently, youths would blindfold each other,

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:37.840
 pull stalks of kale from the ground, and then analyse their length and girth,

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.840
 and the amount of dirt caked onto them,

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.840
 and it would tell them what kind of partner they'll marry.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.840
 Why do they have to be blindfolded?

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:53.840
 And then you could say, "Oh, I think I'll marry that tall, girthy, non-soiled girl."

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.840
 No one wants a soiled girl.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.840
 But I guess that's what you would do then.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.840
 You'd go around the bars looking for a soiled, girthy woman.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.840
 The first one you said kale used in Halloween,

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.840
 I thought it was going to be the world's most disappointing trick or treat.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.840
 Have you never bobbed for kale?

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.840
 When I was a young girl in the '80s,

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.840
 trick or treat wasn't a thing, really.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.840
 When it started to come in, I remember my mum.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.840
 There was a ring at the doorbell, and these two kids said trick or treat,

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.840
 and my mum didn't know what it meant at all.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.840
 It just hadn't been a thing here.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.840
 And so my mum went, "Oh, treat! Two of this week!"

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.840
 She shot the doorbell.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.840
 Amazing.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.840
 That's the choice she was making.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.840
 That's great.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:38.840
 I was really disappointed to read that kale is very high in vitamins K, A and E,

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.840
 but not L.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.840
 Is there a vitamin L?

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.840
 Well, there is.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.840
 There's a guy called Dr. W. Nakahara,

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.840
 who in the 1930s discovered something that he called vitamin L,

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:57.840
 but it turned out to be a couple of chemicals which are not vitamins at all

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.840
 and which aren't in kale.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.840
 But he called it vitamin L because he thought it was good for lactation

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.840
 in rats in particular.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.840
 But it turns out that, yeah, not only is it not a vitamin,

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.840
 it's not particularly good for lactation either.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.840
 But it is a thing, vitamin L.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.840
 It's vitamin L, but the L stands for lie.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.840
 Yes, exactly.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:24.840
 But 130 grams of kale contains 1,000% of your daily vitamin K nutrition.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:25.840
 Wow.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.840
 What does vitamin K do? You get stiff bones, really.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.840
 Stiff bones?

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:35.840
 Do make sure to try and get your bones as stiff as you possibly can.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.840
 I just hear if it's vitamin K, it just feels like a euphemism for ketamine.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.840
 Yes.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.840
 How much kale was that?

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.840
 130 grams, not much.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.840
 I was about to say the opposite.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.840
 That's quite light, isn't it, kale?

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.840
 It's light, I suppose.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.840
 Truth is, it's 1,000%.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.840
 So you only need 13 grams.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.840
 But people who take blood thinners should be careful with kale

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.840
 because if you have too much vitamin K,

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.840
 it can be a problem with your clotting of your blood.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:12.840
 And also, if you have iodine deficiency and you eat an enormous amount of kale,

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.840
 you can get hypothyroidism, where you make too much of your thyroid hormone.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.840
 You can get a nice goiter on your neck.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:24.840
 An 88-year-old woman got severe hypothyroidism and went into a coma after eating.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.840
 But she was eating between 1 and 1.5 kilograms a day.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:34.840
 This is actually bok choy, which has a similar property, raw bok choy for several months.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.840
 But that's more than 10,000% of her daily fit of kale.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.840
 So she was overdoing it.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.840
 And how can you physically eat that much bok choy?

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.840
 It's really light.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.840
 She can't have been doing much else with her days.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:53.840
 It's like a panda, just all day, just chewing on bok choy.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:59.840
 That's a hipster panda, isn't it?

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:08.840
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the week, and that is James's fact.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.840
 Okay, my fact this week is that Goldfinger was such a difficult boss

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.840
 that he once fired someone who didn't even work for him.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.840
 You don't want a fictional Goldfinger here.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.840
 Goldfinger!

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.840
 No, I deliberately missed out.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:30.840
 The start of this fact, which is Brutalist Architect, Erno Goldfinger, did all this stuff.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.840
 We knew Angela was coming on the show, and we know you like a bit of Brutalism architecture.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:40.840
 And so I dug out my book Concretopia, which was written by a good friend, John Grindrod,

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.840
 all about Brutalist architecture.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.840
 And I thought I'd find some facts about Erno Goldfinger.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.840
 And he was a very angry man, apparently.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.840
 Maybe he was stuck in a texture.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.840
 Yes.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.840
 He'd have to be a big dexter, he was a big man.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.840
 Was he?

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.840
 Yeah.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:00.840
 He used to show his strength to the people in his office by using a hole punch

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.840
 to punch through stacks of card that no one else was strong enough to do.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:10.840
 And that was his way of going, don't mess with me, look how many bits of card I can punch a hole through.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.840
 What's the threat there? I can punch a hole through your torso?

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.840
 It's weird that in World's Strongest Man they don't have this ability.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.840
 They're missing a trick.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.840
 It'd be great, because an office-based World's Strongest Man would be very funny.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.840
 Yeah.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.840
 And fun.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.840
 So Erno Goldfinger, people, especially who live in London, will know some of his buildings.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:33.840
 Trelik Tower, I think, is his most famous one, which is only because I used to live near.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:39.840
 But yeah, he did a lot of these concrete buildings, very popular for about three years,

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.840
 but they're all still here.

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:49.840
 And John Grindroth, who wrote this book Concretopia, he spoke to James Dunnett, who worked with Erno Goldfinger,

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:53.840
 and then Dunnett sort of related this story, that he was a very fiery character.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.840
 And whenever you came to work for Goldfinger, a lot of people only lasted less than a day,

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.840
 and they'd be fired at lunchtime.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.840
 And apparently one day, Goldfinger was in one of his rages, you know,

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.840
 probably he didn't get his hole punch working properly, and he stormed through a reception,

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.840
 and there was a guy just waiting in reception, and he just went, "You're fired!"

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.840
 And he didn't even work for them.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:22.840
 He apparently, between 1954 and 1955, in that year, he lost 26 employees in a small office,

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.840
 either through sacking them or they left because of stress.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.840
 That was just in one year.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:33.840
 And you know, obviously, the actual Ian Fleming Goldfinger connection with Goldfinger.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.840
 So Ian Fleming named the character Goldfinger after Erno Goldfinger.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:45.840
 So Erno Goldfinger, the architect, was married to Isabel Blackwell from, yeah, from Cossum Blackwell family,

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:49.840
 and her cousin played golf with Ian Fleming.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.840
 And the family all hated Erno Goldfinger because he was so mean and nasty.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:59.840
 And Ian Fleming didn't like him because he'd demolished some houses in Hampstead

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.840
 to build the Willow Avenue, is it, Willow Road?

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.840
 Two Willow Road, his house, yeah, in Hampstead.

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:11.840
 And so Ian Fleming was angry that he'd demolished these cottages that had been there before,

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.840
 and so that's why he called him Goldfinger.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:19.840
 And Erno Goldfinger sort of got his lawyers involved to sort of try and stop it,

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:25.840
 and Ian Fleming suggested that what he would be prepared to do was put a slip in every copy of the book

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.840
 that said, actually, his name is Goldprick.

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.840
 But in the end, they settled and it was fine.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:38.840
 Didn't they settle because Ian said, OK, I'll use Alrick Goldfinger as in his first name

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.840
 in every mention of him in the book?

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.840
 To clarify the full name is, yeah, he did do that.

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.840
 It's nothing to do with you, it's a complete coincidence.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:49.840
 The story doesn't reflect very well on Ian Fleming, I think,

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:55.840
 because between the destruction of these cottages in Hampstead and the writing of the book,

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:57.840
 I think it was about 20 years.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.840
 I think it's a long grudge that was held.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:04.840
 Well, the thing is with Fleming is, so Pierce Fletcher, who's the producer of QI,

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.840
 he says he knows someone called Scaramanga,

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.840
 and this guy called Scaramanga, his father went to school with Ian Fleming, right?

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:17.840
 And I've met, I don't know if you've met, blow felt the cricket commentator.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.840
 Surely that character is not based on the cricket commentator blow felt.

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.840
 I can't see any similarities.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.840
 It's based on his father, apparently.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.840
 And according to blowers, he says that they went to the same club,

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.840
 and Fleming saw the name in the club list and stuff like that.

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.840
 We're not quite sure.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:37.840
 But basically, I mean, Ian Fleming just knew so many people with amazing names.

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:38.840
 Incredible.

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:42.840
 Because I looked at all my Facebook friends yesterday to see if any of my friends

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.840
 had good enough names to be Bond villains, and none of them do.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.840
 Like, literally, I don't have a single friend who has a funny surname.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.840
 But the settlement they came to was that the publisher would pay Goldfingers,

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.840
 I think some of his legal costs, and they would also provide six copies of the book.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.840
 That's all right then.

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.840
 As long as I've got six copies of the book that's hanging me off, I don't mind.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.840
 But I think it probably didn't pay off for Goldfinger in the end because for years afterwards,

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.840
 or for years after the movie came out, the James Bond film,

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.840
 people would ring him up and do a Sean Connery voice and say,

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.840
 "Goldfinger, this is double all seven."

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:17.840
 Well, you shouldn't have made your address so public with this famous house you built.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.840
 That's true.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:21.840
 He was a lifelong Marxist as well, and he used to sell...

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.840
 He had art sales for...

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:29.840
 Him and his wife used to hold these art sales to raise money for the Red Army.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.840
 Oh, did they?

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.840
 Yeah, and we're friends with...

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.840
 I think Barbara Hepworth used to sell stuff with him.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.840
 Yeah.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:41.840
 I guess his kind of architecture, brutalist architecture, gets associated with left-wing ideology.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.840
 And I think the anti-brutalism movement of saying,

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.840
 "We really hate these buildings. They're so ugly.

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.840
 Can we get some more classical Roman stuff up, please?"

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.840
 is more associated with conservative hypes.

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.840
 It's very eastern block.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.840
 The concrete...

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.840
 It puts the block in eastern block.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.840
 It's very strong.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.840
 It's a function over form, isn't it?

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:07.840
 The whole idea of modernist showing you're working, which I think is beautiful.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.840
 I have a concrete wedding ring and a concrete engagement ring.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.840
 I'm showing this. That's my concrete engagement ring, which I'm showing you.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.840
 It's like a square of concrete.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.840
 And that is my concrete wedding ring.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.840
 My husband has one the same, and the aggregate is pebbles from Brighton Beach,

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.840
 because we live in Brighton.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.840
 So, yeah, I'm a little obsessed with concrete as a medium.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.840
 It's the most attractive I've ever seen concrete be, actually.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.840
 Well, I've got a little theory about that.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.840
 I wrote an article about this in The Independent a little while ago

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:38.840
 about this idea of, you know, like, I was going to say Prince Charles, King Charles,

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.840
 or as Dara O'Brien keeps calling him, what the week, King Prince Charles, which...

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:47.840
 He obviously spoke out against Brutus architecture quite a lot.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.840
 He described the National Theatre as something like a clever way

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.840
 of disguising a nuclear power station in the centre of London or something like that.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.840
 And the monstrous carbon cores and all of that.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.840
 But my theory is that we're sort of triggered by nostalgia human beings,

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.840
 you know, about things that make us think about home.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.840
 If you grew up in Buckingham Palace, then yes, the National Theatre is going to look quite ugly.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.840
 But if you grew up like I did on an estate, you know, where there's lots of concrete

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.840
 about concrete subways, concrete, then those buildings make me feel nostalgic

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.840
 and warm and, you know, so it's all relative.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:21.840
 Like, for example, Wellbeck Street Car Park was a famous Brutus structure in Soho

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.840
 that got demolished a few years ago.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.840
 That beautiful sort of...

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.840
 Oh, yeah, I go past it all the time.

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.840
 It sort of looks like they pour concrete into a beehive,

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.840
 that kind of sort of tessellated, beautiful structure and they knocked it down.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.840
 I just think, well, where's the difference there?

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.840
 Like, people will preserve, say, old coaching-ins.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.840
 Yeah.

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.840
 Because Charles I stayed there once or whatever.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.840
 You go, well, who parked their car in that car park?

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.840
 I bet a load of really famous people did.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.840
 Because of where it is in Soho.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.840
 You've got to get the blue past down.

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.840
 But you know, this idea that things that seem modern to us and ugly,

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.840
 well, in the future we'll have historic values. Stop knocking them down.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840
 Yeah, I agree.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.840
 I would love a car park plaque scheme.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.840
 You know, if you found out Gary Lernicker parked here in 1996,

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.840
 it would change the way I felt about that in space.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.840
 Because basically every Indian restaurant in the country

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.840
 has a picture of Gary Lernicker.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.840
 Does that make you feel different about those?

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.840
 It's, I can't believe...

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.840
 He must have parked somewhere.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.840
 He must have gone to so many Indian restaurants around the country

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:19.840
 because they are, it's everywhere.

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.840
 There's one right near here, right near where we're recording this now.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:26.840
 And it's, I just can't imagine how he had the time as a top-class footballer

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:29.840
 to be plowing through that many curries.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.840
 I can't imagine what it's like to share a bathroom with him.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.840
 Slightly related, I saw Gary Lernicker once in a service station.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.840
 I can't remember which one, like a proper sort of motorway service station.

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.840
 And I was with the comedian John Robbins, we were now waiting for a gig somewhere.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.840
 And he's only like, nice to be with Gary Lernicker ahead of us in the queue.

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.840
 And the thing that just amazed us most was he'd obviously been travelling

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.840
 from somewhere to somewhere and was wearing the most crisp white shirt

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.840
 without a crease in it.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.840
 Oh, really?

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:55.840
 So you've obviously got out of a car.

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.840
 How are you looking so amazing?

00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.840
 That's interesting.

00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.840
 Nice. Well done, Gary.

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.840
 Was he absolutely going to town on a Cormor or something like this?

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.840
 Not in Starbucks, no.

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.840
 He was signing a cup for them, though.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.840
 So I guess they were going to put that on the way.

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.840
 Well, see, all celebrities get around a lot.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.840
 Gary's the only one who comes with his own marker pen.

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.840
 But yeah, you're right.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.840
 Going back to this architecture,

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.840
 which we're talking about, I think,

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.840
 there is this assumption that it's bad for a community.

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.840
 People get very depressed.

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.840
 It has a negative impact on mental health.

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.840
 There was lots of chat in the '80s, which, like, in Thatcher Zero,

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.840
 there was this big pushback against all this brutalist architecture.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.840
 And people were saying, like, Thatcher's favourite housing expert,

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.840
 who was a woman called Alice Coleman,

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:45.840
 saying it's increasing levels of crime and antisocial behaviour

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:48.840
 in all these areas, partly because I think there's less surveillance.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.840
 If you've got those big tower blocks,

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:52.840
 you can get away with a lot, she said.

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.840
 And people do assume that.

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.840
 And I couldn't really find any evidence of any studies

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.840
 that say people's mental health is affected.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.840
 And also, I think, what happened?

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.840
 So, post-war, when there was a housing shortage, you know,

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.840
 after the Blitz and everything, you had to build quickly.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.840
 And there was this fashion in Europe

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.840
 for building up these modernist architects.

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.840
 So, Le Corbusier, who built UnitÃ© d'Abertation,

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.840
 all these grand ideas.

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.840
 But what we tried to do here is do it cheaply.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.840
 Because you had, when Churchill's government came back in '51,

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.840
 and you then had, I think the housing minister then was Macmillan,

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:27.840
 and the idea was to build quickly and cheaply.

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.840
 And so, there was the disaster that happened at Ronan Point,

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.840
 which was a tower block in Newham.

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:36.840
 And it was built 16 stories higher than it should have been.

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.840
 So, the designs were for it to be 16 stories lower.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.840
 That's a lot. That's a lot to add.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.840
 And they used what was called an LPS system,

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.840
 which is a large panel system.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.840
 So, it's precast concrete panels that are then slotted together in situ.

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.840
 And what happened?

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.840
 Apparently, in this particular building,

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.840
 some of the gaps between the panels were so big,

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.840
 you could put a coin through them.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.840
 And they just stuffed them with newspaper.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.840
 And then a gas explosion happened.

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.840
 And one corner, the pictures all over the papers,

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.840
 this corner blowing off of this thing.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.840
 But of course, it spread really quickly because of the gaps

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.840
 in the panel system and all of this.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.840
 So, it was all kind of set up to fail in this country.

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.840
 Because there were tower blocks in Europe that worked perfectly well.

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.840
 And obviously, what happened as well is that when Right to Buy came in,

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.840
 people would buy their council homes,

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.840
 and then they'd move up the property ladder, move out,

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.840
 and then private landlords would let them...

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.840
 So, you end up with this situation where it's the poorest people in society

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.840
 all packed together in places without a concierge,

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.840
 without any proper management,

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.840
 and with nooks and crannies where drug dealers or whatever could...

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.840
 So, they were set up to fail from the off, really.

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:42.840
 So, it's not the building's fault.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.840
 It's the funding and the government, you know, at the time.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.840
 These big ideas cost money.

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.840
 Architects that came up with these big ideas never had to live in them.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.840
 - Yeah. - Although, old Goldfinger did.

00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:55.840
 - Oh, he did live in Balfront Tower, didn't he? - He did.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.840
 I mean, only for a couple of months.

00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.840
 He did say of his... of Balfront Tower,

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:02.840
 which was like the first big thing that he built in London.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.840
 And he said, "Everything I did, I did as if it was done for me."

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.840
 And to show that he went and moved in with his wife.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:11.840
 And he used to host champagne receptions for all the residents

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:13.840
 where they would come and tell him what they thought of the building

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.840
 and what they liked and didn't like about it.

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.840
 Although, if you do, after two months, just move to your swanky pad in London.

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.840
 - Yeah, yeah. - You can go back to Hampstead.

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.840
 - Is it worth saying something about the word "brutalism"? - Yeah, definitely.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:26.840
 Because "brutalism", I think people think, is because it looks brutal.

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:30.840
 But it's actually from BÃ©ton Brut, which is French for raw concrete.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.840
 - OK. - So, that's where...

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.840
 And the term "brutalism" came from...

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.840
 There's a couple called Alison and Peter Smithson,

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.840
 who were sort of pioneers of new brutalism.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.840
 They were the kind of radical young architects in the '50s.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:45.840
 And they wrote an essay where they mentioned new brutalism

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.840
 as this new form over function...

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.840
 Sorry, function over form, ascetic.

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.840
 Which we should say, because it's confused me for a long time researching.

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.840
 You'll definitely know it. New brutalism was just brutalism.

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:57.840
 - There was no old brutalism. - No, no.

00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.840
 - They just started. - But they're new.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.840
 I think Sweden or somewhere, it's called Nybrutalism,

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.840
 was the sort of original in the late '40s, I think.

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:07.840
 And then they sort of picked up that and ran with it.

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:11.840
 And then there was an architectural journalist, Peter Raynabanam,

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.840
 who then wrote about it in the architectural review.

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:17.840
 And they described it as an ethic, not an aesthetic.

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.840
 So, this idea that buildings should be for functional purposes

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.840
 for people to live in, rather than to just look pretty.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.840
 So, it was Raynabanam who kind of brought brutalism as a word, right?

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.840
 It was kind of... They talked about new brutalism,

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.840
 and then he was the one who kind of made a joke

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.840
 about the brute concrete in France. Is that right?

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:38.840
 - Yeah, I think so, yeah. - 'Cause I wrote to John Grindroth,

00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.840
 and he sent me some facts, and he said that the brute in brutalism,

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.840
 because it comes from the same root as Breton Brute,

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.840
 it's the same brute as you get in Champagne.

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.840
 - Really? - So, yeah, Brute Champagne means dry,

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.840
 it also means raw, I think, in French.

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:56.840
 Concrete, would you like a glass of concrete to celebrate?

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.840
 - That's what we had at our wedding. - No.

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:03.840
 Although we did have, actually, the tables at our wedding

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:08.840
 were named after either whiskeys, 'cause my husband's a big whisky fan,

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.840
 - or Brutalist buildings. - That's right.

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.840
 So, we had a Wellbeck Street car park table.

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.840
 - That's so good. - We had a number one Croydon table.

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.840
 We had... My favourite structures, one of them,

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:23.840
 is the Pennine Tower at Lancaster Services.

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:28.840
 I love that structure so much, we had a table named after that.

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.840
 I used to live there, I used to live near there,

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.840
 and I moved to a town, it's called Silverdale,

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.840
 and just to try and get in with the locals,

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.840
 I did a pub quiz there, and they had a question,

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:42.840
 it was around where they gave you ten clues,

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.840
 and if you got the right answer,

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.840
 if you got it in the first clue, you get ten points,

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.840
 and it'd go all the way down.

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:52.840
 The first question was, this building was designed by whoever it was...

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.840
 - Oh, God, now you've got a TP something. - Whatever it's called.

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.840
 Every other team in the quiz ran to him saying,

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.840
 "We've got the answer, we've got the answer."

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.840
 And me and my partner at the time were sat in the corner,

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:07.840
 "No, okay, next clue, next clue, next clue."

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:10.840
 They got all the way down to the last clue,

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.840
 which was like, it can be seen on the M6 just outside Silverdale,

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.840
 and we guessed that it must be that service station.

00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:20.840
 And yeah, that was a typical kind of quiz in that town

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.840
 where all the locals knew all the answers,

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.840
 but if you weren't local, you had no chance.

00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.840
 - That's so funny. - It's a beautiful structure,

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:32.840
 it's a kind of like a space age, a kind of like a flying saucer on a pole.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:36.840
 - Fortin Tower. - You would have got on, I think, quite well with Thomas Edison,

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:39.840
 who was also, do you know about his concrete obsession?

00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:43.840
 - I don't think I do, no. - Oh, God, I think you might have married him in a different life.

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:46.840
 He was obsessed with it. He set up Edison Portland Cement Company,

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:50.840
 and he wanted to make houses and all of their interiors entirely out of concrete.

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:53.840
 And he actually, I think it was because he had lots of sand left over

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.840
 from other stuff he was trying, so...

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.840
 I don't know why he was making sand castles.

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.840
 And he imagined houses made entirely of concrete,

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.840
 but then inside they would have concrete tables and chairs

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.840
 and bath towers made of concrete, fridges made of concrete pianos.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.840
 And he built, I think he built a little version, a little concrete cottage,

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.840
 and it does look like someone's taken a normal house,

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.840
 and then they've poured concrete over all the items in it.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.840
 - I think that was kind of his idea, right?

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.840
 He would just get this kind of shape of a house,

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.840
 and all you would have to do is pour concrete in,

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.840
 and eventually it was set, you'd take off the mould,

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.840
 and you'd have a house, and it would have all the tables in and everything.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.840
 But I think that's, does that still exist, that building?

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.840
 - There might be one. - I think that original one might still exist.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.840
 - They probably have tried to get rid of it, but found it impossible to destroy.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.840
 - It's a place called Hermits Castle, which is in Scotland somewhere,

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.840
 and I can't remember exactly where, but it was an early sort of,

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.840
 I think in the early '50s, maybe, this architect, David, someone, I can't remember his name.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.840
 This is just full of me trying to remember people's names.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.840
 But he built this little, out of concrete, this little castle,

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.840
 and the idea was that anyone walking could then just sleep in it, and people do.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.840
 But he did exactly that, like the beds all moulded into it,

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.840
 and the little shelves and things, it's all moulded into it.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:17.840
 It's called shuttering, so you use wooden panels,

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.840
 or wooden moulds to pour the concrete into.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.840
 You sort of line them with resin, and then move them away.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.840
 So that's why concrete is so exciting, because you can make any shape out of it.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.840
 - It's like plastic, I guess, right? - Yeah.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.840
 - Not comfortable, though, to sleep on.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.840
 - You wish that someone had made a bouncy castle.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.840
 A house made of doovies.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.840
 - Angela, have you seen the film 'Lock'?

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.840
 It's Tom Hardy. - Oh, in the car? Yes, I have.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.840
 I forgot it was called that, about the big concrete port.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:52.840
 So I did British Brutalist Architecture for Mastermind a few months ago,

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.840
 and I just found myself down this YouTube rabbit hole,

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.840
 and about four in the morning I was watching videos of concrete pours,

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.840
 going, "This isn't what I'm doing!"

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:03.840
 "This is not going to come up!"

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.840
 You should start a festive site.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:14.840
 OK, that is it, that is all of our facts.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.840
