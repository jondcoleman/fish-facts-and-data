00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 Hey, clubfish members, welcome to your bonus bit of content.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,080
 We've got a compilation for you today.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,040
 You're going to hear not only the four regular fishers,

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,720
 but you're also going to get the brilliant comedian Olga Koch.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,120
 And you're also going to hear the voice and facts of Lee-ing Lee,

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,640
 one of the QI elves who works on no such thing as a fish and the TV show QI.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,320
 So here we go.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,480
 Here's all the stuff that we couldn't cram into the main episodes on with the show.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,880
 Well, it's Biggest Meatball.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,920
 OK. I have a name.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,160
 Can I just jump in there, Andy?

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,520
 Because I saw this as well.

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,600
 Can I just ask the two people who haven't seen this?

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,560
 Do you think it's bigger or smaller than a Blue Whales testicle?

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,520
 What? The world's biggest meatball?

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,160
 Yeah. Bigger?

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,040
 Smaller.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,880
 Andy, how big is the biggest meatball?

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,480
 It's £1,700, which in new money is...

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,800
 I don't know, actually.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,680
 What about in whale testicle?

22
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,040
 Well, over to my colleague.

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,120
 Only £150 maximum, so you're right, Olga.

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,920
 So it is bigger?

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,640
 Much bigger, yeah.

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,240
 Bigger than a whale's testicle.

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,960
 Gosh.

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,760
 So the criteria for the Guinness World Record meatball, not testicle,

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,360
 meatball is it was on a South Carolina, it was an Italian-American club,

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,320
 and they said, we know meatballs, we can do this.

31
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,520
 And they had a special cast iron cooking pod for it.

32
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,280
 I think they might have had to custom make the pod.

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,680
 Yeah, how do you cook that through?

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,360
 It's so thick.

35
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,120
 Well, that's exactly the criteria.

36
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,720
 It had to be the biggest, obviously, by weight.

37
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,400
 It had to not fall apart when removed from the pod.

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,760
 Oh, my God, that is tough, actually.

39
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,960
 And it had to be edible.

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,320
 But it, disappointingly, I did look into it a bit more.

41
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,040
 It did not all have to be eaten,

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,600
 as in the judge just peeled off a strip and he ate that.

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,640
 Like I said, it's edible.

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,520
 I would think you would have to, like, Bruce Bogtrotter style,

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,240
 sit it down in front of somebody who has then got to finish it.

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,960
 Yeah.

47
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,120
 How big is it if you were like...

48
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,640
 I think it's about the size of a very large pig.

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,720
 Oh, that's not that big.

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,920
 Are we talking this table?

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,280
 Not quite this table, but it's very big.

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,920
 And they put up the recipe on the website,

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,160
 which is ingredients that serves 4,500 people.

54
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,040
 [LAUGHTER]

55
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,560
 Do you guys know what the international language of space is?

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,080
 Ooh, I should think English.

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,120
 Is there an answer to this?

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,960
 Esperanto?

59
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,000
 It's kind of an answer.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,600
 Martian.

61
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,800
 It's definitely not the right answer.

62
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,360
 It's a sign language.

63
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,000
 No, it's the language of love.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,640
 Yes, how can we feel?

65
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,800
 It must be English.

66
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,640
 It must be English or Russian,

67
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,720
 because that's what all the astronauts are.

68
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,240
 Yeah, you're so close to it.

69
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,400
 Oh, both.

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,440
 Runglish.

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,280
 Runglish.

72
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,840
 Runglish is a mixture of both Russian and English.

73
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,320
 So the majority of the astronauts that go into space

74
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,200
 are either Russian-speaking or English-speaking.

75
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,560
 There are multiple nationalities,

76
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,480
 but you are not allowed to go up as an American astronaut

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,560
 unless you learn Russian fluently.

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,400
 That's true.

79
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,560
 Why? Is that true?

80
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,040
 Helen Sharman spoke Russian.

81
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,560
 Yeah, Tim Peake had to learn Russian.

82
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,320
 What if you're-- well, that's because if you're going

83
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,600
 to the International Space Station, right,

84
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,160
 surely there must have been some US-only mission.

85
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,960
 Buzz Aldrin doesn't know Russian, does he?

86
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,840
 No, so this is--

87
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,080
 Sorry, this is current.

88
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,200
 Just terrifying.

89
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,880
 Yeah, because I don't think Leica spoke Russian.

90
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,480
 Yeah.

91
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,680
 But the flip side is that the Russian cosmonauts

92
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,920
 need to speak English fluently as well.

93
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,360
 So what ends up happening is that in space,

94
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,320
 you have a new language, Runglish,

95
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,360
 whereby shortcuts are used between both the languages.

96
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,080
 So you'll start a sentence in Russian,

97
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,000
 but maybe end it in English, because you're just

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,440
 using key words to--

99
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,800
 so that's how they speak in space, largely to each other

100
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,480
 if they're talking to someone who's--

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,360
 But that's like how I try and get by in a shop

102
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,440
 if I'm in a foreign country.

103
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,400
 And I know--

104
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,760
 I know, can I have, or I know, what is the cost of?

105
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,040
 And then I'll tail off, and I'll say that sausage or whatever.

106
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
 Yeah, yeah.

107
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,720
 You just say it with the accent, right?

108
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,040
 Yeah.

109
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,360
 So in German, how might you buy a sausage?

110
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,160
 Done.

111
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,960
 If you feel this, that's--

112
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,360
 Sausage.

113
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,440
 --a cherry-versed bit there.

114
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,400
 Yeah, yeah, but--

115
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,120
 That's German.

116
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,640
 Yeah, yeah.

117
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,520
 Yeah, I was--

118
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,160
 I was too good at German, I'm afraid.

119
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,240
 I don't know, I can't even pronounce.

120
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,080
 How would you say if there's a sausage on the table?

121
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
 I would be stuffed.

122
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,360
 I was like, yeah.

123
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,520
 That's the first is alf, whatever, tish, as we know.

124
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,080
 Yeah, yeah.

125
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,640
 Done.

126
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,280
 Just while we're on space, I've got a Russian linguistic

127
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,800
 moment that was interesting that happened.

128
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,560
 In the early days when they were sending up

129
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,040
 the first cosmonauts into space,

130
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,000
 and they were orbiting for like two days or whatever,

131
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,280
 and then they'd come back down.

132
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,440
 So there was a series of missions called Vostok.

133
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,960
 And Vostok 4 had a cosmonaut called Popovich.

134
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,120
 And Popovich was meant to be up there for four days,

135
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,480
 but he ended up coming down early.

136
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,360
 And the reason-- there's a lot of--

137
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,560
 because there's always hidden stuff about this,

138
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,800
 but one of the acknowledged possible reasons

139
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,240
 that he came back down is while he was up there,

140
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,000
 he was talking to comms, and he was looking down at the Earth,

141
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,480
 and he saw a thunderstorm.

142
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,360
 And he went, oh, there's a thunderstorm.

143
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,160
 He completely forgot that there was a code word

144
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,720
 that they had created, which is that if he was getting

145
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,680
 space sickness, and this was a new thing

146
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,760
 that they didn't understand, you would say thunderstorm.

147
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,000
 Give him a word of something he'll never say.

148
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,680
 Exactly.

149
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,080
 So he says thunderstorm.

150
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,480
 The mission ends a couple of days early.

151
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,880
 There was a lot of stuff in there,

152
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,520
 like the amount of oxygen and stuff like that.

153
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,280
 Something went slightly wrong, and they were a bit worried

154
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
 that maybe they should bring him back in case

155
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
 it broke all together.

156
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,400
 But largely they think it's because they put him on edge

157
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
 when he said, I can see a thunderstorm.

158
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,440
 They went, he's done the code.

159
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,760
 So they brought him down.

160
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,240
 Yeah.

161
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,680
 Oh my god.

162
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,760
 Yeah, cool guy.

163
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,200
 What a wally.

164
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,840
 That is funny.

165
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,360
 Yeah.

166
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,480
 That is a fun fact.

167
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,160
 And he was meant to be, he was as contender to be Gagarian.

168
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,000
 He was meant to be the first person in space.

169
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,600
 So he really wanted to get to space.

170
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,360
 He had four days.

171
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,160
 He was going to be the longest anyone had done it.

172
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,920
 And then, yeah.

173
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,320
 Wow.

174
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,840
 Came back early.

175
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,040
 Gosh.

176
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,920
 This is the worst competitive eating

177
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,280
 I've ever seen on half of a sandwich

178
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,440
 is taking you 45 minutes.

179
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,520
 Surely there's a slow eating competition as well.

180
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,200
 That would be lovely.

181
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,080
 Because you need to continuously be eating though, right?

182
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,960
 That's true.

183
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,280
 You can anecdote at the same time.

184
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,400
 I always finish my meals last, because I'm chatting away.

185
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,080
 You're an only child, Andy.

186
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,600
 Yeah.

187
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
 I think there's a thing about--

188
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,720
 How long have we known each other?

189
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,440
 Yeah, no, I didn't know that you were an only child.

190
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,560
 But I think there's a thing with only children

191
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,840
 is they tend to eat slower.

192
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,920
 Because if you're in a big family,

193
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,800
 you just have to get at the food before going to the house.

194
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

195
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,880
 Only children have a certain--

196
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
 and I mean this is a compliment--

197
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,480
 young Sheldon quality to say.

198
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,560
 Sort of precociousness.

199
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,200
 You're not the first and you won't be the last.

200
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,360
 I'm so sorry.

201
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,160
 I don't know you at all.

202
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,720
 Was it received as a compliment?

203
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,240
 This is going to be the first walk out on such a busy fish,

204
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,360
 but it's not me who's walking.

205
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,600
 Interestingly, the Eagles were knocked off

206
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,320
 from the biggest selling album in America

207
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,800
 by Michael Jackson's Thriller when he passed away,

208
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,760
 that kind of surge.

209
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,000
 And then they took it back over in 2018.

210
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,280
 So it's gone back to the top.

211
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,440
 Because people just keep buying it.

212
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,960
 That is blowing my mind.

213
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,040
 It's nuts, isn't it?

214
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,480
 I didn't think they were that big.

215
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,400
 Because not one of them is the Beatles?

216
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,040
 That's crazy.

217
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,720
 Yeah, exactly.

218
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,480
 Yeah, I read a really fun thing about Queen the other day,

219
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,080
 which is when they got massive internationally.

220
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,800
 You know that thing that people often do

221
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,440
 where they just write Santa, North Pole,

222
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,520
 and it gets sent and it might find its way there.

223
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,320
 A lot of people just put Queen, England, to send it to them,

224
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,400
 but all their mail went to Buckingham Palace.

225
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,240
 That was so funny.

226
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,920
 The Queen was just constantly getting messages

227
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,080
 to Freddie Mercury from someone in Germany.

228
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,040
 That's very funny.

229
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,440
 I read that they found the first scribbles

230
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,520
 of Bohemian Rhapsody, and it was called Mongolian Rhapsody.

231
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,080
 Really?

232
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,640
 Yeah, yeah.

233
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,440
 I mean, they're both regions?

234
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,640
 Yeah, and they both scan.

235
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,680
 They both scan.

236
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,920
 But Bohemian just feels like a better nationality or--

237
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,440
 It's because Bohemian has a different meaning, doesn't it?

238
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,520
 Yeah, I mean nothing against Mongolians.

239
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

240
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,240
 But Bohemian, if you're sort of Lucian,

241
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,560
 living the urban nightlife lifestyle, yeah.

242
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
 What year are you from?

243
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,280
 I don't know.

244
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,880
 [LAUGHTER]

245
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,800
 They are home to weirdos like that giant bacterium

246
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,720
 and other freaks of nature, literally.

247
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,480
 As something else, I think we've mentioned once

248
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,960
 is the mangrove rifulus, which is the only fish that

249
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,680
 lives completely on mangrove.

250
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,600
 So you get fish that live sometimes in mangroves.

251
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,120
 They're very useful places for little fish to hide.

252
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,040
 It's like base.

253
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,760
 They hide from big fish, because big fish can't survive there.

254
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,840
 You swim among the roots, and they're

255
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,400
 small little niches to--

256
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,680
 Exactly, it's a really good hide-and-seek game.

257
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,640
 But the mangrove rifulus is the only one

258
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,400
 that can live there all the time.

259
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,520
 And it can survive for 66 days out of water,

260
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,520
 because the water often recedes in mangrove forests, low tide.

261
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,600
 And so they can live--

262
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,320
 I think we've mentioned before, they live in trees sometimes.

263
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,360
 [LAUGHTER]

264
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,040
 Film, bitch.

265
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,520
 Sorry?

266
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,040
 [LAUGHTER]

267
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,920
 Film, bitch.

268
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,760
 Oh, bitch.

269
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,480
 Film, bitch.

270
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,200
 Sorry, sorry.

271
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,680
 It came out as bitch, didn't it?

272
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,480
 I heard film, bitch.

273
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,560
 I heard film, bitch.

274
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,720
 Film, bitch.

275
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
 This is why my pitch presentations are Hollywood.

276
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,760
 Of course, I've got to be wrong.

277
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,960
 Pitch for a film, fish out of water, right?

278
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,280
 And it's about a little mangrove rifulus,

279
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,960
 which is on day 63 out of 66.

280
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,460
 OK.

281
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,560
 He's got to get back into the--

282
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
 The thing is, though, the term fish out of water

283
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,120
 refers to someone who's in a position they're not usually

284
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,520
 in, but this guy is actually adapted to that situation

285
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,480
 of living out of the water.

286
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,640
 Yeah, it's a positive film, a positive message,

287
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,800
 is that it's fine to be a fish out of water.

288
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
 Well, that's a spoiler alert, isn't it?

289
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,600
 Is it fine, or does it make it in time?

290
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,240
 God, you guys are really intense as a panel for--

291
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,560
 it's good to stress test the idea, though.

292
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,280
 Thank you, before we take it to Tinseltown.

293
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,360
 I think that's a good--

294
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,720
 I think it's ready now.

295
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,880
 I don't think I heard the plot, as well.

296
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,360
 Bitch.

297
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
 OK.

298
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,920
 Everyone's a critic at this point, right?

299
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,840
 Oh, it doesn't have a plot.

300
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
 Oh, that's a spoiler.

301
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,080
 Oh, there's nothing happening in this film.

302
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,800
 I'm trying here to secure our next phase of this podcast

303
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,320
 where we move mostly into scripts.

304
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,760
 Can I quickly tell you about Phil Swern?

305
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,480
 Yes.

306
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,560
 Phil Swern, he devised Popmaster on Radio 2,

307
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,120
 but he was also the only person to own every single top 40

308
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,840
 record in the UK Singles Chart from its origins in 1952

309
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,240
 until the mid '90s.

310
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,120
 He bought every single one.

311
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,880
 He reckoned he had between 6 and 1/2 to 7 million records.

312
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,720
 Oh, my goodness.

313
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
 Wow.

314
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,760
 They're all vinyl, yeah.

315
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,760
 Obviously, we don't do so many vinyls anymore, so he stopped.

316
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,920
 He got to a stage where he knew how much

317
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,160
 he had in his collection and which ones he needed.

318
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,840
 And so he would go to a record fair,

319
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,240
 and as soon as anyone saw him, they just double the price

320
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,080
 of anything that they had, because they knew that he

321
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,040
 would pay the money for it.

322
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,680
 Yeah.

323
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,560
 There was a place called Beano's in Croydon,

324
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,880
 which unfortunately is closed now,

325
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,080
 but it was the largest record store in Europe.

326
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,840
 And they said, here's the key to the stock room.

327
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,520
 Just go in.

328
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,640
 Anything that you want, just anything you can find,

329
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,120
 you can have it.

330
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,360
 And the last record he needed for his collection

331
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,080
 was Diana Decker's Poppa Peccalino, which is the only one

332
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,000
 he didn't have.

333
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
 And he found it in a car book fair,

334
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,160
 and he said to the guy, how much do you want for this?

335
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,040
 And the guy said, 90p.

336
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,360
 And he said, I'll give you 50p for it.

337
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,400
 What he didn't know is that he would have paid anything.

338
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,560
 Can I just really--

339
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,480
 I know we have to move on, but can I quickly

340
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,800
 say something that Evian has given us?

341
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,920
 The writing style of Ernest Hemingway.

342
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,640
 It's thanks to Evian.

343
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,280
 So Hemingway was living in Europe,

344
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,160
 and he wanted to show his works to an editor.

345
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,040
 He might be able to write, publish a new book.

346
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,080
 And so he asked his wife, Hadley, who

347
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,360
 was living in Paris at the time, where his base was,

348
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,080
 to bring his notes up so that he could show them to an editor.

349
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,440
 Hadley decided to pick up not just one or two bits,

350
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,080
 but literally everything.

351
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,280
 So she picked up all of his notes,

352
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,760
 all of his copies of his notes, basically all of his writings,

353
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,720
 everything that Hemingway ever produced.

354
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,240
 She picked it all up and put it in one bag.

355
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,720
 She went to the Garde Leon to go and see Hemingway.

356
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,440
 She realized it was a long trip, so went

357
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,640
 to get a bottle of Evian from a shop.

358
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,320
 When she came back, the bag was gone,

359
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,760
 including all of Hemingway's stuff.

360
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,520
 She went to see Hemingway, was crying the whole way

361
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,240
 because she couldn't believe what has happened.

362
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,120
 She gets to Hemingway.

363
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,800
 He says, oh, don't worry, I've got copies.

364
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,600
 She's like, I got bad news about the copies.

365
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,160
 They're also in the bag.

366
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,040
 So what happened was Hemingway now doesn't have any

367
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,640
 of the work that he's been working on for years,

368
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,080
 but still thinks it's time for him to become a writer.

369
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,160
 So he decides to change his writing style

370
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,520
 and start writing really short sentences.

371
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,960
 - So was he really for it?

372
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,600
 - He was just trying to rewrite everything but far.

373
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,440
 - Yeah.

374
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
 - There's no time for these adjectives.

375
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,040
 - It's not amazing.

376
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,880
 - That's incredible.

377
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,720
 - No way.

378
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,640
 - Apparently that's true.

379
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,800
 - Have you heard of a pot wallopper borough?

380
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,640
 - This is a--

381
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,480
 - No.

382
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,880
 - Pot wallopper.

383
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,720
 Can we guess?

384
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
 - No.

385
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,120
 - Pot walloping is like, you would hit a pot,

386
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,200
 make a lot of noise, and sometimes it would be like,

387
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,680
 if someone wanted to be punished,

388
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,080
 but you didn't want to sell them to the prison,

389
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,800
 you might make this noise to kind of, like--

390
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,000
 - Was that called rough music?

391
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,080
 - Sort of social punishment.

392
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,520
 - Make the noise to what?

393
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,080
 - Kind of embarrass them.

394
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,760
 - Yeah, turn it upside someone's house

395
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,040
 if they've not paid their tax or if they've mistreated

396
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,880
 a dog or whatever, I don't know.

397
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,720
 - And if it's due to that?

398
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,560
 - Nope.

399
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,800
 (laughing)

400
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,600
 - So in the 18th century, right,

401
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,360
 they didn't have the secret ballot yet.

402
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,640
 There were no curtains in the polling booths.

403
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,080
 You had to call out your vote.

404
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,720
 - It was seen as anti-English, wasn't it?

405
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,600
 - Yeah, and it was written down

406
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,680
 and lists were actually published

407
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,280
 of how everyone had voted, so it was a big,

408
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,600
 it was a sort of public thing.

409
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,880
 - It's like you weren't supposed

410
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,520
 to be embarrassed by your vote, right?

411
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,360
 - No, exactly, whereas as we know,

412
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,720
 often you should.

413
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,040
 (laughing)

414
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,160
 I don't mean that.

415
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,640
 So there was a place in,

416
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,200
 so for example, there were these pot wallopper boroughs,

417
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,880
 right, where the only people who could vote

418
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,840
 were people who could boil or wallop a pot

419
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,160
 on a hearth in their house.

420
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,880
 - So they owned the house.

421
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
 - You owned a house which features a hearth

422
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,240
 which you could boil a pot on.

423
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,080
 'Cause some houses were completely tumbled down

424
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,160
 and they were rubbish.

425
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,320
 People lived in a hay barn or something.

426
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,960
 That's not, you can't wallop a pot on the hearth in there.

427
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,800
 - Right.

428
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,480
 - You would have had to have had some convoluted logic

429
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,320
 to guess that.

430
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,440
 (laughing)

431
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,920
 - Pretty obvious, frankly.

432
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,000
 So you have to qualify for these quite,

433
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,960
 the franchise was limited,

434
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,120
 not just to people who owned property,

435
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,800
 but you had to be a housekeeper.

436
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,240
 You had to be not in receipt of arms.

437
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,840
 You had to live in which is like local charity.

438
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,360
 So alms, sorry, alms.

439
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,000
 - Alms, alms.

440
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,120
 - Also, obviously you had to be an adult man.

441
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,720
 And you could be challenged when you went to vote, right?

442
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
 So when you went to vote.

443
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
 - Wallop this pan.

444
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,400
 (laughing)

445
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,560
 - People can put up their hand and say,

446
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,400
 "I haven't seen him walloping a pot for years or whatever."

447
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,760
 Or you know, "I saw him taking some alms."

448
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,360
 And so, and this is the amazing thing.

449
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
 When people went door to door canvassing for votes,

450
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,800
 they were not only trying to persuade you

451
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,360
 to vote in their direction,

452
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,840
 they were also gathering data like,

453
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,160
 "Doesn't look like he's got a pot or whatever."

454
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,840
 So they would then use that data against you

455
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,240
 on voting day.

456
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
 - But if you were campaigning

457
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
 and you were wanting more people to vote for you,

458
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,440
 would there be kind of slightly unscrupulous politicians

459
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,000
 who would give people hearths?

460
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,320
 - Yeah, hot pots.

461
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,160
 - Hot pots.

462
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,680
 - Yeah, teach you how to wallop.

463
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,400
 - Yeah, teach your man to wallop.

464
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,080
 And you'll vote for you in parliament.

465
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,960
 - "Age of Sale" stuff is so cool.

466
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,120
 Like, I just, I really, really like all of it.

467
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,000
 So here's a nice one about the color scheme

468
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,840
 of "Age of Sale" ships.

469
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,960
 This is great, right?

470
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,800
 - Okay.

471
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,040
 - So the Navy tried repeatedly to get captains

472
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,560
 to paint their ships the Navy colors.

473
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,760
 And captains had quite a little latitude

474
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,800
 and they kept on just ignoring it

475
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,840
 and painting them whatever they wanted.

476
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,680
 - What?

477
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,560
 Are the Navy colors Navy?

478
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,400
 - Navy blue?

479
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,960
 - No, sorry.

480
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
 There was a Royal Navy color scheme

481
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,720
 which was adopted more after Nelson adopted it

482
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,520
 'cause obviously it was very popular.

483
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,000
 And it's called the Nelson Checker.

484
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,160
 And it's bands of, the ship looks like a wasp basically.

485
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,520
 It's bands of yellow and black.

486
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,320
 - What, like no such thing as a fish?

487
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
 - It's exactly like that.

488
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,280
 - Okay.

489
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,480
 - This whole podcast is a nod to that.

490
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,000
 I thought we all knew that, right, okay.

491
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,040
 So basically, like horizontal stripes

492
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,440
 of black and yellow, right?

493
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,400
 But the ships have gun decks, don't they?

494
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,720
 So the gun holes, the gun ports are black

495
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,840
 and they are all along the yellow band, right?

496
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,680
 - Nice.

497
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,880
 - So if you're sailing along

498
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,000
 and you are ready for battle

499
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,280
 or you're about to attack someone,

500
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,720
 the ship, it looks like a chessboard

501
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,040
 because you've got a black band

502
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,480
 and then yellow but studded with black.

503
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,320
 - Okay.

504
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
 - Whereas if the gun ports are closed

505
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,280
 and you're not ready for action,

506
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,160
 you've got uniform bands of black and yellow.

507
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,480
 So that's really handy.

508
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,680
 If you're sailing into a harbor

509
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,280
 and you want to show that you're friendly

510
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,200
 or you're not a threat.

511
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,040
 - I see.

512
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,680
 - The color scheme is useful to signal your intention.

513
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,200
 - Can I ask, also, would different countries

514
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,080
 have different colors like football kits

515
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,440
 so you would know who was on your team?

516
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,280
 - Yes.

517
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,120
 - Would they?

518
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,040
 - Yeah, definitely.

519
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,720
 And I think, I don't know what,

520
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,560
 I don't know whether you had,

521
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,320
 you know, you kind of had home and away.

522
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,160
 (laughing)

523
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,000
 Always away.

524
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,840
 - It's away for everyone.

525
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,880
 (laughing)

526
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,720
 - Wait, so you were saying that they have,

527
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,400
 then Royal Navy had the color scheme

528
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
 but the captains ignored them.

529
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,640
 - Yeah.

530
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,480
 - So what did they do instead?

531
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,320
 - Throughout the 18th century,

532
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,280
 they just disguised themselves as the French

533
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,880
 to make it a bit harder and add a little bit of free song.

534
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,080
 - Yeah, that was bad form, wasn't it?

535
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,920
 That's pirate stuff.

536
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,760
 I don't know.

537
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,600
 - I think it was.

538
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,880
 And friendly fire was a problem with ships in this period.

539
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,120
 Well, yeah, 'cause you'd fire a cannon

540
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,400
 and you would quite often have it land

541
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,240
 on the ship in front of you,

542
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
 which was one of your allies,

543
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,760
 rather than the ship a bit further away,

544
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,480
 which was one of your enemies.

545
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,320
 And this is where this revolutionary technique came about,

546
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,160
 which I didn't know about.

547
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,000
 - So can I just ask,

548
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,800
 previously would you have your entire fleet like a conga

549
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,760
 where you would have one and everyone would be behind you?

550
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,720
 - Well, that's so interesting you say that.

551
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,080
 That was what you did.

552
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,520
 This was the huge turning point that came in the age of sail,

553
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,920
 which is kind of what made,

554
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,200
 partly made Britannia rule the waves,

555
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,560
 which is that ships used to all go in a line,

556
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,080
 like all facing each other.

557
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,880
 And you'd be sort of behind your mate

558
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,760
 and you'd be all in a cluster

559
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,600
 and the friendly fire would be a problem.

560
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,440
 So then it's a week.

561
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,280
 - No, no, no, no.

562
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,200
 You would be strung out in a big long line,

563
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,600
 all sideways facing on towards each other.

564
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,040
 I mean, friendly fire was a massive problem

565
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,200
 when ships got close to each other

566
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,360
 'cause you couldn't see anything.

567
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,920
 - Yes, I think it was just, it could end up more messy.

568
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,560
 Whereas what then they decided to do

569
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,840
 is the line ahead formation,

570
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,040
 which is literally like you're in a queue

571
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,960
 and the ships go past the enemy one by one

572
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,680
 and fire cannons at them.

573
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,240
 So if you're in...

574
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,280
 - Like when you have a football match

575
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,880
 and each of the teams walks past each other and shakes hands.

576
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,720
 - Exactly like that.

577
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,840
 You know, I was thinking it was like the queen shaking hands,

578
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,960
 but yes, like footballers or the queen, same kind of deal.

579
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,600
 - But it only works if one of the sides does it.

580
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,920
 This is the thing.

581
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,200
 - Yeah, once everyone gets cracked.

582
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,040
 - This side stops and then like divides

583
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,720
 into two attacking formations

584
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,000
 and goes through the enemy line.

585
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,520
 - For the listener, Andy is drawing up a...

586
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,360
 - Sorry.

587
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,840
 - Very detailed diagrams.

588
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,080
 - I've got an over-enthusiastic.

589
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,560
 - Oh, no, no, we don't need the salt.

590
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,640
 Oh, no, he's pushing them around with a long stick.

591
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,680
 Oh my God.

592
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,560
 No, the black boat, no, put the black boat away, Andy.

593
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,400
 - I'm sorry.

594
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,520
 I just love this stuff so much.

595
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,960
 - Stop twirling your moustache.

596
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,640
 (all laughing)

597
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,480
 - That's great.

598
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,400
 - Can I give you some names of British ships?

599
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,120
 - Yeah, stand me to move on.

600
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,120
 - HMS Abercrombie, HMS Affleck, HMS Amazon, HMS Broke,

601
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,320
 HMS Desperate, HMS Flirt, HMS Kale, HMS Keith,

602
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,320
 HMS Kwan, HMS Spanker, HMS Terrible, and HMS Trump.

603
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,840
 - Lot's of one pick there.

604
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,960
 - Brilliant.

605
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,800
 - So of those, one of them I deliberately mispronounced

606
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,360
 for comic effect.

607
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,560
 Can you guess which one it is?

608
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,320
 Abercrombie, Affleck, HMS Broke, HMS Desperate, HMS Flirt,

609
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,400
 HMS Kale, HMS Keith, HMS Kwan, HMS Spanker, HMS Terrible,

610
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,800
 and HMS Trump.

611
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,600
 - It's not Spanker.

612
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,440
 I've got a shi-

613
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,760
 I've got a nautical hat with Spanker

614
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,360
 on written on the hat, which was a prop from that series.

615
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,120
 - I've got a photo of you in said hat,

616
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,600
 which I think actually comes up whenever you ring me,

617
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,040
 a picture of you with Spanker written on your head.

618
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,360
 - That's brilliant.

619
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,880
 - I've got Spanker, Flirt,

620
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,600
 and then there was another ship called Titan Uranus.

621
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,160
 'Cause that was a real ship,

622
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,440
 but it was commercial, not naval.

623
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,280
 - That's right.

624
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,920
 - It was not Royal Navy, so there was no...

625
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,000
 - Keith?

626
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,560
 - No, it's HMS Broke.

627
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,400
 - Baroque?

628
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,160
 - It's actually Baroque,

629
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,880
 because it was named after a guy called Sir Philip Baroque,

630
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,200
 but it's spelled Baroque.

631
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,800
 - Oh, okay.

632
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,560
 - Yeah, anyway, that's something we'll cut.

633
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,400
 - Must have been funny when the ship came in for repairs.

634
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,000
 - If it ain't Baroque, it affects it anyway, hey.

635
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,520
 I've got favorite mugs.

636
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,360
 - Do you?

637
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,320
 - Yeah, oh God, yeah.

638
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,160
 - Oh yeah.

639
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,000
 - There are certain mugs,

640
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,840
 which if I see them in the cupboard,

641
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,000
 I think, oh yeah, I'll have that one.

642
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,840
 - Yeah, yeah.

643
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,800
 - And then the bad ones I'll give to my wife.

644
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,000
 (all laughing)

645
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,760
 - What constitutes a bad mug in your eyes?

646
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,200
 - I just have certain ones where I like the way the handle

647
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,880
 sits on the fingers, that kind of thing.

648
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,200
 - Do you like a thin rim or a thick rim?

649
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
 - Oh, come on, let's not go into Andy's personal life.

650
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,120
 ♪ Sun in the day ♪

651
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,160
 - I mean, after 10 years, I'm not,

652
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,600
 I'm actually not gonna answer that question.

653
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,440
 No, I don't mind.

654
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,280
 - Do you know what I mean?

655
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,680
 Like you get those tall cups or even like a bone china cup

656
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,000
 which's got a very thin rim,

657
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,960
 or you get your standard mug which's got a thicker rim.

658
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,560
 I actually prefer a thicker rim.

659
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,520
 - I don't mind a fine bone, but I will have a,

660
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,160
 oh, no, I prefer a slightly thicker mug, you know?

661
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,400
 - Yeah.

662
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,920
 - You were saying, James, that this guy couldn't be removed

663
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,440
 from parliament for being of not sound mind,

664
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,560
 and they did introduce a law called the lunacy brackets

665
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,560
 vacating of seats acts in 1886 to allow MPs to be removed,

666
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,080
 and you got inspected,

667
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,880
 and then six months later, you got inspected again,

668
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,080
 and if you'd managed to stay of unsound mind

669
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,040
 for six months, then you got removed.

670
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,080
 So that could happen, but I didn't realize that.

671
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,480
 Who can you name who's resigned from parliament?

672
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,200
 - Boris Johnson.

673
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,040
 - Incorrect.

674
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,880
 - Anna, is this the thing about

675
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,320
 you can't resign from parliament?

676
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,160
 - Yeah.

677
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,000
 - Oh, I see.

678
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,820
 Is that the trick?

679
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,660
 - Is that you?

680
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,500
 - This is the trick.

681
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,340
 - Are you tricking us all?

682
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,160
 - 'Cause I didn't--

683
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,840
 - So Nadine has just left the Chilton Hundreds, was it, or?

684
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,240
 - The Chilton Hundreds, yes.

685
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,680
 - This has international lists of the Klaxon all over it.

686
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
 - I think exactly.

687
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,360
 I think the international listeners,

688
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,200
 I just think it's the kind of thing

689
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,400
 that Americans love about England, or hate.

690
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,440
 - Settle in, international listeners.

691
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,960
 The international listeners switched off a long time ago,

692
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,640
 actually, I don't know where or when.

693
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,480
 - Go on.

694
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
 - I think this might be the kind of

695
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,960
 tragically British thing that international listeners love,

696
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
 so listen up.

697
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,600
 You cannot resign from parliament.

698
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,080
 No one's ever done it, because in 1624,

699
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,560
 it was made illegal for an MP to quit.

700
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,160
 But you also are not allowed to be an MP

701
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,120
 while you're also holding an office

702
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,840
 for profit under the crown.

703
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,520
 So there's basically a fake job,

704
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,800
 which is being crown steward and bailiff

705
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,680
 of the Chilton Hundreds, and you have to take that job.

706
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,120
 It must be one of the most taken, like,

707
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,520
 the single posts that's had the most occupants in history.

708
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,360
 - There's another one, isn't there?

709
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,320
 - If you have to have two MPs resigning

710
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,160
 close to each other.

711
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,000
 - There's a backup.

712
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,840
 - So there's the Chilton Hundreds, and then there's--

713
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,800
 - Chilton Two-Hundreds?

714
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,240
 (laughing)

715
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,200
 - I can't remember what the other one's called.

716
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,040
 - I can't remember what the other one is.

717
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,080
 - It's bailiff of the Manor of North Stead,

718
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,360
 or something like that.

719
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,560
 - Wait, so this job doesn't actually exist.

720
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,600
 - No, but you have to accept it.

721
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,440
 - Right.

722
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,400
 - But Tony Blair has been it

723
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,960
 after he stepped down as an MP.

724
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,840
 - Right, the Dean Doris has been it.

725
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,080
 - And you are it until the next person resigns,

726
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,920
 and then they're in.

727
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
 - And then they become the best.

728
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,600
 - Yeah.

729
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,440
 - It's very, I like that.

730
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,600
 - It's great.

731
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,840
 It's strong stuff.

732
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,840
 - Do they still get paid when you're,

733
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,400
 is this job, well, it's a job.

734
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,640
 You must get something.

735
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,620
 Peppercorn maybe.

736
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,460
 - It's interesting.

737
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,120
 I wonder if they do send you a fiver or something.

738
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,720
 Okay, that is all of our facts.

739
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,480
 Thank you so much for listening.

740
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,880
 We will be back again next week.

741
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,320
 Thank you so much for listening.

742
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,600
 If you wanna get in, we'll back, yep.

743
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
 Hello.

744
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,440
 - Hello.

745
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,520
 (laughing)

746
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,560
 It is harder than it looks.

747
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,320
 (laughing)

748
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,160
 - Hello.

749
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,360
 - Well, that was a great rehearsal, guys.

750
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,720
 (laughing)

751
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,960
 - Are you ready to kick off?

752
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,840
 Can we start with all this?

753
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,560
 (laughing)

754
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,400
 - Okay, that's it.

755
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
 That is all of our outtakes.

756
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,880
 All some hosting from Anna at the end there.

757
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,680
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

758
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,960
 about the things that were said

759
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,640
 during the course of this compilation,

760
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,760
 you could email us on podcast@ky.com.

761
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,480
 And Andy could bring some of those comments

762
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,600
 to the Drop Us a Line,

763
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,120
 which we should have in a couple of weeks

764
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,160
 back here as part of Club Fish.

765
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,920
 Or you can find us on our various social media accounts.

766
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,600
 And do remember, by the way,

767
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,800
 to go and see Olga Cock live if you can.

768
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,920
 She's on tour at the moment throughout the UK

769
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,600
 with her show Prawn Cocktail.

770
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,040
 And then she's going to Australia

771
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,200
 and she's gonna be doing some of the major cities there.

772
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,080
 So go to Rock'n'Rolga, which is her website.

773
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,520
 It's got all the details of the upcoming gigs.

774
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,960
 And yeah, go and see it.

775
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,240
 She's brilliant live.

776
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,200
 Anyway, that's it for us.

777
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,320
 We're gonna be back again with more Club Fish stuff

778
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,160
 in a couple of weeks.

779
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,080
 So we'll see you then.

780
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,920
 Goodbye.

781
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,500
 (upbeat music)
