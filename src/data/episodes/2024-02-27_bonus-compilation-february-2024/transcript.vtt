00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hey, clubfish members, welcome to your bonus bit of content.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.080
 We've got a compilation for you today.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.040
 You're going to hear not only the four regular fishers,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.720
 but you're also going to get the brilliant comedian Olga Koch.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.120
 And you're also going to hear the voice and facts of Lee-ing Lee,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.640
 one of the QI elves who works on no such thing as a fish and the TV show QI.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.320
 So here we go.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.480
 Here's all the stuff that we couldn't cram into the main episodes on with the show.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.880
 Well, it's Biggest Meatball.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.920
 OK. I have a name.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.160
 Can I just jump in there, Andy?

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.520
 Because I saw this as well.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.600
 Can I just ask the two people who haven't seen this?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.560
 Do you think it's bigger or smaller than a Blue Whales testicle?

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.520
 What? The world's biggest meatball?

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.160
 Yeah. Bigger?

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.040
 Smaller.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.880
 Andy, how big is the biggest meatball?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.480
 It's £1,700, which in new money is...

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 I don't know, actually.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.680
 What about in whale testicle?

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.040
 Well, over to my colleague.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.120
 Only £150 maximum, so you're right, Olga.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.920
 So it is bigger?

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.640
 Much bigger, yeah.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.240
 Bigger than a whale's testicle.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.960
 Gosh.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.760
 So the criteria for the Guinness World Record meatball, not testicle,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.360
 meatball is it was on a South Carolina, it was an Italian-American club,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.320
 and they said, we know meatballs, we can do this.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.520
 And they had a special cast iron cooking pod for it.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.280
 I think they might have had to custom make the pod.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.680
 Yeah, how do you cook that through?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.360
 It's so thick.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.120
 Well, that's exactly the criteria.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.720
 It had to be the biggest, obviously, by weight.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.400
 It had to not fall apart when removed from the pod.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.760
 Oh, my God, that is tough, actually.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.960
 And it had to be edible.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.320
 But it, disappointingly, I did look into it a bit more.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.040
 It did not all have to be eaten,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.600
 as in the judge just peeled off a strip and he ate that.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.640
 Like I said, it's edible.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.520
 I would think you would have to, like, Bruce Bogtrotter style,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.240
 sit it down in front of somebody who has then got to finish it.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.960
 Yeah.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.120
 How big is it if you were like...

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.640
 I think it's about the size of a very large pig.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.720
 Oh, that's not that big.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.920
 Are we talking this table?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.280
 Not quite this table, but it's very big.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.920
 And they put up the recipe on the website,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.160
 which is ingredients that serves 4,500 people.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.560
 Do you guys know what the international language of space is?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.080
 Ooh, I should think English.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.120
 Is there an answer to this?

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.960
 Esperanto?

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.000
 It's kind of an answer.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.600
 Martian.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.800
 It's definitely not the right answer.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.360
 It's a sign language.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.000
 No, it's the language of love.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.640
 Yes, how can we feel?

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.800
 It must be English.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.640
 It must be English or Russian,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.720
 because that's what all the astronauts are.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.240
 Yeah, you're so close to it.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.400
 Oh, both.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.440
 Runglish.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.280
 Runglish.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.840
 Runglish is a mixture of both Russian and English.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.320
 So the majority of the astronauts that go into space

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.200
 are either Russian-speaking or English-speaking.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.560
 There are multiple nationalities,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.480
 but you are not allowed to go up as an American astronaut

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.560
 unless you learn Russian fluently.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.400
 That's true.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.560
 Why? Is that true?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.040
 Helen Sharman spoke Russian.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.560
 Yeah, Tim Peake had to learn Russian.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.320
 What if you're-- well, that's because if you're going

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.600
 to the International Space Station, right,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.160
 surely there must have been some US-only mission.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.960
 Buzz Aldrin doesn't know Russian, does he?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.840
 No, so this is--

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.080
 Sorry, this is current.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.200
 Just terrifying.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.880
 Yeah, because I don't think Leica spoke Russian.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.480
 Yeah.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.680
 But the flip side is that the Russian cosmonauts

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.920
 need to speak English fluently as well.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.360
 So what ends up happening is that in space,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.320
 you have a new language, Runglish,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.360
 whereby shortcuts are used between both the languages.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.080
 So you'll start a sentence in Russian,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.000
 but maybe end it in English, because you're just

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.440
 using key words to--

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.800
 so that's how they speak in space, largely to each other

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.480
 if they're talking to someone who's--

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.360
 But that's like how I try and get by in a shop

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.440
 if I'm in a foreign country.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.400
 And I know--

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.760
 I know, can I have, or I know, what is the cost of?

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.040
 And then I'll tail off, and I'll say that sausage or whatever.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.720
 You just say it with the accent, right?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.040
 Yeah.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.360
 So in German, how might you buy a sausage?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.160
 Done.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.960
 If you feel this, that's--

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.360
 Sausage.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.440
 --a cherry-versed bit there.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.400
 Yeah, yeah, but--

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.120
 That's German.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.520
 Yeah, I was--

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.160
 I was too good at German, I'm afraid.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.240
 I don't know, I can't even pronounce.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.080
 How would you say if there's a sausage on the table?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.880
 I would be stuffed.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.360
 I was like, yeah.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.520
 That's the first is alf, whatever, tish, as we know.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.640
 Done.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.280
 Just while we're on space, I've got a Russian linguistic

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.800
 moment that was interesting that happened.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.560
 In the early days when they were sending up

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.040
 the first cosmonauts into space,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.000
 and they were orbiting for like two days or whatever,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.280
 and then they'd come back down.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.440
 So there was a series of missions called Vostok.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.960
 And Vostok 4 had a cosmonaut called Popovich.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.120
 And Popovich was meant to be up there for four days,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.480
 but he ended up coming down early.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.360
 And the reason-- there's a lot of--

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.560
 because there's always hidden stuff about this,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.800
 but one of the acknowledged possible reasons

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.240
 that he came back down is while he was up there,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.000
 he was talking to comms, and he was looking down at the Earth,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.480
 and he saw a thunderstorm.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.360
 And he went, oh, there's a thunderstorm.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.160
 He completely forgot that there was a code word

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.720
 that they had created, which is that if he was getting

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.680
 space sickness, and this was a new thing

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.760
 that they didn't understand, you would say thunderstorm.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.000
 Give him a word of something he'll never say.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.680
 Exactly.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.080
 So he says thunderstorm.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.480
 The mission ends a couple of days early.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.880
 There was a lot of stuff in there,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.520
 like the amount of oxygen and stuff like that.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.280
 Something went slightly wrong, and they were a bit worried

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.720
 that maybe they should bring him back in case

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.720
 it broke all together.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.400
 But largely they think it's because they put him on edge

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.320
 when he said, I can see a thunderstorm.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.440
 They went, he's done the code.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.760
 So they brought him down.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.240
 Yeah.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.680
 Oh my god.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.760
 Yeah, cool guy.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.200
 What a wally.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.840
 That is funny.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.360
 Yeah.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.480
 That is a fun fact.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.160
 And he was meant to be, he was as contender to be Gagarian.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.000
 He was meant to be the first person in space.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.600
 So he really wanted to get to space.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.360
 He had four days.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.160
 He was going to be the longest anyone had done it.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.920
 And then, yeah.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.320
 Wow.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.840
 Came back early.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.040
 Gosh.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.920
 This is the worst competitive eating

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.280
 I've ever seen on half of a sandwich

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.440
 is taking you 45 minutes.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.520
 Surely there's a slow eating competition as well.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.200
 That would be lovely.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.080
 Because you need to continuously be eating though, right?

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.960
 That's true.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.280
 You can anecdote at the same time.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.400
 I always finish my meals last, because I'm chatting away.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.080
 You're an only child, Andy.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.600
 Yeah.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.560
 I think there's a thing about--

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.720
 How long have we known each other?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.440
 Yeah, no, I didn't know that you were an only child.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.560
 But I think there's a thing with only children

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.840
 is they tend to eat slower.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.920
 Because if you're in a big family,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.800
 you just have to get at the food before going to the house.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.880
 Only children have a certain--

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.880
 and I mean this is a compliment--

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.480
 young Sheldon quality to say.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.560
 Sort of precociousness.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.200
 You're not the first and you won't be the last.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.360
 I'm so sorry.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.160
 I don't know you at all.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.720
 Was it received as a compliment?

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.240
 This is going to be the first walk out on such a busy fish,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.360
 but it's not me who's walking.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.600
 Interestingly, the Eagles were knocked off

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.320
 from the biggest selling album in America

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.800
 by Michael Jackson's Thriller when he passed away,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.760
 that kind of surge.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.000
 And then they took it back over in 2018.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.280
 So it's gone back to the top.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.440
 Because people just keep buying it.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.960
 That is blowing my mind.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.040
 It's nuts, isn't it?

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.480
 I didn't think they were that big.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.400
 Because not one of them is the Beatles?

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.040
 That's crazy.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.720
 Yeah, exactly.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.480
 Yeah, I read a really fun thing about Queen the other day,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.080
 which is when they got massive internationally.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.800
 You know that thing that people often do

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.440
 where they just write Santa, North Pole,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.520
 and it gets sent and it might find its way there.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.320
 A lot of people just put Queen, England, to send it to them,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.400
 but all their mail went to Buckingham Palace.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.240
 That was so funny.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.920
 The Queen was just constantly getting messages

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.080
 to Freddie Mercury from someone in Germany.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.040
 That's very funny.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.440
 I read that they found the first scribbles

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.520
 of Bohemian Rhapsody, and it was called Mongolian Rhapsody.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.080
 Really?

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.440
 I mean, they're both regions?

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.640
 Yeah, and they both scan.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.680
 They both scan.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.920
 But Bohemian just feels like a better nationality or--

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.440
 It's because Bohemian has a different meaning, doesn't it?

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.520
 Yeah, I mean nothing against Mongolians.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.240
 But Bohemian, if you're sort of Lucian,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.560
 living the urban nightlife lifestyle, yeah.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.560
 What year are you from?

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.280
 I don't know.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.800
 They are home to weirdos like that giant bacterium

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.720
 and other freaks of nature, literally.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.480
 As something else, I think we've mentioned once

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.960
 is the mangrove rifulus, which is the only fish that

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.680
 lives completely on mangrove.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.600
 So you get fish that live sometimes in mangroves.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.120
 They're very useful places for little fish to hide.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.040
 It's like base.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.760
 They hide from big fish, because big fish can't survive there.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.840
 You swim among the roots, and they're

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.400
 small little niches to--

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.680
 Exactly, it's a really good hide-and-seek game.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.640
 But the mangrove rifulus is the only one

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.400
 that can live there all the time.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.520
 And it can survive for 66 days out of water,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.520
 because the water often recedes in mangrove forests, low tide.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.600
 And so they can live--

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.320
 I think we've mentioned before, they live in trees sometimes.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.040
 Film, bitch.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.520
 Sorry?

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:31.920
 Film, bitch.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.760
 Oh, bitch.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.480
 Film, bitch.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.200
 Sorry, sorry.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.680
 It came out as bitch, didn't it?

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.480
 I heard film, bitch.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.560
 I heard film, bitch.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.720
 Film, bitch.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.720
 This is why my pitch presentations are Hollywood.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.760
 Of course, I've got to be wrong.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.960
 Pitch for a film, fish out of water, right?

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.280
 And it's about a little mangrove rifulus,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.960
 which is on day 63 out of 66.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.460
 OK.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.560
 He's got to get back into the--

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.560
 The thing is, though, the term fish out of water

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.120
 refers to someone who's in a position they're not usually

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.520
 in, but this guy is actually adapted to that situation

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.480
 of living out of the water.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.640
 Yeah, it's a positive film, a positive message,

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.800
 is that it's fine to be a fish out of water.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.800
 Well, that's a spoiler alert, isn't it?

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.600
 Is it fine, or does it make it in time?

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.240
 God, you guys are really intense as a panel for--

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.560
 it's good to stress test the idea, though.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.280
 Thank you, before we take it to Tinseltown.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.360
 I think that's a good--

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.720
 I think it's ready now.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.880
 I don't think I heard the plot, as well.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.360
 Bitch.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.360
 OK.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.920
 Everyone's a critic at this point, right?

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.840
 Oh, it doesn't have a plot.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.840
 Oh, that's a spoiler.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.080
 Oh, there's nothing happening in this film.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.800
 I'm trying here to secure our next phase of this podcast

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.320
 where we move mostly into scripts.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.760
 Can I quickly tell you about Phil Swern?

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.480
 Yes.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.560
 Phil Swern, he devised Popmaster on Radio 2,

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.120
 but he was also the only person to own every single top 40

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.840
 record in the UK Singles Chart from its origins in 1952

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.240
 until the mid '90s.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.120
 He bought every single one.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.880
 He reckoned he had between 6 and 1/2 to 7 million records.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.720
 Oh, my goodness.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.720
 Wow.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.760
 They're all vinyl, yeah.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.760
 Obviously, we don't do so many vinyls anymore, so he stopped.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.920
 He got to a stage where he knew how much

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.160
 he had in his collection and which ones he needed.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.840
 And so he would go to a record fair,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.240
 and as soon as anyone saw him, they just double the price

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.080
 of anything that they had, because they knew that he

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.040
 would pay the money for it.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.680
 Yeah.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.560
 There was a place called Beano's in Croydon,

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.880
 which unfortunately is closed now,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.080
 but it was the largest record store in Europe.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.840
 And they said, here's the key to the stock room.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.520
 Just go in.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.640
 Anything that you want, just anything you can find,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.120
 you can have it.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.360
 And the last record he needed for his collection

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.080
 was Diana Decker's Poppa Peccalino, which is the only one

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.000
 he didn't have.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.680
 And he found it in a car book fair,

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.160
 and he said to the guy, how much do you want for this?

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.040
 And the guy said, 90p.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.360
 And he said, I'll give you 50p for it.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.400
 What he didn't know is that he would have paid anything.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.560
 Can I just really--

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.480
 I know we have to move on, but can I quickly

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.800
 say something that Evian has given us?

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.920
 The writing style of Ernest Hemingway.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.640
 It's thanks to Evian.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.280
 So Hemingway was living in Europe,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.160
 and he wanted to show his works to an editor.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.040
 He might be able to write, publish a new book.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.080
 And so he asked his wife, Hadley, who

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.360
 was living in Paris at the time, where his base was,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.080
 to bring his notes up so that he could show them to an editor.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.440
 Hadley decided to pick up not just one or two bits,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.080
 but literally everything.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.280
 So she picked up all of his notes,

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.760
 all of his copies of his notes, basically all of his writings,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.720
 everything that Hemingway ever produced.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.240
 She picked it all up and put it in one bag.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.720
 She went to the Garde Leon to go and see Hemingway.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.440
 She realized it was a long trip, so went

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.640
 to get a bottle of Evian from a shop.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.320
 When she came back, the bag was gone,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.760
 including all of Hemingway's stuff.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.520
 She went to see Hemingway, was crying the whole way

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.240
 because she couldn't believe what has happened.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.120
 She gets to Hemingway.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.800
 He says, oh, don't worry, I've got copies.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.600
 She's like, I got bad news about the copies.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.160
 They're also in the bag.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.040
 So what happened was Hemingway now doesn't have any

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.640
 of the work that he's been working on for years,

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.080
 but still thinks it's time for him to become a writer.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.160
 So he decides to change his writing style

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.520
 and start writing really short sentences.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.960
 - So was he really for it?

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.600
 - He was just trying to rewrite everything but far.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.440
 - Yeah.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.200
 - There's no time for these adjectives.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.040
 - It's not amazing.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.880
 - That's incredible.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.720
 - No way.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.640
 - Apparently that's true.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.800
 - Have you heard of a pot wallopper borough?

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.640
 - This is a--

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.480
 - No.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.880
 - Pot wallopper.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.720
 Can we guess?

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.560
 - No.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.120
 - Pot walloping is like, you would hit a pot,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.200
 make a lot of noise, and sometimes it would be like,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.680
 if someone wanted to be punished,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.080
 but you didn't want to sell them to the prison,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.800
 you might make this noise to kind of, like--

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.000
 - Was that called rough music?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.080
 - Sort of social punishment.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.520
 - Make the noise to what?

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.080
 - Kind of embarrass them.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.760
 - Yeah, turn it upside someone's house

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.040
 if they've not paid their tax or if they've mistreated

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.880
 a dog or whatever, I don't know.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.720
 - And if it's due to that?

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.560
 - Nope.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.800
 (laughing)

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.600
 - So in the 18th century, right,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.360
 they didn't have the secret ballot yet.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.640
 There were no curtains in the polling booths.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.080
 You had to call out your vote.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.720
 - It was seen as anti-English, wasn't it?

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.600
 - Yeah, and it was written down

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.680
 and lists were actually published

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.280
 of how everyone had voted, so it was a big,

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.600
 it was a sort of public thing.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.880
 - It's like you weren't supposed

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.520
 to be embarrassed by your vote, right?

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.360
 - No, exactly, whereas as we know,

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.720
 often you should.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.040
 (laughing)

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.160
 I don't mean that.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.640
 So there was a place in,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.200
 so for example, there were these pot wallopper boroughs,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.880
 right, where the only people who could vote

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.840
 were people who could boil or wallop a pot

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.160
 on a hearth in their house.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.880
 - So they owned the house.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.800
 - You owned a house which features a hearth

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.240
 which you could boil a pot on.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.080
 'Cause some houses were completely tumbled down

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.160
 and they were rubbish.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.320
 People lived in a hay barn or something.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.960
 That's not, you can't wallop a pot on the hearth in there.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.800
 - Right.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.480
 - You would have had to have had some convoluted logic

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.320
 to guess that.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.440
 (laughing)

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.920
 - Pretty obvious, frankly.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.000
 So you have to qualify for these quite,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.960
 the franchise was limited,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.120
 not just to people who owned property,

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.800
 but you had to be a housekeeper.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.240
 You had to be not in receipt of arms.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.840
 You had to live in which is like local charity.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.360
 So alms, sorry, alms.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.000
 - Alms, alms.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.120
 - Also, obviously you had to be an adult man.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.720
 And you could be challenged when you went to vote, right?

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.560
 So when you went to vote.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.560
 - Wallop this pan.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.400
 (laughing)

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.560
 - People can put up their hand and say,

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.400
 "I haven't seen him walloping a pot for years or whatever."

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.760
 Or you know, "I saw him taking some alms."

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.360
 And so, and this is the amazing thing.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.360
 When people went door to door canvassing for votes,

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.800
 they were not only trying to persuade you

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.360
 to vote in their direction,

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.840
 they were also gathering data like,

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.160
 "Doesn't look like he's got a pot or whatever."

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.840
 So they would then use that data against you

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.240
 on voting day.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.920
 - But if you were campaigning

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.000
 and you were wanting more people to vote for you,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.440
 would there be kind of slightly unscrupulous politicians

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.000
 who would give people hearths?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.320
 - Yeah, hot pots.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.160
 - Hot pots.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.680
 - Yeah, teach you how to wallop.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.400
 - Yeah, teach your man to wallop.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.080
 And you'll vote for you in parliament.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.960
 - "Age of Sale" stuff is so cool.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.120
 Like, I just, I really, really like all of it.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.000
 So here's a nice one about the color scheme

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.840
 of "Age of Sale" ships.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.960
 This is great, right?

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.800
 - Okay.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.040
 - So the Navy tried repeatedly to get captains

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.560
 to paint their ships the Navy colors.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.760
 And captains had quite a little latitude

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.800
 and they kept on just ignoring it

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.840
 and painting them whatever they wanted.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.680
 - What?

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.560
 Are the Navy colors Navy?

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.400
 - Navy blue?

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.960
 - No, sorry.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.960
 There was a Royal Navy color scheme

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.720
 which was adopted more after Nelson adopted it

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.520
 'cause obviously it was very popular.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.000
 And it's called the Nelson Checker.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.160
 And it's bands of, the ship looks like a wasp basically.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.520
 It's bands of yellow and black.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.320
 - What, like no such thing as a fish?

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.440
 - It's exactly like that.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.280
 - Okay.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.480
 - This whole podcast is a nod to that.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.000
 I thought we all knew that, right, okay.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.040
 So basically, like horizontal stripes

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.440
 of black and yellow, right?

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.400
 But the ships have gun decks, don't they?

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.720
 So the gun holes, the gun ports are black

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.840
 and they are all along the yellow band, right?

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.680
 - Nice.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.880
 - So if you're sailing along

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.000
 and you are ready for battle

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.280
 or you're about to attack someone,

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.720
 the ship, it looks like a chessboard

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.040
 because you've got a black band

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.480
 and then yellow but studded with black.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.320
 - Okay.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.320
 - Whereas if the gun ports are closed

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.280
 and you're not ready for action,

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.160
 you've got uniform bands of black and yellow.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.480
 So that's really handy.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.680
 If you're sailing into a harbor

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.280
 and you want to show that you're friendly

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.200
 or you're not a threat.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.040
 - I see.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.680
 - The color scheme is useful to signal your intention.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.200
 - Can I ask, also, would different countries

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.080
 have different colors like football kits

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.440
 so you would know who was on your team?

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.280
 - Yes.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.120
 - Would they?

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.040
 - Yeah, definitely.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.720
 And I think, I don't know what,

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.560
 I don't know whether you had,

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.320
 you know, you kind of had home and away.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.160
 (laughing)

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.000
 Always away.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.840
 - It's away for everyone.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.880
 (laughing)

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.720
 - Wait, so you were saying that they have,

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.400
 then Royal Navy had the color scheme

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.800
 but the captains ignored them.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.640
 - Yeah.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.480
 - So what did they do instead?

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.320
 - Throughout the 18th century,

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.280
 they just disguised themselves as the French

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.880
 to make it a bit harder and add a little bit of free song.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.080
 - Yeah, that was bad form, wasn't it?

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.920
 That's pirate stuff.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.760
 I don't know.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.600
 - I think it was.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.880
 And friendly fire was a problem with ships in this period.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.120
 Well, yeah, 'cause you'd fire a cannon

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.400
 and you would quite often have it land

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.240
 on the ship in front of you,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.240
 which was one of your allies,

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.760
 rather than the ship a bit further away,

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.480
 which was one of your enemies.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.320
 And this is where this revolutionary technique came about,

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.160
 which I didn't know about.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.000
 - So can I just ask,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.800
 previously would you have your entire fleet like a conga

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.760
 where you would have one and everyone would be behind you?

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.720
 - Well, that's so interesting you say that.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.080
 That was what you did.

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.520
 This was the huge turning point that came in the age of sail,

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.920
 which is kind of what made,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.200
 partly made Britannia rule the waves,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.560
 which is that ships used to all go in a line,

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.080
 like all facing each other.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.880
 And you'd be sort of behind your mate

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.760
 and you'd be all in a cluster

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.600
 and the friendly fire would be a problem.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.440
 So then it's a week.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.280
 - No, no, no, no.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.200
 You would be strung out in a big long line,

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.600
 all sideways facing on towards each other.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.040
 I mean, friendly fire was a massive problem

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.200
 when ships got close to each other

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.360
 'cause you couldn't see anything.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.920
 - Yes, I think it was just, it could end up more messy.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.560
 Whereas what then they decided to do

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.840
 is the line ahead formation,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.040
 which is literally like you're in a queue

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.960
 and the ships go past the enemy one by one

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.680
 and fire cannons at them.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.240
 So if you're in...

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.280
 - Like when you have a football match

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.880
 and each of the teams walks past each other and shakes hands.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.720
 - Exactly like that.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.840
 You know, I was thinking it was like the queen shaking hands,

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.960
 but yes, like footballers or the queen, same kind of deal.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.600
 - But it only works if one of the sides does it.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.920
 This is the thing.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.200
 - Yeah, once everyone gets cracked.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.040
 - This side stops and then like divides

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.720
 into two attacking formations

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.000
 and goes through the enemy line.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.520
 - For the listener, Andy is drawing up a...

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.360
 - Sorry.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.840
 - Very detailed diagrams.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.080
 - I've got an over-enthusiastic.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.560
 - Oh, no, no, we don't need the salt.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.640
 Oh, no, he's pushing them around with a long stick.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.680
 Oh my God.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.560
 No, the black boat, no, put the black boat away, Andy.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.400
 - I'm sorry.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.520
 I just love this stuff so much.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.960
 - Stop twirling your moustache.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.640
 (all laughing)

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.480
 - That's great.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.400
 - Can I give you some names of British ships?

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.120
 - Yeah, stand me to move on.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:57.120
 - HMS Abercrombie, HMS Affleck, HMS Amazon, HMS Broke,

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.320
 HMS Desperate, HMS Flirt, HMS Kale, HMS Keith,

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.320
 HMS Kwan, HMS Spanker, HMS Terrible, and HMS Trump.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.840
 - Lot's of one pick there.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.960
 - Brilliant.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.800
 - So of those, one of them I deliberately mispronounced

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.360
 for comic effect.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.560
 Can you guess which one it is?

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.320
 Abercrombie, Affleck, HMS Broke, HMS Desperate, HMS Flirt,

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.400
 HMS Kale, HMS Keith, HMS Kwan, HMS Spanker, HMS Terrible,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.800
 and HMS Trump.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.600
 - It's not Spanker.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.440
 I've got a shi-

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.760
 I've got a nautical hat with Spanker

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.360
 on written on the hat, which was a prop from that series.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.120
 - I've got a photo of you in said hat,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.600
 which I think actually comes up whenever you ring me,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.040
 a picture of you with Spanker written on your head.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.360
 - That's brilliant.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.880
 - I've got Spanker, Flirt,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.600
 and then there was another ship called Titan Uranus.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.160
 'Cause that was a real ship,

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.440
 but it was commercial, not naval.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.280
 - That's right.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.920
 - It was not Royal Navy, so there was no...

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.000
 - Keith?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.560
 - No, it's HMS Broke.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.400
 - Baroque?

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.160
 - It's actually Baroque,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.880
 because it was named after a guy called Sir Philip Baroque,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.200
 but it's spelled Baroque.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.800
 - Oh, okay.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.560
 - Yeah, anyway, that's something we'll cut.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.400
 - Must have been funny when the ship came in for repairs.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.000
 - If it ain't Baroque, it affects it anyway, hey.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.520
 I've got favorite mugs.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.360
 - Do you?

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.320
 - Yeah, oh God, yeah.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.160
 - Oh yeah.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.000
 - There are certain mugs,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.840
 which if I see them in the cupboard,

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.000
 I think, oh yeah, I'll have that one.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.840
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.800
 - And then the bad ones I'll give to my wife.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.000
 (all laughing)

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.760
 - What constitutes a bad mug in your eyes?

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.200
 - I just have certain ones where I like the way the handle

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.880
 sits on the fingers, that kind of thing.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.200
 - Do you like a thin rim or a thick rim?

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.600
 - Oh, come on, let's not go into Andy's personal life.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.120
 ♪ Sun in the day ♪

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.160
 - I mean, after 10 years, I'm not,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.600
 I'm actually not gonna answer that question.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.440
 No, I don't mind.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.280
 - Do you know what I mean?

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.680
 Like you get those tall cups or even like a bone china cup

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.000
 which's got a very thin rim,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.960
 or you get your standard mug which's got a thicker rim.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.560
 I actually prefer a thicker rim.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.520
 - I don't mind a fine bone, but I will have a,

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.160
 oh, no, I prefer a slightly thicker mug, you know?

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.400
 - Yeah.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.920
 - You were saying, James, that this guy couldn't be removed

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.440
 from parliament for being of not sound mind,

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.560
 and they did introduce a law called the lunacy brackets

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.560
 vacating of seats acts in 1886 to allow MPs to be removed,

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.080
 and you got inspected,

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.880
 and then six months later, you got inspected again,

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.080
 and if you'd managed to stay of unsound mind

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.040
 for six months, then you got removed.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.080
 So that could happen, but I didn't realize that.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.480
 Who can you name who's resigned from parliament?

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.200
 - Boris Johnson.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.040
 - Incorrect.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:30.880
 - Anna, is this the thing about

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.320
 you can't resign from parliament?

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.160
 - Yeah.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.000
 - Oh, I see.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.820
 Is that the trick?

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.660
 - Is that you?

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.500
 - This is the trick.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.340
 - Are you tricking us all?

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.160
 - 'Cause I didn't--

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.840
 - So Nadine has just left the Chilton Hundreds, was it, or?

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.240
 - The Chilton Hundreds, yes.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.680
 - This has international lists of the Klaxon all over it.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.680
 - I think exactly.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.360
 I think the international listeners,

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.200
 I just think it's the kind of thing

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.400
 that Americans love about England, or hate.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.440
 - Settle in, international listeners.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.960
 The international listeners switched off a long time ago,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.640
 actually, I don't know where or when.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.480
 - Go on.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.480
 - I think this might be the kind of

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.960
 tragically British thing that international listeners love,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.400
 so listen up.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.600
 You cannot resign from parliament.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.080
 No one's ever done it, because in 1624,

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.560
 it was made illegal for an MP to quit.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.160
 But you also are not allowed to be an MP

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.120
 while you're also holding an office

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.840
 for profit under the crown.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.520
 So there's basically a fake job,

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.800
 which is being crown steward and bailiff

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.680
 of the Chilton Hundreds, and you have to take that job.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.120
 It must be one of the most taken, like,

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.520
 the single posts that's had the most occupants in history.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.360
 - There's another one, isn't there?

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.320
 - If you have to have two MPs resigning

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.160
 close to each other.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.000
 - There's a backup.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.840
 - So there's the Chilton Hundreds, and then there's--

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.800
 - Chilton Two-Hundreds?

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.240
 (laughing)

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.200
 - I can't remember what the other one's called.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.040
 - I can't remember what the other one is.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.080
 - It's bailiff of the Manor of North Stead,

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.360
 or something like that.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.560
 - Wait, so this job doesn't actually exist.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.600
 - No, but you have to accept it.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.440
 - Right.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.400
 - But Tony Blair has been it

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.960
 after he stepped down as an MP.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.840
 - Right, the Dean Doris has been it.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.080
 - And you are it until the next person resigns,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.920
 and then they're in.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.760
 - And then they become the best.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.600
 - Yeah.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.440
 - It's very, I like that.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.600
 - It's great.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.840
 It's strong stuff.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.840
 - Do they still get paid when you're,

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.400
 is this job, well, it's a job.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.640
 You must get something.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.620
 Peppercorn maybe.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.460
 - It's interesting.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.120
 I wonder if they do send you a fiver or something.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.720
 Okay, that is all of our facts.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.480
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.880
 We will be back again next week.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.320
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.600
 If you wanna get in, we'll back, yep.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600
 Hello.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.440
 - Hello.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.520
 (laughing)

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.560
 It is harder than it looks.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.320
 (laughing)

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.160
 - Hello.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.360
 - Well, that was a great rehearsal, guys.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.720
 (laughing)

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.960
 - Are you ready to kick off?

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.840
 Can we start with all this?

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.560
 (laughing)

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.400
 - Okay, that's it.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.600
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.880
 All some hosting from Anna at the end there.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.680
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.960
 about the things that were said

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.640
 during the course of this compilation,

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.760
 you could email us on podcast@ky.com.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.480
 And Andy could bring some of those comments

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.600
 to the Drop Us a Line,

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.120
 which we should have in a couple of weeks

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.160
 back here as part of Club Fish.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.920
 Or you can find us on our various social media accounts.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.600
 And do remember, by the way,

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.800
 to go and see Olga Cock live if you can.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.920
 She's on tour at the moment throughout the UK

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.600
 with her show Prawn Cocktail.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.040
 And then she's going to Australia

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.200
 and she's gonna be doing some of the major cities there.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.080
 So go to Rock'n'Rolga, which is her website.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.520
 It's got all the details of the upcoming gigs.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.960
 And yeah, go and see it.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.240
 She's brilliant live.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.200
 Anyway, that's it for us.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.320
 We're gonna be back again with more Club Fish stuff

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.160
 in a couple of weeks.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.080
 So we'll see you then.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:20.920
 Goodbye.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.500
 (upbeat music)
