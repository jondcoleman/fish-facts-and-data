00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dennis Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Alex Bell and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Chazinski.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 My fact this week is that the first performance enhancing drug to be used in baseball was pulverized guinea pig testicles.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Yeah.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Pulverized is such a scary word.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 It's such a good word.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 It's such a good word.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Would you prefer them whole, though?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 No, just the word. Pulverized them.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 I know. I know. They should have just gone with crushed as too many syllables.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Yeah.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 So yeah, the baseball player in question was James Galvin, who was known as James Put Galvin, because I think he squashed everyone like puddings maybe.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Not that he used to put testicles in his body.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 And not it wasn't that no, because the pudding testicles in his body actually came after the nickname.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 So he was recruited by this incredible doctor called Charles Edward Browns-Sacard, who had come up with this idea and said that he tried it on himself and it had worked.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 That ground up guinea pigs testicles or dog testicles mixed with blood and injected into a person could reverse the aging process and make someone fitter and healthier.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 And so this baseball player had these testicles injected into himself, and no one pulled it absolutely smashed the next game.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Really? Yeah.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Did they pick the guinea pig because just of that scientific thing of a guinea pig as in it's just like that's the thing that you use.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Yeah, but that's why they used it is because it's a thing that you use.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 You're kidding. They actually use guinea pigs when they say it's a guinea pig.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 They used to. I think today it's less than 1% of the experiments done on guinea pigs, but it's just, you know, because some are done on guinea pigs.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Today it's very rare. It's mostly rats and mice. Right. But at the start of the 20th century, mostly it was guinea pigs.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 And a lot of Nobel prizes were won by guinea pigs. Oh, yes.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 And they were unilaterally claimed by humans. Yes, exactly. They never got the medals.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 There was no tiny podium and very little. No, that's not a big deal.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 But this guy, what about this guy? This doctor is so great.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 So he was at one of the world's true eccentrics. He was a doctor in the 19th century.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 He was a very well respected doctor, which is why this treatment was actually taken quite seriously by some people.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 And it was sold a lot around the country because he is the father of endocrinology.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 I think people often say what the endocrinology is a study of hormones.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Okay. But he also did some pretty wacky things.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 So as well as doing this, he there was a cholera outbreak in 1853.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 And he had a new potential cholera treatment he wanted to try. And so he swallowed the vomit of one of his cholera patients in order to contract the disease so that he could test out the potential cure on himself.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Oh, my God. One of those guys, yeah. One of those guys.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 It's a good, like, it'll give you a good work, I think. If you give yourself the disease that you then, like, you've got a time limit.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Oh, yeah. It's literally a deadline. It's literally a deadline, you're right.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 I like the way that this guy is one of the eccentrics of that era.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Because these days to be an eccentric, you just have to, like, grow a beard or wear a hat.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Like no socks.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Yeah. And those days you used to kind of inject testicles into yourself and swallow other people's vomit.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 I think because you trust your doctor who was willing to experiment with their cures on themselves first.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Would you?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 If he works into your GP and he's just finishing off a pint of vomit.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Are you going to go great? I feel really reassured now.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Yes. I'd recommend him to my friends.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Another thing he did. He was into testicles. He ate monkey testicles.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Browns are called to enhance his sexual prowess, which he said worked very well.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 And actually the, so the ground up guinea pig testicles that he injected into himself.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 He said they had a number of different effects. So he could lift much heavier weights.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 He could run up and down stairs and he was 72 by this age.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 So he was barely mobile until he started injecting himself.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 But also he said the average length of his urine jet had increased by 25%.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 And it gave him a greater improvement with regard to the expulsion of fecal matters.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Then in any other function.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 So they again gave him. He could shit a long way.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 He could shit a long way. Not not the speed of shit coming out of him.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 It was distance. That's what I wanted.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 He said improvement. So it's really kind of left to us.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Okay.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 There's a bit of ambiguity there.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 I'm picturing the poster of deep impact.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Oh yeah. What a guy though.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Yeah.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Yeah. He sounds incredible.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 So is there any evidence that any of the testicles he was injecting into himself worked?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Well they had a placebo effect certainly. I mean genuinely this baseball players game was enormously improved.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 Yeah.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 So I read a review of the game afterwards and I didn't understand any of it.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 But I got the strong impression that it was unbelievably good.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 His back was full of vitality. That was the only sentence I understood today.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 At least they should take Viagra for that don't they?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Yeah.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 What it was is that he thought the reason that he put testicles in himself is because he thought that it was like a lack of vitality that he had.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 And because they'd felt they'd kind of noticed that eunuchs and people who regularly masturbated were quite frail when they were older.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 And so the idea was you got rid of a lot of some kind of substance in your body through that.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 And so the way to get it back is to find some guinea pigs and castrate them.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 But listen up 13 year old boys.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 If you don't want to be doing that you've got to stop masturbating because you'll be frail when you're older according to James.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 So the idea of testicles and sport is not as it goes way further back than this old baseball.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 What do you mean by that?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 I mean that in the original ancient Olympics that was kind of the they're equivalent of doping scandals that they used to chew raw testicles.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 They would chew it before any of their races.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 I think Pliny recommended it didn't he?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 Did he?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Yeah, classic.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Why you know it is wrong.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Pliny's the only one that if someone was like if Pliny told you to walk off a cliff would you do it?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 You'd be like well yes.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 He's also told me to eat testicles.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 He's got so much weird shit that he says.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 It's astonishing that no one called him out in his own lifetime and it took like two thousand years for someone to say I call bullshit or everything you've ever said.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 But no, so they used to they used to chew testicles in ancient Olympic times.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 I didn't know that.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Yeah.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Yeah.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Pulling on other people's testicles was an illegal move in wrestling as it is today I imagine.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 I think it was easier to do that because they weren't wearing it as much.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 I would imagine it would be definitely a move I went for if it wasn't against the rules.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 No, we're in a wrestling match.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 That's why I'm always losing matches.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 That's when my whole time searching.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Down there.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 I must be here somewhere.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 I read it in Pliny.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Yeah, sorry.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Well, I was just going to say that just sticking with the ancients and testicles quickly.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 I was reading about some other ancient testicles, Assyrian testicles.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 And apparently it was a criminal act to damage a man's testicles.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Still it still is, I think.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Well, no, but the punishment was more severe.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 I think if you kick someone in the balls these days, you'd get in trouble.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 But if you were if you were a woman and you crushed a man's testicles back in ancient Assyria,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 you would have either the your finger cut off.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 So assuming that the finger was what was doing the crushing of the man's testicles.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 And then this was another thing that would happen.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Both of your nipples would be torn off.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Oh, torn mixes.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Torn mixes.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Torn.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 You're just getting your hands around it and ripping it.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Exactly.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Did that sound terrible?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Do you know in Ireland, in ancient Ireland, whenever there was a king,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 then when he became king, they had to kind of kiss his nipples or something.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 And so to stop someone from ever being king, you would tear off their nipples.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 And they used to fact they would find bodies with no nipples.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 And they know that that's someone who's been banned from being the king.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Wow.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Do you think some people had their nipples torn off and then ran back to collect them later,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 just in case they were king, they could produce them.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 And then you foiled the person who tore your nipples up.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Yeah, there's nowhere in the rule thing it has to be attached to the body.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Yeah, precisely.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 You could make a necklace out of them away your nipples or ring a nipple ring.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 I'm just on advantages in sport and going back to baseball.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 I was reading today that they reckon that about 25% of major league baseball players in America are left-handed.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Because we've spoken about before how Nadal was both right-handed and left-handed,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 but decided to be left-handed because it gave you an advantage on the court,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 harder to return if you're right-handed to a left-handed person.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 The same thing kind of applies to baseball as well.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Because if you're batting, the left-handed batters have an advantage because they're one step closer to the first base.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 And it's how weird is that. It's just one step, but they're one step closer.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 A lot of the argument about left-handers having an advantage is that you come across them less regularly.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 So if you're a right-hander, you'll come across a left-hander one in ten times or whatever.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And so you don't really know how to be against them because you don't really come across them that often.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 If you're a left-hander going against a right-hander, you come across them all the time.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 So you have an advantage because you're regularly in this position,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 whether you're the guy who's really not in that position.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 That's so interesting.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 In fact, in 1987, I found another way that you can cheat in baseball.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 It doesn't really work, but there was a Pennsylvania minor league baseball player called Dave Bresnerhand.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 And he tagged a run out by switching the ball with a peeled potato that he had...

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 He did in his catch-us mitt that he brought onto the field.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 And he got fired the next day because everyone immediately realised that he was a potato.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 But he did win the point and then he got taken away again.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 And then he got fired. And now he's a stockbroker.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 So actually, overall, I think he won.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Yeah, but all this money that they think he's made is actually just bags of potatoes.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 That's amazing.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 So the idea of that for people who don't know baseball is someone's running towards the base and to get them out,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 you can either touch the base before they do or you can touch them before they reach the base.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And so someone must have thrown the ball.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 He's not caught the ball and just pretended that this potato is the ball.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 It makes no sense, though, because this is 1987.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Like we had cameras in there.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 And the other thing is also baseballs are readily available.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 So why don't you just have a baseball player?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 So much more sense.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Anything else?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Before we move on.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 A couple of things on testicles.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Yeah.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Ginny Pigger's jacket is apparently even harder to get out of your head than doing gum.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 How did you learn this?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 He was pulverising a testicle.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 I was on a Ginny Pig forum.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 But the first person in the forum didn't give any extra information as to why they had Ginny Pigger jacket in their hair.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Anyway, you said it was a scientific paper.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 This is just a bunch of mates going, "I've got..."

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 I said apparently.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 I tell you, I do have a scientific study.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 If you feed yogurt to a mouse, you can make their testicles up to 15% bigger.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And they also get more luxuriant silky hair and they develop a swagger.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 According to the scientists.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 You would develop a swagger if you had more luxuriant hair and big testicles.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 As you're bigger testicles, I feel like physically you just need to walk differently.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Yeah.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Put it off your balance.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Yeah.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Squirrels have 20% the length of their body size testicles.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 A massive testicles.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 I know that that is true of some animals.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 But whenever I've been to St. James's Park and I've seen squirrels,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 I think I'd have noticed if one fifth of the body was testicles.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Yeah, it's true.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 I've never seen these fables.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 It's cold here, so they probably rejected.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 I've found a few baseball injuries from history.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 This is from a website called Netorama.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 I'll just read a few of them out and see if you like them.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 There's a guy called Fat Freddy Fitzsimmons who smashed his fingers on his pitching arm

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 when he fell asleep on his rocking chair and rocked over his own hand.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Whoa.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Is that a baseball injury?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 Well, it was an injury to a baseball player.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Yeah.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 It's a different category.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 It's gone.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 This one's also in the same category as the one that I just said, I suppose.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 John Smoltz, he tried ironing his shirts while he was still wearing it

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 and burned his chest and missed a load of the season.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Babe Ruth, famous baseball player, he knocked himself unconscious once

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 by running headfirst into a coconut tree.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 Wow.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 That was a baseball one because he was chasing after a ball.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 And then the last one, Matt Anderson, who apparently is a baseball player,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 he shredded the muscle in his right arm while throwing a noctopus.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Right.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 I bet the octopus came off worse.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Yeah, he shredded eight arms.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 How about this?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 The first president of the World Anti-Doping Agency was called Dick Pound.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 That is brilliant.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 That is a gray fact.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 That's very good.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Okay, it is time for back number two and that is Alex.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 My fact this week is that there is a power station buried inside a Welsh mountain

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 that only turned on during TV advert breaks.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 It is called a dinner wig power station.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 It is in North Wales in Snowdonia National Park.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 It is a hydroelectric power station.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 It is called a fast response power station.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 In fact, it is the fastest in the world.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 It takes 12 seconds to produce enough power to power about 600,000 kettles

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 in 12 seconds.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 That is incredibly fast.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 You press a button and immediately you have got that power.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 It is mainly there because obviously demand for electrical power in the UK changes over time.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 But one of the most common reasons for a massive increase in demand

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 is when a really popular TV program goes to a commercial break.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Okay.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 So, for example, X-factor or...

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 X-factor strictly.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 What is the standard?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 The standard is massive.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Wait a minute.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 They don't have adversaries.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Let me see.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 When it ends must be the end of the show.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Coronation Street, I think famously has it, doesn't it?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Coronation Street.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 The biggest one was the World Cup penalty shootout.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 England versus West Germany in 1990.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 FIFA World Cup.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 It's going to be fine.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 That was the biggest...

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 That was the biggest one ever.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 That the kettles were turned on.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 The biggest passage in the UK.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Well, we had lost that penalty shootout.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 So it might have been other things like people putting their heads in the oven.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 [laughter]

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 For the end of East Enders, we have to borrow electricity from France.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Do we?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 Really?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 And I think France would be proud to know the noble program they were supporting

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 in lending that to us.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 I reckon if the British probably knew they were using French electricity,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 they would turn off their television.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 I reckon that at the end of East Enders people are like,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 "Oh my God, we're running out of electricity."

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 [laughter]

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 I found a power station that affected TV

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 more than any other power station I reckon.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 What's that?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And I'm talking UK.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 This is 1964 and it's Battersea Power Station.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Battersea Power Station affected TV in a massive way

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 because there was a fire there.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 And the fire caused power failures all throughout London.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 So it affected BBC Television Centre.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Now the big thing about it was they had to change the launch date of BBC 2

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 to the next day.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Because so it was meant to launch.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 And Battersea Power Station ruined it.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 So they had to launch a day later than they were planning to.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 Which is nuts.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 Battersea Power Station.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 So I was googling it today because I passed it every morning on the train.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 It's beautiful to see.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 And they're redoing it up at the moment.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 But I had no idea the guy who designed it.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 Is this a well-known fact in the UK?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 The guy who designed it?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 So his name was Sir Giles Gilbert Scott.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 So he designed Battersea Power Station.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 He also designed Waterloo Bridge.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 But he also designed the red telephone box.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Did he?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 Yeah.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 The UK red telephone box.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Anyone overseas, picture a red telephone box in your head.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 That's the one.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 He designed it.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 That kind of upsets me because I'd much prefer it if Battersea Power Station

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 looked like one giant red telephone box.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 You know what does it like a telephone box?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 His tombstone is shaped in the same way.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 He's got a big sort of monumental tombstone and he goes in.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 It looks a bit like a telephone.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 By design or by accident?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 I think he designed it.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 So it's supposed to look like that?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 Yes, yeah.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Wow.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 This is tombstone covering adverts for cool girls.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Just on the subject of the red telephone box.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Currently in Wales there is a mountain that has a red telephone box.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 And it's not in use and they're going to remove it.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 But there's been huge protests from local ramblers.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Huge protests.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 So in Brazil recently they have 3.5 million people on the streets.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 Yeah.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Similar.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 It's bigger.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 I'm just surprised they haven't covered it.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 All the reporters are trying to ring in.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Yeah.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 So they want to remove it because it's redundant.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 It's not working anymore.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 But everyone there is saying we want you to keep it.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Because the mountain that it happens to be on can be very windy and very rainy at times.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 And it serves as a shelter for people who are suddenly stuck in torrential rain and gale force winds.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Yeah.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 So they actually say it's a lifeline for a lot of people who may get stuck up there.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 So they're still, this is still a story that's going on.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 I'll keep you all updated.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Other news in Welsh mountain news.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 Yes, please.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 More protests up there.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 So there's 189 peaks for Wales.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 And one has just been taken off the list.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 It's called Mollewen Moire.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 That's the correct pronunciation.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 And it has, it was a mountain and they've now disqualified it.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 They've taken it off the list because it doesn't meet the height standards that you're meant to have to be classified as a mountain.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 But it misses it by a matter of millimeters.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Really?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Yeah, literally.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 So they're not just scoop ups and more snow and just, I know you figured they could do something like that.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 So this is what it says.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 It says, the hill.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Oh, controversial mountain like massive quotes.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Yeah, so the hill in Snowdonia, North Wales, needs at least a 15 meter height difference between the summit and its pass, which connects it to the next higher hill.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Recent tests have shown that it misses these criterias by millimeters measured in at 14.77 meters.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 It needs to be 15 and it's at 14.77 meters.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 But that's even easier because you just dig a hole at the bottom, right?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 You figure, yeah, but no one has apparently.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Maybe no one cared enough, really.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 I mean, I mean, because they're all too busy protesting about that other thing.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Well, there's only so much you can do.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 You know, you've got to pick your battles.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Well, there was that movie, the man who went up a hill and came down a mountain with this example.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 A great film.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 It was exactly like this, isn't it, where he kind of adds a bit at the top.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 And that's based on a true story.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 So chance for a sequel.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Oh, yeah, exactly.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 But it was in Wales as well, I think.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Yes, it was.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Yeah, Hugh Grant in his finest performance to date.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Yeah.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Actually, he's up to this.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Yeah.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 You never know he might be to this.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 This dance says when that sequel comes along.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 It could be amazing.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 Notting Hill was going to be Notting Mountain, but actually it did.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 It's the required height.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Yeah.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 That's, that is all from Welsh Mountain News.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 I'm down, Shiver.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 On a power conservation, I love this that I didn't know, which is about reusing energy.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 So one of the problems is that we generate a lot of electricity.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 And if there's not enough demand for it, it just gets wasted.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 And we don't really know how to conserve a lot of energy and then repurpose it later on.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 But we have worked out how to do this on the London Underground, on the tube.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 And this is, I read this on TFL's website and it was a press release from last year, I think.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 So I don't know if it's been put into action yet.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 But they are planning to take the energy that is emitted from tube underground train brakes

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 and use it to power London homes because it releases so much energy.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 And so they did this pilot experiment on the Victoria Line somewhere.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 And they realised that in one week of getting the energy from tube brakes

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 and converting it into, let's say, heat energy or electrical energy,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 we would have enough power to power a tube station for two days, a tube station like Hoban.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 So Hoban, for instance, could power itself for two days of the week,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 just off the energy release from its brakes.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 That's insane. Isn't that cool?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 It's kind of cool that, I mean, Earth is basically still steam power

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 because every single major way we have of producing power

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 is basically produce heat in order to heat up water to make steam.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 And the steam goes around pipes and drives the turbine.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 And so we're steam power.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 This fact was basically an excuse to talk about the New York steam power system.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 We were just thinking, "Oh, it's just cool. Please, can we talk about that?"

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 And you've only just got that.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 That's the end of this matter.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Time for fact number three.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 It's really cool. It's just that New York, the Manhattan is built on a whole network of steam pipes.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 So they have massive boilers, like power stations basically,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 but they're actually boilers that create huge amounts of steam.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 And all this steam gets pumped into the buildings.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 And then the buildings can use the steam in whatever way they like.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 So they can generate electricity from it using steam power generators.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 They can use it to heat, you know, power air conditioners or they use it as heating.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 They can plummet directly into their like dishwashers.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 And they've got steam dishwashers that wash dishes using steam.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 And then they condense in this really, really hot water.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 It's just really cool.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 And that's why New York has this image of being you always got steam coming up out of the great.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 So that's true because that's, and it's still like that.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 And it's the biggest system in the world.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 And it's just the coolest thing ever.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 I always just saw that was a, for the Ninja Turtles,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 so that they could not be seen in the evening when they came out.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 To take the role.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 But one of the problems is that it can explode because it's a pressurized system.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 So, you know, I think in 2011 or 2007 was one of the,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 one of the most recent times when a part of the road just exploded and that the steam came out.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Oh, wow.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Yeah.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Oh, it's crazy.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Wow.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Actually, speaking of America.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Yeah.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 They just don't do kettles.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 We're just quite weird.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 They mostly don't use electric kettles.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 And that is because they take twice as long to boil as ours.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Really?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Yeah, isn't it, isn't it so weird?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 And there's going to be Americans listening who are confused by the fact that this isn't just readily accepted.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 I'm trying to picture because I've been to America a few times recently.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 You can get kettles, but generally they don't use them.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 And that's because their voltage in their main systems is only 110 volts and ours is 220.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 So that means that kettles just boil less fast.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Wow.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Isn't that weird?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 Yeah.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 Thinking about it, my wife's Russian and her family.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 I don't think I've ever seen them use a kettle.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 There you go.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 They kind of just, yeah, boil while trying to hub.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 I'm pretty sure that's what, until recently, at least France used to do as well.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 They were very much more kettles than ours.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 Are we the only people in the world with kettles?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 I think what I was reading and finding was a bit of a British quirk.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 It sounds like we've had to build entire power stations to deal with this quirk.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that 85 million years before butterflies existed,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 there was another animal that looked and acted exactly the same as butterflies.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 What were they called?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 Well, they didn't have names.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Oh, yeah, I guess.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 Oh, so the difference is they couldn't talk.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 No, we call them calligrammated lace wings from the order Neuroptura.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 And if you look at them, they've just found some new fossils in China.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 And these are of things that you would be certain they are butterflies.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 They've got the same wing shape, they've got the same wing spots and eye spots.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 They've got the same scales, the same proboscis, like the long tube that they feed with.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 It looks like they feed in the same way.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 They flew in the same way.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 They were basically butterflies, but they were 85 million years before actual butterflies.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Wow.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 And we're definitely sure that they weren't just butterflies.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 They're from a different line.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 They're not related at all.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Well, they were insects, so they're related slightly.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 But also there's a massive period between them and actual butterflies.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Exactly.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 So we have an idea of when true butterflies came in, and this was a lot before that.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 This is interesting because if theoretically you had two completely identical animals that evolved separately,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 do we still have to classify them as separate species?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 No, that is really interesting.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 They found a load of muscles around Britain a few years ago.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 And they found some in the North Sea and some down their Bristol and some down on the South Coast.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 And they all look like muscles because I don't want to be muscle racist.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 All muscles kind of look the same.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 But then they did DNA tests on them and they were all completely different species.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Like they couldn't mate with one another we think.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Wow.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 But we would never know that they were different animals because they just look exactly the same.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 So we'd be trying to force them to have sex and they would be like...

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Well, we don't really do that.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 You've got to beach on this if you have.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 So, but that, I mean isn't it interesting?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 It's so weird because so it's convergence basically isn't it?

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Where evolutionarily two things develop independent of each other that are exactly the same.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 But when you look at a butterfly, I think that's got to die out soon because it's a tiny flimsy piece of tissue paper

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 that practically dies if I touch it.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 And yet it was like to evolve twice.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 Why are you touching butterflies?

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 It's just what I'm into on the weekends.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 You're trying to force them to have sex.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 That is interesting.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 I guess I suppose whatever niche they live in, it must be perfect for them.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Yeah.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Also, they don't die if you touch them.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 I just want to clarify that I do know that in case anyone writes in.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 Don't the wing scales fall off?

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Some of them do a bit, it doesn't kill them.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 Isn't it cool that they have scales though?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 Isn't that really worth?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 That's amazing.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 Just on the subject of butterfly death, I read an article which it starts.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 This line is included right at the top.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 Hundreds of butterflies were killed in a celebration that transformed quickly into a traumatic blood path.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Now this is the story, a furniture shop.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 This is in China decided that they would do an event.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 It says here, the event would be remembered as a happy occasion for their business.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 But they were wrong.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 They were seriously wrong.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 They opened up.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 The idea was that they had all these butterflies held in boxes, and they were going to release the butterflies onto the ground.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 And children were going to run towards the butterflies.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 And as they were running, the butterflies would fly away, creating a great effect.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 So it was for children just to chase the butterfly.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 What they didn't count on is the fact that the butterflies were in lethargic form.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 I don't know what that means, but it sounds like they're lazy.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 They were tired.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 Basically, they're there, laying on the floor, all lethargic, while a stampede of children come towards them.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Thinking they're going to fly away, and they just crushed the entire back.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 I've got another story.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 You know what debutant bulls are?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 And you're like wealthy families when the daughter of the family came of AIDS.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 It had a sort of coming out party.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Oh yeah.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 It would be a big kind of thing.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 This happened in 1906.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 There was a Philadelphia woman called Mary Astropoul.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 And she had 10,000 Brazilian butterflies imported into her house and hung in nets all over the ceiling of the ballroom.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 But when the nets were dropped at the end of the party, it turned out that all the butterflies had died due to the heat.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 So the guests were just showered with thousands of dead people.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 I just found so funny.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Which would be kind of beautiful anyway.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 It's kind of funny.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Just what the thousands of people running away screaming at.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 Would you scream?

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 I mean, I know you'd be like.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 I know you can't when someone tries to high five either.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Would you just run away screaming?

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 Because with you dead butterflies.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 I mean, 10,000 in one room.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Yeah.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 I think that one of the really nice things about transforming from a caterpillar to a butterfly is that you stop pooing.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 I think that's quite cool.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 So caterpillars defecate all the time as you know, as a lot of creatures do.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 They eat a lot and they defecate a lot.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 But butterflies, they don't really eat.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 They sort of drink liquid through their proboscis that James mentioned earlier.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 But they just drink enough liquid to power themselves.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 Occasionally, if they've drunk too much, they release a very fine mist of water from their abdomen.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 But mainly, they don't really excrete at all.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 So you go from being a caterpillar to a butterfly and you mature into not pooing anymore.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 What they need is some guinea pig testicles and they'll be firing it out like Billy O.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 So they don't drink with their tongue as it passes over that drink through their tongue.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Their tongue is a straw.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 There's a hole in their tongue and they slurp the stuff up.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 That's cool.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Isn't that awesome?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 There are some species that do this thing called mug puddling, which is less like drinking.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 You drink any liquid, find any liquid you can to like blood or like muddy water and stuff like that.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 And you basically filter the water so it goes straight through you and it comes straight out of the other end as they're drinking.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 And they filter all the nutrients.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 But there are, there is one species of moth.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 There's not a butterfly, it's a moth.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 But they sneak up to sleeping birds and stick their proboscis through their closed eyelids and drink their tears.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 Yeah, so cool as that.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 But why are the birds so sad?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 There could be tears of happiness.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Tears of joy that they've got a beautiful butterfly.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And they do it to crocodiles and turtles as well.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 And humans, they can drink.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 There is this thing called vampire moth because you know, it's got a reputation of drinking blood from a human.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 I like the fact that they have, when they, when they crowd around puddles to drink, which they do, they're called puddle clubs.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 And if you're a butterfly, watch a butterfly fan, then you go to puddle clubs or you set up a puddle club in your garden and they'll flock around it.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 Wow, that sounds like a series of books or teenage girls.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 A puddle club, yeah.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 It sounds like a load of books for incontinent old men.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 I don't know, but yeah.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Speaking of butterfly collecting, which I don't know, but it feels like people don't really do that much anymore.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 It's television games.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 In the early 1700s, butterfly collector Lady Eleanor Glamville was declared insane due to her butterfly collecting.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 An entomologist testified that none but those deprived of their senses would go in pursuit of butterflies.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 Oh, wow.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 What?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 It's not because they were like, yeah, we went to her house for dinner and she dropped 10,000 dead butterflies.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 It kind of feels like they were looking for an excuse to declare her insane, but that's what they did.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Wow.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Wow.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 Someone else actually who was declared insane on a butterfly related charge.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 I don't know, who would have thought it was very common in the Victorian era.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 This was someone who Darwin met on the Beagle voyage and he noted down his conversation he had with him in his diary.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 And it was a guy called Renouse who was a naturalist and collector.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 And he related a story to Darwin that he had left some caterpillars in the charge of a little girl and instructed her on how to feed them so that they turn into butterflies.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 And so this girl had done this and she'd fed the caterpillars and they turn into butterflies.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 And by this point he'd left town and he came back to town and rumoured spread that he'd left these caterpillars in the charge of this girl promising that they turn into butterflies.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 And people thought that was absurd, that those butterflies could have come from caterpillars because they didn't realize that about metamorphosis and the butterflies could come from caterpillars.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 And so there was a town meeting and eventually the governors and the Padres of the town consulted and they agreed that it was heresy and he had to be arrested.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 So he was arrested for telling a girl that a caterpillar would become a butterfly.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Wow. Isn't that weird? Because they're so unbelievably different as we've discussed before they've sort of melt before they become butterflies.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 But people just didn't think it was possible that they were related.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 It is absolutely bizarre, isn't it? When you think about that, it is bizarre.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 I think it's magic. I've said this since we've all known each other. It's the fact that in between the process they turn into a soup, there's just a soup and then they come back and then they retain memory of their previous existence.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 It is super. It is like organs floating in it because I thought for ages that it was just total liquid but actually it's like kind of if we were able to just melt all our actual flesh.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 They've got these things called imaginal disc which I think it's like lots of little flash drives and like ones for the eyes and ones for the wings and ones for the legs and they're all floating in this soup.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 And one of them's got all the neurons in it for the brain and stuff. It's great.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 Wow. They're like the baddie in Terminator 2. That's what they're like. They can just go into liquid form and just come back.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 Actually, have you read the scientific paper by Donald Williamson that was released in 2012? I know that sounds like a ridiculous question.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 To me, it sounds likely that I would have. I'm sure you have. It was unbelievably controversial but it was published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. So it was super prestigious and he believes that butterflies and caterpillars are different species.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Yes, I have read that. And there you go. And he's read it. Yeah, because it calls a massive stir. So he's a genuine scientist who said that actually two different species made it and produced this offspring at some point, you know, hundreds of thousands of years ago.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 And that's the only way that they could exist in a butterfly. It's a different species to a caterpillar. So the different organisms, it becomes a new organism. Wow.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 And then he got, um, he got roundly criticized by all of science. Really.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that the long-quan buddhist temple in China has a monk called Worthy Stupid Robot Monk.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 So, okay, it's not a human monk. It is actually, as it says in the title, a robot monk. They have developed at this buddhist temple.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 A monk, that specific job is for when tourists come and want to chat to people, they go talk to the robot monk and he'll answer your questions about what is the meaning of life and all those other things.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Um, he's programmed to give you answers and he's basically just their PR person when people come because they might be busy doing monk stuff. So I'd be quite disappointed if I turn up to a buddhist temple off like years of going on a spiritual journey.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 And I turn up on the monks to want to talk to me and I have to talk to their robot. Yeah. Well, they think it's a good way of spreading more idea of what Buddhism is because it's kind of like a monk version of Siri.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Did you read what the meaning of life is, according to the robot? No, no. Well, I looked up an article about him. I think it was in Gizmodo Magazine and it was about him being displayed at a robot fair.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 And he was asked two questions. He was first asked what's the meaning of life and his reply was, my master says the meaning of life is to help more people finally leave behind bitterness and gain happiness.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 And the next question it was asked was, who are your parents? And he said, that's ridiculous. How can robots have parents? Which I think that's quite a good answer. It's kind of a bit of tone.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Yeah, but someone has just said, leave behind your bitterness and gain happiness. He's really jumped on my throat for asking about his mum and dad.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 I know he's very good at long repressive monotonous chance, because we're a very important part of bigger Buddhist monks. Just to defend the robot for a second, that we've been roundly criticising.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 Well, isn't the Buddha who kind of sat in front of a wall for 10 years or something, just meditating? That would be quite easy for a robot. Yes. Turn it off.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 You can see why robots have started out with Buddhism, can't you? It feels like the easiest, most achievable one.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 So just to give a visual to anyone who hasn't yet gone to Google straight away, see what he looks like. He is a two-foot tall, little cartoon looking kind of monk. He's got the robes. He's got the yellow saffron kind of robes.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 And he has a kind of iPad that sits in the middle of his chest, which you can press and that helps you with the questions and the answers.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Is it Tally Tubby? He's. And so it exists this little monk, this CNR. He exists in this temple, which is 500 years old. It's kind of on the outskirts of Beijing. And you can go and visit. He's not always in use. He's sometimes in a cupboard.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 Meditating. No things to waste off.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Can I just say something about the temple that the robot monk came from? Yeah. Because it's really interesting. The Longquan temple is famously tech savvy and has been for years. So this is really just an accumulation of what they've been working towards for ages. And you would love it Alex, I thought with you and I was reading about it.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 Is it steam powered? It should be steam powered. I think it might even have moved beyond that.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 So first of all, a monk from their parent invented WeChat, which is that? What is WeChat? Is that why you study Rhinol and you're just talking to the person next to you?

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 First person ever to do it. Yeah. If one was too awkward before that. How do you know?

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 It's still we. Not at urinals, but in cubicles. But they do talk. They do talk. We don't talk. Of course you talk. My girlfriend, my sorry, my fiance, was telling me just the other day that at work, even her colleagues, they'll go in and they'll just continue chatting.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 I know that my friends at school did it. This is not anecdotal.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 But that's the same time. It's a definite definition of anecdotal. First scientist ever.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 See, just as you were saying that, as the words came out, you're like, no!

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 I would still suggest I've been in more women's toilets than you have in my life.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 I know, but you don't like talking. I do hate to talk. Can I ask, Ella?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 You know, this definitely is a thing. Like, I can tell, having not been in many women's toilets, that when my wife or a girl that I know goes to the toilet, she'll often bring a friend with her and they'll go to the toilet at the same time.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 So they just stand in stony silence.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 To be honest, I've never done that. So I've never known what they do. People are chatting in front of the mirror when they're putting makeup on the stuff.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 This actually wasn't really the point of my eat. My thing about the monks.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 So we chat. So this is a, yeah, among from the long-grand temple, invented we chat.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 It is said, and we chat is basically China's equivalent of WhatsApp, and I suspect that it has many more users. So it's got over a billion subscribers right now, which is a seventh of the world's population.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 That's basically everyone in China, isn't it? It's like 1.2 billion people in China.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Yeah, I guess so. So anyway, it's said that the guy who manufactured it, this guy called Zhang Xiaolong, he went to the temple in Beijing,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 because questions concerning his idea for we chat had long weighed in his heart. And he consulted with the monks there, and it turned out they're super tech savvy.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 And one of the monks sat down with him for seven days and talked over the digitization of this idea he had, and told him how to do it.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 And he left after seven days of reflection and chatting to a monk, and he invented we chat.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Wow. Isn't that cool? They're moving away from nature and towards technology.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 I do know, I mean, the Dalai Lama very famously loves technology always has was obsessed with clocks. So maybe it's our impression of tech and Buddhism being incompatible is just our view of that.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 Maybe it actually they've been dying for an iPad. Some people would say that being really into clocks is not being up to date with the most modern technology.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 And I've come to the clock. There's a robot called WD2. Was that like an early version of WD40?

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 WD40, the 40 means 40 of attempt. WD stands for water displacement, and he made 39 tries and it didn't work. And then WD40 was his 40 of try.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 So WD2 is the robot that it's just a robot with a face that looks at you, scans your face in 3D, and then rearranges its burn stroke to say it looks like you.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 And there's no use for it. There's no use. What about fucking people up? Yeah, basically like a really grieving mirror.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 That would be the weirdest thing ever. That's incredible. There's immense use for that.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 Okay, go on, Anna. All of crime and Harry Potter is based around but making yourself look like someone else, isn't it?

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 Oh yeah, I can see. Yeah, you know, they take that potion and oh yeah, that one scene.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 It's already seen up at four times in the process.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 Hotels are really good places of robots in Japan, especially. That's one of the first places in which service and issue robots coming in because they're so well suited to it.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 You've got all the rooms have got the same, you know, all the corridors are exactly the same. It's all really well organized.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 Do they have robots using like cleaning the rooms?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 Well, they've got robot conscientious. If you order room service, there are some hotels where you get a little knock on the door and it's basically like it's kind of like an R2-D2 robot and it looks exactly like you.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 All right, we're going to have to wrap up really soon. Anyone got anything before we do.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 So Buddhist monks have an obesity problem at the moment.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 It turns out more than half of Buddhist monks are obese and that's because when people give donations to monks, it's often like sweet foods.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 So they just sit and they eat all these sweet foods that people are offering to them. And their medical costs are really burning the Thai government and so they've been had to put on this government sponsored diet.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 And they've also manufactured for them these special girdles which tighten as you put on weight as a gentle reminder that you're getting too fat for your girdle.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 I read something similar about nurses in this country. I don't think they're pointing on a particular amount of weight but I think they eat too many chocolates because whenever they save someone or look after someone, their relatives always give them chocolates and they just eat shit loads of them.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 So a nurse will thank us for this next time. Give your nurse some raw carrots and some celery or a girdle.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 They're not horses. If I think into the rambles or toes. They'll horse potatoes.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
