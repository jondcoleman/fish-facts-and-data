00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dennis Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Alex Bell and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Chazinski.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 My fact this week is that the first performance enhancing drug to be used in baseball was pulverized guinea pig testicles.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 [LAUGHTER]

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Yeah.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Pulverized is such a scary word.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 It's such a good word.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 It's such a good word.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Would you prefer them whole, though?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 No, just the word. Pulverized them.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I know. I know. They should have just gone with crushed as too many syllables.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Yeah.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 So yeah, the baseball player in question was James Galvin, who was known as James Put Galvin, because I think he squashed everyone like puddings maybe.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Not that he used to put testicles in his body.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And not it wasn't that no, because the pudding testicles in his body actually came after the nickname.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 So he was recruited by this incredible doctor called Charles Edward Browns-Sacard, who had come up with this idea and said that he tried it on himself and it had worked.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 That ground up guinea pigs testicles or dog testicles mixed with blood and injected into a person could reverse the aging process and make someone fitter and healthier.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And so this baseball player had these testicles injected into himself, and no one pulled it absolutely smashed the next game.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Really? Yeah.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Did they pick the guinea pig because just of that scientific thing of a guinea pig as in it's just like that's the thing that you use.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Yeah, but that's why they used it is because it's a thing that you use.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 You're kidding. They actually use guinea pigs when they say it's a guinea pig.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 They used to. I think today it's less than 1% of the experiments done on guinea pigs, but it's just, you know, because some are done on guinea pigs.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Today it's very rare. It's mostly rats and mice. Right. But at the start of the 20th century, mostly it was guinea pigs.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And a lot of Nobel prizes were won by guinea pigs. Oh, yes.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And they were unilaterally claimed by humans. Yes, exactly. They never got the medals.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 There was no tiny podium and very little. No, that's not a big deal.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 But this guy, what about this guy? This doctor is so great.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 So he was at one of the world's true eccentrics. He was a doctor in the 19th century.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 He was a very well respected doctor, which is why this treatment was actually taken quite seriously by some people.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And it was sold a lot around the country because he is the father of endocrinology.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I think people often say what the endocrinology is a study of hormones.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Okay. But he also did some pretty wacky things.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 So as well as doing this, he there was a cholera outbreak in 1853.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And he had a new potential cholera treatment he wanted to try. And so he swallowed the vomit of one of his cholera patients in order to contract the disease so that he could test out the potential cure on himself.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Oh, my God. One of those guys, yeah. One of those guys.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 It's a good, like, it'll give you a good work, I think. If you give yourself the disease that you then, like, you've got a time limit.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Oh, yeah. It's literally a deadline. It's literally a deadline, you're right.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I like the way that this guy is one of the eccentrics of that era.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Because these days to be an eccentric, you just have to, like, grow a beard or wear a hat.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Like no socks.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Yeah. And those days you used to kind of inject testicles into yourself and swallow other people's vomit.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 I think because you trust your doctor who was willing to experiment with their cures on themselves first.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Would you?

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 If he works into your GP and he's just finishing off a pint of vomit.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Are you going to go great? I feel really reassured now.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Yes. I'd recommend him to my friends.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Another thing he did. He was into testicles. He ate monkey testicles.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Browns are called to enhance his sexual prowess, which he said worked very well.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And actually the, so the ground up guinea pig testicles that he injected into himself.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 He said they had a number of different effects. So he could lift much heavier weights.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 He could run up and down stairs and he was 72 by this age.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So he was barely mobile until he started injecting himself.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 But also he said the average length of his urine jet had increased by 25%.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And it gave him a greater improvement with regard to the expulsion of fecal matters.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Then in any other function.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 So they again gave him. He could shit a long way.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 He could shit a long way. Not not the speed of shit coming out of him.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 It was distance. That's what I wanted.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 He said improvement. So it's really kind of left to us.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Okay.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 There's a bit of ambiguity there.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I'm picturing the poster of deep impact.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Oh yeah. What a guy though.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Yeah.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Yeah. He sounds incredible.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 So is there any evidence that any of the testicles he was injecting into himself worked?

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Well they had a placebo effect certainly. I mean genuinely this baseball players game was enormously improved.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Yeah.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 So I read a review of the game afterwards and I didn't understand any of it.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But I got the strong impression that it was unbelievably good.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 His back was full of vitality. That was the only sentence I understood today.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 At least they should take Viagra for that don't they?

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Yeah.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 What it was is that he thought the reason that he put testicles in himself is because he thought that it was like a lack of vitality that he had.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And because they'd felt they'd kind of noticed that eunuchs and people who regularly masturbated were quite frail when they were older.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And so the idea was you got rid of a lot of some kind of substance in your body through that.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And so the way to get it back is to find some guinea pigs and castrate them.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 But listen up 13 year old boys.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 If you don't want to be doing that you've got to stop masturbating because you'll be frail when you're older according to James.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 So the idea of testicles and sport is not as it goes way further back than this old baseball.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 What do you mean by that?

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 I mean that in the original ancient Olympics that was kind of the they're equivalent of doping scandals that they used to chew raw testicles.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 They would chew it before any of their races.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 I think Pliny recommended it didn't he?

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Did he?

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Yeah, classic.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Why you know it is wrong.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Pliny's the only one that if someone was like if Pliny told you to walk off a cliff would you do it?

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 You'd be like well yes.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 He's also told me to eat testicles.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 He's got so much weird shit that he says.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 It's astonishing that no one called him out in his own lifetime and it took like two thousand years for someone to say I call bullshit or everything you've ever said.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 But no, so they used to they used to chew testicles in ancient Olympic times.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I didn't know that.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Yeah.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Yeah.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Pulling on other people's testicles was an illegal move in wrestling as it is today I imagine.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 I think it was easier to do that because they weren't wearing it as much.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I would imagine it would be definitely a move I went for if it wasn't against the rules.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 No, we're in a wrestling match.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 That's why I'm always losing matches.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 That's when my whole time searching.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Down there.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I must be here somewhere.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 I read it in Pliny.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Yeah, sorry.

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Well, I was just going to say that just sticking with the ancients and testicles quickly.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I was reading about some other ancient testicles, Assyrian testicles.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And apparently it was a criminal act to damage a man's testicles.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Still it still is, I think.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Well, no, but the punishment was more severe.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I think if you kick someone in the balls these days, you'd get in trouble.

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 But if you were if you were a woman and you crushed a man's testicles back in ancient Assyria,

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 you would have either the your finger cut off.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 So assuming that the finger was what was doing the crushing of the man's testicles.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And then this was another thing that would happen.

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Both of your nipples would be torn off.

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Oh, torn mixes.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Torn mixes.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Torn.

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 You're just getting your hands around it and ripping it.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Exactly.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Did that sound terrible?

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Do you know in Ireland, in ancient Ireland, whenever there was a king,

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 then when he became king, they had to kind of kiss his nipples or something.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And so to stop someone from ever being king, you would tear off their nipples.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And they used to fact they would find bodies with no nipples.

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And they know that that's someone who's been banned from being the king.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Wow.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Oh, yeah.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Do you think some people had their nipples torn off and then ran back to collect them later,

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 just in case they were king, they could produce them.

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And then you foiled the person who tore your nipples up.

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Yeah, there's nowhere in the rule thing it has to be attached to the body.

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Yeah, precisely.

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 You could make a necklace out of them away your nipples or ring a nipple ring.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I'm just on advantages in sport and going back to baseball.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I was reading today that they reckon that about 25% of major league baseball players in America are left-handed.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Because we've spoken about before how Nadal was both right-handed and left-handed,

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 but decided to be left-handed because it gave you an advantage on the court,

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 harder to return if you're right-handed to a left-handed person.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 The same thing kind of applies to baseball as well.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Because if you're batting, the left-handed batters have an advantage because they're one step closer to the first base.

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And it's how weird is that. It's just one step, but they're one step closer.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 A lot of the argument about left-handers having an advantage is that you come across them less regularly.

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 So if you're a right-hander, you'll come across a left-hander one in ten times or whatever.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And so you don't really know how to be against them because you don't really come across them that often.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 If you're a left-hander going against a right-hander, you come across them all the time.

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 So you have an advantage because you're regularly in this position,

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 whether you're the guy who's really not in that position.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 That's so interesting.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 In fact, in 1987, I found another way that you can cheat in baseball.

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 It doesn't really work, but there was a Pennsylvania minor league baseball player called Dave Bresnerhand.

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And he tagged a run out by switching the ball with a peeled potato that he had...

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 He did in his catch-us mitt that he brought onto the field.

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 And he got fired the next day because everyone immediately realised that he was a potato.

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 But he did win the point and then he got taken away again.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And then he got fired. And now he's a stockbroker.

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 So actually, overall, I think he won.

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Yeah, but all this money that they think he's made is actually just bags of potatoes.

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 That's amazing.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 So the idea of that for people who don't know baseball is someone's running towards the base and to get them out,

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 you can either touch the base before they do or you can touch them before they reach the base.

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 And so someone must have thrown the ball.

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 He's not caught the ball and just pretended that this potato is the ball.

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 It makes no sense, though, because this is 1987.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Like we had cameras in there.

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And the other thing is also baseballs are readily available.

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 So why don't you just have a baseball player?

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 So much more sense.

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Anything else?

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Before we move on.

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 A couple of things on testicles.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Yeah.

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Ginny Pigger's jacket is apparently even harder to get out of your head than doing gum.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 How did you learn this?

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 He was pulverising a testicle.

181
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 I was on a Ginny Pig forum.

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 But the first person in the forum didn't give any extra information as to why they had Ginny Pigger jacket in their hair.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Anyway, you said it was a scientific paper.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 This is just a bunch of mates going, "I've got..."

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 I said apparently.

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 I tell you, I do have a scientific study.

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 If you feed yogurt to a mouse, you can make their testicles up to 15% bigger.

188
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 And they also get more luxuriant silky hair and they develop a swagger.

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 According to the scientists.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 You would develop a swagger if you had more luxuriant hair and big testicles.

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 As you're bigger testicles, I feel like physically you just need to walk differently.

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Yeah.

193
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Put it off your balance.

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Yeah.

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Squirrels have 20% the length of their body size testicles.

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 A massive testicles.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 I know that that is true of some animals.

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 But whenever I've been to St. James's Park and I've seen squirrels,

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I think I'd have noticed if one fifth of the body was testicles.

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Yeah, it's true.

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 I've never seen these fables.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 It's cold here, so they probably rejected.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I've found a few baseball injuries from history.

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Oh, yeah.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 This is from a website called Netorama.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I'll just read a few of them out and see if you like them.

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 There's a guy called Fat Freddy Fitzsimmons who smashed his fingers on his pitching arm

208
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 when he fell asleep on his rocking chair and rocked over his own hand.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Whoa.

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Is that a baseball injury?

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Well, it was an injury to a baseball player.

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Yeah.

213
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 It's a different category.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 It's gone.

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 This one's also in the same category as the one that I just said, I suppose.

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 John Smoltz, he tried ironing his shirts while he was still wearing it

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 and burned his chest and missed a load of the season.

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Babe Ruth, famous baseball player, he knocked himself unconscious once

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 by running headfirst into a coconut tree.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Wow.

221
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 That was a baseball one because he was chasing after a ball.

222
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And then the last one, Matt Anderson, who apparently is a baseball player,

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 he shredded the muscle in his right arm while throwing a noctopus.

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Right.

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I bet the octopus came off worse.

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Yeah, he shredded eight arms.

227
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 How about this?

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 The first president of the World Anti-Doping Agency was called Dick Pound.

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 That is brilliant.

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 That is a gray fact.

231
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 That's very good.

232
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Okay, it is time for back number two and that is Alex.

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 My fact this week is that there is a power station buried inside a Welsh mountain

234
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 that only turned on during TV advert breaks.

235
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 It is called a dinner wig power station.

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 It is in North Wales in Snowdonia National Park.

237
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 It is a hydroelectric power station.

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 It is called a fast response power station.

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 In fact, it is the fastest in the world.

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 It takes 12 seconds to produce enough power to power about 600,000 kettles

241
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 in 12 seconds.

242
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 That is incredibly fast.

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 You press a button and immediately you have got that power.

244
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 It is mainly there because obviously demand for electrical power in the UK changes over time.

245
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 But one of the most common reasons for a massive increase in demand

246
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 is when a really popular TV program goes to a commercial break.

247
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Okay.

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 So, for example, X-factor or...

249
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 X-factor strictly.

250
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 What is the standard?

251
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 The standard is massive.

252
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Wait a minute.

253
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 They don't have adversaries.

254
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Let me see.

255
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 When it ends must be the end of the show.

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Coronation Street, I think famously has it, doesn't it?

257
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Coronation Street.

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 The biggest one was the World Cup penalty shootout.

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 England versus West Germany in 1990.

260
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 FIFA World Cup.

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It's going to be fine.

262
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 That was the biggest...

263
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 That was the biggest one ever.

264
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 That the kettles were turned on.

265
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 The biggest passage in the UK.

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Well, we had lost that penalty shootout.

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 So it might have been other things like people putting their heads in the oven.

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 [laughter]

269
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 For the end of East Enders, we have to borrow electricity from France.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Do we?

271
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Really?

272
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And I think France would be proud to know the noble program they were supporting

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 in lending that to us.

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 I reckon if the British probably knew they were using French electricity,

275
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 they would turn off their television.

276
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 I reckon that at the end of East Enders people are like,

277
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 "Oh my God, we're running out of electricity."

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 [laughter]

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I found a power station that affected TV

280
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 more than any other power station I reckon.

281
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 What's that?

282
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And I'm talking UK.

283
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 This is 1964 and it's Battersea Power Station.

284
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Battersea Power Station affected TV in a massive way

285
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 because there was a fire there.

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And the fire caused power failures all throughout London.

287
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 So it affected BBC Television Centre.

288
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Now the big thing about it was they had to change the launch date of BBC 2

289
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 to the next day.

290
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Because so it was meant to launch.

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 And Battersea Power Station ruined it.

292
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 So they had to launch a day later than they were planning to.

293
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Which is nuts.

294
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Battersea Power Station.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 So I was googling it today because I passed it every morning on the train.

296
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 It's beautiful to see.

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And they're redoing it up at the moment.

298
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 But I had no idea the guy who designed it.

299
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Is this a well-known fact in the UK?

300
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 The guy who designed it?

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So his name was Sir Giles Gilbert Scott.

302
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 So he designed Battersea Power Station.

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 He also designed Waterloo Bridge.

304
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 But he also designed the red telephone box.

305
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Did he?

306
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Yeah.

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 The UK red telephone box.

308
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Anyone overseas, picture a red telephone box in your head.

309
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 That's the one.

310
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 He designed it.

311
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 That kind of upsets me because I'd much prefer it if Battersea Power Station

312
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 looked like one giant red telephone box.

313
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 You know what does it like a telephone box?

314
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 His tombstone is shaped in the same way.

315
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 He's got a big sort of monumental tombstone and he goes in.

316
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 It looks a bit like a telephone.

317
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 By design or by accident?

318
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 I think he designed it.

319
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 So it's supposed to look like that?

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Yes, yeah.

321
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Wow.

322
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 This is tombstone covering adverts for cool girls.

323
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Just on the subject of the red telephone box.

324
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Currently in Wales there is a mountain that has a red telephone box.

325
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And it's not in use and they're going to remove it.

326
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 But there's been huge protests from local ramblers.

327
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Huge protests.

328
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 So in Brazil recently they have 3.5 million people on the streets.

329
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Yeah.

330
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Similar.

331
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 It's bigger.

332
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I'm just surprised they haven't covered it.

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 All the reporters are trying to ring in.

334
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Yeah.

335
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 So they want to remove it because it's redundant.

336
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 It's not working anymore.

337
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 But everyone there is saying we want you to keep it.

338
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Because the mountain that it happens to be on can be very windy and very rainy at times.

339
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 And it serves as a shelter for people who are suddenly stuck in torrential rain and gale force winds.

340
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Yeah.

341
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 So they actually say it's a lifeline for a lot of people who may get stuck up there.

342
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 So they're still, this is still a story that's going on.

343
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I'll keep you all updated.

344
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Other news in Welsh mountain news.

345
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Yes, please.

346
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 More protests up there.

347
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 So there's 189 peaks for Wales.

348
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And one has just been taken off the list.

349
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It's called Mollewen Moire.

350
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 That's the correct pronunciation.

351
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And it has, it was a mountain and they've now disqualified it.

352
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 They've taken it off the list because it doesn't meet the height standards that you're meant to have to be classified as a mountain.

353
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 But it misses it by a matter of millimeters.

354
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Really?

355
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Yeah, literally.

356
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 So they're not just scoop ups and more snow and just, I know you figured they could do something like that.

357
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 So this is what it says.

358
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It says, the hill.

359
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Oh, controversial mountain like massive quotes.

360
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Yeah, so the hill in Snowdonia, North Wales, needs at least a 15 meter height difference between the summit and its pass, which connects it to the next higher hill.

361
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Recent tests have shown that it misses these criterias by millimeters measured in at 14.77 meters.

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 It needs to be 15 and it's at 14.77 meters.

363
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 But that's even easier because you just dig a hole at the bottom, right?

364
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 You figure, yeah, but no one has apparently.

365
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Maybe no one cared enough, really.

366
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I mean, I mean, because they're all too busy protesting about that other thing.

367
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Well, there's only so much you can do.

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 You know, you've got to pick your battles.

369
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Well, there was that movie, the man who went up a hill and came down a mountain with this example.

370
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 A great film.

371
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 It was exactly like this, isn't it, where he kind of adds a bit at the top.

372
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And that's based on a true story.

373
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 So chance for a sequel.

374
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Oh, yeah, exactly.

375
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 But it was in Wales as well, I think.

376
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Yes, it was.

377
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Yeah, Hugh Grant in his finest performance to date.

378
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Yeah.

379
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Actually, he's up to this.

380
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Yeah.

381
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 You never know he might be to this.

382
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 This dance says when that sequel comes along.

383
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 It could be amazing.

384
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Notting Hill was going to be Notting Mountain, but actually it did.

385
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It's the required height.

386
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Yeah.

387
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 That's, that is all from Welsh Mountain News.

388
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 I'm down, Shiver.

389
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 On a power conservation, I love this that I didn't know, which is about reusing energy.

390
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 So one of the problems is that we generate a lot of electricity.

391
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And if there's not enough demand for it, it just gets wasted.

392
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And we don't really know how to conserve a lot of energy and then repurpose it later on.

393
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 But we have worked out how to do this on the London Underground, on the tube.

394
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And this is, I read this on TFL's website and it was a press release from last year, I think.

395
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 So I don't know if it's been put into action yet.

396
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 But they are planning to take the energy that is emitted from tube underground train brakes

397
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 and use it to power London homes because it releases so much energy.

398
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And so they did this pilot experiment on the Victoria Line somewhere.

399
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And they realised that in one week of getting the energy from tube brakes

400
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 and converting it into, let's say, heat energy or electrical energy,

401
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 we would have enough power to power a tube station for two days, a tube station like Hoban.

402
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So Hoban, for instance, could power itself for two days of the week,

403
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 just off the energy release from its brakes.

404
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 That's insane. Isn't that cool?

405
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 It's kind of cool that, I mean, Earth is basically still steam power

406
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 because every single major way we have of producing power

407
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 is basically produce heat in order to heat up water to make steam.

408
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And the steam goes around pipes and drives the turbine.

409
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And so we're steam power.

410
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 This fact was basically an excuse to talk about the New York steam power system.

411
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 We were just thinking, "Oh, it's just cool. Please, can we talk about that?"

412
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And you've only just got that.

413
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 That's the end of this matter.

414
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Time for fact number three.

415
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 It's really cool. It's just that New York, the Manhattan is built on a whole network of steam pipes.

416
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So they have massive boilers, like power stations basically,

417
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 but they're actually boilers that create huge amounts of steam.

418
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And all this steam gets pumped into the buildings.

419
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And then the buildings can use the steam in whatever way they like.

420
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 So they can generate electricity from it using steam power generators.

421
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 They can use it to heat, you know, power air conditioners or they use it as heating.

422
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 They can plummet directly into their like dishwashers.

423
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And they've got steam dishwashers that wash dishes using steam.

424
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And then they condense in this really, really hot water.

425
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 It's just really cool.

426
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And that's why New York has this image of being you always got steam coming up out of the great.

427
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 So that's true because that's, and it's still like that.

428
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 And it's the biggest system in the world.

429
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And it's just the coolest thing ever.

430
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I always just saw that was a, for the Ninja Turtles,

431
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 so that they could not be seen in the evening when they came out.

432
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 To take the role.

433
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 But one of the problems is that it can explode because it's a pressurized system.

434
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 So, you know, I think in 2011 or 2007 was one of the,

435
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 one of the most recent times when a part of the road just exploded and that the steam came out.

436
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Oh, wow.

437
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Yeah.

438
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Oh, it's crazy.

439
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Wow.

440
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Actually, speaking of America.

441
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Yeah.

442
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 They just don't do kettles.

443
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 We're just quite weird.

444
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 They mostly don't use electric kettles.

445
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And that is because they take twice as long to boil as ours.

446
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Really?

447
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Yeah, isn't it, isn't it so weird?

448
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And there's going to be Americans listening who are confused by the fact that this isn't just readily accepted.

449
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 I'm trying to picture because I've been to America a few times recently.

450
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 You can get kettles, but generally they don't use them.

451
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 And that's because their voltage in their main systems is only 110 volts and ours is 220.

452
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 So that means that kettles just boil less fast.

453
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Wow.

454
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Isn't that weird?

455
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Yeah.

456
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Thinking about it, my wife's Russian and her family.

457
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 I don't think I've ever seen them use a kettle.

458
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 There you go.

459
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 They kind of just, yeah, boil while trying to hub.

460
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 I'm pretty sure that's what, until recently, at least France used to do as well.

461
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 They were very much more kettles than ours.

462
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Are we the only people in the world with kettles?

463
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 I think what I was reading and finding was a bit of a British quirk.

464
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 It sounds like we've had to build entire power stations to deal with this quirk.

465
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

466
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that 85 million years before butterflies existed,

467
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 there was another animal that looked and acted exactly the same as butterflies.

468
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 What were they called?

469
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Well, they didn't have names.

470
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Oh, yeah, I guess.

471
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Oh, so the difference is they couldn't talk.

472
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 No, we call them calligrammated lace wings from the order Neuroptura.

473
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And if you look at them, they've just found some new fossils in China.

474
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And these are of things that you would be certain they are butterflies.

475
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 They've got the same wing shape, they've got the same wing spots and eye spots.

476
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 They've got the same scales, the same proboscis, like the long tube that they feed with.

477
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 It looks like they feed in the same way.

478
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 They flew in the same way.

479
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 They were basically butterflies, but they were 85 million years before actual butterflies.

480
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Wow.

481
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And we're definitely sure that they weren't just butterflies.

482
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 They're from a different line.

483
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 They're not related at all.

484
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Well, they were insects, so they're related slightly.

485
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 But also there's a massive period between them and actual butterflies.

486
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Exactly.

487
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 So we have an idea of when true butterflies came in, and this was a lot before that.

488
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 This is interesting because if theoretically you had two completely identical animals that evolved separately,

489
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 do we still have to classify them as separate species?

490
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 No, that is really interesting.

491
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 They found a load of muscles around Britain a few years ago.

492
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 And they found some in the North Sea and some down their Bristol and some down on the South Coast.

493
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And they all look like muscles because I don't want to be muscle racist.

494
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 All muscles kind of look the same.

495
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 But then they did DNA tests on them and they were all completely different species.

496
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Like they couldn't mate with one another we think.

497
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Wow.

498
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 But we would never know that they were different animals because they just look exactly the same.

499
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 So we'd be trying to force them to have sex and they would be like...

500
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Well, we don't really do that.

501
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 You've got to beach on this if you have.

502
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 So, but that, I mean isn't it interesting?

503
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 It's so weird because so it's convergence basically isn't it?

504
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Where evolutionarily two things develop independent of each other that are exactly the same.

505
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 But when you look at a butterfly, I think that's got to die out soon because it's a tiny flimsy piece of tissue paper

506
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 that practically dies if I touch it.

507
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And yet it was like to evolve twice.

508
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Why are you touching butterflies?

509
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 It's just what I'm into on the weekends.

510
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 You're trying to force them to have sex.

511
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 That is interesting.

512
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 I guess I suppose whatever niche they live in, it must be perfect for them.

513
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Yeah.

514
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Also, they don't die if you touch them.

515
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 I just want to clarify that I do know that in case anyone writes in.

516
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Don't the wing scales fall off?

517
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Some of them do a bit, it doesn't kill them.

518
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Isn't it cool that they have scales though?

519
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Isn't that really worth?

520
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 That's amazing.

521
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Just on the subject of butterfly death, I read an article which it starts.

522
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 This line is included right at the top.

523
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Hundreds of butterflies were killed in a celebration that transformed quickly into a traumatic blood path.

524
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Now this is the story, a furniture shop.

525
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 This is in China decided that they would do an event.

526
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 It says here, the event would be remembered as a happy occasion for their business.

527
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 But they were wrong.

528
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 They were seriously wrong.

529
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 They opened up.

530
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 The idea was that they had all these butterflies held in boxes, and they were going to release the butterflies onto the ground.

531
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And children were going to run towards the butterflies.

532
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 And as they were running, the butterflies would fly away, creating a great effect.

533
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 So it was for children just to chase the butterfly.

534
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 What they didn't count on is the fact that the butterflies were in lethargic form.

535
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 I don't know what that means, but it sounds like they're lazy.

536
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 They were tired.

537
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Basically, they're there, laying on the floor, all lethargic, while a stampede of children come towards them.

538
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Thinking they're going to fly away, and they just crushed the entire back.

539
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 I've got another story.

540
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 You know what debutant bulls are?

541
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And you're like wealthy families when the daughter of the family came of AIDS.

542
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 It had a sort of coming out party.

543
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Oh yeah.

544
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 It would be a big kind of thing.

545
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 This happened in 1906.

546
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 There was a Philadelphia woman called Mary Astropoul.

547
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 And she had 10,000 Brazilian butterflies imported into her house and hung in nets all over the ceiling of the ballroom.

548
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 But when the nets were dropped at the end of the party, it turned out that all the butterflies had died due to the heat.

549
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 So the guests were just showered with thousands of dead people.

550
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 I just found so funny.

551
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Which would be kind of beautiful anyway.

552
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 It's kind of funny.

553
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Just what the thousands of people running away screaming at.

554
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Would you scream?

555
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I mean, I know you'd be like.

556
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 I know you can't when someone tries to high five either.

557
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Would you just run away screaming?

558
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Because with you dead butterflies.

559
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 I mean, 10,000 in one room.

560
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Yeah.

561
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 I think that one of the really nice things about transforming from a caterpillar to a butterfly is that you stop pooing.

562
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 I think that's quite cool.

563
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 So caterpillars defecate all the time as you know, as a lot of creatures do.

564
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 They eat a lot and they defecate a lot.

565
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 But butterflies, they don't really eat.

566
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 They sort of drink liquid through their proboscis that James mentioned earlier.

567
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 But they just drink enough liquid to power themselves.

568
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Occasionally, if they've drunk too much, they release a very fine mist of water from their abdomen.

569
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 But mainly, they don't really excrete at all.

570
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 So you go from being a caterpillar to a butterfly and you mature into not pooing anymore.

571
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 What they need is some guinea pig testicles and they'll be firing it out like Billy O.

572
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 So they don't drink with their tongue as it passes over that drink through their tongue.

573
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Their tongue is a straw.

574
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 There's a hole in their tongue and they slurp the stuff up.

575
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 That's cool.

576
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Isn't that awesome?

577
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 There are some species that do this thing called mug puddling, which is less like drinking.

578
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 You drink any liquid, find any liquid you can to like blood or like muddy water and stuff like that.

579
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And you basically filter the water so it goes straight through you and it comes straight out of the other end as they're drinking.

580
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 And they filter all the nutrients.

581
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 But there are, there is one species of moth.

582
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 There's not a butterfly, it's a moth.

583
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 But they sneak up to sleeping birds and stick their proboscis through their closed eyelids and drink their tears.

584
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Yeah, so cool as that.

585
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Yeah, yeah.

586
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 But why are the birds so sad?

587
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 There could be tears of happiness.

588
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Tears of joy that they've got a beautiful butterfly.

589
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And they do it to crocodiles and turtles as well.

590
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And humans, they can drink.

591
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 There is this thing called vampire moth because you know, it's got a reputation of drinking blood from a human.

592
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 I like the fact that they have, when they, when they crowd around puddles to drink, which they do, they're called puddle clubs.

593
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And if you're a butterfly, watch a butterfly fan, then you go to puddle clubs or you set up a puddle club in your garden and they'll flock around it.

594
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Wow, that sounds like a series of books or teenage girls.

595
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 A puddle club, yeah.

596
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 It sounds like a load of books for incontinent old men.

597
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 I don't know, but yeah.

598
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Speaking of butterfly collecting, which I don't know, but it feels like people don't really do that much anymore.

599
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 It's television games.

600
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 In the early 1700s, butterfly collector Lady Eleanor Glamville was declared insane due to her butterfly collecting.

601
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 An entomologist testified that none but those deprived of their senses would go in pursuit of butterflies.

602
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Oh, wow.

603
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 What?

604
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 It's not because they were like, yeah, we went to her house for dinner and she dropped 10,000 dead butterflies.

605
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 It kind of feels like they were looking for an excuse to declare her insane, but that's what they did.

606
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Wow.

607
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Wow.

608
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Someone else actually who was declared insane on a butterfly related charge.

609
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 I don't know, who would have thought it was very common in the Victorian era.

610
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 This was someone who Darwin met on the Beagle voyage and he noted down his conversation he had with him in his diary.

611
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And it was a guy called Renouse who was a naturalist and collector.

612
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 And he related a story to Darwin that he had left some caterpillars in the charge of a little girl and instructed her on how to feed them so that they turn into butterflies.

613
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And so this girl had done this and she'd fed the caterpillars and they turn into butterflies.

614
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 And by this point he'd left town and he came back to town and rumoured spread that he'd left these caterpillars in the charge of this girl promising that they turn into butterflies.

615
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 And people thought that was absurd, that those butterflies could have come from caterpillars because they didn't realize that about metamorphosis and the butterflies could come from caterpillars.

616
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And so there was a town meeting and eventually the governors and the Padres of the town consulted and they agreed that it was heresy and he had to be arrested.

617
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 So he was arrested for telling a girl that a caterpillar would become a butterfly.

618
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Wow. Isn't that weird? Because they're so unbelievably different as we've discussed before they've sort of melt before they become butterflies.

619
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 But people just didn't think it was possible that they were related.

620
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 It is absolutely bizarre, isn't it? When you think about that, it is bizarre.

621
00:31:48,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 I think it's magic. I've said this since we've all known each other. It's the fact that in between the process they turn into a soup, there's just a soup and then they come back and then they retain memory of their previous existence.

622
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 It is super. It is like organs floating in it because I thought for ages that it was just total liquid but actually it's like kind of if we were able to just melt all our actual flesh.

623
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 They've got these things called imaginal disc which I think it's like lots of little flash drives and like ones for the eyes and ones for the wings and ones for the legs and they're all floating in this soup.

624
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 And one of them's got all the neurons in it for the brain and stuff. It's great.

625
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Wow. They're like the baddie in Terminator 2. That's what they're like. They can just go into liquid form and just come back.

626
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Actually, have you read the scientific paper by Donald Williamson that was released in 2012? I know that sounds like a ridiculous question.

627
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 To me, it sounds likely that I would have. I'm sure you have. It was unbelievably controversial but it was published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. So it was super prestigious and he believes that butterflies and caterpillars are different species.

628
00:32:47,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Yes, I have read that. And there you go. And he's read it. Yeah, because it calls a massive stir. So he's a genuine scientist who said that actually two different species made it and produced this offspring at some point, you know, hundreds of thousands of years ago.

629
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 And that's the only way that they could exist in a butterfly. It's a different species to a caterpillar. So the different organisms, it becomes a new organism. Wow.

630
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And then he got, um, he got roundly criticized by all of science. Really.

631
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that the long-quan buddhist temple in China has a monk called Worthy Stupid Robot Monk.

632
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 So, okay, it's not a human monk. It is actually, as it says in the title, a robot monk. They have developed at this buddhist temple.

633
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 A monk, that specific job is for when tourists come and want to chat to people, they go talk to the robot monk and he'll answer your questions about what is the meaning of life and all those other things.

634
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Um, he's programmed to give you answers and he's basically just their PR person when people come because they might be busy doing monk stuff. So I'd be quite disappointed if I turn up to a buddhist temple off like years of going on a spiritual journey.

635
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 And I turn up on the monks to want to talk to me and I have to talk to their robot. Yeah. Well, they think it's a good way of spreading more idea of what Buddhism is because it's kind of like a monk version of Siri.

636
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Did you read what the meaning of life is, according to the robot? No, no. Well, I looked up an article about him. I think it was in Gizmodo Magazine and it was about him being displayed at a robot fair.

637
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 And he was asked two questions. He was first asked what's the meaning of life and his reply was, my master says the meaning of life is to help more people finally leave behind bitterness and gain happiness.

638
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And the next question it was asked was, who are your parents? And he said, that's ridiculous. How can robots have parents? Which I think that's quite a good answer. It's kind of a bit of tone.

639
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Yeah, but someone has just said, leave behind your bitterness and gain happiness. He's really jumped on my throat for asking about his mum and dad.

640
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 I know he's very good at long repressive monotonous chance, because we're a very important part of bigger Buddhist monks. Just to defend the robot for a second, that we've been roundly criticising.

641
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 Well, isn't the Buddha who kind of sat in front of a wall for 10 years or something, just meditating? That would be quite easy for a robot. Yes. Turn it off.

642
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 You can see why robots have started out with Buddhism, can't you? It feels like the easiest, most achievable one.

643
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 So just to give a visual to anyone who hasn't yet gone to Google straight away, see what he looks like. He is a two-foot tall, little cartoon looking kind of monk. He's got the robes. He's got the yellow saffron kind of robes.

644
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 And he has a kind of iPad that sits in the middle of his chest, which you can press and that helps you with the questions and the answers.

645
00:35:47,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Is it Tally Tubby? He's. And so it exists this little monk, this CNR. He exists in this temple, which is 500 years old. It's kind of on the outskirts of Beijing. And you can go and visit. He's not always in use. He's sometimes in a cupboard.

646
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Meditating. No things to waste off.

647
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Can I just say something about the temple that the robot monk came from? Yeah. Because it's really interesting. The Longquan temple is famously tech savvy and has been for years. So this is really just an accumulation of what they've been working towards for ages. And you would love it Alex, I thought with you and I was reading about it.

648
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Is it steam powered? It should be steam powered. I think it might even have moved beyond that.

649
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 So first of all, a monk from their parent invented WeChat, which is that? What is WeChat? Is that why you study Rhinol and you're just talking to the person next to you?

650
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 First person ever to do it. Yeah. If one was too awkward before that. How do you know?

651
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 It's still we. Not at urinals, but in cubicles. But they do talk. They do talk. We don't talk. Of course you talk. My girlfriend, my sorry, my fiance, was telling me just the other day that at work, even her colleagues, they'll go in and they'll just continue chatting.

652
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 I know that my friends at school did it. This is not anecdotal.

653
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 But that's the same time. It's a definite definition of anecdotal. First scientist ever.

654
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 See, just as you were saying that, as the words came out, you're like, no!

655
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 I would still suggest I've been in more women's toilets than you have in my life.

656
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 I know, but you don't like talking. I do hate to talk. Can I ask, Ella?

657
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 You know, this definitely is a thing. Like, I can tell, having not been in many women's toilets, that when my wife or a girl that I know goes to the toilet, she'll often bring a friend with her and they'll go to the toilet at the same time.

658
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 So they just stand in stony silence.

659
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 To be honest, I've never done that. So I've never known what they do. People are chatting in front of the mirror when they're putting makeup on the stuff.

660
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 This actually wasn't really the point of my eat. My thing about the monks.

661
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 So we chat. So this is a, yeah, among from the long-grand temple, invented we chat.

662
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 It is said, and we chat is basically China's equivalent of WhatsApp, and I suspect that it has many more users. So it's got over a billion subscribers right now, which is a seventh of the world's population.

663
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 That's basically everyone in China, isn't it? It's like 1.2 billion people in China.

664
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Yeah, I guess so. So anyway, it's said that the guy who manufactured it, this guy called Zhang Xiaolong, he went to the temple in Beijing,

665
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 because questions concerning his idea for we chat had long weighed in his heart. And he consulted with the monks there, and it turned out they're super tech savvy.

666
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 And one of the monks sat down with him for seven days and talked over the digitization of this idea he had, and told him how to do it.

667
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 And he left after seven days of reflection and chatting to a monk, and he invented we chat.

668
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Wow. Isn't that cool? They're moving away from nature and towards technology.

669
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 I do know, I mean, the Dalai Lama very famously loves technology always has was obsessed with clocks. So maybe it's our impression of tech and Buddhism being incompatible is just our view of that.

670
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Maybe it actually they've been dying for an iPad. Some people would say that being really into clocks is not being up to date with the most modern technology.

671
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 And I've come to the clock. There's a robot called WD2. Was that like an early version of WD40?

672
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 WD40, the 40 means 40 of attempt. WD stands for water displacement, and he made 39 tries and it didn't work. And then WD40 was his 40 of try.

673
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 So WD2 is the robot that it's just a robot with a face that looks at you, scans your face in 3D, and then rearranges its burn stroke to say it looks like you.

674
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 And there's no use for it. There's no use. What about fucking people up? Yeah, basically like a really grieving mirror.

675
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 That would be the weirdest thing ever. That's incredible. There's immense use for that.

676
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 Okay, go on, Anna. All of crime and Harry Potter is based around but making yourself look like someone else, isn't it?

677
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 Oh yeah, I can see. Yeah, you know, they take that potion and oh yeah, that one scene.

678
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 It's already seen up at four times in the process.

679
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Hotels are really good places of robots in Japan, especially. That's one of the first places in which service and issue robots coming in because they're so well suited to it.

680
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 You've got all the rooms have got the same, you know, all the corridors are exactly the same. It's all really well organized.

681
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 Do they have robots using like cleaning the rooms?

682
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Well, they've got robot conscientious. If you order room service, there are some hotels where you get a little knock on the door and it's basically like it's kind of like an R2-D2 robot and it looks exactly like you.

683
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 All right, we're going to have to wrap up really soon. Anyone got anything before we do.

684
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 So Buddhist monks have an obesity problem at the moment.

685
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 It turns out more than half of Buddhist monks are obese and that's because when people give donations to monks, it's often like sweet foods.

686
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 So they just sit and they eat all these sweet foods that people are offering to them. And their medical costs are really burning the Thai government and so they've been had to put on this government sponsored diet.

687
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 And they've also manufactured for them these special girdles which tighten as you put on weight as a gentle reminder that you're getting too fat for your girdle.

688
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 I read something similar about nurses in this country. I don't think they're pointing on a particular amount of weight but I think they eat too many chocolates because whenever they save someone or look after someone, their relatives always give them chocolates and they just eat shit loads of them.

689
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 So a nurse will thank us for this next time. Give your nurse some raw carrots and some celery or a girdle.

690
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 They're not horses. If I think into the rambles or toes. They'll horse potatoes.

691
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.
