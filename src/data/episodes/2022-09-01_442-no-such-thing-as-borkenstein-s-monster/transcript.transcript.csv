00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everybody, just before we start this show we wanted to let you know that we are going"
00:00:05,00:00:10,to be doing a live show in London and yet also all around the world.
00:00:10,00:00:14,"Anna it's impossible, you can't be in two places at once."
00:00:14,00:00:18,"Oh well, let me introduce you to a little something called the Interweb."
00:00:18,00:00:23,"On the 9th of September we will be doing a live podcast at Kings Place in London, but"
00:00:23,00:00:27,there are endless tickets available for you to be in a virtual audience.
00:00:27,00:00:33,"Yes, we could make this the largest mass gathering of people ever."
00:00:33,00:00:35,"We could. We won't, but we could."
00:00:35,00:00:41,"If just one person in 12 joins this event we will have, what's that, 500 million people"
00:00:41,00:00:42,more at the event?
00:00:42,00:00:44,"Yeah, I think that's likely actually."
00:00:44,00:00:45,Can you imagine it?
00:00:45,00:00:46,Yeah.
00:00:46,00:00:48,"OK, how do you become part of the 500 million, Andy?"
00:00:48,00:00:49,It's so easy.
00:00:49,00:00:50,It's so easy.
00:00:50,00:00:56,Just go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live and then you will be part of the greatest mass
00:00:56,00:00:58,event in global history.
00:00:58,00:01:00,It's also going to be a really fun show.
00:01:00,00:01:04,"We are going to be performing a live episode of the podcast, all your favourite characters"
00:01:04,00:01:05,are going to be there.
00:01:05,00:01:11,"Dan, James, Anna, Andy, Raoul who sits in the corner and hasn't said anything for 400"
00:01:11,00:01:12,episodes.
00:01:12,00:01:13,We're all going to be there.
00:01:13,00:01:14,He's always been my favourite though.
00:01:14,00:01:15,Good old Raoul.
00:01:15,00:01:16,"So yeah, they always are really fun."
00:01:16,00:01:19,We're really looking forward to getting back on the road and doing live shows.
00:01:19,00:01:21,Please join us for them at knowsuchthingasafish.com/live.
00:01:21,00:01:25,"OK, on with the show."
00:01:25,00:01:44,Come with the podcast.
00:01:44,00:01:50,"Hello and welcome to another episode of knowsuchthingasafish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the"
00:01:50,00:01:52,QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:01:52,00:01:53,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:53,00:01:58,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once"
00:01:58,00:02:02,again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last
00:02:02,00:02:07,"seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:07,00:02:10,Starting with fact number one and that is Andy.
00:02:10,00:02:15,My fact is that Charles Darwin kept a pet bug so he could see how long it lasted on
00:02:15,00:02:17,a meal of blood.
00:02:17,00:02:19,Who's blood?
00:02:19,00:02:25,So I went to Charles Darwin's house recently which is called Down House and it's amazing.
00:02:25,00:02:29,It's really great because they preserved it almost exactly as it was when he was living
00:02:29,00:02:33,"there because it was his, then it passed to his and his wife's children and then it became"
00:02:33,00:02:34,a museum.
00:02:34,00:02:37,So they've got the chair he wrote the original species in.
00:02:37,00:02:40,They've got all of his little experiments in the garden and there was a board up which
00:02:40,00:02:43,said that it seemed to imply that it was his blood.
00:02:43,00:02:47,Actually I think it was he got the bug to drink someone else's blood and then just monitored
00:02:47,00:02:48,the bug.
00:02:48,00:02:50,Did you just drag people off the street?
00:02:50,00:02:54,He was on the voyage of the Beagle at the time because the voyage took years.
00:02:54,00:02:57,You need company on that kind of thing.
00:02:57,00:02:58,A pet's a good idea.
00:02:58,00:02:59,It's a really good idea.
00:02:59,00:03:00,Exactly.
00:03:00,00:03:01,Do we know what this bug is by the way?
00:03:01,00:03:02,We do.
00:03:02,00:03:07,It's called the Vincuca now or at the time he called it the Bencuca and it's called
00:03:07,00:03:10,the kissing bug or the assassin bug and it crawls all over your body and then drinks
00:03:10,00:03:12,your blood.
00:03:12,00:03:17,So he put it on the table and from the account he got some sailors on the boat to offer their
00:03:17,00:03:22,"fingers to the bug and he said that it would immediately protrude its sucker, make a charge"
00:03:22,00:03:27,and if allowed draw blood and then in ten minutes it went from being completely flat
00:03:27,00:03:33,to being globular and that this one feast kept it fat during four whole months.
00:03:33,00:03:34,Wow.
00:03:34,00:03:35,Wow.
00:03:35,00:03:36,Yeah.
00:03:36,00:03:37,That's pretty good.
00:03:37,00:03:38,Is that the one that he got Shaggers disease from?
00:03:38,00:03:39,Yeah.
00:03:39,00:03:40,Yeah.
00:03:40,00:03:42,This is of all the bugs that you could keep as a pet.
00:03:42,00:03:46,This is the one where by it's yeah it's the worst.
00:03:46,00:03:47,Mosquito.
00:03:47,00:03:50,Mosquito is bad but this is the one where it's got that longevity thing where if you
00:03:50,00:03:56,get bitten by it and the sort of whatever saliva goes into your body twenty years later
00:03:56,00:03:58,you might have heart conditions.
00:03:58,00:04:02,So he had incredibly poor health for the last few decades of his life.
00:04:02,00:04:08,"Really terrible digestion and just awful health and we think it may be, it's not completely"
00:04:08,00:04:12,"sure what it was but there's a really strong theory that it was his pet, Shaggers disease"
00:04:12,00:04:13,from his pet bug.
00:04:13,00:04:18,"And when I say Shaggers disease it's C-H-A-G-A-S, isn't it?"
00:04:18,00:04:19,Exactly.
00:04:19,00:04:20,"But it's, I pronounce it Shaggers."
00:04:20,00:04:21,It's much more funny to pronounce it Shaggers disease.
00:04:21,00:04:27,Cause you could go do a sex addict meeting but you thought you were going to a Shaggers
00:04:27,00:04:28,disease meeting.
00:04:28,00:04:30,It's just cool to say at the pub isn't it?
00:04:30,00:04:31,Got Shaggers disease.
00:04:31,00:04:32,Yeah.
00:04:32,00:04:33,How did you catch it?
00:04:33,00:04:34,Yeah.
00:04:34,00:04:35,Off an insect.
00:04:35,00:04:39,I'll be dead in a couple of years.
00:04:39,00:04:40,Did he have a name for the pet?
00:04:40,00:04:41,No.
00:04:41,00:04:43,I don't think he named the pet.
00:04:43,00:04:45,"And again, this brings into question."
00:04:45,00:04:46,Is it a pet?
00:04:46,00:04:48,Did he take it for walks?
00:04:48,00:04:49,It seems very unlikely.
00:04:49,00:04:52,But a cat is a pet and you don't take that for a walk normally.
00:04:52,00:04:56,Did it sit on his lap while he watched Telly?
00:04:56,00:05:01,What was the age he didn't just aloofly walk away from him all the time like my cat does?
00:05:01,00:05:02,Pet.
00:05:02,00:05:03,Exactly.
00:05:03,00:05:04,Did it show no emotional interest?
00:05:04,00:05:05,Pet.
00:05:05,00:05:06,It was a cat.
00:05:06,00:05:07,Effectively he turns out he had a cat.
00:05:07,00:05:12,"But if he got Shaggers disease from it, it does imply that he did experiment on it himself,"
00:05:12,00:05:13,right?
00:05:13,00:05:17,"It may have been one of its many rival colleague bugs, which actually gave him the disease."
00:05:17,00:05:20,"But he may also have, he probably did let it, let it feed."
00:05:20,00:05:21,He did.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"It was on that trips, which he wrote in his voyage of the Beagle Diary that there was"
00:05:24,00:05:27,a night where there was an attack of these kind of bugs where he was bitten.
00:05:27,00:05:33,So I don't think it was necessarily his pet that went for him as opposed to a whole swarm
00:05:33,00:05:34,in the middle of the night.
00:05:34,00:05:35,Yeah.
00:05:35,00:05:36,It is a really cool house.
00:05:36,00:05:42,"But he had his desk chair, like so many animals, evolved to meet his needs."
00:05:42,00:05:47,"As in it gave birth to other desk chairs, some of which died because they weren't adapted"
00:05:47,00:05:48,well enough to the environment.
00:05:48,00:05:51,Or did he intelligently design it to change it?
00:05:51,00:05:53,"Oh my God, he absolutely, he actually did."
00:05:53,00:05:54,He actually designed it.
00:05:54,00:05:55,"He, yeah."
00:05:55,00:05:56,He disproved himself.
00:05:56,00:06:01,It was a big comfy chair and he had a board across it so he could sit in basically a lovely
00:06:01,00:06:03,"big armchair, but also right."
00:06:03,00:06:04,I think we said it had wheels.
00:06:04,00:06:05,It had wheels.
00:06:05,00:06:06,Office chair.
00:06:06,00:06:10,They loved tampering with furniture because we've actually mentioned years ago that Erasmus
00:06:10,00:06:15,"Darwin, his grandfather, adjusted a table to accommodate his fat stomach, don't they?"
00:06:15,00:06:16,"Yes, kind of holding it."
00:06:16,00:06:17,Yeah.
00:06:17,00:06:18,"Well, they were part of the Wedgwood family."
00:06:18,00:06:19,Yes.
00:06:19,00:06:20,So they liked interiors.
00:06:20,00:06:21,Oh yeah.
00:06:21,00:06:22,What's that?
00:06:22,00:06:25,On that side of the family?
00:06:25,00:06:26,"No, it was his wife, wasn't it?"
00:06:26,00:06:30,"But I just remembered they were cousins here and his wife, so actually both sides of the"
00:06:30,00:06:31,family.
00:06:31,00:06:32,Yeah.
00:06:32,00:06:33,"So you said it lasted four months, right?"
00:06:33,00:06:34,Yeah.
00:06:34,00:06:35,And a lot of blood suckers.
00:06:35,00:06:36,Right.
00:06:36,00:06:39,"But they do last a very long time, most of them, on very small amounts of blood."
00:06:39,00:06:41,"Well, the little blood suckers."
00:06:41,00:06:47,So I think you can get lice that last like a year on one blood meal.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Wow.
00:06:48,00:06:49,And leeches.
00:06:49,00:06:50,So we breed leeches.
00:06:50,00:06:55,"Actually, Wales has the world's biggest leech breeding farm for medical purposes, the vast"
00:06:55,00:06:57,majority of the world's leeches that are used in medicine.
00:06:57,00:06:59,And they don't put that in the tourist information.
00:06:59,00:07:00,"No, no, why not?"
00:07:00,00:07:01,I think they should.
00:07:01,00:07:03,Why did they choose the dragon as their animal?
00:07:03,00:07:04,Leech?
00:07:04,00:07:05,Dragons don't even exist.
00:07:05,00:07:06,Right.
00:07:06,00:07:07,Good point.
00:07:07,00:07:08,And leech is much easier to draw.
00:07:08,00:07:09,Yes.
00:07:09,00:07:10,Looks a bit like a poo though.
00:07:10,00:07:11,On the flag.
00:07:11,00:07:12,Yeah.
00:07:12,00:07:13,You don't want that to be...
00:07:13,00:07:17,"If you draw the serrated teeth and the slobbering fangs, I think it'll make clearer that it's"
00:07:17,00:07:18,a leech.
00:07:18,00:07:19,Yeah.
00:07:19,00:07:20,On the flag.
00:07:20,00:07:21,Do you think?
00:07:21,00:07:22,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:22,00:07:23,"It's like if you put eyes on a poo, it still looks like a poo, as emojis have showed us."
00:07:23,00:07:24,That's true.
00:07:24,00:07:28,I think if you've got the leech latched into a human vein.
00:07:28,00:07:29,That's a great idea.
00:07:29,00:07:30,Yeah.
00:07:30,00:07:31,That's a nice logo for a country.
00:07:31,00:07:36,They put the back off it so that it just keeps sucking and the blood pours out of its rectum.
00:07:36,00:07:37,Why?
00:07:37,00:07:38,Why is it a severed leech?
00:07:38,00:07:39,"Well, that's what they do with leeches, isn't it?"
00:07:39,00:07:44,"When you have blood-sucking leeches, if you're a guy from the 16th century or something,"
00:07:44,00:07:48,"a doctor, you put a leech on them and you cut the end off and they just keep eating,"
00:07:48,00:07:49,I think so.
00:07:49,00:07:50,"Oh, wow."
00:07:50,00:07:51,Because they don't know they're full.
00:07:51,00:07:52,"I'm going off memory, so I might be completely wrong."
00:07:52,00:07:53,They're not full.
00:07:53,00:07:54,They're empty.
00:07:54,00:07:55,You're emptying them out.
00:07:55,00:07:56,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:56,00:07:58,"That's like, you know, when people pack two cases to go on holiday, but you don't want"
00:07:58,00:08:03,"them to go in Austin Powers, for instance, as they close and you take them out."
00:08:03,00:08:04,"Oh, I see."
00:08:04,00:08:05,You don't cut a hole in the suitcase.
00:08:05,00:08:06,"No, no."
00:08:06,00:08:07,They get pissed off about that.
00:08:07,00:08:10,"Wait, so could you bleed to death if you had an anus-less leech?"
00:08:10,00:08:11,No.
00:08:11,00:08:13,I think your body would create enough blood.
00:08:13,00:08:14,Okay.
00:08:14,00:08:15,Your body has a lot of blood.
00:08:15,00:08:16,Yeah.
00:08:16,00:08:17,It would take a long time and a lot of leeches.
00:08:17,00:08:18,Okay.
00:08:18,00:08:19,Yeah.
00:08:19,00:08:20,Still quite amazing.
00:08:20,00:08:21,"My cat, I have to feed it every day."
00:08:21,00:08:22,Hmm.
00:08:22,00:08:23,How long did that bug say?
00:08:23,00:08:24,One year without a meal.
00:08:24,00:08:26,"Yeah, you can go one year without a meal."
00:08:26,00:08:29,"These leeches, they get fed sheep's blood every six months on the farm, which is not,"
00:08:29,00:08:33,"I guess there's probably just one sheep and every six months it gets a call and is like,"
00:08:33,00:08:34,"""It's your day today."""
00:08:34,00:08:35,No.
00:08:35,00:08:36,"Oh, no."
00:08:36,00:08:37,That's all right.
00:08:37,00:08:38,It's only twice a year.
00:08:38,00:08:41,"I think, do they put it in a, put a load of sheep's blood in a condom or something and"
00:08:41,00:08:43,then the leeches have to attach onto it?
00:08:43,00:08:44,"Yeah, maybe it's that."
00:08:44,00:08:45,Get that on the flag.
00:08:45,00:08:52,"So, I actually haven't realized how widespread they are in plastic surgery, for instance."
00:08:52,00:08:57,"So, there was a survey of 50 plastic surgery units in the UK and 80% of them use leeches"
00:08:57,00:08:58,in the last five years.
00:08:58,00:08:59,That's right.
00:08:59,00:09:00,"So, it's common in plastic surgery."
00:09:00,00:09:01,"What are they, in that scenario?"
00:09:01,00:09:02,What are they using them for?
00:09:02,00:09:07,"They shove them inside your boobs to make them bigger, just lower to loads of leeches."
00:09:07,00:09:08,I didn't realize that's what I said.
00:09:08,00:09:09,You can see them wriggling.
00:09:09,00:09:10,Yeah.
00:09:10,00:09:11,Yeah.
00:09:11,00:09:12,Poshpice.
00:09:12,00:09:15,"They are used for, because they thin blood."
00:09:15,00:09:19,"So, when they latch onto you to suck your blood, they thin it out so that they can suck"
00:09:19,00:09:20,as much of it as possible.
00:09:20,00:09:23,"So, in surgery, it's very useful because often you get blood clots after surgery."
00:09:23,00:09:28,"And also, if you're reattaching limbs, so if your nose has fallen off and you need to"
00:09:28,00:09:32,"have it reattached, it's quite common to use leeches to sort of connect the two bits to"
00:09:32,00:09:35,"keep the blood flow going, otherwise your blood will just clot and then you would be"
00:09:35,00:09:36,able to get the blood flow.
00:09:36,00:09:37,They remove it.
00:09:37,00:09:38,Yeah.
00:09:38,00:09:41,"As it's pooling in the area, they just remove it and it means that the new capillaries form"
00:09:41,00:09:42,neatly between the two.
00:09:42,00:09:43,Very cool.
00:09:43,00:09:44,How amazing.
00:09:44,00:09:45,They're amazing.
00:09:45,00:09:46,Let's do some other animals that eat blood.
00:09:46,00:09:47,Okay.
00:09:47,00:09:48,"Well, check this out, right?"
00:09:48,00:09:49,"So, mosquitoes."
00:09:49,00:09:50,They eat the blood.
00:09:50,00:09:51,We all know that.
00:09:51,00:09:52,Famously.
00:09:52,00:09:57,"What I didn't know is that there are midges that eat mosquitoes, so they eat the blood"
00:09:57,00:09:58,from the mosquito.
00:09:58,00:09:59,"Oh, I see."
00:09:59,00:10:03,"So, it's like if they're having our blood via the mosquito."
00:10:03,00:10:07,Then is there a smaller little louse that's latched onto the midge?
00:10:07,00:10:08,Possibly.
00:10:08,00:10:09,Yeah.
00:10:09,00:10:10,It's the opposite of a Russian doll.
00:10:10,00:10:11,"Because also, it's on the outside."
00:10:11,00:10:13,"It's out flowing, yeah, flowing out."
00:10:13,00:10:14,Yeah.
00:10:14,00:10:15,"Yeah, that's incredible."
00:10:15,00:10:19,"I was hearing blood is actually incredibly, but as I thought of blood as being an ultimate"
00:10:19,00:10:20,food.
00:10:20,00:10:21,Yeah.
00:10:21,00:10:22,"Well, you are a vampire."
00:10:22,00:10:23,"Yeah, exactly."
00:10:23,00:10:24,"As in, I thought."
00:10:24,00:10:25,It's a super food.
00:10:25,00:10:26,It's like kale.
00:10:26,00:10:27,Yeah.
00:10:27,00:10:29,It's like red kale.
00:10:29,00:10:30,It's strong.
00:10:30,00:10:32,"You know, you drink the blood to gain the life."
00:10:32,00:10:33,"You know, it's a life force."
00:10:33,00:10:35,"Auntie, this is really creepy."
00:10:35,00:10:36,It's incredible.
00:10:36,00:10:37,I don't know.
00:10:37,00:10:38,People think of it that way.
00:10:38,00:10:39,It's full of iron.
00:10:39,00:10:40,It's full of iron.
00:10:40,00:10:42,It turns out it's pretty much the worst food you can have.
00:10:42,00:10:43,Yeah.
00:10:43,00:10:44,It's so rubbish.
00:10:44,00:10:45,"So, it's incredible."
00:10:45,00:10:48,It doesn't have enough B vitamins for you to survive on.
00:10:48,00:10:50,"So, almost everything needs B vitamins."
00:10:50,00:10:51,And it's got none.
00:10:51,00:10:54,"Quite a lot of cereals have B vitamins added, don't they?"
00:10:54,00:10:56,"So, you could put blood on your cornflakes."
00:10:56,00:10:57,Yeah.
00:10:57,00:10:58,Yeah.
00:10:58,00:10:59,Yeah.
00:10:59,00:11:00,Yeah.
00:11:00,00:11:01,Exactly.
00:11:01,00:11:02,Okay.
00:11:02,00:11:03,"Well, that's a good solution."
00:11:03,00:11:04,You're right for the natural world.
00:11:04,00:11:07,"But so, red meat has a thousand times as much vitamin B12 as blood, just to put it out"
00:11:07,00:11:08,in context.
00:11:08,00:11:10,"Also, it does have loads of iron, which can be toxic."
00:11:10,00:11:12,"So, that's a problem as well."
00:11:12,00:11:16,"And leeches and ticks and lots of other blood-sucking creatures, they have to have special bacteria"
00:11:16,00:11:21,"in their stomachs, which create B vitamins, and leeches have to have a particular issue"
00:11:21,00:11:24,"to tie up the iron, which they're ingesting."
00:11:24,00:11:28,"They don't want to ingest this iron, but they've got these special chemicals in them to protect"
00:11:28,00:11:29,themselves from it.
00:11:29,00:11:31,"So, it's a terrible food."
00:11:31,00:11:32,Yeah.
00:11:32,00:11:35,"So, there's 30,000 species, I read, that are blood suckers."
00:11:35,00:11:36,Wow.
00:11:36,00:11:41,"And that sounds a lot, except for Andy's point, is it's really not a lot when you consider"
00:11:41,00:11:44,how readily available blood is for a species.
00:11:44,00:11:45,"And also, how many species there are."
00:11:45,00:11:46,How many species there are.
00:11:46,00:11:49,"So, that's actually quite a limited number, which goes to your point that it's not the"
00:11:49,00:11:50,most practical of food.
00:11:50,00:11:51,Okay.
00:11:51,00:11:54,"So, like everything, loads of carnivals eat meat, there are way more than 30,000 of those."
00:11:54,00:11:57,"But yeah, blood suckers, you have to be really specially evolved to do it."
00:11:57,00:11:58,"Yeah, exactly."
00:11:58,00:11:59,Cool.
00:11:59,00:12:00,"So, it's not the ultimate food."
00:12:00,00:12:01,"Well, that's, you've exploded."
00:12:01,00:12:02,The myth there.
00:12:02,00:12:08,Do not pick that box on HelloFresh the next time you're ordering it.
00:12:08,00:12:21,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:12:21,00:12:26,My fact this week is that the child who the book The Exorcist was based on went on to
00:12:26,00:12:31,become a NASA engineer whose inventions contributed to the Apollo moon missions.
00:12:31,00:12:32,So cool.
00:12:32,00:12:38,"So, are you saying that actually they levitated all the way to the moon?"
00:12:38,00:12:39,Yes.
00:12:39,00:12:40,Fuck you.
00:12:40,00:12:45,Propelled by vomit coming out from the astronauts.
00:12:45,00:12:46,Yeah.
00:12:46,00:12:49,"So, the author of The Exorcist, the novel William Blatty, he based it on a true life"
00:12:49,00:12:50,story.
00:12:50,00:12:54,"And it was in 1949 in St. Louis, Missouri."
00:12:54,00:12:58,And it was the story of a kid who we've known as Roland Doe.
00:12:58,00:12:59,No one's known who he is.
00:12:59,00:13:04,Then it gets revealed an engineer from NASA who's called Ronald Edwin Hunkler.
00:13:04,00:13:06,He in fact was the boy.
00:13:06,00:13:08,And that the other name was a pseudonym.
00:13:08,00:13:13,"And all along, people within NASA, you know, close friends knew this, but he never wanted"
00:13:13,00:13:17,to tell anyone because he found it an extraordinarily embarrassing thing.
00:13:17,00:13:21,"So he was someone who worked at NASA, who was part of the Apollo missions."
00:13:21,00:13:24,"As I just said, he also had a few patents with them."
00:13:24,00:13:27,He made these ceramics that you put on the outside of rockets.
00:13:27,00:13:28,Cool.
00:13:28,00:13:29,That's awesome.
00:13:29,00:13:34,"No, it's like a special ceramic plates."
00:13:34,00:13:39,"And I think when there was a crash or a problem recently, they blamed it on the ceramic plates."
00:13:39,00:13:40,People might remember that.
00:13:40,00:13:41,He messed it up.
00:13:41,00:13:42,"No, no, no."
00:13:42,00:13:43,That was a different issue.
00:13:43,00:13:48,"But he invented this thing, which was like foamed ceramics, where you would like make"
00:13:48,00:13:51,a slurry of different materials.
00:13:51,00:13:54,And then you would wait for it to bubble up and then you put it into the oven and it
00:13:54,00:13:56,would bake and it would be really heat resistant.
00:13:56,00:13:57,Wow.
00:13:57,00:13:58,And he invented those things.
00:13:58,00:13:59,So cool.
00:13:59,00:14:02,We should say that obviously the exorcist of the film is Reagan the girl.
00:14:02,00:14:03,So I don't know at what point it changed.
00:14:03,00:14:05,Was it in the book that it was a girl as well?
00:14:05,00:14:06,Yeah.
00:14:06,00:14:07,When did it change from a boy to a girl?
00:14:07,00:14:08,I don't know actually.
00:14:08,00:14:09,I think in the book it was a girl.
00:14:09,00:14:10,Yes.
00:14:10,00:14:11,In the book it was a girl.
00:14:11,00:14:12,Yeah.
00:14:12,00:14:13,And then he changed it.
00:14:13,00:14:14,What was the name?
00:14:14,00:14:15,Blathe?
00:14:15,00:14:16,Yeah.
00:14:16,00:14:18,He changed it because it was a way of masking what had gone on.
00:14:18,00:14:23,"But it was very, the original case sounds extremely spooky, which you wouldn't think"
00:14:23,00:14:24,it.
00:14:24,00:14:25,He did it.
00:14:25,00:14:26,No.
00:14:26,00:14:27,It was absolutely terrifying.
00:14:27,00:14:28,Yeah.
00:14:28,00:14:30,"He was born in 1935, this boy."
00:14:30,00:14:35,Don't open with that.
00:14:35,00:14:39,"Well, the case of the thing like hearing scratching noises from his bedroom walls and the family"
00:14:39,00:14:44,minister wrote to a parapsychology lab at Duke University when the boy was 14 years
00:14:44,00:14:46,old in 1949.
00:14:46,00:14:48,And said that his bed shook when he was in it.
00:14:48,00:14:49,"Oh, come on."
00:14:49,00:14:50,"No, stop."
00:14:50,00:14:53,He could have had shaggers disease.
00:14:53,00:14:55,He was 14.
00:14:55,00:15:02,And then a picture of Christ on the wall shook when he was nearby and the image itself
00:15:02,00:15:03,was spooky.
00:15:03,00:15:06,He did live in an earthquake-prone place.
00:15:06,00:15:08,I can't believe they're the things you're picking out at spooky.
00:15:08,00:15:09,So many mad things happened.
00:15:09,00:15:10,Okay.
00:15:10,00:15:14,So the details from the story that we know are based on basically this diary by Father
00:15:14,00:15:15,Raymond Bishop.
00:15:15,00:15:20,So there were a few priests who rocked up to try and help out with the exorcism and Father
00:15:20,00:15:24,"Raymond Bishop was one of them very confusing, not a bishop, a priest called Bishop."
00:15:24,00:15:25,"Oh, clever."
00:15:25,00:15:28,"But I mean, name yourself for the job you want."
00:15:28,00:15:29,Yeah.
00:15:29,00:15:30,Okay.
00:15:30,00:15:31,Yeah.
00:15:31,00:15:32,He's working his way out.
00:15:32,00:15:33,My local priest in Bolton is called a pastor.
00:15:33,00:15:34,No.
00:15:34,00:15:39,He should have started an Italian restaurant though.
00:15:39,00:15:41,He replaced someone called Father McVicar.
00:15:41,00:15:42,No.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Yeah.
00:15:43,00:15:52,"That's the man who was voted on in an internet poll, wasn't it?"
00:15:52,00:15:53,Make a face.
00:15:53,00:15:56,"Anyway, Bishop McBishopface wrote this diary about all the stuff that happened, which is"
00:15:56,00:16:00,part of the reason why we're somewhat skeptical about the facts of the exorcist because he
00:16:00,00:16:02,didn't come on a little bit later.
00:16:02,00:16:05,So he was using what he'd been told by the family and the other priest who had been involved
00:16:05,00:16:06,earlier on.
00:16:06,00:16:08,But some of the things he said are kind of amusing.
00:16:08,00:16:14,So there was apparently once there was a question of the time of departure from the house and
00:16:14,00:16:17,suddenly the word Saturday appeared written on the boy's hip.
00:16:17,00:16:22,"So I guess the devil's like, you know, get leave on Saturday."
00:16:22,00:16:25,"There was, for instance, his desk at school used to move independently of him."
00:16:25,00:16:26,It's very hard to fake that.
00:16:26,00:16:33,"It's not like it's not like all these, wow, independently of anyone that just moved."
00:16:33,00:16:34,Okay.
00:16:34,00:16:36,Can we just clarify please that obviously we know it's all lies.
00:16:36,00:16:37,I'm not saying it's true.
00:16:37,00:16:40,I'm just saying some of the claims that were made about what happened.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Yeah.
00:16:41,00:16:42,You couldn't say a boy had done it.
00:16:42,00:16:43,What I didn't believe was the priest wrote down.
00:16:43,00:16:45,But so what are you saying did it then?
00:16:45,00:16:46,It's just lies.
00:16:46,00:16:47,"Oh, God."
00:16:47,00:16:48,It made it made up.
00:16:48,00:16:51,"It made up, he said."
00:16:51,00:16:54,But he said he'd left school out of embarrassment that his desk was moving.
00:16:54,00:16:59,"Now I think if I was a school child and my desk moved independently, you'd be the coolest"
00:16:59,00:17:00,kid in school.
00:17:00,00:17:01,Yeah.
00:17:01,00:17:02,"That's not embarrassing, is it?"
00:17:02,00:17:03,"Oh, children are very quick to find a point of difference, aren't they?"
00:17:03,00:17:04,Yeah.
00:17:04,00:17:08,"If you're ready and then your desk started moving, that's not going to help you become"
00:17:08,00:17:09,cool.
00:17:09,00:17:13,I can picture what would have happened if I had been possessed by a demon at school.
00:17:13,00:17:14,Wouldn't have helped.
00:17:14,00:17:15,Right.
00:17:15,00:17:16,Good to know.
00:17:16,00:17:17,No.
00:17:17,00:17:20,"This guy, Hunkler, the exorcism boy I think growing up, he always apparently went out"
00:17:20,00:17:21,on Halloween.
00:17:21,00:17:22,Okay.
00:17:22,00:17:24,Because he was worried that someone would find him.
00:17:24,00:17:25,On Halloween.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"Oh, I see."
00:17:27,00:17:29,Not because he was worried the demons would come back just because.
00:17:29,00:17:30,Right.
00:17:30,00:17:31,Yeah.
00:17:31,00:17:32,Yeah.
00:17:32,00:17:33,He seemed to be very paranoid about being found out for being this boy.
00:17:33,00:17:34,Yeah.
00:17:34,00:17:35,He was really terrified to ruin his life a bit.
00:17:35,00:17:36,Yeah.
00:17:36,00:17:38,It's because the book sold 13 million copies in America alone.
00:17:38,00:17:44,"But using a fictional plotline with a girl, he was nicely hidden, but I guess someone"
00:17:44,00:17:45,"would have known, right?"
00:17:45,00:17:46,They would have known where he lives.
00:17:46,00:17:47,I think some people he worked with knew.
00:17:47,00:17:48,Yeah.
00:17:48,00:17:49,Like people did know.
00:17:49,00:17:50,"Yeah, that's true."
00:17:50,00:17:51,I reckon it was an open secret in the area.
00:17:51,00:17:52,"Yeah, definitely."
00:17:52,00:17:58,"In the newspaper reports around the time, this is from the Baltimore Evening Sun from 1949,"
00:17:58,00:18:05,they said that it took 20 to 30 exorcisms to get rid of the demon and that at the end
00:18:05,00:18:11,"of each one, the child would have a tantrum and voice scraps of Latin and that a boy once"
00:18:11,00:18:13,sat in a chair and it tipped over.
00:18:13,00:18:15,That was evidence that he had a demon.
00:18:15,00:18:16,Yeah.
00:18:16,00:18:21,But he did say that local families were sprinkling holy water around his house because they'd
00:18:21,00:18:25,heard about this demon possession and everyone would go around and put holy water there.
00:18:25,00:18:26,That's a no.
00:18:26,00:18:27,You've got to get really good coverage though with that.
00:18:27,00:18:28,Holy water doesn't come in big quantities.
00:18:28,00:18:29,No.
00:18:29,00:18:30,You can't put it in a hosepipe.
00:18:30,00:18:31,Yeah.
00:18:31,00:18:35,It's not like putting it down vinegar to deter a fox where you can just slosh it about.
00:18:35,00:18:39,Couldn't you just get a big vat of water and get a priest to bless it?
00:18:39,00:18:40,To bless it.
00:18:40,00:18:41,Does it then all become holy?
00:18:41,00:18:42,"Yeah, it's not."
00:18:42,00:18:43,Why don't we just bless all the water then?
00:18:43,00:18:47,"As in if this works, which I'm not saying it does, why not just bless the..."
00:18:47,00:18:49,Send a priest to the Pacific Ocean and just...
00:18:49,00:18:50,Exactly.
00:18:50,00:18:51,Bless that.
00:18:51,00:18:52,And then we'll have a thing.
00:18:52,00:18:54,"Basically, you're going to have to do this."
00:18:54,00:19:00,"Go to Lutz, buy up all the holy water, drink it all, piss it out, get it back into the"
00:19:00,00:19:02,water cycle and then some of it will be...
00:19:02,00:19:03,It stays holy.
00:19:03,00:19:07,"Yeah, it'll be like one or two bits of it will be in every glass of water you ever drink."
00:19:07,00:19:09,We'll have a little bit of holy water in it.
00:19:09,00:19:10,That's a good idea.
00:19:10,00:19:11,That's exciting.
00:19:11,00:19:12,Yeah.
00:19:12,00:19:13,Presumably that's true already.
00:19:13,00:19:14,"You know, the holy water has been part of the water cycle, hasn't it?"
00:19:14,00:19:15,How long does it stay holy?
00:19:15,00:19:16,How long does it stay holy?
00:19:16,00:19:17,And piss it out?
00:19:17,00:19:18,It's been sprinkled on people.
00:19:18,00:19:19,It evaporates.
00:19:19,00:19:20,It goes up into the clouds.
00:19:20,00:19:21,It's in the seas.
00:19:21,00:19:22,"All water is holy, I think."
00:19:22,00:19:23,Great.
00:19:23,00:19:24,There we go.
00:19:24,00:19:26,"Possessions have dropped off, haven't they?"
00:19:26,00:19:27,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:27,00:19:31,"Well, some local families, like I say, they sprinkled water around this house, but there"
00:19:31,00:19:35,was one family that didn't believe any of it and they invited him to stay with them
00:19:35,00:19:38,"and said, ""Okay, we'll see if you're really possessed."""
00:19:38,00:19:43,"And they reported that his bed shook and bumped in the night and they became believers, according"
00:19:43,00:19:46,to the Baltimore evening sun.
00:19:46,00:19:50,"One of the other symptoms, according to the priests who were there, and this one you could"
00:19:50,00:19:55,"fake, probably, if you're talented, is that apparently during possessions, several times"
00:19:55,00:19:58,there was the passing of wind through his rectum.
00:19:58,00:20:03,"Well, one thing I noticed, because I looked at all of his patents, one of his patents"
00:20:03,00:20:09,is for gaseous flow purging in thermal blanket cleaning.
00:20:09,00:20:15,"So his patents was about gaseous flow and while he was possessed, he also had gaseous flow."
00:20:15,00:20:19,"And I read through every single patent that he did, and that was the only link I could"
00:20:19,00:20:21,find to the existence.
00:20:21,00:20:27,It just seems to be a teenage boy farting and shaking the bed through unknown mechanisms.
00:20:27,00:20:34,I bet he needed some thermal blanket cleaning after the...
00:20:34,00:20:41,"In the film, there was a lot of chat that maybe the filming itself was haunted, because"
00:20:41,00:20:46,"for example, the climactic exorcism scene, when they were filming it, it had to be delayed"
00:20:46,00:20:52,because a pigeon flew into a light box and the set burned down.
00:20:52,00:20:53,The set burned down?
00:20:53,00:20:54,Yeah.
00:20:54,00:20:55,The set burned down.
00:20:55,00:20:58,"Well, a pigeon, the pigeon I imagine, the light box is very hot."
00:20:58,00:20:59,"Yeah, no, no."
00:20:59,00:21:02,"We understand why, but I feel like that's a big story."
00:21:02,00:21:07,"Well, the thing is, the director, William Freakin, claimed that a winged creature with"
00:21:07,00:21:10,talons had been responsible for this f***ing...
00:21:10,00:21:11,He was freaking out.
00:21:11,00:21:12,"Oh, God."
00:21:12,00:21:16,"It was responsible for it, so I think he was sexing up."
00:21:16,00:21:17,Yeah.
00:21:17,00:21:18,Yeah.
00:21:18,00:21:19,The pigeon.
00:21:19,00:21:20,Spooky.
00:21:20,00:21:24,"There's officially three Exorcist movies, so the first one was based on the novel, and"
00:21:24,00:21:27,"then the second one, Blatty went off, and they just made..."
00:21:27,00:21:30,They wrote a sequel and they put that out.
00:21:30,00:21:31,Exorcist 3...
00:21:31,00:21:32,"So, sorry."
00:21:32,00:21:33,The famous one is the first one.
00:21:33,00:21:34,Famous one is the first one.
00:21:34,00:21:35,"Yeah, okay."
00:21:35,00:21:36,And then there's the sequel.
00:21:36,00:21:39,"Yeah, then there's the sequel, and then there's Exorcist 3, which Blatty himself wrote and"
00:21:39,00:21:42,"directed, so he came back for the third one."
00:21:42,00:21:43,Oh.
00:21:43,00:21:44,But...
00:21:44,00:21:45,"The novelist, right."
00:21:45,00:21:51,"He worked in film, generally, anyway, but so he also wrote novels, and he wanted to"
00:21:51,00:21:54,"make his novel, which was called Legion, into a movie."
00:21:54,00:21:55,Okay.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"And I think when they were funding it, something went round where they sort of said, ""It's"
00:21:58,00:21:59,not going to happen.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"What if we call it Exorcist 3?"""
00:22:01,00:22:05,"So it was named Exorcist 3, so he was directing it, directing the whole movie."
00:22:05,00:22:08,"They'd done the whole production, and then during the production, someone noticed that,"
00:22:08,00:22:12,"""Hang on, there's no Exorcisms in this movie whatsoever."
00:22:12,00:22:13,"What's going on?"""
00:22:13,00:22:15,"And so the money people came and said, ""What are you doing?"
00:22:15,00:22:16,"Why is this called this?"""
00:22:16,00:22:19,"He said, ""Well, it's actually based on my novel, Legion, which doesn't have any Exorcisms"
00:22:19,00:22:20,"in it."""
00:22:20,00:22:26,So they ended up making him re-film the entire last third of the movie at costs of $4 million
00:22:26,00:22:30,just so they could introduce some random new father character who could perform an Exorcism
00:22:30,00:22:31,in the movie.
00:22:31,00:22:32,No.
00:22:32,00:22:33,"To me, that seems reasonable if they're calling it Exorcist 3."
00:22:33,00:22:34,Absolutely.
00:22:34,00:22:35,Yeah.
00:22:35,00:22:36,It's either that or change the name.
00:22:36,00:22:37,Yeah.
00:22:37,00:22:38,Exactly.
00:22:38,00:22:39,What was Legion about?
00:22:39,00:22:40,Did it fit with the plot?
00:22:40,00:22:41,I actually don't know.
00:22:41,00:22:42,"Yeah, but..."
00:22:42,00:22:43,Was it like a Roman army?
00:22:43,00:22:44,Halfway through.
00:22:44,00:22:45,Yeah.
00:22:45,00:22:46,"Veedy, veedy."
00:22:46,00:22:47,What was that?
00:22:47,00:22:52,"They're all speaking Latin all the way through, it's incredibly scary."
00:22:52,00:23:01,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna."
00:23:01,00:23:09,My fact this week is that plants remember droughts and they like it.
00:23:09,00:23:10,They like it.
00:23:10,00:23:11,They like it because it's useful to them.
00:23:11,00:23:17,"How is it useful for them because they can't go somewhere, let's move next to that river."
00:23:17,00:23:20,"They can't, they haven't went out to buy plane tickets to wet places yet."
00:23:20,00:23:24,What you can do is you can take action as a plant.
00:23:24,00:23:28,So this is kind of an amazing discovery about plants because it kind of taps into something
00:23:28,00:23:33,"that we thought they were not capable of doing at all, which is more of an animal feature."
00:23:33,00:23:37,How it works is let's say you take a plant that has undergone a really bad drought and
00:23:37,00:23:41,then you take a plant that didn't undergo a really bad drought and then you subject them
00:23:41,00:23:43,both to a bad drought the following year.
00:23:43,00:23:47,The plant that underwent the bad drought is going to have learned to deal with it and
00:23:47,00:23:50,"it can do clever things like it cannot open, it's paused as much so it doesn't lose as"
00:23:50,00:23:51,much water.
00:23:51,00:23:56,It can do clever things to conserve water to make it less shit.
00:23:56,00:24:05,"These technical words, they're just shit, that's what they said in the paper."
00:24:05,00:24:06,It's very clever.
00:24:06,00:24:11,So they make a molecule which is called the GABA molecule which acts like a memory.
00:24:11,00:24:15,So they make more of this molecule when it's droughty and that molecule is what tells it
00:24:15,00:24:20,"next time to do things like not open, it's paused so it doesn't lose water and the unbelievable"
00:24:20,00:24:24,thing about this which I think is maybe even more amazing is that it's sort of deposited
00:24:24,00:24:27,"on their genes, this learning process."
00:24:27,00:24:33,"So it's epigenetics, you know, when, it's basically the opposite of Darwinism."
00:24:33,00:24:36,It's like you're not just getting your genes from your parents.
00:24:36,00:24:40,You're learning something and then that goes into your genes and then you can pass it on.
00:24:40,00:24:41,Wow.
00:24:41,00:24:42,I feel a bit challenged actually.
00:24:42,00:24:45,It feels a bit pointed that Anna's brought up this anti-dharmonistic thing.
00:24:45,00:24:46,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:46,00:24:47,Just Lamarcus almost.
00:24:47,00:24:48,Yeah.
00:24:48,00:24:49,Yeah.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"So thanks a lot, Anna."
00:24:50,00:24:51,I'm not wishing your favourite.
00:24:51,00:24:52,You know the amazing thing about it.
00:24:52,00:24:53,Awesome.
00:24:53,00:24:54,"Sorry, I've just got one specifically on that."
00:24:54,00:24:58,"You just said this thing was called GABA, the molecule."
00:24:58,00:25:02,GABA is also an acronym for a very dry place.
00:25:02,00:25:04,It's a cricket ground in Australia for GABA.
00:25:04,00:25:06,"Well, it's in Australia."
00:25:06,00:25:11,"So the GABA is a slang term, Aussie slang term, which stands for the Great Australian"
00:25:11,00:25:12,Bugger All.
00:25:12,00:25:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:13,00:25:17,"And it's the sort of ultra outbacky, really, really dry bit of Australia."
00:25:17,00:25:18,There we go.
00:25:18,00:25:19,We've completed the circle.
00:25:19,00:25:21,It's one of the first facts I ever learned at QI.
00:25:21,00:25:22,Is it?
00:25:22,00:25:23,Interesting.
00:25:23,00:25:24,Yeah.
00:25:24,00:25:28,GABA actually stands in this case for Gamma Amino Butyric Acid.
00:25:28,00:25:29,Oh.
00:25:29,00:25:34,But the really interesting thing about it is that it's the same molecule that's used
00:25:34,00:25:39,in mammals and in other animals to signal messages between your body.
00:25:39,00:25:43,"So through your nervous system, you also use GABA, and these plants are using the same"
00:25:43,00:25:44,thing.
00:25:44,00:25:45,Wow.
00:25:45,00:25:46,That's amazing.
00:25:46,00:25:47,That's cool.
00:25:47,00:25:48,Yeah.
00:25:48,00:25:49,So we all contain GABA?
00:25:49,00:25:50,We're all contain.
00:25:50,00:25:51,We're all contain.
00:25:51,00:25:52,Some of us more than others.
00:25:52,00:25:57,"Yeah, there's quite a lot of stuff over the last kind of ten years, if you start reading"
00:25:57,00:26:01,"about plant that looks into the idea of plant consciousness being a thing, not the same"
00:26:01,00:26:05,"way that humans have it, but investigating whether we've underestimated that."
00:26:05,00:26:09,And I think people didn't want to think about it for ages because of this thing that I'd
00:26:09,00:26:15,"never heard of actually, but this guy called Trofim Lysenko, who's this Soviet guy."
00:26:15,00:26:23,"So basically, he thought the plants had memories, and he turned out to be a real piece of shit."
00:26:23,00:26:25,So people don't like to copy him.
00:26:25,00:26:30,So there are some grains that are stimulated by cold weather to know to then grow in spring.
00:26:30,00:26:31,"Oh, right."
00:26:31,00:26:35,"But he realized that if he subjected those grains to just cold temperatures, he could"
00:26:35,00:26:39,"trick them into thinking that it had been winter, and then they'd remember that, and"
00:26:39,00:26:42,then they'd grow in what they thought was spring a few months later.
00:26:42,00:26:45,"So he said, plants have got memories."
00:26:45,00:26:46,Great.
00:26:46,00:26:47,Does that mean double harvests?
00:26:47,00:26:48,That means double harvests.
00:26:48,00:26:49,Exactly.
00:26:49,00:26:51,"So he was like, this is going to transform the Soviet Union."
00:26:51,00:26:53,"Oh my God, I am going to make it go so well."
00:26:53,00:26:58,"And as many of us know, the Soviet Union did not go that well in a harvest sense."
00:26:58,00:27:00,But he didn't sound like a piece of shit so far.
00:27:00,00:27:01,Right.
00:27:01,00:27:03,"Sounds like a good guy so far, trying to get some extra harvests in."
00:27:03,00:27:04,No.
00:27:04,00:27:05,I agree.
00:27:05,00:27:06,Maybe his intentions were good at some point.
00:27:06,00:27:10,"So he came up with some really dodgy scientific conclusions, which were completely incorrect"
00:27:10,00:27:14,and forced loads of farmers to plant specific grains at specific times.
00:27:14,00:27:15,It didn't work.
00:27:15,00:27:20,And it's really responsible for a lot of the famines of the 40s and 50s in the Soviet
00:27:20,00:27:21,Union.
00:27:21,00:27:23,"And, you know, he's possibly responsible for millions of deaths."
00:27:23,00:27:28,"The whole plant consciousness is obviously a giant pseudoscience, which has been around"
00:27:28,00:27:29,since the late 60s.
00:27:29,00:27:32,"There was a book that was called The Secret Life of Plants, which came out, which was"
00:27:32,00:27:34,a number one bestseller globally.
00:27:34,00:27:39,And it had all of these big claims about what plants were able to do.
00:27:39,00:27:42,And so a guy called Cleave Baxter was the main guy behind it.
00:27:42,00:27:45,He was a CIA polygraph guy who kind of made...
00:27:45,00:27:46,Oh no.
00:27:46,00:27:47,It was an extraordinary story.
00:27:47,00:27:52,"And it kind of the reason people talk to plants these days, kind of is rooted back to him."
00:27:52,00:27:57,"These days, there's an amazing woman in Australia who's called Monica Gagliano."
00:27:57,00:28:02,"And she's leading a lot in bioacoustics, which is looking at plants and how sound might be"
00:28:02,00:28:04,something that they can pick up as well.
00:28:04,00:28:09,"Many scientists, obviously hugely skeptical, but she works for a university in Sydney and"
00:28:09,00:28:14,"she's publishing reports that let's say, for example, you played the sound of water and"
00:28:14,00:28:16,it was a recording of water.
00:28:16,00:28:18,The roots would grow towards it.
00:28:18,00:28:22,We should say Gagliano is not the kind of pseudoscience of the 70s book.
00:28:22,00:28:23,She is a legitimate...
00:28:23,00:28:25,"She's a legitimate scientist, but she makes huge claims."
00:28:25,00:28:30,"She wrote a book called Thus Spoke the Plant, which she says she co-wrote with plants, speaking"
00:28:30,00:28:31,to the plants.
00:28:31,00:28:32,"Not metaphorically, literally."
00:28:32,00:28:34,Did she share the royalties?
00:28:34,00:28:35,Possibly.
00:28:35,00:28:36,"I bet she does, in some way."
00:28:36,00:28:37,Give it to her.
00:28:37,00:28:38,I do.
00:28:38,00:28:39,That looks after plants.
00:28:39,00:28:43,"Because, yes, she has done experiments which are very surprising."
00:28:43,00:28:48,"She did that thing where if you drop certain plants, then they will close up to try and"
00:28:48,00:28:49,protect themselves.
00:28:49,00:28:53,"And so she created actually this really cool thing, which you use to drop a plant, which"
00:28:53,00:28:57,"you know when you're at a fairground and you sit on one of those benches, it carries you"
00:28:57,00:29:00,"up a pole, a vertical pole, then it drops you down again."
00:29:00,00:29:05,"She made that for plants and she realised that if you drop them enough times, they stop"
00:29:05,00:29:06,closing up.
00:29:06,00:29:07,Because they learn.
00:29:07,00:29:10,Because they learn that it's not going to do them any harm.
00:29:10,00:29:14,And she says that it can then remember that lesson for a month.
00:29:14,00:29:19,"You can modify plants to make them drought-proof, as you can GM tweak them, basically."
00:29:19,00:29:22,So this is something that was done in 2018.
00:29:22,00:29:27,"This tweaked a single gene in tobacco plants, which means they lose, I think it was a quarter"
00:29:27,00:29:28,less water.
00:29:28,00:29:34,"And it's because they have these pores, right, which they normally open up and close in response"
00:29:34,00:29:35,to daylight.
00:29:35,00:29:36,So that's what triggers it.
00:29:36,00:29:41,"So when the pores are open, they suck in carbon dioxide, but they also lose water."
00:29:41,00:29:45,"So the carbon dioxide is necessary for photosynthesis, but losing water is obviously a bad thing"
00:29:45,00:29:47,if you're in a time of drought.
00:29:47,00:29:52,"So in the GM version of these plants, they open for a briefer spell, is go whoop, and"
00:29:52,00:29:54,then close up again.
00:29:54,00:30:00,"So the good thing is, they can still get enough carbon dioxide in to do all the photosynthesis"
00:30:00,00:30:03,"they need, but they lose a quarter less water."
00:30:03,00:30:07,You will have a plant that is way more resistant to dry weather.
00:30:07,00:30:08,Clever.
00:30:08,00:30:09,It's so clever.
00:30:09,00:30:11,Why do we need all this tobacco?
00:30:11,00:30:14,That's a great point.
00:30:14,00:30:19,"I suppose they hope it can be done eventually with other, more useful plants."
00:30:19,00:30:23,"Yeah, yeah, we're not just all going to have to just literally be smoking 20 a day."
00:30:23,00:30:26,"But we will, if we smoke 20 a day, we will need less food."
00:30:26,00:30:27,So we'll have to grow less wheat.
00:30:27,00:30:31,"So actually, right, it's some real product."
00:30:31,00:30:36,"In 1933, yo-yos were banned in Syria because they thought they were causing droughts."
00:30:36,00:30:37,Right.
00:30:37,00:30:38,"Yeah, I read that."
00:30:38,00:30:39,Was there a logic to that?
00:30:39,00:30:40,Yeah.
00:30:40,00:30:45,"There was an Ulaama who were like religious heads, and they petitioned the Prime Minister"
00:30:45,00:30:50,of Syria and said that the yo-yo was responsible for the drought that they were having at the
00:30:50,00:30:55,time because the up-and-down movement was counteracting their prayers.
00:30:55,00:30:57,"And so they banned it, and the next day it rained."
00:30:57,00:30:59,There we go.
00:30:59,00:31:04,"But anyway, there was an article in the New York Times at the time, and they spoke about"
00:31:04,00:31:07,"whether this could be true or not, and they said, ""Well, London at the moment is full"
00:31:07,00:31:10,"of yo-yos, and it rains there all the time."""
00:31:10,00:31:11,That was their evidence.
00:31:11,00:31:13,That's counter-evidence.
00:31:13,00:31:14,Yeah.
00:31:14,00:31:20,"James, do you have a view as a golf fan on what I think you know is coming?"
00:31:20,00:31:25,"The fact that in droughts, golf courses are very often exempt."
00:31:25,00:31:30,"The UK, in Australia, and it's on health at the moment."
00:31:30,00:31:31,This is a huge deal.
00:31:31,00:31:35,"In France, they're going and pouring concrete and stuff into golf holes on golf courses."
00:31:35,00:31:38,"Which is the most pointless thing, because they change the golf hole every single day."
00:31:38,00:31:43,"Like on a golf course, if you go onto a green, the hole is in a certain place."
00:31:43,00:31:46,"Every day, they fill it in, and they put it in a different place."
00:31:46,00:31:47,You had me.
00:31:47,00:31:48,I had never heard of that.
00:31:48,00:31:49,Because it's part of the game.
00:31:49,00:31:50,"Because people play every day, right?"
00:31:50,00:31:53,And so it would be boring if it was always in the same place.
00:31:53,00:31:55,"Oh yeah, that's the thing that makes it boring."
00:31:55,00:31:59,"People are coming in filling in these holes, which are literally about to be filled in"
00:31:59,00:32:00,anyway.
00:32:00,00:32:01,They're doing their job for them.
00:32:01,00:32:02,Yeah.
00:32:02,00:32:03,Maybe they're doing it to help them out.
00:32:03,00:32:04,"Well, that's very funny."
00:32:04,00:32:08,"I don't remember how far, like, three centimetres to the left."
00:32:08,00:32:10,It might be as little as that.
00:32:10,00:32:14,"It tends to be, like, another part of the green, like, with a different slope."
00:32:14,00:32:19,"Do golfers claim, ""Oh, I would have got it if I'd been here yesterday, and I was playing"
00:32:19,00:32:21,"actually to yesterday's hole?"""
00:32:21,00:32:25,"Yeah, actually, when you play golf, you can see where the old hole was, because it never"
00:32:25,00:32:26,quite bends.
00:32:26,00:32:27,Right.
00:32:27,00:32:29,"And so often, you'll hit a ball, and you're nowhere near the actual hole, but you're right"
00:32:29,00:32:30,next to where it was.
00:32:30,00:32:31,A few days ago.
00:32:31,00:32:33,"Can you get, like, a half point for that?"
00:32:33,00:32:34,No half points.
00:32:34,00:32:36,"It's not a points game, is it?"
00:32:36,00:32:37,"Well, yeah, shots."
00:32:37,00:32:38,"Yeah, shots."
00:32:38,00:32:39,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:32:39,00:32:40,"But, yeah."
00:32:40,00:32:44,"Well, I think we've all learned something very interesting about this, but, yeah, they"
00:32:44,00:32:48,"are exempt, and they're exempt according to Southern Water, because this is happening"
00:32:48,00:32:49,at the moment in the UK.
00:32:49,00:32:52,There have been a few hosepipe bands in certain areas.
00:32:52,00:32:57,"Southern Water wrote on their website that, ""On health and safety grounds, golf courses"
00:32:57,00:32:58,"are exempt."""
00:32:58,00:32:59,"Oh, great."
00:32:59,00:33:03,"I mean, no, I'd rather think if I'm not allowed to use a hosepipe on my garden, probably"
00:33:03,00:33:04,you shouldn't be allowed on golf course.
00:33:04,00:33:05,Probably I would use more on a golf course.
00:33:05,00:33:11,"But perhaps there are reasons, like, because it gets people doing healthy things."
00:33:11,00:33:15,"Maybe as there are other exemptions on tennis courts, for instance, and on the sporting"
00:33:15,00:33:16,field.
00:33:16,00:33:17,I've got data on this.
00:33:17,00:33:21,My local bowls club lawn is looking very green indeed.
00:33:21,00:33:26,"I would imagine probably they, for all sporting and health events, they probably have an exemption"
00:33:26,00:33:27,right now.
00:33:27,00:33:28,They don't.
00:33:28,00:33:30,"Yeah, I guess golf courses are just the big grassy ones, aren't they, so that's probably"
00:33:30,00:33:31,the ones that get all the attention.
00:33:31,00:33:34,"Those bowls are sort of smaller, you know, although it's probably less healthy as well."
00:33:34,00:33:36,"I mean, bowls doesn't do much good for you."
00:33:36,00:33:40,"I remember once reading that it was the most dangerous sport that you can do, and that's"
00:33:40,00:33:42,because 90-year-olds do it.
00:33:42,00:33:44,And if you look at the number of deaths.
00:33:44,00:33:45,"Huge fatality, right?"
00:33:45,00:33:46,Yeah.
00:33:46,00:33:48,"Well, I was looking, sorry, just on golf courses."
00:33:48,00:33:51,"If you did want to know what your golf course was, I was looking at advice on restoring courses"
00:33:51,00:33:56,"after drought on some golf website, and apparently it said, ""Make sure that all dead grass plants"
00:33:56,00:33:59,"are removed by scaring or tickle harrowing the turf."""
00:33:59,00:34:00,Tickle harrowing.
00:34:00,00:34:01,Tickle harrowing.
00:34:01,00:34:04,"That's quite a good word for something, isn't it, if you've had a harrowing experience,"
00:34:04,00:34:05,but not very harrowing.
00:34:05,00:34:07,It was a bit tickle harrowing.
00:34:07,00:34:08,Yeah.
00:34:08,00:34:12,"I'm just watching the Exorcist, you know."
00:34:12,00:34:17,"I'm sorry, I cannot get over that they change the golf hole every day, I absolutely blown"
00:34:17,00:34:18,my mind.
00:34:18,00:34:21,"And I think listeners at home are in my position right now, going, ""Why are they talking about"
00:34:21,00:34:23,"anything else that is astonishing?"""
00:34:23,00:34:27,"Certainly anyone who plays golf, or has ever played golf, or ever watched golf on television"
00:34:27,00:34:28,would know that.
00:34:28,00:34:30,"Watching it on TV, you wouldn't notice the next day."
00:34:30,00:34:32,"I mean, they talk about it all the time."
00:34:32,00:34:34,There's very little else to talk about.
00:34:34,00:34:37,Are there any rogue hole places who put it right on the edge of the green?
00:34:37,00:34:39,That's kind of the point.
00:34:39,00:34:43,"Let's say, for instance, there's a green, right, it's got lots of slopes on it."
00:34:43,00:34:47,"One of the slopes goes right down into some water, right?"
00:34:47,00:34:51,"If you put the hole right next to that slope, then it really changes where you aim, because"
00:34:51,00:34:55,"you're not going to aim to the side of it where the water is, right?"
00:34:55,00:34:59,"Or you can put it 20 yards further, so you have to use a different golf club to reach"
00:34:59,00:35:02,"it on the next time, or you put it next to a bunker."
00:35:02,00:35:05,Why not do it so that there is no flag?
00:35:05,00:35:08,"So all you do is, when you arrive, and this is for professionals, when you arrive, you"
00:35:08,00:35:12,have the data of the previous month's hole positions.
00:35:12,00:35:13,Yeah.
00:35:13,00:35:15,"I mean, that pretty much happens what you're talking about."
00:35:15,00:35:19,"So the week before a major championship, all the caddies will walk around and look at all"
00:35:19,00:35:24,"the possible places where the hole could be, where it's been in previous years, where it's"
00:35:24,00:35:28,"been on the Thursday and Friday on a Saturday and Sunday, and they kind of know more or less"
00:35:28,00:35:29,where it's going to be.
00:35:29,00:35:33,"And then on the morning, they all get a little booklet that tells you exactly where the hole"
00:35:33,00:35:40,"is on each of the 18 holes, and it'll be like 17 yards on and 8 yards from the left or whatever."
00:35:40,00:35:42,And that's every morning they get that.
00:35:42,00:35:43,OK.
00:35:43,00:35:47,"I found a way of being less interested in golf than I was before, which was a really fascinating"
00:35:47,00:35:50,chart I think I've had in eight years of this podcast.
00:35:50,00:35:51,"Oh, God."
00:35:51,00:35:52,"Thank you, guys."
00:35:52,00:35:53,One more question.
00:35:53,00:36:03,"One more question. So let's say a master's is happening, and they go and they sus out"
00:36:03,00:36:05,where the holes have been previously.
00:36:05,00:36:08,Is there a kind of thing where you go home and let's say Greg Norman and watch golf
00:36:08,00:36:09,for a while?
00:36:09,00:36:12,"Greg Norman is definitely haven't, if you're talking about Greg Norman and the master's"
00:36:12,00:36:14,"but anyway, carry on."
00:36:14,00:36:18,Is there a simulation thing where they can place the ball in a virtual reality kind of
00:36:18,00:36:22,simulation so they can test with knowing what the wind speeds will be the next day and so
00:36:22,00:36:23,on?
00:36:23,00:36:24,Sure.
00:36:24,00:36:30,"You have simulated golf, and you can simulate wind for short, you can simulate pin positions."
00:36:30,00:36:32,"Whether anyone actually does that, I doubt."
00:36:32,00:36:33,But it's not impossible.
00:36:33,00:36:37,"Dan, I cannot believe you fought tooth and nail, even when we were saying shut up for"
00:36:37,00:36:38,that question.
00:36:38,00:36:39,"That was so boring, Dan."
00:36:39,00:36:40,Are you kidding me?
00:36:40,00:36:41,That was so boring.
00:36:41,00:36:42,"OK, kill it."
00:36:42,00:36:46,"Dan, you and I will do our own special podcast afterwards when you ask me all the questions"
00:36:46,00:36:48,that no one ever wanted to know about golf.
00:36:48,00:36:56,"It's going to be a hit, clump fish, new show coming, very fish."
00:36:56,00:37:05,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:37:05,00:37:17,"OK, my fact this week is that when you play golf, is that in 2017 there was a house party"
00:37:17,00:37:25,in Maryland that was so boozy the ambient air in the building tested positive on a breathalyzer?
00:37:25,00:37:28,I'm just excited that everyone from the US is going to switch off because you just said
00:37:28,00:37:29,Maryland.
00:37:29,00:37:30,Maryland.
00:37:30,00:37:31,It's just Maryland.
00:37:31,00:37:32,That's just how it is.
00:37:32,00:37:35,"But Maryland, I can see in a, probably, in a Bolton accent."
00:37:35,00:37:36,"In a Bolton accent, yeah."
00:37:36,00:37:38,"Well, this feels like shit for the golf chat."
00:37:38,00:37:39,Sorry.
00:37:39,00:37:40,Sorry.
00:37:40,00:37:45,"This feels like the non-meat of the fact, given that the building tested positive on"
00:37:45,00:37:46,a breathalyzer.
00:37:46,00:37:47,"I mean, that was the funny thing."
00:37:47,00:37:48,It's incredible.
00:37:48,00:37:54,"So, yeah, this was a party, like a frat party kind of thing, advertised online as Tequila"
00:37:54,00:37:56,Tuesday.
00:37:56,00:38:01,"Loads of neighbors complained that it was so loud, and so the police turned up and it"
00:38:01,00:38:07,turned out that as well as being beer cans and spilled alcohol and lots of possibly underage
00:38:07,00:38:11,"people drinking, they also did a breathalyzer on lots of people, but they did it inside"
00:38:11,00:38:15,the house and it registered .01.
00:38:15,00:38:18,"So it wouldn't be legally drunk, but it showed up on the breathalyzer."
00:38:18,00:38:19,So it would be able to drive.
00:38:19,00:38:20,It would be able to drive.
00:38:20,00:38:23,The building would be able to drive.
00:38:23,00:38:27,"But the reason that this is kind of interesting, I think, is that some breathalysers, they"
00:38:27,00:38:33,work by taking the ambient air and then they compare your breath to what the air is.
00:38:33,00:38:38,"And so, like, if you're outside, if you've been driving and then they stop you, they're"
00:38:38,00:38:42,"testing against the air, you know, around the road, that's one thing."
00:38:42,00:38:46,"But if they're testing against air, which is already also drunk, then there could be"
00:38:46,00:38:47,a problem that you are.
00:38:47,00:38:48,That's really funny.
00:38:48,00:38:53,"So if you could sort of hot-box your car with alcohol air, make sure they test that."
00:38:53,00:38:59,"If you are drink-driving right now, quickly pour vodka all over your car and waft up"
00:38:59,00:39:02,"the air-conditioning, get it going, and you'll be fine."
00:39:02,00:39:03,Yeah.
00:39:03,00:39:04,Smart.
00:39:04,00:39:05,We're not condoning drink-driving in any way.
00:39:05,00:39:06,Absolutely.
00:39:06,00:39:07,"I think we are, based on this research."
00:39:07,00:39:08,Blimey.
00:39:08,00:39:11,"I really like the fact that the breathalyzer was, first of all, the drunkometer."
00:39:11,00:39:12,Yeah.
00:39:12,00:39:14,It's a much funnier and better name.
00:39:14,00:39:15,Yeah.
00:39:15,00:39:16,That was an early version of it.
00:39:16,00:39:17,Yeah.
00:39:17,00:39:18,"It was like 30, isn't it?"
00:39:18,00:39:19,"In the '60s, even, they were still calling it the drunkometer."
00:39:19,00:39:20,It was a standard phrase.
00:39:20,00:39:21,"Or sometimes, the alchometer."
00:39:21,00:39:23,"It was about 30, as they called it that."
00:39:23,00:39:24,I don't know why they changed it.
00:39:24,00:39:25,Intoximeter.
00:39:25,00:39:26,"Intoximeter, as well."
00:39:26,00:39:27,It's hard to say.
00:39:27,00:39:28,It's hard to say.
00:39:28,00:39:29,"It's a test, actually."
00:39:29,00:39:30,"If you can't pronounce it, you'll find the drive."
00:39:30,00:39:31,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:31,00:39:34,But the drunkometer was a different thing than the breathalyzer we use today.
00:39:34,00:39:41,And I love that the breathalyzer itself was invented by a guy called Robert Frank Borkenstein.
00:39:41,00:39:42,It's amazing.
00:39:42,00:39:44,Frank Borkenstein is such a great name.
00:39:44,00:39:45,Yeah.
00:39:45,00:39:46,Yeah.
00:39:46,00:39:50,"In Canada, it's sometimes called the Borkenstein, or it used to be, like the breathalyzer was"
00:39:50,00:39:51,known as a Borkenstein.
00:39:51,00:39:52,Oh.
00:39:52,00:39:55,"Of course, Borkenstein was the name of the doctor."
00:39:55,00:39:59,You should call it Borkenstein's monster.
00:39:59,00:40:03,"He really changed things a lot, Borkenstein, because in 1954, he invented it."
00:40:03,00:40:07,"And before him, the drunkometer could tell the presence of alcohol, but it couldn't"
00:40:07,00:40:10,"tell the quantity of alcohol, couldn't measure it precisely."
00:40:10,00:40:15,"And so before him, a defense lawyer, if someone was on a charge of drink driving, a defense"
00:40:15,00:40:19,"lawyer might say, ""Oh, my client was working for very long hours,"" and his eyes are red"
00:40:19,00:40:21,because he's got allergies.
00:40:21,00:40:25,And I've got friends of his racked up who will all swear blind that he only had two
00:40:25,00:40:26,beers on the night.
00:40:26,00:40:31,"And so he wasn't drink driving, and it was incredible, just so hard to prove, whereas"
00:40:31,00:40:33,Borkenstein absolutely changed that.
00:40:33,00:40:34,He did.
00:40:34,00:40:35,"He liked to drink himself, though."
00:40:35,00:40:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:40:36,00:40:39,"If you look at any obituaries, they're not very euphemistic about it."
00:40:39,00:40:40,Really?
00:40:40,00:40:45,"Was he lending it as a competitive thing, like he would score highest on my breathalyzer?"
00:40:45,00:40:50,"In The Guardian, it says, ""He was a genial fellow who enjoyed serving drinks to his friends"
00:40:50,00:40:53,"and exhibited a Catholic taste in wines and spirits."""
00:40:53,00:40:57,But he was a really great guy.
00:40:57,00:41:03,"When he was a child, he built a robot, which worked, like when he was at school."
00:41:03,00:41:09,"In World War II, they had bombs, which held them before they were released, but they needed"
00:41:09,00:41:13,"to be spot checked, and he invented a new way of spot checking them, which made it way,"
00:41:13,00:41:14,way easier.
00:41:14,00:41:18,So it helped the war effort in that way.
00:41:18,00:41:19,Nice.
00:41:19,00:41:20,"Safety first, again."
00:41:20,00:41:21,Yeah.
00:41:21,00:41:22,"Theme, developing."
00:41:22,00:41:23,I read a thing.
00:41:23,00:41:29,"The judge in Kerry Island, so this is a case, two cases were thrown out where the drink"
00:41:29,00:41:35,driving claim was no longer useful because the judge said that the people who were accused
00:41:35,00:41:41,of potentially being drunk had inhaled their own urine while they were in the actual custody
00:41:41,00:41:42,of the police.
00:41:42,00:41:43,Sorry.
00:41:43,00:41:44,What?
00:41:44,00:41:45,So this is a thing.
00:41:45,00:41:49,"There's a thing which is kind of known as a loophole law, and what it is is called section"
00:41:49,00:41:50,49.
00:41:50,00:41:56,"The reason why is that if you were the police bringing people to the station, there needs"
00:41:56,00:41:58,to be 20 minutes before you breathalyze them.
00:41:58,00:42:02,"In that 20 minutes, you have to have your eyes on them, and they can't have drinks,"
00:42:02,00:42:06,and they can't have anything that might influence what their breath is going to be.
00:42:06,00:42:08,"As in you breathalyze them straight away in the car, haven't you, because when you stop"
00:42:08,00:42:10,"someone in a car, you breathalyze them, but then you turn to the station."
00:42:10,00:42:12,"But you need them, you need it at the station for it to be legit."
00:42:12,00:42:13,So what happened?
00:42:13,00:42:17,And I think that's because the idea is that you can show a false positive on a breathalyzer
00:42:17,00:42:20,"if you've drunk really recently, or if you've got like alcohol in your mouth, right?"
00:42:20,00:42:22,So it's just waiting long enough that you're definitely positive.
00:42:22,00:42:24,"To make sure that you're definitely positive, yeah."
00:42:24,00:42:27,"Okay, so where do we get to inhaling your own urine?"
00:42:27,00:42:32,"So in these two specific cases, a judge called Judge O'Connor, he said that, where he was"
00:42:32,00:42:36,"told that during this 20 minute period where they weren't to be observed, they both went"
00:42:36,00:42:40,"to the bathroom, and when they went to the bathroom, they both were facing away from"
00:42:40,00:42:42,the police officers who were meant to be monitoring them.
00:42:42,00:42:47,"And according to the judge, in that time, the urine could have released odours that"
00:42:47,00:42:50,"would have been of a alcoholic nature, and that could influence that brand."
00:42:50,00:42:52,Is that why we say someone's pissed?
00:42:52,00:42:53,Possibly.
00:42:53,00:42:54,Yeah.
00:42:54,00:42:55,Quite possible.
00:42:55,00:42:56,"Well, yeah, it was this."
00:42:56,00:42:57,That is incredible.
00:42:57,00:42:58,"It wasn't long ago, but I haven't written down the year."
00:42:58,00:42:59,And that is bananas.
00:42:59,00:43:00,Did it work?
00:43:00,00:43:01,Do we know?
00:43:01,00:43:04,"Yeah, they got the two cases we're throwing out of court for that specific reason."
00:43:04,00:43:05,That is amazing.
00:43:05,00:43:06,Yeah.
00:43:06,00:43:07,Why are we sharing tips?
00:43:07,00:43:08,"But I mean, that is incredible."
00:43:08,00:43:11,"So what they should have done was after they came back from the toilet, waited another 20"
00:43:11,00:43:15,"minutes, but then they used the breathalyzer test within that time frame."
00:43:15,00:43:16,Yeah.
00:43:16,00:43:19,"Or you say it was just the police weren't monitoring them, so or if the police, they"
00:43:19,00:43:23,were at the urinal and put the policeman is sort of facing them at the urinal and watching
00:43:23,00:43:24,them every second.
00:43:24,00:43:27,"I think if you're at a urinal and someone's facing you, there are problems."
00:43:27,00:43:28,Something's gone wrong.
00:43:28,00:43:29,Something's gone wrong.
00:43:29,00:43:30,"They have to be sitting in the urinal, don't they?"
00:43:30,00:43:31,Yeah.
00:43:31,00:43:32,And can we talk about Barbara Castle?
00:43:32,00:43:33,"Yes, we can."
00:43:33,00:43:34,Yeah.
00:43:34,00:43:35,Very keen.
00:43:35,00:43:44,"So Transport Secretary, who introduced breathalyzers to British policing in 1967, you know, and"
00:43:44,00:43:48,part of the problem was that at the time the number of cars on the road had increased six
00:43:48,00:43:49,fold in the previous 20 years.
00:43:49,00:43:52,"So the word, you know, in the late 40s, there were two million cars on the road."
00:43:52,00:43:53,Now there were 12 million.
00:43:53,00:43:54,That's sixfold.
00:43:54,00:43:55,That's sixfold.
00:43:55,00:44:01,And my new podcast is going to be about simple sums and we'll go off against your golf whole
00:44:01,00:44:03,podcast and we'll just see who's is worse.
00:44:03,00:44:07,"It was just that last week, Anna said something about doubling, and she said from six million"
00:44:07,00:44:09,"to 12 million, you went, that's doubling."
00:44:09,00:44:14,"I've been hoist on my own referential, but I hate it."
00:44:14,00:44:19,"Anyway, Barbara Castle was great, but she was incredibly unpopular at the time for introducing"
00:44:19,00:44:22,"this partly because drinkers were saying, you know, I want to be able to have several"
00:44:22,00:44:25,drinks and then go home or drive home.
00:44:25,00:44:31,So some pub customers stuck pins in a doll labeled Barbara Castle.
00:44:31,00:44:34,That's from the mirror in 67.
00:44:34,00:44:39,"But her main foe, maybe when this thing was introduced was, have you guys heard of AJP"
00:44:39,00:44:40,Taylor?
00:44:40,00:44:41,No.
00:44:41,00:44:46,"It's a very famous 20th century historian basically, really, really famous at the time."
00:44:46,00:44:50,And he wrote about her and about breathalysers again and again.
00:44:50,00:44:52,"And there was a piece, why pick on the private motorist?"
00:44:52,00:44:57,"And he said, no one has the slightest idea how much alcohol affects a driver."
00:44:57,00:45:02,"The slightly tired driver, for instance, may actually be improved by a glass of sherry."
00:45:02,00:45:06,"And he concluded at the end of this piece, it was a really, really rude piece about her"
00:45:06,00:45:07,and about the whole idea.
00:45:07,00:45:10,And I've been driving a car for 45 years.
00:45:10,00:45:15,I have consistently ignored all the various speed limits.
00:45:15,00:45:18,Never once have I encountered the slightest risk as a result.
00:45:18,00:45:19,This is what she was up against.
00:45:19,00:45:23,I found the way breathalysers work really interesting.
00:45:23,00:45:30,In a way that's not more funny than where they put the hole on the green.
00:45:30,00:45:34,"You do realise the more we come back to this more, I'm going to have to keep it in."
00:45:34,00:45:39,This is my spin off podcast.
00:45:39,00:45:45,"So they work based on colour change, which I think is so cool."
00:45:45,00:45:50,"So basically, when you breathe into a breathalyzer, you've usually got, or the police who's holding"
00:45:50,00:45:54,"the breathalyzer, they've got the control solution on one side, then they've got the"
00:45:54,00:45:56,solution that you're breathing into.
00:45:56,00:46:03,"And they're using a solution called potassium dichromite, which is orange in colour."
00:46:03,00:46:07,"But when you breathe into it, the alcohol reacts with the dichromite and it produces"
00:46:07,00:46:11,"chromium, chromium ions on their own, and that is green."
00:46:11,00:46:16,"So if you're breathing alcohol into it, the orange turns to green, which is kind of cool."
00:46:16,00:46:20,"And then the way it works is it produces an electrical current based on the colour change,"
00:46:20,00:46:23,which I actually just didn't know could happen.
00:46:23,00:46:28,"So because different colours produce different amounts of energy, so if you've got a colour"
00:46:28,00:46:31,"that's a high frequency, like blue, like at the bottom of the rainbow, it produces more"
00:46:31,00:46:34,"energy than, let's say, red."
00:46:34,00:46:40,So that we can connect it up to a system where that translates into an electrical current.
00:46:40,00:46:45,So you connect some electrodes to the green solution and the orange solution and they
00:46:45,00:46:49,can sense the difference between the two and exactly how green it is.
00:46:49,00:46:50,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:46:50,00:46:51,And that's exactly how much alcohol you've got.
00:46:51,00:46:55,And that's what that's a standard breathalyzer.
00:46:55,00:47:00,"And then it translates into a figure on a screen, so you don't see any of this, sadly."
00:47:00,00:47:03,And you probably might be too drunk to understand it anyway.
00:47:03,00:47:08,"I haven't had anything to drink it, I was clinging on."
00:47:08,00:47:15,"In 2010, in Eastern Cape in South Africa, there was a person who was arrested and breathalyzed"
00:47:15,00:47:21,"and they were 32 times over the legal alcohol limit, which as far as I can tell is a record."
00:47:21,00:47:28,"He was caught driving a Mercedes-Benz Vito very erratically, and inside the car there"
00:47:28,00:47:32,"were also five children, a woman and 15 sheep."
00:47:32,00:47:33,What?!
00:47:33,00:47:34,Excuse me?
00:47:34,00:47:35,That's a big number.
00:47:35,00:47:36,Was he part of a joke?
00:47:36,00:47:37,"Sorry, in the car."
00:47:37,00:47:38,"In the car, yeah."
00:47:38,00:47:41,"Hang on, you can't get 15 sheep in a car?"
00:47:41,00:47:43,"Well, he did."
00:47:43,00:47:45,"If you're drunk enough, you can do anything."
00:47:45,00:47:48,"Probably wasn't a mini, was it?"
00:47:48,00:47:51,"It was a Mercedes-Benz Vito, which I actually don't know what that kind of car is."
00:47:51,00:47:55,"But it doesn't sound like it's a bus, so that's incredible."
00:47:55,00:48:01,"Apparently, he'd allegedly stolen the sheep from nearby farms, so, well drunk."
00:48:01,00:48:04,"Imagine waking up in the morning, kind of forgetting what you did last night, going"
00:48:04,00:48:05,out to the car.
00:48:05,00:48:07,It was just 50 sheep.
00:48:07,00:48:18,"2010 was a huge year for drink-driving incidents like this, so also in 2010, a guy in Nebraska"
00:48:18,00:48:23,"was pulled over after swerving dangerously on the road, and the police saw him driving"
00:48:23,00:48:24,very erratically.
00:48:24,00:48:28,"And there was a bottle of vodka in the car, empty beer cans all over the place."
00:48:28,00:48:29,He was 19 years old.
00:48:29,00:48:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:48:30,00:48:31,"I mean, all the signs were there."
00:48:31,00:48:32,He was arrested.
00:48:32,00:48:33,"You could say you're going to the recycling centre, can't you?"
00:48:33,00:48:34,"Well, yeah."
00:48:34,00:48:35,He was tested.
00:48:35,00:48:36,He was definitely over the limit.
00:48:36,00:48:37,Yeah.
00:48:37,00:48:40,"But the extra bit of evidence against him was that, at the time, he was dressed as a breathalyzer"
00:48:40,00:48:41,test.
00:48:41,00:48:51,"He'd been to a party, and it had a dial on the front, which said, you know, are you blood"
00:48:51,00:48:52,alcohol level?
00:48:52,00:48:56,"And it was from loser having fun to brain damage, because the arrow was set to brain damage"
00:48:56,00:49:03,"for him, and he had a tube which you blow into at his crotch level, insert inside mouth"
00:49:03,00:49:04,written on it.
00:49:04,00:49:07,And did the police use his breathalyzer?
00:49:07,00:49:10,"He said, can you blow into this?"
00:49:10,00:49:13,"He's like, well, you have to, you blow into this."
00:49:13,00:49:17,"Oh, one absolute tool."
00:49:17,00:49:22,"Yeah, the police said that he was joined at the detox centre by a French maid and a naughty"
00:49:22,00:49:23,board of patrol agents.
00:49:23,00:49:24,Oh my God.
00:49:24,00:49:30,"There's one way that people think you can beat the test, and that's by sucking on a"
00:49:30,00:49:31,penny.
00:49:31,00:49:36,The idea is that the zinc or the copper in the penny reacts with your alcohol in your
00:49:36,00:49:41,"mouth, and it kind of puts a different chemical into the breathalyzer, so it doesn't do all"
00:49:41,00:49:44,the chemical stuff it's supposed to do.
00:49:44,00:49:48,"Usually old breathalysers, that would work, but these days the way breathalysers are made,"
00:49:48,00:49:53,"it doesn't work, and it hasn't worked for about, you know, 10, 20 years almost that"
00:49:53,00:49:54,hasn't worked.
00:49:54,00:49:57,I've got to hope you get an incredibly old police officer.
00:49:57,00:50:02,"Well, there was another thing in 1967, this was a warning published in the Somerset County"
00:50:02,00:50:03,Gazette.
00:50:03,00:50:07,"A warning was given to motorists, and it was just as the breathalyzer was being introduced."
00:50:07,00:50:11,A warning was given to motorists by Somerset police this week that they should treat with
00:50:11,00:50:16,caution the suggestion that they could beat the breathalyzer by eating mashed potatoes.
00:50:16,00:50:21,You load up on mashed potato and then you fire.
00:50:21,00:50:24,"You can't, they do get tricked by certain things, so you never know."
00:50:24,00:50:28,"That's why a breathalyzer can never be admissible evidence, it just gives you enough evidence"
00:50:28,00:50:31,to take them to police station where you do a blood test.
00:50:31,00:50:37,"Like for instance, if you have a lot of acetone in your breath, then that could be just because"
00:50:37,00:50:38,you haven't eaten for a long time.
00:50:38,00:50:41,"That's if you haven't eaten for a long time, if you're diabetic, you can have acetone levels"
00:50:41,00:50:45,"a thousand times higher than normal, that can set off a breathalyzer."
00:50:45,00:50:47,So you can make all of these excuses by the on-way to the police station.
00:50:47,00:50:52,"I'm sort of picturing someone right now listening to our show, they've just been pulled over"
00:50:52,00:50:56,"and they're desperately, while the policemen's walking towards their car, listening to all"
00:50:56,00:51:00,"the advice we're giving right now, looking for pennies on the floor that says, ""We're"
00:51:00,00:51:01,"mashed potatoes in the back."""
00:51:01,00:51:05,Do you remember that fact that you guys didn't let me put in book of the year?
00:51:05,00:51:09,"A guy pulled over who was probably on drugs, more than alcohol, and the police officers"
00:51:09,00:51:12,asked him for a urine sample on the spot.
00:51:12,00:51:16,"So he went into the bush and he took ages to come back out, and then when he came out,"
00:51:16,00:51:27,he presented a semen sample and he had misheard what that said.
00:51:27,00:51:29,"Okay, that's it."
00:51:29,00:51:30,That's all of our facts.
00:51:30,00:51:31,Thank you so much for listening.
