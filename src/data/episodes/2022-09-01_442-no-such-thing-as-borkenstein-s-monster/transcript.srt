00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
 Hi everybody, just before we start this show we wanted to let you know that we are going

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,960
 to be doing a live show in London and yet also all around the world.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,160
 Anna it's impossible, you can't be in two places at once.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,400
 Oh well, let me introduce you to a little something called the Interweb.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,240
 On the 9th of September we will be doing a live podcast at Kings Place in London, but

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,200
 there are endless tickets available for you to be in a virtual audience.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,520
 Yes, we could make this the largest mass gathering of people ever.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,920
 We could. We won't, but we could.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,760
 If just one person in 12 joins this event we will have, what's that, 500 million people

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
 more at the event?

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,040
 Yeah, I think that's likely actually.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,280
 Can you imagine it?

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
 Yeah.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,720
 OK, how do you become part of the 500 million, Andy?

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
 It's so easy.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
 It's so easy.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,080
 Just go to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live and then you will be part of the greatest mass

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,160
 event in global history.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,520
 It's also going to be a really fun show.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,860
 We are going to be performing a live episode of the podcast, all your favourite characters

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,860
 are going to be there.

22
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,440
 Dan, James, Anna, Andy, Raoul who sits in the corner and hasn't said anything for 400

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
 episodes.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
 We're all going to be there.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
 He's always been my favourite though.

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
 Good old Raoul.

27
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,640
 So yeah, they always are really fun.

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
 We're really looking forward to getting back on the road and doing live shows.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
 Please join us for them at knowsuchthingasafish.com/live.

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
 OK, on with the show.

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:44,480
 Come with the podcast.

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of knowsuchthingasafish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,840
 QI offices in Covent Garden.

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,720
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,720
 again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,320
 seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,560
 Starting with fact number one and that is Andy.

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,000
 My fact is that Charles Darwin kept a pet bug so he could see how long it lasted on

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
 a meal of blood.

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,440
 Who's blood?

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,560
 So I went to Charles Darwin's house recently which is called Down House and it's amazing.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,520
 It's really great because they preserved it almost exactly as it was when he was living

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,880
 there because it was his, then it passed to his and his wife's children and then it became

45
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
 a museum.

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,080
 So they've got the chair he wrote the original species in.

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,080
 They've got all of his little experiments in the garden and there was a board up which

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,240
 said that it seemed to imply that it was his blood.

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,240
 Actually I think it was he got the bug to drink someone else's blood and then just monitored

50
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
 the bug.

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,960
 Did you just drag people off the street?

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,800
 He was on the voyage of the Beagle at the time because the voyage took years.

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,400
 You need company on that kind of thing.

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
 A pet's a good idea.

55
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
 It's a really good idea.

56
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
 Exactly.

57
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
 Do we know what this bug is by the way?

58
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
 We do.

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,600
 It's called the Vincuca now or at the time he called it the Bencuca and it's called

60
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,980
 the kissing bug or the assassin bug and it crawls all over your body and then drinks

61
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,920
 your blood.

62
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,440
 So he put it on the table and from the account he got some sailors on the boat to offer their

63
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,920
 fingers to the bug and he said that it would immediately protrude its sucker, make a charge

64
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,600
 and if allowed draw blood and then in ten minutes it went from being completely flat

65
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,960
 to being globular and that this one feast kept it fat during four whole months.

66
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
 Wow.

67
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
 Wow.

68
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
 Yeah.

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
 That's pretty good.

70
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
 Is that the one that he got Shaggers disease from?

71
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
 Yeah.

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
 Yeah.

73
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,760
 This is of all the bugs that you could keep as a pet.

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,000
 This is the one where by it's yeah it's the worst.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Mosquito.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,720
 Mosquito is bad but this is the one where it's got that longevity thing where if you

77
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,800
 get bitten by it and the sort of whatever saliva goes into your body twenty years later

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,600
 you might have heart conditions.

79
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,840
 So he had incredibly poor health for the last few decades of his life.

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,560
 Really terrible digestion and just awful health and we think it may be, it's not completely

81
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,620
 sure what it was but there's a really strong theory that it was his pet, Shaggers disease

82
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,620
 from his pet bug.

83
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,360
 And when I say Shaggers disease it's C-H-A-G-A-S, isn't it?

84
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
 Exactly.

85
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
 But it's, I pronounce it Shaggers.

86
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,860
 It's much more funny to pronounce it Shaggers disease.

87
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,900
 Cause you could go do a sex addict meeting but you thought you were going to a Shaggers

88
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,900
 disease meeting.

89
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,400
 It's just cool to say at the pub isn't it?

90
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
 Got Shaggers disease.

91
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
 Yeah.

92
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
 How did you catch it?

93
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
 Yeah.

94
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
 Off an insect.

95
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,040
 I'll be dead in a couple of years.

96
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
 Did he have a name for the pet?

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
 No.

98
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,320
 I don't think he named the pet.

99
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,820
 And again, this brings into question.

100
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
 Is it a pet?

101
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,140
 Did he take it for walks?

102
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,220
 It seems very unlikely.

103
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,900
 But a cat is a pet and you don't take that for a walk normally.

104
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,220
 Did it sit on his lap while he watched Telly?

105
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,500
 What was the age he didn't just aloofly walk away from him all the time like my cat does?

106
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 Pet.

107
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
 Exactly.

108
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
 Did it show no emotional interest?

109
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 Pet.

110
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
 It was a cat.

111
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
 Effectively he turns out he had a cat.

112
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,460
 But if he got Shaggers disease from it, it does imply that he did experiment on it himself,

113
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,460
 right?

114
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,480
 It may have been one of its many rival colleague bugs, which actually gave him the disease.

115
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,320
 But he may also have, he probably did let it, let it feed.

116
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
 He did.

117
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,120
 It was on that trips, which he wrote in his voyage of the Beagle Diary that there was

118
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,880
 a night where there was an attack of these kind of bugs where he was bitten.

119
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,280
 So I don't think it was necessarily his pet that went for him as opposed to a whole swarm

120
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,960
 in the middle of the night.

121
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
 Yeah.

122
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
 It is a really cool house.

123
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,980
 But he had his desk chair, like so many animals, evolved to meet his needs.

124
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,820
 As in it gave birth to other desk chairs, some of which died because they weren't adapted

125
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,820
 well enough to the environment.

126
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,580
 Or did he intelligently design it to change it?

127
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,560
 Oh my God, he absolutely, he actually did.

128
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,860
 He actually designed it.

129
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,860
 He, yeah.

130
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,860
 He disproved himself.

131
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,740
 It was a big comfy chair and he had a board across it so he could sit in basically a lovely

132
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,060
 big armchair, but also right.

133
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,060
 I think we said it had wheels.

134
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
 It had wheels.

135
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,060
 Office chair.

136
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,720
 They loved tampering with furniture because we've actually mentioned years ago that Erasmus

137
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,000
 Darwin, his grandfather, adjusted a table to accommodate his fat stomach, don't they?

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,320
 Yes, kind of holding it.

139
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
 Yeah.

140
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
 Well, they were part of the Wedgwood family.

141
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
 Yes.

142
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
 So they liked interiors.

143
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
 Oh yeah.

144
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
 What's that?

145
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,320
 On that side of the family?

146
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,920
 No, it was his wife, wasn't it?

147
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,840
 But I just remembered they were cousins here and his wife, so actually both sides of the

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
 family.

149
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
 Yeah.

150
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
 So you said it lasted four months, right?

151
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
 Yeah.

152
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
 And a lot of blood suckers.

153
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
 Right.

154
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,800
 But they do last a very long time, most of them, on very small amounts of blood.

155
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,320
 Well, the little blood suckers.

156
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,340
 So I think you can get lice that last like a year on one blood meal.

157
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
 Wow.

158
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
 And leeches.

159
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,340
 So we breed leeches.

160
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,380
 Actually, Wales has the world's biggest leech breeding farm for medical purposes, the vast

161
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,500
 majority of the world's leeches that are used in medicine.

162
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,420
 And they don't put that in the tourist information.

163
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
 No, no, why not?

164
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,420
 I think they should.

165
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,460
 Why did they choose the dragon as their animal?

166
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
 Leech?

167
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,460
 Dragons don't even exist.

168
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,460
 Right.

169
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,460
 Good point.

170
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
 And leech is much easier to draw.

171
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,460
 Yes.

172
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,460
 Looks a bit like a poo though.

173
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,460
 On the flag.

174
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,460
 Yeah.

175
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,460
 You don't want that to be...

176
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,120
 If you draw the serrated teeth and the slobbering fangs, I think it'll make clearer that it's

177
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
 a leech.

178
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
 Yeah.

179
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
 On the flag.

180
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
 Do you think?

181
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
 Yeah, yeah.

182
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,920
 It's like if you put eyes on a poo, it still looks like a poo, as emojis have showed us.

183
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
 That's true.

184
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,240
 I think if you've got the leech latched into a human vein.

185
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
 That's a great idea.

186
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
 Yeah.

187
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
 That's a nice logo for a country.

188
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,100
 They put the back off it so that it just keeps sucking and the blood pours out of its rectum.

189
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,100
 Why?

190
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,100
 Why is it a severed leech?

191
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,820
 Well, that's what they do with leeches, isn't it?

192
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,900
 When you have blood-sucking leeches, if you're a guy from the 16th century or something,

193
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,940
 a doctor, you put a leech on them and you cut the end off and they just keep eating,

194
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,940
 I think so.

195
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,940
 Oh, wow.

196
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,940
 Because they don't know they're full.

197
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
 I'm going off memory, so I might be completely wrong.

198
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,940
 They're not full.

199
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,940
 They're empty.

200
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,940
 You're emptying them out.

201
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,940
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

202
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,740
 That's like, you know, when people pack two cases to go on holiday, but you don't want

203
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,240
 them to go in Austin Powers, for instance, as they close and you take them out.

204
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
 Oh, I see.

205
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
 You don't cut a hole in the suitcase.

206
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
 No, no.

207
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,740
 They get pissed off about that.

208
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,840
 Wait, so could you bleed to death if you had an anus-less leech?

209
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
 No.

210
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,640
 I think your body would create enough blood.

211
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
 Okay.

212
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
 Your body has a lot of blood.

213
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
 Yeah.

214
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
 It would take a long time and a lot of leeches.

215
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
 Okay.

216
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
 Yeah.

217
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
 Still quite amazing.

218
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
 My cat, I have to feed it every day.

219
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
 Hmm.

220
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
 How long did that bug say?

221
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
 One year without a meal.

222
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,140
 Yeah, you can go one year without a meal.

223
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,980
 These leeches, they get fed sheep's blood every six months on the farm, which is not,

224
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,080
 I guess there's probably just one sheep and every six months it gets a call and is like,

225
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
 "It's your day today."

226
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
 No.

227
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
 Oh, no.

228
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
 That's all right.

229
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
 It's only twice a year.

230
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,760
 I think, do they put it in a, put a load of sheep's blood in a condom or something and

231
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,960
 then the leeches have to attach onto it?

232
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
 Yeah, maybe it's that.

233
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
 Get that on the flag.

234
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:52,160
 So, I actually haven't realized how widespread they are in plastic surgery, for instance.

235
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,700
 So, there was a survey of 50 plastic surgery units in the UK and 80% of them use leeches

236
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
 in the last five years.

237
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
 That's right.

238
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
 So, it's common in plastic surgery.

239
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
 What are they, in that scenario?

240
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,700
 What are they using them for?

241
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,860
 They shove them inside your boobs to make them bigger, just lower to loads of leeches.

242
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,860
 I didn't realize that's what I said.

243
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,860
 You can see them wriggling.

244
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
 Yeah.

245
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,860
 Yeah.

246
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
 Poshpice.

247
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,060
 They are used for, because they thin blood.

248
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,340
 So, when they latch onto you to suck your blood, they thin it out so that they can suck

249
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,340
 as much of it as possible.

250
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,980
 So, in surgery, it's very useful because often you get blood clots after surgery.

251
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,300
 And also, if you're reattaching limbs, so if your nose has fallen off and you need to

252
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,060
 have it reattached, it's quite common to use leeches to sort of connect the two bits to

253
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,380
 keep the blood flow going, otherwise your blood will just clot and then you would be

254
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,380
 able to get the blood flow.

255
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,380
 They remove it.

256
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,380
 Yeah.

257
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,900
 As it's pooling in the area, they just remove it and it means that the new capillaries form

258
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
 neatly between the two.

259
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
 Very cool.

260
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
 How amazing.

261
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
 They're amazing.

262
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,900
 Let's do some other animals that eat blood.

263
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,900
 Okay.

264
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,900
 Well, check this out, right?

265
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,900
 So, mosquitoes.

266
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,900
 They eat the blood.

267
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
 We all know that.

268
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,900
 Famously.

269
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,700
 What I didn't know is that there are midges that eat mosquitoes, so they eat the blood

270
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
 from the mosquito.

271
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
 Oh, I see.

272
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,100
 So, it's like if they're having our blood via the mosquito.

273
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,300
 Then is there a smaller little louse that's latched onto the midge?

274
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
 Possibly.

275
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
 Yeah.

276
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
 It's the opposite of a Russian doll.

277
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,420
 Because also, it's on the outside.

278
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,180
 It's out flowing, yeah, flowing out.

279
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,180
 Yeah.

280
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,180
 Yeah, that's incredible.

281
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,220
 I was hearing blood is actually incredibly, but as I thought of blood as being an ultimate

282
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
 food.

283
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220
 Yeah.

284
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,220
 Well, you are a vampire.

285
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,220
 Yeah, exactly.

286
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,220
 As in, I thought.

287
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,220
 It's a super food.

288
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,220
 It's like kale.

289
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,220
 Yeah.

290
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,140
 It's like red kale.

291
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,640
 It's strong.

292
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,660
 You know, you drink the blood to gain the life.

293
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,660
 You know, it's a life force.

294
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,160
 Auntie, this is really creepy.

295
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
 It's incredible.

296
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
 I don't know.

297
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
 People think of it that way.

298
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
 It's full of iron.

299
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
 It's full of iron.

300
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,060
 It turns out it's pretty much the worst food you can have.

301
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
 Yeah.

302
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
 It's so rubbish.

303
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,060
 So, it's incredible.

304
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,300
 It doesn't have enough B vitamins for you to survive on.

305
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,460
 So, almost everything needs B vitamins.

306
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
 And it's got none.

307
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,540
 Quite a lot of cereals have B vitamins added, don't they?

308
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,460
 So, you could put blood on your cornflakes.

309
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,460
 Yeah.

310
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,460
 Yeah.

311
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
 Yeah.

312
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,460
 Yeah.

313
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,460
 Exactly.

314
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,460
 Okay.

315
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,460
 Well, that's a good solution.

316
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,460
 You're right for the natural world.

317
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,060
 But so, red meat has a thousand times as much vitamin B12 as blood, just to put it out

318
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,060
 in context.

319
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,860
 Also, it does have loads of iron, which can be toxic.

320
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,620
 So, that's a problem as well.

321
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,620
 And leeches and ticks and lots of other blood-sucking creatures, they have to have special bacteria

322
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,700
 in their stomachs, which create B vitamins, and leeches have to have a particular issue

323
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,420
 to tie up the iron, which they're ingesting.

324
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,660
 They don't want to ingest this iron, but they've got these special chemicals in them to protect

325
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,660
 themselves from it.

326
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,220
 So, it's a terrible food.

327
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,220
 Yeah.

328
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,060
 So, there's 30,000 species, I read, that are blood suckers.

329
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,060
 Wow.

330
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,020
 And that sounds a lot, except for Andy's point, is it's really not a lot when you consider

331
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,060
 how readily available blood is for a species.

332
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,060
 And also, how many species there are.

333
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,060
 How many species there are.

334
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,140
 So, that's actually quite a limited number, which goes to your point that it's not the

335
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,140
 most practical of food.

336
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
 Okay.

337
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,260
 So, like everything, loads of carnivals eat meat, there are way more than 30,000 of those.

338
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,300
 But yeah, blood suckers, you have to be really specially evolved to do it.

339
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
 Yeah, exactly.

340
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
 Cool.

341
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,300
 So, it's not the ultimate food.

342
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,300
 Well, that's, you've exploded.

343
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
 The myth there.

344
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,540
 Do not pick that box on HelloFresh the next time you're ordering it.

345
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:21,300
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

346
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,180
 My fact this week is that the child who the book The Exorcist was based on went on to

347
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,540
 become a NASA engineer whose inventions contributed to the Apollo moon missions.

348
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,540
 So cool.

349
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,740
 So, are you saying that actually they levitated all the way to the moon?

350
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,740
 Yes.

351
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
 Fuck you.

352
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,120
 Propelled by vomit coming out from the astronauts.

353
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
 Yeah.

354
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,980
 So, the author of The Exorcist, the novel William Blatty, he based it on a true life

355
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,980
 story.

356
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,460
 And it was in 1949 in St. Louis, Missouri.

357
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,340
 And it was the story of a kid who we've known as Roland Doe.

358
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,700
 No one's known who he is.

359
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,180
 Then it gets revealed an engineer from NASA who's called Ronald Edwin Hunkler.

360
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,220
 He in fact was the boy.

361
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,620
 And that the other name was a pseudonym.

362
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,540
 And all along, people within NASA, you know, close friends knew this, but he never wanted

363
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,260
 to tell anyone because he found it an extraordinarily embarrassing thing.

364
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,460
 So he was someone who worked at NASA, who was part of the Apollo missions.

365
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,300
 As I just said, he also had a few patents with them.

366
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,700
 He made these ceramics that you put on the outside of rockets.

367
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,700
 Cool.

368
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,700
 That's awesome.

369
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,460
 No, it's like a special ceramic plates.

370
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,140
 And I think when there was a crash or a problem recently, they blamed it on the ceramic plates.

371
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
 People might remember that.

372
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,380
 He messed it up.

373
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
 No, no, no.

374
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,540
 That was a different issue.

375
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,500
 But he invented this thing, which was like foamed ceramics, where you would like make

376
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,260
 a slurry of different materials.

377
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,140
 And then you would wait for it to bubble up and then you put it into the oven and it

378
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,300
 would bake and it would be really heat resistant.

379
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,300
 Wow.

380
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,300
 And he invented those things.

381
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
 So cool.

382
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,060
 We should say that obviously the exorcist of the film is Reagan the girl.

383
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,760
 So I don't know at what point it changed.

384
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,260
 Was it in the book that it was a girl as well?

385
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,260
 Yeah.

386
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,260
 When did it change from a boy to a girl?

387
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,260
 I don't know actually.

388
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,260
 I think in the book it was a girl.

389
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,260
 Yes.

390
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,260
 In the book it was a girl.

391
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,260
 Yeah.

392
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
 And then he changed it.

393
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,260
 What was the name?

394
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,260
 Blathe?

395
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,260
 Yeah.

396
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
 He changed it because it was a way of masking what had gone on.

397
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,500
 But it was very, the original case sounds extremely spooky, which you wouldn't think

398
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
 it.

399
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
 He did it.

400
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
 No.

401
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
 It was absolutely terrifying.

402
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 Yeah.

403
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
 He was born in 1935, this boy.

404
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,500
 Don't open with that.

405
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,820
 Well, the case of the thing like hearing scratching noises from his bedroom walls and the family

406
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,060
 minister wrote to a parapsychology lab at Duke University when the boy was 14 years

407
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,060
 old in 1949.

408
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,340
 And said that his bed shook when he was in it.

409
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,340
 Oh, come on.

410
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
 No, stop.

411
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,020
 He could have had shaggers disease.

412
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,740
 He was 14.

413
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:02,020
 And then a picture of Christ on the wall shook when he was nearby and the image itself

414
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
 was spooky.

415
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,340
 He did live in an earthquake-prone place.

416
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,780
 I can't believe they're the things you're picking out at spooky.

417
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
 So many mad things happened.

418
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,780
 Okay.

419
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,780
 So the details from the story that we know are based on basically this diary by Father

420
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,780
 Raymond Bishop.

421
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,460
 So there were a few priests who rocked up to try and help out with the exorcism and Father

422
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,980
 Raymond Bishop was one of them very confusing, not a bishop, a priest called Bishop.

423
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,980
 Oh, clever.

424
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,180
 But I mean, name yourself for the job you want.

425
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,180
 Yeah.

426
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,180
 Okay.

427
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,180
 Yeah.

428
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
 He's working his way out.

429
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,180
 My local priest in Bolton is called a pastor.

430
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,180
 No.

431
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,140
 He should have started an Italian restaurant though.

432
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,740
 He replaced someone called Father McVicar.

433
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,740
 No.

434
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,740
 Yeah.

435
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:52,340
 That's the man who was voted on in an internet poll, wasn't it?

436
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,340
 Make a face.

437
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,940
 Anyway, Bishop McBishopface wrote this diary about all the stuff that happened, which is

438
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,820
 part of the reason why we're somewhat skeptical about the facts of the exorcist because he

439
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,620
 didn't come on a little bit later.

440
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,380
 So he was using what he'd been told by the family and the other priest who had been involved

441
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,380
 earlier on.

442
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,380
 But some of the things he said are kind of amusing.

443
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,020
 So there was apparently once there was a question of the time of departure from the house and

444
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,660
 suddenly the word Saturday appeared written on the boy's hip.

445
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,020
 So I guess the devil's like, you know, get leave on Saturday.

446
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,980
 There was, for instance, his desk at school used to move independently of him.

447
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,980
 It's very hard to fake that.

448
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:33,060
 It's not like it's not like all these, wow, independently of anyone that just moved.

449
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
 Okay.

450
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,740
 Can we just clarify please that obviously we know it's all lies.

451
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
 I'm not saying it's true.

452
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,540
 I'm just saying some of the claims that were made about what happened.

453
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,540
 Yeah.

454
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
 You couldn't say a boy had done it.

455
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,540
 What I didn't believe was the priest wrote down.

456
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,060
 But so what are you saying did it then?

457
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
 It's just lies.

458
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,060
 Oh, God.

459
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,060
 It made it made up.

460
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,060
 It made up, he said.

461
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,300
 But he said he'd left school out of embarrassment that his desk was moving.

462
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,220
 Now I think if I was a school child and my desk moved independently, you'd be the coolest

463
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,220
 kid in school.

464
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
 Yeah.

465
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
 That's not embarrassing, is it?

466
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,900
 Oh, children are very quick to find a point of difference, aren't they?

467
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,900
 Yeah.

468
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,700
 If you're ready and then your desk started moving, that's not going to help you become

469
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
 cool.

470
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,540
 I can picture what would have happened if I had been possessed by a demon at school.

471
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,540
 Wouldn't have helped.

472
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,540
 Right.

473
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,540
 Good to know.

474
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,540
 No.

475
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,480
 This guy, Hunkler, the exorcism boy I think growing up, he always apparently went out

476
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
 on Halloween.

477
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
 Okay.

478
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,860
 Because he was worried that someone would find him.

479
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,860
 On Halloween.

480
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,420
 Oh, I see.

481
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,620
 Not because he was worried the demons would come back just because.

482
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,620
 Right.

483
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,620
 Yeah.

484
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,620
 Yeah.

485
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,620
 He seemed to be very paranoid about being found out for being this boy.

486
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,620
 Yeah.

487
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,620
 He was really terrified to ruin his life a bit.

488
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,620
 Yeah.

489
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,980
 It's because the book sold 13 million copies in America alone.

490
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:44,060
 But using a fictional plotline with a girl, he was nicely hidden, but I guess someone

491
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,060
 would have known, right?

492
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,060
 They would have known where he lives.

493
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,060
 I think some people he worked with knew.

494
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,060
 Yeah.

495
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,060
 Like people did know.

496
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,060
 Yeah, that's true.

497
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,740
 I reckon it was an open secret in the area.

498
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,820
 Yeah, definitely.

499
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,540
 In the newspaper reports around the time, this is from the Baltimore Evening Sun from 1949,

500
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:05,540
 they said that it took 20 to 30 exorcisms to get rid of the demon and that at the end

501
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:11,420
 of each one, the child would have a tantrum and voice scraps of Latin and that a boy once

502
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,940
 sat in a chair and it tipped over.

503
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,740
 That was evidence that he had a demon.

504
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,740
 Yeah.

505
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,500
 But he did say that local families were sprinkling holy water around his house because they'd

506
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,420
 heard about this demon possession and everyone would go around and put holy water there.

507
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,420
 That's a no.

508
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,420
 You've got to get really good coverage though with that.

509
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,980
 Holy water doesn't come in big quantities.

510
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,980
 No.

511
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
 You can't put it in a hosepipe.

512
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,980
 Yeah.

513
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,460
 It's not like putting it down vinegar to deter a fox where you can just slosh it about.

514
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,620
 Couldn't you just get a big vat of water and get a priest to bless it?

515
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
 To bless it.

516
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,620
 Does it then all become holy?

517
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,620
 Yeah, it's not.

518
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,620
 Why don't we just bless all the water then?

519
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,900
 As in if this works, which I'm not saying it does, why not just bless the...

520
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,780
 Send a priest to the Pacific Ocean and just...

521
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,780
 Exactly.

522
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
 Bless that.

523
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,780
 And then we'll have a thing.

524
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,500
 Basically, you're going to have to do this.

525
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,220
 Go to Lutz, buy up all the holy water, drink it all, piss it out, get it back into the

526
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,660
 water cycle and then some of it will be...

527
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
 It stays holy.

528
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,540
 Yeah, it'll be like one or two bits of it will be in every glass of water you ever drink.

529
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,140
 We'll have a little bit of holy water in it.

530
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,140
 That's a good idea.

531
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,140
 That's exciting.

532
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,140
 Yeah.

533
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,140
 Presumably that's true already.

534
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,140
 You know, the holy water has been part of the water cycle, hasn't it?

535
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,140
 How long does it stay holy?

536
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,140
 How long does it stay holy?

537
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,140
 And piss it out?

538
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,140
 It's been sprinkled on people.

539
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
 It evaporates.

540
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,140
 It goes up into the clouds.

541
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,140
 It's in the seas.

542
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,140
 All water is holy, I think.

543
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,140
 Great.

544
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,140
 There we go.

545
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,260
 Possessions have dropped off, haven't they?

546
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,140
 Well, some local families, like I say, they sprinkled water around this house, but there

548
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,740
 was one family that didn't believe any of it and they invited him to stay with them

549
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,540
 and said, "Okay, we'll see if you're really possessed."

550
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:43,500
 And they reported that his bed shook and bumped in the night and they became believers, according

551
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,260
 to the Baltimore evening sun.

552
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,500
 One of the other symptoms, according to the priests who were there, and this one you could

553
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,700
 fake, probably, if you're talented, is that apparently during possessions, several times

554
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,700
 there was the passing of wind through his rectum.

555
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,820
 Well, one thing I noticed, because I looked at all of his patents, one of his patents

556
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,660
 is for gaseous flow purging in thermal blanket cleaning.

557
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,540
 So his patents was about gaseous flow and while he was possessed, he also had gaseous flow.

558
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,820
 And I read through every single patent that he did, and that was the only link I could

559
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,820
 find to the existence.

560
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:27,580
 It just seems to be a teenage boy farting and shaking the bed through unknown mechanisms.

561
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:34,580
 I bet he needed some thermal blanket cleaning after the...

562
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:41,660
 In the film, there was a lot of chat that maybe the filming itself was haunted, because

563
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,220
 for example, the climactic exorcism scene, when they were filming it, it had to be delayed

564
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,220
 because a pigeon flew into a light box and the set burned down.

565
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,220
 The set burned down?

566
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,220
 Yeah.

567
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,220
 The set burned down.

568
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,780
 Well, a pigeon, the pigeon I imagine, the light box is very hot.

569
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,780
 Yeah, no, no.

570
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,100
 We understand why, but I feel like that's a big story.

571
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,420
 Well, the thing is, the director, William Freakin, claimed that a winged creature with

572
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,700
 talons had been responsible for this f***ing...

573
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,700
 He was freaking out.

574
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,700
 Oh, God.

575
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,100
 It was responsible for it, so I think he was sexing up.

576
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
 Yeah.

577
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
 Yeah.

578
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
 The pigeon.

579
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
 Spooky.

580
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,420
 There's officially three Exorcist movies, so the first one was based on the novel, and

581
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,700
 then the second one, Blatty went off, and they just made...

582
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,340
 They wrote a sequel and they put that out.

583
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,340
 Exorcist 3...

584
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,340
 So, sorry.

585
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,340
 The famous one is the first one.

586
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,340
 Famous one is the first one.

587
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,340
 Yeah, okay.

588
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
 And then there's the sequel.

589
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,860
 Yeah, then there's the sequel, and then there's Exorcist 3, which Blatty himself wrote and

590
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,940
 directed, so he came back for the third one.

591
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
 Oh.

592
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
 But...

593
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
 The novelist, right.

594
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,820
 He worked in film, generally, anyway, but so he also wrote novels, and he wanted to

595
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,980
 make his novel, which was called Legion, into a movie.

596
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,980
 Okay.

597
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,420
 And I think when they were funding it, something went round where they sort of said, "It's

598
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,420
 not going to happen.

599
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,140
 What if we call it Exorcist 3?"

600
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,140
 So it was named Exorcist 3, so he was directing it, directing the whole movie.

601
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,700
 They'd done the whole production, and then during the production, someone noticed that,

602
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,100
 "Hang on, there's no Exorcisms in this movie whatsoever.

603
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
 What's going on?"

604
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,540
 And so the money people came and said, "What are you doing?

605
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,540
 Why is this called this?"

606
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,060
 He said, "Well, it's actually based on my novel, Legion, which doesn't have any Exorcisms

607
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,060
 in it."

608
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:26,060
 So they ended up making him re-film the entire last third of the movie at costs of $4 million

609
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,460
 just so they could introduce some random new father character who could perform an Exorcism

610
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,460
 in the movie.

611
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,460
 No.

612
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,620
 To me, that seems reasonable if they're calling it Exorcist 3.

613
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,620
 Absolutely.

614
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,620
 Yeah.

615
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,620
 It's either that or change the name.

616
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,620
 Yeah.

617
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,620
 Exactly.

618
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,620
 What was Legion about?

619
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,620
 Did it fit with the plot?

620
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,620
 I actually don't know.

621
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,620
 Yeah, but...

622
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,620
 Was it like a Roman army?

623
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,620
 Halfway through.

624
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,620
 Yeah.

625
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,620
 Veedy, veedy.

626
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,620
 What was that?

627
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,620
 They're all speaking Latin all the way through, it's incredibly scary.

628
00:22:52,620 --> 00:23:01,660
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna.

629
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:09,100
 My fact this week is that plants remember droughts and they like it.

630
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
 They like it.

631
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,580
 They like it because it's useful to them.

632
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:17,560
 How is it useful for them because they can't go somewhere, let's move next to that river.

633
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,700
 They can't, they haven't went out to buy plane tickets to wet places yet.

634
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,260
 What you can do is you can take action as a plant.

635
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,700
 So this is kind of an amazing discovery about plants because it kind of taps into something

636
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,620
 that we thought they were not capable of doing at all, which is more of an animal feature.

637
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,740
 How it works is let's say you take a plant that has undergone a really bad drought and

638
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,020
 then you take a plant that didn't undergo a really bad drought and then you subject them

639
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,360
 both to a bad drought the following year.

640
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,180
 The plant that underwent the bad drought is going to have learned to deal with it and

641
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,260
 it can do clever things like it cannot open, it's paused as much so it doesn't lose as

642
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
 much water.

643
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,980
 It can do clever things to conserve water to make it less shit.

644
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:05,660
 These technical words, they're just shit, that's what they said in the paper.

645
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,660
 It's very clever.

646
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,140
 So they make a molecule which is called the GABA molecule which acts like a memory.

647
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,700
 So they make more of this molecule when it's droughty and that molecule is what tells it

648
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,300
 next time to do things like not open, it's paused so it doesn't lose water and the unbelievable

649
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,340
 thing about this which I think is maybe even more amazing is that it's sort of deposited

650
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,740
 on their genes, this learning process.

651
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:33,580
 So it's epigenetics, you know, when, it's basically the opposite of Darwinism.

652
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,140
 It's like you're not just getting your genes from your parents.

653
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,100
 You're learning something and then that goes into your genes and then you can pass it on.

654
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
 Wow.

655
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,100
 I feel a bit challenged actually.

656
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,660
 It feels a bit pointed that Anna's brought up this anti-dharmonistic thing.

657
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,660
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

658
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,660
 Just Lamarcus almost.

659
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,660
 Yeah.

660
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,660
 Yeah.

661
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
 So thanks a lot, Anna.

662
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
 I'm not wishing your favourite.

663
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,660
 You know the amazing thing about it.

664
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,660
 Awesome.

665
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,660
 Sorry, I've just got one specifically on that.

666
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,700
 You just said this thing was called GABA, the molecule.

667
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,220
 GABA is also an acronym for a very dry place.

668
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,780
 It's a cricket ground in Australia for GABA.

669
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,060
 Well, it's in Australia.

670
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,940
 So the GABA is a slang term, Aussie slang term, which stands for the Great Australian

671
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
 Bugger All.

672
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
 Oh, yeah.

673
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,780
 And it's the sort of ultra outbacky, really, really dry bit of Australia.

674
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,780
 There we go.

675
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,780
 We've completed the circle.

676
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,940
 It's one of the first facts I ever learned at QI.

677
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,940
 Is it?

678
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,940
 Interesting.

679
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
 Yeah.

680
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,500
 GABA actually stands in this case for Gamma Amino Butyric Acid.

681
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 Oh.

682
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,380
 But the really interesting thing about it is that it's the same molecule that's used

683
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,980
 in mammals and in other animals to signal messages between your body.

684
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,740
 So through your nervous system, you also use GABA, and these plants are using the same

685
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,740
 thing.

686
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
 Wow.

687
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,740
 That's amazing.

688
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,740
 That's cool.

689
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,740
 Yeah.

690
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
 So we all contain GABA?

691
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
 We're all contain.

692
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,740
 We're all contain.

693
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,740
 Some of us more than others.

694
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,020
 Yeah, there's quite a lot of stuff over the last kind of ten years, if you start reading

695
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,420
 about plant that looks into the idea of plant consciousness being a thing, not the same

696
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,660
 way that humans have it, but investigating whether we've underestimated that.

697
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,660
 And I think people didn't want to think about it for ages because of this thing that I'd

698
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:15,220
 never heard of actually, but this guy called Trofim Lysenko, who's this Soviet guy.

699
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:23,140
 So basically, he thought the plants had memories, and he turned out to be a real piece of shit.

700
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,100
 So people don't like to copy him.

701
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,820
 So there are some grains that are stimulated by cold weather to know to then grow in spring.

702
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,820
 Oh, right.

703
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,540
 But he realized that if he subjected those grains to just cold temperatures, he could

704
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,780
 trick them into thinking that it had been winter, and then they'd remember that, and

705
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,940
 then they'd grow in what they thought was spring a few months later.

706
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,180
 So he said, plants have got memories.

707
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,180
 Great.

708
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,580
 Does that mean double harvests?

709
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
 That means double harvests.

710
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
 Exactly.

711
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,420
 So he was like, this is going to transform the Soviet Union.

712
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,820
 Oh my God, I am going to make it go so well.

713
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,100
 And as many of us know, the Soviet Union did not go that well in a harvest sense.

714
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
 But he didn't sound like a piece of shit so far.

715
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
 Right.

716
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,700
 Sounds like a good guy so far, trying to get some extra harvests in.

717
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
 No.

718
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
 I agree.

719
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,700
 Maybe his intentions were good at some point.

720
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,420
 So he came up with some really dodgy scientific conclusions, which were completely incorrect

721
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,940
 and forced loads of farmers to plant specific grains at specific times.

722
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
 It didn't work.

723
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,460
 And it's really responsible for a lot of the famines of the 40s and 50s in the Soviet

724
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
 Union.

725
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,420
 And, you know, he's possibly responsible for millions of deaths.

726
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,260
 The whole plant consciousness is obviously a giant pseudoscience, which has been around

727
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,260
 since the late 60s.

728
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,620
 There was a book that was called The Secret Life of Plants, which came out, which was

729
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,780
 a number one bestseller globally.

730
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,020
 And it had all of these big claims about what plants were able to do.

731
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,140
 And so a guy called Cleave Baxter was the main guy behind it.

732
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,780
 He was a CIA polygraph guy who kind of made...

733
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,780
 Oh no.

734
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,780
 It was an extraordinary story.

735
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,660
 And it kind of the reason people talk to plants these days, kind of is rooted back to him.

736
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,340
 These days, there's an amazing woman in Australia who's called Monica Gagliano.

737
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,500
 And she's leading a lot in bioacoustics, which is looking at plants and how sound might be

738
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,980
 something that they can pick up as well.

739
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,540
 Many scientists, obviously hugely skeptical, but she works for a university in Sydney and

740
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:14,940
 she's publishing reports that let's say, for example, you played the sound of water and

741
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,780
 it was a recording of water.

742
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,340
 The roots would grow towards it.

743
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,620
 We should say Gagliano is not the kind of pseudoscience of the 70s book.

744
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,620
 She is a legitimate...

745
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,820
 She's a legitimate scientist, but she makes huge claims.

746
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,260
 She wrote a book called Thus Spoke the Plant, which she says she co-wrote with plants, speaking

747
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,260
 to the plants.

748
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,900
 Not metaphorically, literally.

749
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,420
 Did she share the royalties?

750
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,420
 Possibly.

751
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,900
 I bet she does, in some way.

752
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,900
 Give it to her.

753
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
 I do.

754
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,900
 That looks after plants.

755
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,340
 Because, yes, she has done experiments which are very surprising.

756
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:48,820
 She did that thing where if you drop certain plants, then they will close up to try and

757
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
 protect themselves.

758
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,980
 And so she created actually this really cool thing, which you use to drop a plant, which

759
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,860
 you know when you're at a fairground and you sit on one of those benches, it carries you

760
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,740
 up a pole, a vertical pole, then it drops you down again.

761
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,140
 She made that for plants and she realised that if you drop them enough times, they stop

762
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,140
 closing up.

763
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,140
 Because they learn.

764
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,140
 Because they learn that it's not going to do them any harm.

765
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,180
 And she says that it can then remember that lesson for a month.

766
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:19,980
 You can modify plants to make them drought-proof, as you can GM tweak them, basically.

767
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,220
 So this is something that was done in 2018.

768
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,300
 This tweaked a single gene in tobacco plants, which means they lose, I think it was a quarter

769
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,660
 less water.

770
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:34,380
 And it's because they have these pores, right, which they normally open up and close in response

771
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
 to daylight.

772
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,660
 So that's what triggers it.

773
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,180
 So when the pores are open, they suck in carbon dioxide, but they also lose water.

774
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,260
 So the carbon dioxide is necessary for photosynthesis, but losing water is obviously a bad thing

775
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,100
 if you're in a time of drought.

776
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,940
 So in the GM version of these plants, they open for a briefer spell, is go whoop, and

777
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,980
 then close up again.

778
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:00,740
 So the good thing is, they can still get enough carbon dioxide in to do all the photosynthesis

779
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,620
 they need, but they lose a quarter less water.

780
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,620
 You will have a plant that is way more resistant to dry weather.

781
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,620
 Clever.

782
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,620
 It's so clever.

783
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,380
 Why do we need all this tobacco?

784
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,580
 That's a great point.

785
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,260
 I suppose they hope it can be done eventually with other, more useful plants.

786
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,460
 Yeah, yeah, we're not just all going to have to just literally be smoking 20 a day.

787
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,500
 But we will, if we smoke 20 a day, we will need less food.

788
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,820
 So we'll have to grow less wheat.

789
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,380
 So actually, right, it's some real product.

790
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,300
 In 1933, yo-yos were banned in Syria because they thought they were causing droughts.

791
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,300
 Right.

792
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,300
 Yeah, I read that.

793
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,300
 Was there a logic to that?

794
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
 Yeah.

795
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,900
 There was an Ulaama who were like religious heads, and they petitioned the Prime Minister

796
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,020
 of Syria and said that the yo-yo was responsible for the drought that they were having at the

797
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:55,140
 time because the up-and-down movement was counteracting their prayers.

798
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,260
 And so they banned it, and the next day it rained.

799
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,320
 There we go.

800
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,300
 But anyway, there was an article in the New York Times at the time, and they spoke about

801
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,540
 whether this could be true or not, and they said, "Well, London at the moment is full

802
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,420
 of yo-yos, and it rains there all the time."

803
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,700
 That was their evidence.

804
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,200
 That's counter-evidence.

805
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
 Yeah.

806
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,100
 James, do you have a view as a golf fan on what I think you know is coming?

807
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:25,740
 The fact that in droughts, golf courses are very often exempt.

808
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,020
 The UK, in Australia, and it's on health at the moment.

809
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,020
 This is a huge deal.

810
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,340
 In France, they're going and pouring concrete and stuff into golf holes on golf courses.

811
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,900
 Which is the most pointless thing, because they change the golf hole every single day.

812
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,900
 Like on a golf course, if you go onto a green, the hole is in a certain place.

813
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,340
 Every day, they fill it in, and they put it in a different place.

814
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,340
 You had me.

815
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,340
 I had never heard of that.

816
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
 Because it's part of the game.

817
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,500
 Because people play every day, right?

818
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,580
 And so it would be boring if it was always in the same place.

819
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,940
 Oh yeah, that's the thing that makes it boring.

820
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,660
 People are coming in filling in these holes, which are literally about to be filled in

821
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,660
 anyway.

822
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,660
 They're doing their job for them.

823
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,660
 Yeah.

824
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,660
 Maybe they're doing it to help them out.

825
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,660
 Well, that's very funny.

826
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,380
 I don't remember how far, like, three centimetres to the left.

827
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,220
 It might be as little as that.

828
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,620
 It tends to be, like, another part of the green, like, with a different slope.

829
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,660
 Do golfers claim, "Oh, I would have got it if I'd been here yesterday, and I was playing

830
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,100
 actually to yesterday's hole?"

831
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,260
 Yeah, actually, when you play golf, you can see where the old hole was, because it never

832
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,260
 quite bends.

833
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
 Right.

834
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,740
 And so often, you'll hit a ball, and you're nowhere near the actual hole, but you're right

835
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
 next to where it was.

836
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,740
 A few days ago.

837
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,340
 Can you get, like, a half point for that?

838
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,340
 No half points.

839
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,060
 It's not a points game, is it?

840
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,060
 Well, yeah, shots.

841
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,060
 Yeah, shots.

842
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

843
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,060
 But, yeah.

844
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:44,020
 Well, I think we've all learned something very interesting about this, but, yeah, they

845
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,620
 are exempt, and they're exempt according to Southern Water, because this is happening

846
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,620
 at the moment in the UK.

847
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,780
 There have been a few hosepipe bands in certain areas.

848
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,660
 Southern Water wrote on their website that, "On health and safety grounds, golf courses

849
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
 are exempt."

850
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,660
 Oh, great.

851
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,180
 I mean, no, I'd rather think if I'm not allowed to use a hosepipe on my garden, probably

852
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,580
 you shouldn't be allowed on golf course.

853
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,980
 Probably I would use more on a golf course.

854
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:11,100
 But perhaps there are reasons, like, because it gets people doing healthy things.

855
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,580
 Maybe as there are other exemptions on tennis courts, for instance, and on the sporting

856
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,580
 field.

857
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,740
 I've got data on this.

858
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,420
 My local bowls club lawn is looking very green indeed.

859
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,500
 I would imagine probably they, for all sporting and health events, they probably have an exemption

860
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
 right now.

861
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
 They don't.

862
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,500
 Yeah, I guess golf courses are just the big grassy ones, aren't they, so that's probably

863
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,700
 the ones that get all the attention.

864
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,980
 Those bowls are sort of smaller, you know, although it's probably less healthy as well.

865
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,580
 I mean, bowls doesn't do much good for you.

866
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,260
 I remember once reading that it was the most dangerous sport that you can do, and that's

867
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,060
 because 90-year-olds do it.

868
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,580
 And if you look at the number of deaths.

869
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,740
 Huge fatality, right?

870
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,740
 Yeah.

871
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,420
 Well, I was looking, sorry, just on golf courses.

872
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,580
 If you did want to know what your golf course was, I was looking at advice on restoring courses

873
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,260
 after drought on some golf website, and apparently it said, "Make sure that all dead grass plants

874
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,500
 are removed by scaring or tickle harrowing the turf."

875
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
 Tickle harrowing.

876
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
 Tickle harrowing.

877
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,340
 That's quite a good word for something, isn't it, if you've had a harrowing experience,

878
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
 but not very harrowing.

879
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,340
 It was a bit tickle harrowing.

880
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,340
 Yeah.

881
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:12,940
 I'm just watching the Exorcist, you know.

882
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,540
 I'm sorry, I cannot get over that they change the golf hole every day, I absolutely blown

883
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,540
 my mind.

884
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,780
 And I think listeners at home are in my position right now, going, "Why are they talking about

885
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,340
 anything else that is astonishing?"

886
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,220
 Certainly anyone who plays golf, or has ever played golf, or ever watched golf on television

887
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,220
 would know that.

888
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,420
 Watching it on TV, you wouldn't notice the next day.

889
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,380
 I mean, they talk about it all the time.

890
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,140
 There's very little else to talk about.

891
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,820
 Are there any rogue hole places who put it right on the edge of the green?

892
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,700
 That's kind of the point.

893
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,460
 Let's say, for instance, there's a green, right, it's got lots of slopes on it.

894
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,180
 One of the slopes goes right down into some water, right?

895
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,700
 If you put the hole right next to that slope, then it really changes where you aim, because

896
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,500
 you're not going to aim to the side of it where the water is, right?

897
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,540
 Or you can put it 20 yards further, so you have to use a different golf club to reach

898
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,300
 it on the next time, or you put it next to a bunker.

899
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,460
 Why not do it so that there is no flag?

900
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,980
 So all you do is, when you arrive, and this is for professionals, when you arrive, you

901
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,380
 have the data of the previous month's hole positions.

902
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,380
 Yeah.

903
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,300
 I mean, that pretty much happens what you're talking about.

904
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,740
 So the week before a major championship, all the caddies will walk around and look at all

905
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,340
 the possible places where the hole could be, where it's been in previous years, where it's

906
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,580
 been on the Thursday and Friday on a Saturday and Sunday, and they kind of know more or less

907
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,580
 where it's going to be.

908
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,980
 And then on the morning, they all get a little booklet that tells you exactly where the hole

909
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:40,420
 is on each of the 18 holes, and it'll be like 17 yards on and 8 yards from the left or whatever.

910
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,140
 And that's every morning they get that.

911
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,140
 OK.

912
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,660
 I found a way of being less interested in golf than I was before, which was a really fascinating

913
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,340
 chart I think I've had in eight years of this podcast.

914
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
 Oh, God.

915
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
 Thank you, guys.

916
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
 One more question.

917
00:35:53,340 --> 00:36:03,420
 One more question. So let's say a master's is happening, and they go and they sus out

918
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,880
 where the holes have been previously.

919
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,420
 Is there a kind of thing where you go home and let's say Greg Norman and watch golf

920
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,420
 for a while?

921
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,740
 Greg Norman is definitely haven't, if you're talking about Greg Norman and the master's

922
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,140
 but anyway, carry on.

923
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,620
 Is there a simulation thing where they can place the ball in a virtual reality kind of

924
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,180
 simulation so they can test with knowing what the wind speeds will be the next day and so

925
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
 on?

926
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
 Sure.

927
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:30,300
 You have simulated golf, and you can simulate wind for short, you can simulate pin positions.

928
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,220
 Whether anyone actually does that, I doubt.

929
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
 But it's not impossible.

930
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,420
 Dan, I cannot believe you fought tooth and nail, even when we were saying shut up for

931
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,420
 that question.

932
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
 That was so boring, Dan.

933
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
 Are you kidding me?

934
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,420
 That was so boring.

935
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,420
 OK, kill it.

936
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,420
 Dan, you and I will do our own special podcast afterwards when you ask me all the questions

937
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,900
 that no one ever wanted to know about golf.

938
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:56,740
 It's going to be a hit, clump fish, new show coming, very fish.

939
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:05,780
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

940
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:17,620
 OK, my fact this week is that when you play golf, is that in 2017 there was a house party

941
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:25,540
 in Maryland that was so boozy the ambient air in the building tested positive on a breathalyzer?

942
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,940
 I'm just excited that everyone from the US is going to switch off because you just said

943
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,940
 Maryland.

944
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,940
 Maryland.

945
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,940
 It's just Maryland.

946
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,940
 That's just how it is.

947
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,620
 But Maryland, I can see in a, probably, in a Bolton accent.

948
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,620
 In a Bolton accent, yeah.

949
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,780
 Well, this feels like shit for the golf chat.

950
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
 Sorry.

951
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,780
 Sorry.

952
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,460
 This feels like the non-meat of the fact, given that the building tested positive on

953
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,460
 a breathalyzer.

954
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,460
 I mean, that was the funny thing.

955
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,460
 It's incredible.

956
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:54,940
 So, yeah, this was a party, like a frat party kind of thing, advertised online as Tequila

957
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,740
 Tuesday.

958
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,380
 Loads of neighbors complained that it was so loud, and so the police turned up and it

959
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,220
 turned out that as well as being beer cans and spilled alcohol and lots of possibly underage

960
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,540
 people drinking, they also did a breathalyzer on lots of people, but they did it inside

961
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,340
 the house and it registered .01.

962
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,420
 So it wouldn't be legally drunk, but it showed up on the breathalyzer.

963
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,620
 So it would be able to drive.

964
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,620
 It would be able to drive.

965
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,260
 The building would be able to drive.

966
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,780
 But the reason that this is kind of interesting, I think, is that some breathalysers, they

967
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:33,940
 work by taking the ambient air and then they compare your breath to what the air is.

968
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,100
 And so, like, if you're outside, if you've been driving and then they stop you, they're

969
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,340
 testing against the air, you know, around the road, that's one thing.

970
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:46,460
 But if they're testing against air, which is already also drunk, then there could be

971
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,460
 a problem that you are.

972
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
 That's really funny.

973
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,100
 So if you could sort of hot-box your car with alcohol air, make sure they test that.

974
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:59,100
 If you are drink-driving right now, quickly pour vodka all over your car and waft up

975
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,300
 the air-conditioning, get it going, and you'll be fine.

976
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
 Yeah.

977
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,300
 Smart.

978
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,300
 We're not condoning drink-driving in any way.

979
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,300
 Absolutely.

980
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,500
 I think we are, based on this research.

981
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,500
 Blimey.

982
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,580
 I really like the fact that the breathalyzer was, first of all, the drunkometer.

983
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,580
 Yeah.

984
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,140
 It's a much funnier and better name.

985
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,140
 Yeah.

986
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,140
 That was an early version of it.

987
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,140
 Yeah.

988
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,140
 It was like 30, isn't it?

989
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
 In the '60s, even, they were still calling it the drunkometer.

990
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,300
 It was a standard phrase.

991
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,300
 Or sometimes, the alchometer.

992
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,300
 It was about 30, as they called it that.

993
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,300
 I don't know why they changed it.

994
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,300
 Intoximeter.

995
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,300
 Intoximeter, as well.

996
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,300
 It's hard to say.

997
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
 It's hard to say.

998
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,300
 It's a test, actually.

999
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,780
 If you can't pronounce it, you'll find the drive.

1000
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1001
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,320
 But the drunkometer was a different thing than the breathalyzer we use today.

1002
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,100
 And I love that the breathalyzer itself was invented by a guy called Robert Frank Borkenstein.

1003
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
 It's amazing.

1004
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,540
 Frank Borkenstein is such a great name.

1005
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540
 Yeah.

1006
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,540
 Yeah.

1007
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,040
 In Canada, it's sometimes called the Borkenstein, or it used to be, like the breathalyzer was

1008
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,180
 known as a Borkenstein.

1009
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,180
 Oh.

1010
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,180
 Of course, Borkenstein was the name of the doctor.

1011
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,220
 You should call it Borkenstein's monster.

1012
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,240
 He really changed things a lot, Borkenstein, because in 1954, he invented it.

1013
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,840
 And before him, the drunkometer could tell the presence of alcohol, but it couldn't

1014
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,780
 tell the quantity of alcohol, couldn't measure it precisely.

1015
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,780
 And so before him, a defense lawyer, if someone was on a charge of drink driving, a defense

1016
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,980
 lawyer might say, "Oh, my client was working for very long hours," and his eyes are red

1017
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,500
 because he's got allergies.

1018
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,260
 And I've got friends of his racked up who will all swear blind that he only had two

1019
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,260
 beers on the night.

1020
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:31,540
 And so he wasn't drink driving, and it was incredible, just so hard to prove, whereas

1021
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,720
 Borkenstein absolutely changed that.

1022
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
 He did.

1023
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
 He liked to drink himself, though.

1024
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,720
 Oh, yeah.

1025
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,280
 If you look at any obituaries, they're not very euphemistic about it.

1026
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
 Really?

1027
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,600
 Was he lending it as a competitive thing, like he would score highest on my breathalyzer?

1028
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,260
 In The Guardian, it says, "He was a genial fellow who enjoyed serving drinks to his friends

1029
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,640
 and exhibited a Catholic taste in wines and spirits."

1030
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,640
 But he was a really great guy.

1031
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:03,460
 When he was a child, he built a robot, which worked, like when he was at school.

1032
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:09,180
 In World War II, they had bombs, which held them before they were released, but they needed

1033
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,740
 to be spot checked, and he invented a new way of spot checking them, which made it way,

1034
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,740
 way easier.

1035
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,340
 So it helped the war effort in that way.

1036
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,340
 Nice.

1037
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,340
 Safety first, again.

1038
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,340
 Yeah.

1039
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,340
 Theme, developing.

1040
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,340
 I read a thing.

1041
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:29,520
 The judge in Kerry Island, so this is a case, two cases were thrown out where the drink

1042
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,420
 driving claim was no longer useful because the judge said that the people who were accused

1043
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:41,400
 of potentially being drunk had inhaled their own urine while they were in the actual custody

1044
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,960
 of the police.

1045
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,960
 Sorry.

1046
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,960
 What?

1047
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
 So this is a thing.

1048
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,600
 There's a thing which is kind of known as a loophole law, and what it is is called section

1049
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
 49.

1050
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:56,740
 The reason why is that if you were the police bringing people to the station, there needs

1051
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,900
 to be 20 minutes before you breathalyze them.

1052
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,720
 In that 20 minutes, you have to have your eyes on them, and they can't have drinks,

1053
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,180
 and they can't have anything that might influence what their breath is going to be.

1054
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,520
 As in you breathalyze them straight away in the car, haven't you, because when you stop

1055
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,220
 someone in a car, you breathalyze them, but then you turn to the station.

1056
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,860
 But you need them, you need it at the station for it to be legit.

1057
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,860
 So what happened?

1058
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,260
 And I think that's because the idea is that you can show a false positive on a breathalyzer

1059
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,140
 if you've drunk really recently, or if you've got like alcohol in your mouth, right?

1060
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,720
 So it's just waiting long enough that you're definitely positive.

1061
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,640
 To make sure that you're definitely positive, yeah.

1062
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,840
 Okay, so where do we get to inhaling your own urine?

1063
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,960
 So in these two specific cases, a judge called Judge O'Connor, he said that, where he was

1064
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,480
 told that during this 20 minute period where they weren't to be observed, they both went

1065
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,480
 to the bathroom, and when they went to the bathroom, they both were facing away from

1066
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,720
 the police officers who were meant to be monitoring them.

1067
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,320
 And according to the judge, in that time, the urine could have released odours that

1068
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,980
 would have been of a alcoholic nature, and that could influence that brand.

1069
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,980
 Is that why we say someone's pissed?

1070
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
 Possibly.

1071
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,980
 Yeah.

1072
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,980
 Quite possible.

1073
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,980
 Well, yeah, it was this.

1074
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,980
 That is incredible.

1075
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,980
 It wasn't long ago, but I haven't written down the year.

1076
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,980
 And that is bananas.

1077
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,980
 Did it work?

1078
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,980
 Do we know?

1079
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,660
 Yeah, they got the two cases we're throwing out of court for that specific reason.

1080
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,660
 That is amazing.

1081
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,660
 Yeah.

1082
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,660
 Why are we sharing tips?

1083
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,660
 But I mean, that is incredible.

1084
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,940
 So what they should have done was after they came back from the toilet, waited another 20

1085
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,500
 minutes, but then they used the breathalyzer test within that time frame.

1086
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:16,500
 Yeah.

1087
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,720
 Or you say it was just the police weren't monitoring them, so or if the police, they

1088
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,240
 were at the urinal and put the policeman is sort of facing them at the urinal and watching

1089
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,240
 them every second.

1090
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,760
 I think if you're at a urinal and someone's facing you, there are problems.

1091
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
 Something's gone wrong.

1092
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
 Something's gone wrong.

1093
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
 They have to be sitting in the urinal, don't they?

1094
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
 Yeah.

1095
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
 And can we talk about Barbara Castle?

1096
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
 Yes, we can.

1097
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,760
 Yeah.

1098
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,760
 Very keen.

1099
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:44,320
 So Transport Secretary, who introduced breathalyzers to British policing in 1967, you know, and

1100
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,100
 part of the problem was that at the time the number of cars on the road had increased six

1101
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,600
 fold in the previous 20 years.

1102
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,160
 So the word, you know, in the late 40s, there were two million cars on the road.

1103
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,280
 Now there were 12 million.

1104
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,280
 That's sixfold.

1105
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,280
 That's sixfold.

1106
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,280
 And my new podcast is going to be about simple sums and we'll go off against your golf whole

1107
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,680
 podcast and we'll just see who's is worse.

1108
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,800
 It was just that last week, Anna said something about doubling, and she said from six million

1109
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,880
 to 12 million, you went, that's doubling.

1110
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,920
 I've been hoist on my own referential, but I hate it.

1111
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,840
 Anyway, Barbara Castle was great, but she was incredibly unpopular at the time for introducing

1112
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,880
 this partly because drinkers were saying, you know, I want to be able to have several

1113
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,520
 drinks and then go home or drive home.

1114
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:31,920
 So some pub customers stuck pins in a doll labeled Barbara Castle.

1115
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,040
 That's from the mirror in 67.

1116
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,840
 But her main foe, maybe when this thing was introduced was, have you guys heard of AJP

1117
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,840
 Taylor?

1118
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,840
 No.

1119
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,000
 It's a very famous 20th century historian basically, really, really famous at the time.

1120
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 And he wrote about her and about breathalysers again and again.

1121
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,920
 And there was a piece, why pick on the private motorist?

1122
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,200
 And he said, no one has the slightest idea how much alcohol affects a driver.

1123
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,800
 The slightly tired driver, for instance, may actually be improved by a glass of sherry.

1124
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,200
 And he concluded at the end of this piece, it was a really, really rude piece about her

1125
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
 and about the whole idea.

1126
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,520
 And I've been driving a car for 45 years.

1127
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,200
 I have consistently ignored all the various speed limits.

1128
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,080
 Never once have I encountered the slightest risk as a result.

1129
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,520
 This is what she was up against.

1130
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,600
 I found the way breathalysers work really interesting.

1131
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:30,600
 In a way that's not more funny than where they put the hole on the green.

1132
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,800
 You do realise the more we come back to this more, I'm going to have to keep it in.

1133
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,520
 This is my spin off podcast.

1134
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,480
 So they work based on colour change, which I think is so cool.

1135
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,440
 So basically, when you breathe into a breathalyzer, you've usually got, or the police who's holding

1136
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,000
 the breathalyzer, they've got the control solution on one side, then they've got the

1137
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,800
 solution that you're breathing into.

1138
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:03,040
 And they're using a solution called potassium dichromite, which is orange in colour.

1139
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,200
 But when you breathe into it, the alcohol reacts with the dichromite and it produces

1140
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,300
 chromium, chromium ions on their own, and that is green.

1141
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:16,080
 So if you're breathing alcohol into it, the orange turns to green, which is kind of cool.

1142
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,760
 And then the way it works is it produces an electrical current based on the colour change,

1143
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,080
 which I actually just didn't know could happen.

1144
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:28,040
 So because different colours produce different amounts of energy, so if you've got a colour

1145
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,480
 that's a high frequency, like blue, like at the bottom of the rainbow, it produces more

1146
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,280
 energy than, let's say, red.

1147
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,320
 So that we can connect it up to a system where that translates into an electrical current.

1148
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,140
 So you connect some electrodes to the green solution and the orange solution and they

1149
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:49,240
 can sense the difference between the two and exactly how green it is.

1150
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
 Wow, that's amazing.

1151
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,880
 And that's exactly how much alcohol you've got.

1152
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,240
 And that's what that's a standard breathalyzer.

1153
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:00,800
 And then it translates into a figure on a screen, so you don't see any of this, sadly.

1154
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,800
 And you probably might be too drunk to understand it anyway.

1155
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,720
 I haven't had anything to drink it, I was clinging on.

1156
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,320
 In 2010, in Eastern Cape in South Africa, there was a person who was arrested and breathalyzed

1157
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:21,720
 and they were 32 times over the legal alcohol limit, which as far as I can tell is a record.

1158
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:28,080
 He was caught driving a Mercedes-Benz Vito very erratically, and inside the car there

1159
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,560
 were also five children, a woman and 15 sheep.

1160
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,560
 What?!

1161
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,560
 Excuse me?

1162
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,560
 That's a big number.

1163
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,560
 Was he part of a joke?

1164
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,560
 Sorry, in the car.

1165
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,560
 In the car, yeah.

1166
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,760
 Hang on, you can't get 15 sheep in a car?

1167
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,280
 Well, he did.

1168
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,640
 If you're drunk enough, you can do anything.

1169
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,160
 Probably wasn't a mini, was it?

1170
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,880
 It was a Mercedes-Benz Vito, which I actually don't know what that kind of car is.

1171
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,160
 But it doesn't sound like it's a bus, so that's incredible.

1172
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:01,840
 Apparently, he'd allegedly stolen the sheep from nearby farms, so, well drunk.

1173
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,960
 Imagine waking up in the morning, kind of forgetting what you did last night, going

1174
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,960
 out to the car.

1175
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,880
 It was just 50 sheep.

1176
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:18,760
 2010 was a huge year for drink-driving incidents like this, so also in 2010, a guy in Nebraska

1177
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,160
 was pulled over after swerving dangerously on the road, and the police saw him driving

1178
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,160
 very erratically.

1179
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,520
 And there was a bottle of vodka in the car, empty beer cans all over the place.

1180
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,520
 He was 19 years old.

1181
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,520
 Oh, yeah.

1182
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,520
 I mean, all the signs were there.

1183
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,520
 He was arrested.

1184
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
 You could say you're going to the recycling centre, can't you?

1185
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,520
 Well, yeah.

1186
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,520
 He was tested.

1187
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,520
 He was definitely over the limit.

1188
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,520
 Yeah.

1189
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,360
 But the extra bit of evidence against him was that, at the time, he was dressed as a breathalyzer

1190
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,360
 test.

1191
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:51,160
 He'd been to a party, and it had a dial on the front, which said, you know, are you blood

1192
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,160
 alcohol level?

1193
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,520
 And it was from loser having fun to brain damage, because the arrow was set to brain damage

1194
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:03,360
 for him, and he had a tube which you blow into at his crotch level, insert inside mouth

1195
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,360
 written on it.

1196
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,440
 And did the police use his breathalyzer?

1197
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,440
 He said, can you blow into this?

1198
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,520
 He's like, well, you have to, you blow into this.

1199
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,080
 Oh, one absolute tool.

1200
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:22,520
 Yeah, the police said that he was joined at the detox centre by a French maid and a naughty

1201
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,600
 board of patrol agents.

1202
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,600
 Oh my God.

1203
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:30,620
 There's one way that people think you can beat the test, and that's by sucking on a

1204
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,620
 penny.

1205
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:36,520
 The idea is that the zinc or the copper in the penny reacts with your alcohol in your

1206
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,840
 mouth, and it kind of puts a different chemical into the breathalyzer, so it doesn't do all

1207
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,040
 the chemical stuff it's supposed to do.

1208
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,080
 Usually old breathalysers, that would work, but these days the way breathalysers are made,

1209
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:53,800
 it doesn't work, and it hasn't worked for about, you know, 10, 20 years almost that

1210
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,800
 hasn't worked.

1211
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,600
 I've got to hope you get an incredibly old police officer.

1212
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:02,000
 Well, there was another thing in 1967, this was a warning published in the Somerset County

1213
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,160
 Gazette.

1214
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,080
 A warning was given to motorists, and it was just as the breathalyzer was being introduced.

1215
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:11,160
 A warning was given to motorists by Somerset police this week that they should treat with

1216
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,120
 caution the suggestion that they could beat the breathalyzer by eating mashed potatoes.

1217
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:21,960
 You load up on mashed potato and then you fire.

1218
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,800
 You can't, they do get tricked by certain things, so you never know.

1219
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,840
 That's why a breathalyzer can never be admissible evidence, it just gives you enough evidence

1220
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,600
 to take them to police station where you do a blood test.

1221
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:37,240
 Like for instance, if you have a lot of acetone in your breath, then that could be just because

1222
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,240
 you haven't eaten for a long time.

1223
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,000
 That's if you haven't eaten for a long time, if you're diabetic, you can have acetone levels

1224
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,340
 a thousand times higher than normal, that can set off a breathalyzer.

1225
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,880
 So you can make all of these excuses by the on-way to the police station.

1226
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,760
 I'm sort of picturing someone right now listening to our show, they've just been pulled over

1227
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,200
 and they're desperately, while the policemen's walking towards their car, listening to all

1228
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,200
 the advice we're giving right now, looking for pennies on the floor that says, "We're

1229
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,200
 mashed potatoes in the back."

1230
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,080
 Do you remember that fact that you guys didn't let me put in book of the year?

1231
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:09,820
 A guy pulled over who was probably on drugs, more than alcohol, and the police officers

1232
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,220
 asked him for a urine sample on the spot.

1233
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,560
 So he went into the bush and he took ages to come back out, and then when he came out,

1234
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:27,920
 he presented a semen sample and he had misheard what that said.

1235
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,040
 Okay, that's it.

1236
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,040
 That's all of our facts.

1237
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,280
