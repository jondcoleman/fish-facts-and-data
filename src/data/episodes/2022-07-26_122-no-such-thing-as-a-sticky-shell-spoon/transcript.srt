00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,320
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,040
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,120
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,920
 I am sitting here with Andy Murray, Anichezinski and James Harkin and once again we have gathered

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,400
 around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in a particular

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,600
 order, here we go, starting with you and Drew Hunter Murray.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,040
 My fact is that farmers in Botswana have started painting eyes on their cows' bottoms to stop

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,240
 lions from attacking them.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
 Stoking.

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,680
 We don't need anything more.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,880
 Time for fact number two.

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
 Does it work Andy?

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,400
 Well, this is the really interesting thing, this is in the trial stages at the moment.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,920
 So it's by a British conservation biologist called Neil Jordan.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,320
 He works in Australia and Botswana, so we're in Botswana here and he he wanted to trick

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,320
 lions into thinking that they've been spotted when they're sneaking up on a cow.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,200
 So he's been working in the Okavango Delta and he did a trial last year where 23 cows

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,200
 had eyes painted on their bottoms.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,120
 They all survived and in the rest of the herd, there were 39 cows which were not painted

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,000
 and of those cows, three were eaten by lions.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,400
 So it's a very small sample size, so he is, literally I wrote to him and said, can you paint

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,240
 some eyes on my bottom please?

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,240
 And he, this coming Monday in a few days is going to Botswana again, he's going to try

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,120
 a larger sample group and the idea is that it's a very cheap way of stopping a her being

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,840
 eaten, so the cost of painting a herd for a year is much less than the value of one cow

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
 being eaten.

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,200
 It's not cheap if the cow's value, their self respect though is it?

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
 No.

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,280
 It's probably a very expensive social sacrifice.

30
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,880
 They look like elephants actually because of their tails sticking out between the eyes.

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,200
 I'm going to put up a photo on my twitter feed, Andrew Hunter M and you can see what they

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
 look like.

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,720
 They should teach them to reverse as well, they told them to walk backwards to make it

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
 really realistic.

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,880
 You only did the same thing to people for the same reason, so in 1989 I found this in an

36
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,200
 old edition of the New York Times, in 1989 thousands of face masks were issued by the forestry

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,760
 of reserve in India to a bunch of people who were living near the Ganges where tigers kept

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,640
 killing people and the face masks were to wear on the back of their heads and they found

39
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,320
 that within something like a year and a half, nobody wearing the face mask on the back

40
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,480
 of their head, so they had a face on the back of their head got attacked.

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,600
 Wait, so the way to avoid tiger attack is to look at it in the face?

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,840
 Yeah, they won't jump at you.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
 Of course they will.

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,200
 It's like tigers, but obviously rather sneak up on you from behind.

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,720
 I think they're not attacking you because you've got two faces.

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,480
 It's like if you go to a supermarket and you don't buy the kind of...

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
 The straight bananas.

48
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,840
 Yeah, the bananas that look weird, you don't buy them, you only buy the ones that look nice.

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
 Yeah.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,440
 So it's a company which has started selling ugly fruit and vegetables in there because they're

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,360
 cheaper and they sell really mischapen, disgusting looking tomatoes, but they're completely

52
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
 the same nutritionally.

53
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,040
 They're doing it in France, I think.

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,800
 And they just had a new rule in France to say that supermarkets have to give any food

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,200
 which is about to go sell by dates to homeless people.

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800
 That's so good.

57
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
 Yeah.

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,160
 I wasn't doing it anyway, but the laws come in now to say they have to...

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,440
 Can't believe we don't all do that, it seems so obvious.

60
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,760
 Speaking of cows' bums, very quickly, have you guys heard of...

61
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,920
 I hadn't heard of this, so I apologise if this is very well known, but have you heard

62
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,440
 of cow blowing?

63
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,200
 The idea is that they want to induce more milk from the cow.

64
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,880
 So what they do is they lift up the tail and they blow into its butt.

65
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
 No.

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,720
 Or vagina.

67
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,360
 So it's one of the two.

68
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,480
 It's always a common thing, isn't there, where people say milking a cow, who was the first

69
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,520
 person to ever think of that?

70
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,520
 That must be one sick individual, but then I would say it's an even sicker individual.

71
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,960
 It first blows into a cow's vagina.

72
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,720
 And they think, wow, they can be even more milk.

73
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,760
 I agree, I know, I don't.

74
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,080
 But weirdly, it is done and Gandhi supposedly didn't drink milk because he hated this process.

75
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,360
 So he was like, if you're going to blow cows, I'm not going to get involved.

76
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,320
 That's one of his favourite quotes.

77
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,240
 Actually, it's attributed to him, but I think he might have been Churchill.

78
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,200
 There is an actual quote, just for the sake of saying it, "Since I had come to know that

79
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,520
 the cow on the buffalo was subjected to the process of Fouca, it's called Ph. W. K. A."

80
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
 Of course it is.

81
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
 This is all they've done.

82
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,320
 I had conceived a strong disgust for milk.

83
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
 So it's called...

84
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
 Yeah, it's called cow blowing.

85
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
 And wait, Fouca.

86
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
 Do you just have to get in there?

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
 Sometimes do it with a tube.

88
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
 Or sometimes.

89
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
 Sometimes with a tube.

90
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 I should have thought it.

91
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
 Oh no, you should watch YouTube videos.

92
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
 They're amazing.

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,320
 Sorry Gary, we've forgotten the tube today again, so...

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,320
 Oh no, Gary, that's the wrong end of the tube.

95
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
 Oh, Gary.

96
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
 No Gary, you're meant to blow.

97
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,320
 It's also called insufflation.

98
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,320
 And yeah, it's quite common in African countries in Kenya and Tanzania.

99
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
 I think they do it quite a bit.

100
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
 But you should watch videos.

101
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
 It looks hilarious.

102
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
 They just lift up the tail and thrust their noses right in there, didn't they?

103
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
 Yeah.

104
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,320
 Because it's been around since Herodotus, who was the first person, the first...

105
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
 I know, I know, it's not a great start.

106
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
 It's at any scientific thing.

107
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
 But Herodotus described this happening in horses.

108
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,320
 So he said that people would insert a tube into the mezzanus then blow.

109
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,320
 Not the mezzanus.

110
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
 So this fact is about bottoms.

111
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
 Yes.

112
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,320
 This is not the only bottom-related story in the week's news.

113
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
 Yeah.

114
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
 So I don't know whether you've seen this.

115
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,320
 But in the times recently, there was a tiny article about a robot bottom,

116
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,320
 which has been invented for doctors to learn how to do prostate exams.

117
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,320
 I'm very indebted to Tom Whipple, who's the science editor at The Times.

118
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,320
 So he told me a bit about this.

119
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,320
 It has prosthetic buttocks and an adjustable rectum.

120
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,320
 The really exciting thing is what this is designed to replace.

121
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,320
 And there is a system at the moment, which is that there is someone in the UK who's job is rectal teaching assistant.

122
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,320
 He goes around the country lending out his bottom to prostate trainees.

123
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
 Is there only one person?

124
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,320
 There's only one person in the entire United Kingdom who goes around with his bottom.

125
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,320
 I've written to his people, but they haven't got back to me yet.

126
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
 He has people.

127
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
 He has people, yeah.

128
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 So is he furious that this robotic farmer is now?

129
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
 He's very glad.

130
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,320
 And he won't be losing his job because he is also very important.

131
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,320
 It's just that he's quite overworked at the moment because just one of them

132
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,320
 has developed a robot assistant.

133
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,320
 He provides very useful feedback on what the procedures like from a patient's point of view.

134
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,320
 Does he really can't feel anything at this point?

135
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,320
 He can't possibly have the average rectum anymore.

136
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
 I think this man's a bloody hero.

137
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
 I really do.

138
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
 Yeah.

139
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
 And how did he fall into that job?

140
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
 That is incredible.

141
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:17,320
 So this guy probably doesn't suffer from another condition called dormant bottom syndrome.

142
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
 What was that?

143
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
 This is a real syndrome.

144
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,320
 It's a guy called Chris Colber, who's a sports medical guy.

145
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,320
 And he reckons that the increased sedentary lifestyle of humans means you sit down all the time.

146
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,320
 And it means your gluteus maximus doesn't get enough exercise and the muscle isn't strong enough.

147
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,320
 And it means that other parts of your leg get a lot more stress.

148
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:45,320
 So your knees might get more stress or your hips might because a lot of work that will be done by your gluteus is not done by that anymore.

149
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
 That's very interesting.

150
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
 Wow.

151
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
 Cool.

152
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,320
 So a good way to avoid the agonizing knee joint pain and already getting age 30 is to stand up more basically.

153
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
 Two more squats.

154
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
 Two more squats.

155
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
 And then you won't have dormant bottom syndrome.

156
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
 That is amazing.

157
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,320
 Have you guys heard of skipper caterpillars?

158
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
 No.

159
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
 No.

160
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
 These are very cool animals.

161
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
 Basically caterpillars get preyed on a lot.

162
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,320
 And one of the ways the predators find them is they trace them by their poo.

163
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,320
 So it is bad as a caterpillar to be near your own poo.

164
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,320
 But skipper caterpillars, they have a trick which they can do, which is to fling their poo as if from a catapult.

165
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,320
 They have a flap under their anus and they build that blood pressure to build up pressure and pressure and pressure.

166
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
 And then eventually they fling their poo.

167
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,320
 They can fling it 40 times their own body length in maximum.

168
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
 Wow.

169
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,320
 So that's the equivalent of a human being able to throw their own poo 80 meters.

170
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
 Wow.

171
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
 You do get arrested for that.

172
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,320
 You should've worn 80 meters.

173
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
 James, that's really cool.

174
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
 Yeah, they know it is.

175
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,320
 But I'm taking like, okay, let's say a discus world record is going to be around 80 meters like that.

176
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
 Yeah.

177
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
 Yeah.

178
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
 That's a discus.

179
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,320
 And they're not flattered your poo into a discus.

180
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,320
 Also, you're not throwing it with your own anus, are you?

181
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
 Oh, that's fair, yeah.

182
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
 It was the anus discus.

183
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,320
 I think the record will be much lower.

184
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,320
 It will be a great spectator sport.

185
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
 Yeah, amazing.

186
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
 The shit pot.

187
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,320
 Or the discus.

188
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,320
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

189
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
 And that is James.

190
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:33,320
 Okay, my fact this week is that my top speed running in armor is the same as the top speed of a snowflake falling to earth.

191
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,320
 How have you tested this?

192
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,320
 No, so I read this in a study by Graham N. Askew et al.

193
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
 It's in the proceedings of the Royal Society.

194
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,320
 And they said that a 38-year-old man can sustain a maximum speed in armor of 1.7 meters per second.

195
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,320
 And I'm not quite 38, but I'm a bit out of shape, so I reckon that's about my maximum speed.

196
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,320
 And according to the internet, especially the telegraph of the 7th of January 2010,

197
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,320
 the average snowflake has a top speed of 1.7 meters per second as well.

198
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
 Oh, so you worked this out?

199
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
 Yeah.

200
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
 Because I was looking for the article when you mentioned this.

201
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,320
 I couldn't find the scientific experiment where a man in armor erased a snowflake to a destination.

202
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,320
 It takes the average snowflake an hour, the journey from the cloud to the ground.

203
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
 Wow.

204
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,320
 Yeah, it's an hour's trip.

205
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
 Oh, that's all isn't, an hour's run, amazing.

206
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,320
 This is the fastest that a snowflake can reach, I think, rather than the average here.

207
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
 Right.

208
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
 Okay.

209
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
 It's the same bolt of snowflakes.

210
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
 Yes, you're quite right.

211
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,320
 Some of the things that are 1.7 meters per second according to the internet.

212
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,320
 It's the speed when ponies tend to change from walking to trotting.

213
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
 Nice.

214
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:51,320
 It's the kind of average speed of a 100 meter freestyle racer during the 1972 Olympics swimming.

215
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,320
 And it's the speed that trap door ants, trap door themselves away from predators,

216
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
 because they can kind of jump away from predators.

217
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
 Oh, but for them, that's really fast, isn't it?

218
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
 Yeah, exactly.

219
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
 That's very cool.

220
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
 One point of a meter's a second.

221
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
 I'm struggling to get a grip on how fast that is.

222
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,320
 In miles an hour, is that like a really fast walk, or is it a small short walk?

223
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 It is.

224
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,320
 You could probably run about twice that, just under twice that speed without any armor.

225
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
 Because actually, armor isn't as heavy and awkward as people used to think it was.

226
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,320
 There's this kind of meme of people in massive suits of armor, hardly being able to move at all.

227
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
 But actually, that's not true to life.

228
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,320
 Because obviously, that'd be ridiculous in a battle if everyone could just move very fast.

229
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,320
 And apparently, those swords weren't as heavy as we think they were either.

230
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:39,320
 Because the other thing is the swords and these huge, like, incredibly heavy weapons.

231
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,320
 And actually, they were never more than five, five.

232
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,320
 I thought five was quite heavy, actually.

233
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
 No, I've been working out.

234
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,320
 This is interesting, because there was a study in 2011, which put knights on a treadmill,

235
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,320
 or put people in suits of armor on a treadmill, and they got tired.

236
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,320
 They thought the one problem was that you're wearing a backplate and a breastplate.

237
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,320
 And basically, you can't take a huge breath in.

238
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,320
 You can only take small, shallow breaths, which means that you do get quite tired quite quickly,

239
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
 because you can't get enough oxygen to your muscles.

240
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,320
 So this new study seems to completely contradict that one.

241
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
 I'm not sure.

242
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
 I mean, you say they got tired.

243
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
 Did they put them on a treadmill at high speed for eight hours?

244
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,320
 Because we need to qualify at what point they got tired on the treadmill.

245
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
 They found it for 23.

246
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,320
 They found it used twice as much energy as doing the same thing without armor.

247
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
 In this previous experiment.

248
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
 Well, actually, this experiment as well.

249
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,320
 They're saying, yes, definitely, it takes more energy, and it's harder to walk at any speed in armor.

250
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
 But actually, it's just not as much as you think.

251
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
 Right.

252
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
 Well, OK, so here's the thing.

253
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
 You know, they have actual joust these days.

254
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
 I mean, there are genuine competitions which take place.

255
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:58,320
 So there's one woman called Nikki Willis, but she jousts as, oh, it's Saint Ratham,

256
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,320
 because she's from Stratum, or she says she's of Saint Ratham.

257
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,320
 So she's brilliant. And she has just taken part last month in the first ever competitive joust between a man and a woman.

258
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
 Oh, great.

259
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
 And I didn't know this about jousting.

260
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
 Do you know what you get points for?

261
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
 I think it's where you hit them on the body, isn't it?

262
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
 Exactly. It's not knocking someone else off.

263
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
 Like a dartboard.

264
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
 It's like a dartboard, yeah.

265
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,320
 And the article I read said it was a pre-arranged thing as though you have to, like, in like in pool,

266
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,320
 where you name the pocket you're going to sink and you say, right, I'm going to hit them on the shoulder or whatever.

267
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,320
 I'm not sure whether it's that or whether it is just like a dartboard where you get most points facing them in the helmet.

268
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,320
 I thought in the olden days it was like treble 20 would be a helmet.

269
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,320
 If you got them on that thin line where the eyes are, jousting didn't really exist in medieval times.

270
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,320
 It was the Malay that was the big sport that they do, which in the Malay was lots of people galloping towards each other.

271
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,320
 And a bit of a sideline at these big Malay festivals would be the joust, which no one really watched and no one cared about.

272
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,320
 And then as the site, these ideas of chivalry and this one night ruling above everyone and attracting the best women and stuff came into the fore

273
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,320
 and chewed at times, then the joust became the centerpiece of these tournaments.

274
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,320
 I remember reading about the Malay, wasn't it?

275
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:16,320
 I read about one where it was like the French and the English were all taking part and then the French kind of cheated or the English cheated.

276
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,320
 The English cheated, but they copied the French, so the English cheated by saying they weren't going to get involved in a Malay.

277
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,320
 I think this is in the kinds of interview.

278
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 You guys carry on, and then as soon as everyone else was tired and lost all the fingers and stuff, they kind of ran it in.

279
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,320
 There were several nations fighting, I think that was the English hung around on the edge.

280
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,320
 Maybe we should have done that in the Uras, just sat out the first few rounds.

281
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,320
 Instead of the last few rounds.

282
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
 The wrong way round guys.

283
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,320
 This is a cool thing. The whole medieval thing got kickstarted in the 19th century.

284
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
 Do you have kickstarted back then?

285
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,320
 Yeah.

286
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,320
 In 1839 there was a thing called the Eglinton tournament, and it was this quite eccentric lord called Lord Eglinton,

287
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,320
 who just said, "I'm going to revive the idea of chivalry. We've been going without it for too long."

288
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,320
 He hosted this massive medieval tournament, but it was in Scotland, unfortunately, which meant that it was a total washout.

289
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,320
 Huge rains, huge storms, huge winds, and the whole thing was a disaster.

290
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,320
 The tilting yard had this huge roof, there were huge crowds, and then it started leaking.

291
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,320
 Basically, the crowds did not come back on the second day, but he just had paintings done, which made it look amazing.

292
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,320
 Then everyone else said, "Oh, well, this is great. We should do this."

293
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,320
 If one looked at those and went, "Ah, do you remember the great tournament of 1836?"

294
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
 Exactly.

295
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,320
 There were quite a lot of paintings of female jousters and knights.

296
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,320
 You were mentioning one earlier, and you think of women as not having been really involved in that.

297
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,320
 There were a few female knights in history.

298
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
 I was the only thing of Joel of art.

299
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,320
 I can think of that lady in Game of Thrones.

300
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
 There was obviously her. I think she was...

301
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,320
 Yeah, 14th, 15th century. Brian of Tar.

302
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,320
 There was a noble woman called the Countess Jean de Pontiev.

303
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,320
 But there were quite a few medieval depictions of women in armour, jousting, and stuff,

304
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,320
 but it was thought to be improper to show them with something as phallic as a joust.

305
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,320
 So they'd show them in jousting tournaments carrying a distaff,

306
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,320
 which is one of those needles that you wrap a wool round when you're sewing.

307
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,320
 You would think that instead of painting the joust,

308
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,320
 they paint like a vagina or something.

309
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,320
 I thought you were going to come up with a weapon that looks like a vagina.

310
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,320
 I couldn't think of any. If I could have thought of one, I would have said it.

311
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 I know. There aren't other.

312
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 No, it's harder because longer and pointier things is what is traditionally used in battles.

313
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,320
 A bear trap? That was pretty messed up, man.

314
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,320
 Don't blow it to that vagina.

315
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:52,320
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

316
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,320
 My fact this week is that archaeologists have started throwing artifacts into skips

317
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,320
 because there is now too much history for them to store.

318
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,320
 There's too much history. They're finding too many bits of history,

319
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,320
 and all of their back rooms are getting clogged up,

320
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,320
 and they don't know what to do with them. It costs too much to store them,

321
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
 so they just have to throw them away.

322
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,320
 What happens is you put it all in a landfill, and then in another thousand years,

323
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,320
 they come to this landfill with loads of different types of history.

324
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,320
 They'll have some Victorian stuff, some Roman stuff, and they'll think,

325
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,320
 "Wow, all these people live together with TVs."

326
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,320
 Time travel happened. They cracked it.

327
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,320
 This is one amazing point. The guys were screwing with the future.

328
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,320
 This is terrible. We need to read leave notes in landfill, say.

329
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,320
 This did not all come at one.

330
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,320
 There are lots of local community archaeology groups find things.

331
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,320
 They take them to museums, but because of lots of funding cuts,

332
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,320
 museums then say we have no storage, and then I think they have to give them back

333
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,320
 to the people who own the land it was found on.

334
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,320
 Yes. And those guys who own the land might just keep them in their house,

335
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,320
 and if they die or move, then they're inheritors of the next people might think,

336
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
 "Well, this is rubbish and throw it away."

337
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,320
 Yeah. And the museums have to charge.

338
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,320
 It's like taking out a PO box, as it were, for mail to be delivered to,

339
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
 from some way that's not your house.

340
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,320
 You pay for a box if you want something to be put in a museum,

341
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,320
 and that can range between 20 pounds and 600 pounds.

342
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,320
 So you're effectively saying, "I'd like to donate this bit of history to you guys,

343
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
 but then I now need to pay to have it stored as well."

344
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,320
 Well, people can't afford that, so just things are being thrown away.

345
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
 Oh, that's terrible.

346
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
 And it doesn't sound like people are finding, you know,

347
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,320
 full statues of Cleopatra, and it's chucking them away.

348
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,320
 I think it's obviously shards of pottery that do have amazing, you know,

349
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,320
 inscriptions on them and so on, but they have lots of examples of it, so they'll be...

350
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
 Yeah, there's an excellent article on Cracks.

351
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,320
 I love it when Cracks does articles written by someone with this job,

352
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,320
 but there was this article on Cracks by an archaeologist called Hadass Levine,

353
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,320
 and she's a really archaeologist, and she said they throw away about 65% of what they find,

354
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,320
 and the bits of pottery, the only bits of pottery that are useful at the bottom and the top,

355
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,320
 because it's only at the lip and the base that you can really date it,

356
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,320
 and all the stuff in between, you just chuck it straight back,

357
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,320
 and unless it's got some really cool thing, like an engraving of a penis on it,

358
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
 and then obviously you keep it because we love that.

359
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,320
 That's very similar to us in that way.

360
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,320
 Remember, Andy, you ages ago were telling me about the fact that there was a new train system

361
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,320
 that was being built, and as they were digging, this was in Istanbul, I think,

362
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
 and as they were looking, there was just too much history.

363
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
 Rome.

364
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
 It was in Rome.

365
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
 Rome is having another underground line built at the moment,

366
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,320
 and they've had to delay it three times now, because they keep finding...

367
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
 Oh, well, it's another massive barracks full of statues,

368
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,320
 and you know, ancient, important stables and things like that, so yeah.

369
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
 I think that happened with Cross Rail a bit, as well, didn't it?

370
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
 Yeah.

371
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
 They can't find in things.

372
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,320
 They can't find in plague pits when they first built the tomb.

373
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,320
 Yeah, I think there's a kink in... I'm going to say it's in the Picadilla line,

374
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,320
 but obviously some people listening would know, but I think there's a kink in it,

375
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
 which goes round the plague pit.

376
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
 Oh, really?

377
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,320
 That must be a classic problem of anyone building up a rail.

378
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
 Oh, yeah.

379
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,320
 And I think if we mentioned before, with HS2, there was an archaeologist shortage.

380
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
 And there still is.

381
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,320
 Yeah.

382
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
 If you're listening to this and you're wondering what to do with your life,

383
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,320
 become an archaeologist or go around letting people put their finger up your bum.

384
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
 So there's a shortage in that too.

385
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,320
 It's just a binary choice now. All the other jobs are filled.

386
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,320
 I went on to a website called It's a Tumblr, called archaeologist Problems.

387
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
 And there's a few of those.

388
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:32,320
 One of them is being asked if giants really exist, but the discovery is covered up by the museums.

389
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,320
 In the third of the months, only that's something they get asked quite a lot.

390
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,320
 I thought I was being original with that question.

391
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,320
 Archaeologist Joyce, finding massive amounts of well-preserved artifacts in one small location,

392
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,320
 followed by archaeologist Problems, said small location is a privy,

393
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,320
 and the smell is stuck on your clothing, your hair, your field gear, everything.

394
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
 Wow, that's a problem they have.

395
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,320
 And also a problem they have is getting teased in Europe before sharpening your trowel

396
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 and getting teased in the US for not sharpening your trowel.

397
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,320
 Archaeologists can be so cruel.

398
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,320
 But I think this is a good tip because under your saying that people should become archaeologists.

399
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,320
 Maybe if you're going to become one, then make sure you always sharpen your trowel in the US,

400
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
 but don't do it in Europe.

401
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
 You better have gone the right way around, James.

402
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,320
 If you're responsible for the rampant bullying of archaeologists, henceforth.

403
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,320
 If you're going to become an archaeologist, maybe become a US one.

404
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,320
 So if you get into a fight with a non-US archaeologist, you'll have a sharp trowel.

405
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
 Yes.

406
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
 So just on things being thrown away by mistake.

407
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,320
 In 2014, Bournemouth Council launched this new scheme where it was a food waste collection service

408
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,320
 and you basically had your own little bin which clipped on inside your bin.

409
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
 Yeah.

410
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,320
 And then binmen accidentally threw away a hundred of the little bins.

411
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
 Isn't that a matter?

412
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,320
 You know, a huge number of coins get thrown away.

413
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,320
 Coins that add up to a massive value. So I was looking at a study which was called a statistical analysis

414
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
 of coins lost in circulation.

415
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,320
 And it said that in 1995, but I can't see why it would have changed much.

416
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,320
 The average one cent coin in America had a 0.3 circulation rate.

417
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,320
 So I think that probably means for every one coin that you put in circulation,

418
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
 you get 0.3 coins back.

419
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,320
 So pretty much 70% of coins never come back in.

420
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,320
 Well, you know each other coin into like a pot and you never use it again or it falls down the back of the sofa.

421
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
 Down a well.

422
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
 Down a well.

423
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
 Happens with pennies especially.

424
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,320
 So they've estimated that $3 billion worth of pennies go missing every year.

425
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
 Every year.

426
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
 Yeah.

427
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,320
 If you could get all those pennies, but you can't.

428
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:47,320
 You can and I think it ceases to be legal tender after you pay 20 P's worth of copper.

429
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
 What?

430
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
 Seriously?

431
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,320
 Something like that. It's 20 something P, I think.

432
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,320
 So if you want to pay for something and you want to pay just in pennies,

433
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,320
 they can still accept it if they want to, but then don't legally have to accept it anything over.

434
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
 I think it's 20 people.

435
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
 It might be more.

436
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
 That is fascinating.

437
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,320
 There are those machines now though in the supermarkets where you can put them in.

438
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
 Yeah.

439
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
 You probably would be there for about.

440
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
 If you have $3 billion.

441
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
 Yeah.

442
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
 I did, they have those in Australia as well.

443
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,320
 And when I moved there temporarily and I was unemployed, I had no money.

444
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
 But my boyfriend had a lot of change lying around the house.

445
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
 So I went and collected it all up.

446
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
 Collected our stall.

447
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,320
 You went over at night when he was asleep.

448
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
 Yeah, I collected it.

449
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,320
 But yeah, I remember just feeling like such a weird person walking up to the bank with this enormous suitcase full of coins.

450
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
 It was something like $400 worth of coins.

451
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
 It was great.

452
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
 It got me through the next year.

453
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
 Yeah, he's ridiculous.

454
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
 So he holds it.

455
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
 If he holds it, it means he was collecting it.

456
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
 Yeah.

457
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
 Which means you stole it.

458
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
 Look, he never noticed.

459
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
 To be able to collect his television as well.

460
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,320
 One American bloke.

461
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,320
 He walked around the town he lived in and he would go on long walks every day.

462
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,320
 And whenever he passed by car wash, he would just feel in the change slot in the vacuum machine.

463
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,320
 You know, you pay a few coins and you get to use the vacuum machine to whoever the inside of your car.

464
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,320
 He made an average of $5.60 per trip.

465
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,320
 And over a decade, he made $21,000.

466
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
 Wow.

467
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
 Just from that.

468
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
 It's actually still not enough to live on, is it?

469
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
 Nope.

470
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,320
 It's a really nice bonus.

471
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,320
 But I'm also thinking he could be using his skills for better use.

472
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,320
 Because what he's doing is he's putting his finger, it's a small hole, feeling around.

473
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,320
 It must be another job that he could do.

474
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
 I can't think of anything.

475
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,320
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

476
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,320
 And that is Anna Chazinsky.

477
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,320
 Yeah, my fact is that restaurants in 1950s, Vietnam, punched holes in their soup spoons to stop people stealing them.

478
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
 It's amazing.

479
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:51,320
 So weird. So I read this in an excerpt from this cookbook called The Foe Cookbook by Andrea Naguyin.

480
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,320
 And yes, she was saying under communism in the 1950s, a lot of people were stealing cutlery from restaurants.

481
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,320
 And so, restaurants decided that they would punch holes in the middle of soup spoons, which she described as making the soup a lot harder to drink.

482
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,320
 It had to be gulp down extremely quickly because otherwise it dribbled all out of the spoon before it got to your mouth.

483
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
 Right.

484
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,320
 But apparently it was to stop people stealing them.

485
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:24,320
 It's weird, isn't it? Because you would think either the hole makes it completely useless that you can't drink out of it or it's still okay in which case you can use it in the restaurant, but you can also still use it at home.

486
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,320
 Exactly.

487
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,320
 By the end of your meal, you've mastered the use of a holy spoon and you bring that home.

488
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:42,320
 Well, they actually did it again. I found one other newspaper article citing it being done in 1993 in Russia in the city of Cheboxyry, and it did conclude that this anti-theft device did not work.

489
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:53,320
 So this was saying that the anti-theft idea in this place was to put holes in the spoons and then diners at the cafe were instructed to boil up pieces of bread that came with their meal and all to plug up the hole in the soup.

490
00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:02,320
 It's amazing how much stuff gets stolen from restaurants. I didn't realise this. Jamie Oliver said he lost 30,000 napkins. Oh, I don't know whether it was a month or a year now.

491
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
 Oh, yeah.

492
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
 But some vast number.

493
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,320
 His napkins have got like branded Jamie Oliver on them or something, don't they?

494
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
 Yeah.

495
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
 Says Jamie Oliver on them, I think.

496
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,320
 Have we mentioned the virgin thing before on a virgin thing?

497
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
 He's got children there.

498
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,320
 I don't think we can make this out of his.

499
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
 He's a virgin.

500
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:29,320
 No, virgin airlines had a similar problem years ago. They had these little planes, salt and pepper shakers and people kept stealing them because they just looked so cool.

501
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:42,320
 And so they thought rather than combating it by stopping production of it or trying to work out how to stop people from stealing it, they ended up just having a little embossed thing at the bottom saying pinched from virgin airways.

502
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
 And it became a huge marketing tool.

503
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
 Everyone loved the idea.

504
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,320
 So they were encouraging people to steal them.

505
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,320
 This is like, Wahaka had an amnesty on stolen spoons recently, actually, because I think Wahaka spoons are also quite distinct.

506
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
 I think they're big and round and plastic.

507
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
 They're plastic, aren't they?

508
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
 Yes, and colourful.

509
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,320
 So they had an amnesty where they said if you return stolen spoons, then we'll give you free food.

510
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,320
 And there were posters up which said sure that irresistibly bright and some say ergonomically perfect.

511
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,320
 True, there's no final ladle for your last mouthful, but please, please can we have them back?

512
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,320
 The State Parliament in Russia, the Doomer, they had a lot of problems with people stealing cutlery.

513
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
 In 2004 at least they did.

514
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,320
 They were losing 30 to 40 spoons and 15 forks a week.

515
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
 So they were losing that much per week.

516
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,320
 And there was a guy, an MP called Sergei Glottov.

517
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:40,320
 And he thought that basically because they didn't have a gift shop whenever anyone came, they just thought I'm going to have to take something.

518
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
 So I'm going to take some cutlery instead.

519
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
 Right.

520
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,320
 When I went to Russia, Loshka, which is spoon, is one of the few words that I learned.

521
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,320
 And people kept over the course of the week, nicking these spoons from around the place.

522
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
 Because you just kept saying Loshka, Loshka.

523
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
 Yeah, I kept saying Loshka and people found it very amusing.

524
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,320
 And they gave me, I came back with about half a dozen spoons.

525
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
 Wow.

526
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,320
 Loshki, meaning spoons, is also a musical instrument, I think.

527
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
 The spoons, yeah.

528
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,320
 It's like the spoons, but they're like decorated and they're big. I have some of them all.

529
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
 Nice.

530
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,320
 You should have gone around Russia saying the words, learn the words for slightly more valuable exciting things.

531
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
 Yeah, I do.

532
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,320
 So I was saying diamond, diamond.

533
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
 I know.

534
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
 Thank you.

535
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
 Should I learn that?

536
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,320
 Yeah, so disappearing spoons seems to be a major thing to the extent that the British Medical Journal in 2005,

537
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:33,320
 published a report called the Case of the Disappearing Teesboons Longitudinal Cohort Study of the Displacement of Teesboons in an Australian Research Institute.

538
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,320
 And it was a study where they investigated the lifespan of a teaspoon and how soon it would be stolen.

539
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,320
 And they worked out that the half life of teaspoons was 81 days.

540
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:49,320
 If you wanted to have an Institute-wide population of 70 teaspoons in this research institute,

541
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,320
 you would need to buy 250 teaspoons in one year.

542
00:28:53,320 --> 00:29:02,320
 And their conclusion was that the loss of workplace teaspoons is rapid showing that their availability and hence office culture in general is constantly threatened.

543
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,320
 We suggest that the development of effective control measures against the loss of teaspoon should be a priority on a natural research agendas.

544
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
 It's fox in this office, isn't it?

545
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
 Yeah, it is.

546
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,320
 We need to get us to another study on this office.

547
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,320
 Yeah, remember when you guys accused me of throwing away all our cutleries?

548
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
 I still think you might have accidentally thrown them away.

549
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
 I didn't do it.

550
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,320
 And I think they were archeological fighters.

551
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
 And I'm an Australian.

552
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,320
 So this is matching up with this report that you just read.

553
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
 It is very obvious.

554
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,320
 So we, you know, like little things like coasters, the prime example is Byros.

555
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,320
 Byros just go.

556
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,320
 Douglas Adams has this whole riff about, you know, they squirrel themselves away through space time to their own dimension.

557
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
 But it is bizarre.

558
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,320
 I frequently put three Byros in my bag and I end the day and I've got none.

559
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,320
 Yeah.

560
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
 Where are they?

561
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
 They're in my bag.

562
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,320
 And I was collecting them.

563
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,320
 I think it's basically anything that's low value, right?

564
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
 So if it's low value, you don't really care about it.

565
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
 So it just goes missing.

566
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,320
 Whereas if you had really nice pan, then you probably would never lose it.

567
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,320
 I was looking into other kinds of spoons that we've had throughout the years.

568
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,320
 My favorite spoon so far, one I've not heard of, ear spoons.

569
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,320
 We heard it ear spoons.

570
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,320
 That's so cool.

571
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
 Historical artifacts.

572
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,320
 It's forgetting wax out your ears.

573
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,320
 Yeah, pre the Q tip.

574
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:22,320
 It was, you'd have a spoon with a little, with a long handle and you'd shove it down your ear and you'd try and dislodge the wax inside.

575
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
 It'd come out with a nice spoon for the wax.

576
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
 Yeah, I have one.

577
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,320
 Do you?

578
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
 I think so.

579
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,320
 Well, you haven't been using it in a long time.

580
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
 Sorry.

581
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,320
 It went in a few years ago.

582
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,320
 In the e-series of QI and we found out about these things and we're looking by them readily online.

583
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,320
 And I think, haven't seen it for years so maybe I haven't got it still, but I thought I bought one with a light on it.

584
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,320
 So you can kind of go into the ears and kind of look.

585
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,320
 You can't see the problem with that.

586
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,320
 I think it's for other people if you're kind of digging with the light.

587
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,320
 If the light comes out of your eyes, you know there's no wax in your ear.

588
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:14,320
 And also I remember reading that, and I don't know if this is kind of a bit of a funny pages thing, but apparently ear wax picking of your loved one was kind of a bit of a fetish in Japan for a while.

589
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,320
 Yeah, it feels like just a made up thing, but I remember reading articles about it.

590
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,320
 Here's the thing about spoons.

591
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,320
 In 1909, the Huddersfield Examiner reported that there had been a competitive spoon cleaning competition.

592
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,320
 Pretty cool.

593
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,320
 It's such a good way to get everyone to do the town's washing.

594
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
 Do you know what the first ever spoons were?

595
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
 Don't they were made from?

596
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
 Oh, wood.

597
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,320
 They were made of shells tied onto sticks.

598
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,320
 So says my research.

599
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,320
 Okay.

600
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,320
 Okay, the Latin word for spoon is cochlear, and that comes from the word fish.

601
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
 That comes from the word for shell.

602
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
 So I think that's the thinking.

603
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,320
 Yeah, but you're not going to find any sticks and shells tied together.

604
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,320
 Throw them all the way with the office fog.

605
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,320
 But you're not going to find that in an archaeological way.

606
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,320
 So I can see the language thing, but even then it could be the shape of it just reminds you of a shell.

607
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
 Possibly, possibly, not sure.

608
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,320
 Might you find it in a cave with just not tied together, but like just sitting next to each other.

609
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
 You don't know.

610
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,320
 Just I mean, you're always going to find sticks and shells next to each other.

611
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,320
 When I go to the beach and I see a bit of drift, what a dish.

612
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,320
 There's the ancient company set.

613
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,320
 You've got to use your imagination in the final work days.

614
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,320
 So do you know one of the oldest spoons that exists in this country is?

615
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,320
 Yes, it's my sticky shell.

616
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,320
 Sorry.

617
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,320
 There's Andy Shell and then hot on the heels of that.

618
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,320
 This is the only piece of medieval regalia we have.

619
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,320
 So a stuff from things that were used in medieval royal ceremonies.

620
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
 And it's the coronation spoon.

621
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,320
 So the most sacred part of the queen's coronation is when she gets anointed,

622
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,320
 which is when the Archbishop of Canterbury in private puts holy oil on her.

623
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
 I think it's her breasts, her hands and her head.

624
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
 Yeah.

625
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,320
 And she uses this, he uses this coronation spoon and it's from the 12th century.

626
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
 Wow.

627
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
 Which I just think that's incredible.

628
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,320
 It's almost 1,000 year old's food.

629
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
 The breasts it's seen.

630
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,320
 In China, restaurants are planning to bring your own cutlery movement

631
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
 because huge amounts of cutlery get wasted.

632
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,320
 So it's weird that we pick up plastic cutlery and a lot of the cafes

633
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,320
 that you go to, for instance, in London.

634
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,320
 And it was worked out that they were wasting something like,

635
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,320
 it was something ridiculous, like 80 billion pairs of chopsticks a year in China.

636
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,320
 And so in Beijing, there's a bring your own cutlery movement

637
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,320
 where a whole bunch of restaurants now, hundreds of restaurants across the city

638
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
 don't serve cutlery.

639
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,320
 And if you forget to bring your own cutlery, then you're bugged, I guess.

640
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
 It was a really good idea.

641
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
 It was a really good idea.

642
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
 Yeah, yeah.

643
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
 And they used to do it in medieval times.

644
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
 Everyone would have to bring their own knife, yeah.

645
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
 You just have a knife on your belt.

646
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
 And that was the knife you use for meals.

647
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,320
 That's exactly what we wanted in London, people walking around with knives.

648
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,320
 Okay, that's it.

649
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
 That's all of our facts.

650
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
 Thank you so much for listening.

651
