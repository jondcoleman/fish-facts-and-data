00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.640
 Before we get going, I just want to let you know we have a very exciting comedian joining us on the show today.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.680
 So Anna's away for this ep, but in her place we are joined by the brilliant Olga Koch.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.880
 Olga is the perfect fish guest. Not only is she incredibly funny, but she's also an absolute thunderdork.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.980
 She studied computer sciences, she speaks three different languages, she has a very confused and unplaceable accent like I do,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.140
 and she is absolutely blitzing the comedy scene at the moment.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.780
 You will have seen her no doubt on shows like Live at the Apollo, she's done pointless celebrities, and of course she's been on QI.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.040
 But the best place, the absolutely best place to see Olga is Live in person at one of her stand-up shows,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.160
 and she is currently on tour with her new show which is called Prawn Cocktail.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.800
 She's traveling the UK, and then for any Aussie listeners out there, she's heading down under.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.600
 So Aussies go and see her, she's absolutely brilliant live,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.300
 and if you want to get a taste of what a full show by Olga is like, she's actually got a few specials up online.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.380
 So if you go to YouTube, you're going to be able to see her 2022 show Just Friends, the full show is there, check it out,

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.860
 and then on Amazon Prime she has another special called Homecoming.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.900
 Go to her website generally, rockandrolga.com, it has a list of all the things that she's done from podcasts to other bits and pieces.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.880
 But for now, here she is, on no searching as a fish. On with the show.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 [Music]

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:39.160
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.940
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.080
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Olga Koch,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.740
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.460
 and in a particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is Olga.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.180
 The world's best prawn cocktail eater practices his technique with budget meatballs.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.180
 Wow.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.240
 I would say that a prawn is different to a meatball, different enough that I wouldn't think it was useful for my training montage.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.620
 I accept what you've just said, and I challenge you to a better replacement to a prawn, a better budget replacement to a prawn.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.260
 Yeah, can I give you a better replacement to a prawn?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.100
 Please.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.780
 There was a guy called Stefan Gates, who wrote a book about eating insects, and he said if you don't have any prawns,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.500
 let's say you don't live near the sea, then a woodlouse is a good replacement, and it will taste about the same.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.060
 And budget too, I mean, all over the garden.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.580
 Yeah, exactly.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.560
 I don't think I can even picture a woodlouse.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.560
 Is that a caterpillar?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.560
 It's like a pill bug?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.560
 No.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.560
 I regret having that.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.560
 So, insect armadillo.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.560
 So, they're the little gray bears.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.560
 Okay, so then if you de-shell it, it is still soft on the inside.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.560
 It'd be very fiddly to de-shell, wouldn't it?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.560
 For the number that you need as well for the challenge.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.560
 No, I think maybe I'm growing back and saying meatball's fine, as in that probably is the best.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.560
 Maybe grabstick?

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.560
 Yeah.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.560
 I mean, this guy probably knows what he's-- do we know his name?

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.560
 Yes, his name is Jeff Esper.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.560
 Okay.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.980
 And also, a very interesting thing about his technique is that he tries to mimic a prawn

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.820
 cocktail as much as he can, so he does eat them cold, and he eats them tossed in cocktail

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.580
 sauce, as opposed to, like, marinara or whatever you'd have your meatballs with.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.140
 There's this amazing video of him online where you see the practice run where he uses the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.380
 meatballs, and it's so weird.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.060
 He's just on his own in his laundry with a camera running, and he's about to eat eight

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.140
 minutes worth of, like, meatball in his face.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.960
 He says things like, "So, exactly, I'm going to use the same sauce."

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.000
 He's going 90% of the video, so I'm going 100%, and he's given it 90%.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 You know what?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 It's just for YouTube.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Exactly.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Yeah.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.160
 So he's going 90, and then he says, "Really, I should be doing this outside, because I

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.080
 think the competition is outside, and I need to acclimatize."

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.080
 Sorry.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.760
 Which geographical location is this happening in?

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.800
 If it's not the equator or the Antarctic, I don't think he needs to acclimatize.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.400
 Well, that's the thing, so it was too cold for him to do it that day, so he didn't.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.620
 But that factors into it. I guess it messes with your, like, capacity to swallow, your

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.620
 speed.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.620
 Yeah.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.540
 Can I explain one more reason why the meatballs were fine as a substitute?

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.540
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.100
 It's because the sauce is the most important part of this particular competition, because

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.460
 it is a seafood sauce, but it's really spicy.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.380
 It's supposed to be the spiciest seafood sauce you can get.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.980
 Someone who had it said, "It's like being electrocuted when you eat it."

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.980
 And so, really, he's more about getting through all this spicy sauce than it is about getting

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.980
 through the problems.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.880
 Oh, his face almost melted right at the end of the video.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.120
 I watched all eight minutes, and the final mouthful, he's on the brink of vomiting, and

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.080
 you watch for about 30 seconds, whether or not it's going to happen.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.080
 It's really close.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080
 Can I give you a few of his records?

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.080
 His other records?

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.960
 Because Jeff Esper, he's a big, big player in what is known as the MLE, the major league

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.960
 of eating.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.600
 It's an official body, like you'd have the baseball league or the NBA, the MLE exists.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.140
 So he's the record holder at certain points.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.860
 He may have been broken since he set them for spam, eating 9.75 pounds of spam.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:14.300
 Chicken wings, Fortune Bay Indian tacos, pretzels, pizzas, Jack's donut holes.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.300
 Donut holes.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.300
 Yeah.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.300
 Oh, those are a thing, aren't they?

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.300
 Sorry.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.300
 I was thinking.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.300
 It's the bit that used to be in the donut.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.300
 It's not just the answers.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.300
 He's eating them all.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.300
 That's why they're not there.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.300
 Yeah, Texas sausage.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.300
 Yeah, Texas sausage.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.300
 Well, very impressive.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.680
 For me, it seems like, you know, in Olympic swimming, how people get loads of medals because

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.440
 you get a medal for 100 meters, for 50 meters, for 200 meters is all basically the same thing.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.440
 It feels to me like once you can eat a load of shrimp, then you could probably eat a load

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.360
 of donuts and you could probably eat a load of everything.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.360
 Oh.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.360
 He's only got one skill and he's getting all these records.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.160
 I think it's all to do with training, right?

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.120
 Well, I think in major league eating, if you are some plucky kid out of nowhere, the best

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.340
 things to go for are things where you can innovate because there are some which are

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.340
 volume based.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.340
 I see.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.420
 Where you just have to drink as much honey as you can, whatever.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.700
 And that depends on how big your stomach is.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.700
 Exactly.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.700
 That is just about.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.620
 You do have to do that competition in just a top no pants pool.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.860
 But if you're some like, you know, upstart, you might be able to develop a new technique.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.860
 I see.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.940
 So before we started today, you just had a cheese and what was it?

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.940
 Celery.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.940
 Yeah.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.000
 You might come up with a new way of eating that, like taking the celery out first.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Exactly.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.800
 Improving the sandwich by taking out the celery.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.840
 I've already had a lot of slacking off about the sandwich, okay?

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.480
 But you might have exactly a new way to eat corn on the cob faster.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.720
 You could attach it to like a black and decker, so it spins round.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.000
 So those are the ones where if you're trying to get into this game and why would you?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 That's what you should do.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.880
 Arriving in New York City on a greyhound bus, with just a corn in your bag.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.500
 And do you think that you start by going to like breakfast restaurants that have those

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.300
 like breakfast challenges that put you on the, put your photo on the wall and then there's

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.060
 like a Tom Hanks in Elvis, like agent in a corner.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.060
 Yes.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.060
 Smoking a cigar.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.620
 I think you've got promise kid.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.660
 I went to a breakfast place the other day that had a breakfast challenge.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.700
 You had to eat this entire, this huge list of like 40 sausages, 20 eggs.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.740
 It wasn't as big as that, but it was, it looked doable.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.220
 You had 20 minutes to do it.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.460
 And if you managed it, you got the meal for free or you had to pay for the whole thing.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.040
 And there was a leaderboard, right?

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.400
 That had the current champion, Pete Docherty of the Liberties.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.400
 No.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.400
 What?

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.400
 Is that the breakfast that was in the newspapers when you had that big breakfast, wasn't it?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.400
 So no one's beat it since.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.400
 No one's beat it since.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.400
 No.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.400
 Wow.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.000
 I once went to one of these restaurants for like burgers and stuff and my sister ordered

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.960
 the huge sort of challenge thing.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.960
 She's quite small, my sister.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.840
 And she was really getting through it and the waiters are all looking at her going, bloody

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.200
 hell, she's doing good.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.180
 And I just ordered one hamburger and it was really small and I ate it really quickly and

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.060
 I was like, I'm going to get another hamburger.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.920
 And then I got my sister to order it.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:01.060
 So she's wolfing down all this thing and she went, can I have another hamburger please?

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.420
 I read an interview with Jeff Esper.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.420
 Oh yeah.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.260
 His favorite movie is Cool Hand Luke.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.820
 Oh, I haven't seen that.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:13.340
 Well, in it, there's a guy who has to eat 50 eggs in an hour and that's I think why he

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.340
 likes it.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.340
 Paul Newman.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.340
 Paul Newman, yeah.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.340
 No, hang on.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.640
 Paul Newman then opened a very successful line of mayonnaise and salad dressing.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.440
 Was that to eat with the eggs?

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.140
 It was the film viral marketing for Paul Newman Ranch.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.140
 First ever.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.140
 Yeah.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.620
 Because the fastest way to eat 50 eggs is actually whip them up on the mayo, emuls them.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.620
 Oh, really?

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.120
 He doesn't do that in the movie.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.720
 He just numbs on them.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:41.160
 But in the TV ads, he would be walking saying, I like my 50 eggs, 50 eggs per bottle.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.160
 Come on.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.160
 That would be amazing.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.060
 Anyway, this interview then asked Jeff Esper what a movie of his life would be called

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.300
 and he said, Cool Hand Jeff.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.260
 So he's quite a witty guy as well.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.260
 Yeah.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.260
 Poor Jeff.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.660
 We love you, Jeff.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:01.020
 But then in 2023, the second and third place in this shrimp eating competition were Miki,

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.220
 Pseudo and Nick Wehry and they're married to each other.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.220
 Cool.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.220
 Did they meet?

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.340
 Oh, did they meet doing the lady in the tramp?

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:13.020
 But it's like an 18 foot lung sausage and they're both slowly eating towards each other.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.920
 I think they met in the competitive eating sphere.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.920
 That's adorable.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:23.960
 We locked eyes as we were both throwing up 100,000 marshmallows into a bucket.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.360
 And they said they have a child, the two of them, and they said the child can do anything

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.280
 they want when they grow up, except become a competitive eater.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.280
 Why?

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.360
 I think they're just in it and they don't feel like it's a good job to have.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.880
 Feels like you're worried it's going to be a Darth Vader situation where the child's

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.080
 going to knock them off.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.840
 What I want to say about Miki Pseudo is that she is, I believe the reigning champion of

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.580
 the Nathan's hot dog eating competitions, women's category.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.940
 And Nathan's, the Nathan's Coney Island hot dog eating competition is really the biggest

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.540
 competition in the competitive eating league and the one that put competitive eating on

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.540
 the map.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.540
 Major league eating.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.540
 It was born out of Nathan.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.540
 There you go.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.540
 Yeah.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.380
 But it's only been split by gender, I believe since 2011, before that women used to compete

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.300
 with men together and they used to place in the top three routinely.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.780
 And then they split them.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.460
 And I know all this from a book called Raw Dog by Jamie Loftus.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.460
 It's an incredible book.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.460
 I recommend it to everybody.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.800
 And basically they were like, it's going to be the same, it's going to be the same.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.040
 But the men's one is televised and the women's isn't.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.540
 And women get less prize money.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.540
 What?

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.540
 Oh, that's actually quite sorry.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.540
 The men's is televised and the women's isn't.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.540
 Yeah.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.540
 That surprises me.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.540
 You think it would be the other way around.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.900
 I think a lot of perverts would be like nothing more than to see a woman eating 75 pot buns.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.360
 It's either not televised or televised on like ESPN3 as opposed to ESPN1.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.360
 Like it's something like that.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.360
 It sucks.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.760
 And it is the only competitive eating which is gender split.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.760
 It's sausage eating.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.760
 Right.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.760
 It's the only one.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.760
 Oh, really?

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.760
 All the others are mixed.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.760
 Oh, I was like, is that an innuender?

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.760
 You're like, no.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.760
 That's up to the audience to make the innuender there.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.420
 I'm just trying to picture you pitching why it should be back on TV and really isolating

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.420
 the pervert market.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.420
 Yeah.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.420
 I was thinking.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.420
 They got big bucks.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.220
 I would do an incredibly subtle pitch, which made it very, very clear who's tuning in.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.220
 Joey Chestnut.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.220
 Yeah.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.060
 So he's managed 76 hot dogs in one go.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.600
 And I think, I think we may have even mentioned before the thing to do is to dip the bun in

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.520
 the water so it gets all slides down, slides down.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.800
 But I love this, the 1984 competition.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.800
 I think this was Nathan's.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.800
 I'm not sure.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.800
 It might have been a different league one.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800
 It was one by someone.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.960
 She was a 17 year old West German judo.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.960
 What do you do?

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.960
 A judo artist?

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.960
 Judoka.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.560
 And she had never had a hot dog before the competition.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.560
 No.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.560
 But then that's that.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560
 Incredible.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.560
 And you're like, oh my God, this stuff is incredible.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.560
 I could eat a million.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.560
 Yeah.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.860
 And that was incredible.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.900
 Was it like she looked at it and she'd never seen one.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.140
 So she didn't know how to eat it.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.700
 And she was like, maybe I just have 10 of them in my mouth.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.700
 She innovated.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:50.800
 Where did they find a German who's never had a salsa?

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:59.020
 Apparently Chestnut, Joey Chestnut was saying, once you have that many hot dogs, you immediately

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:04.380
 need the toilet and the problem, they don't really digest fully.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.060
 So you kind of shit hot dogs out.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.060
 Clean out.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.060
 Clean out.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.060
 Come on.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.060
 That's what he said.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.060
 How can you tell the difference, realistically?

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.560
 I think when you feel a solid hot dog coming at you for 35 times.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.800
 The fun also comes out of that stuff.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.640
 His shit is inside the bun.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:25.320
 Let me tell you a little something about corn.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.920
 Also I'm basically the Nathan's hot dog eating contest was put on the map in the mid-2000s

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:36.580
 by a Japanese competitor called Tekeru Kobayashi, Tekeru Tsunami Kobayashi.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.440
 And then he basically made it super popular in America.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.760
 And then Joey Chestnut was introduced to him as like the American down home alternative.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.380
 And so it was again, it's the Nathan's hot dog eating competition is a story of sexism

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.320
 and racism and hot dogs.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.220
 And the advertising, they mostly stress the hot dog part of it, don't they?

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.220
 Fine friend.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.220
 Fine friend.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.360
 And then you get perverts into that fantastic strap line.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.020
 Do you know what chipmunking is?

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.180
 You might have seen this in your...

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.640
 So I would think it's like, oh, you know I hadn't thought of it and then Dan just did

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.640
 an action.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.640
 I did an action.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.640
 Yeah.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.640
 It's storing in your cheeks.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.640
 That's it.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.640
 That's it.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.640
 Now.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.640
 Were you going to say it was like getting naked at dad's seat?

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.180
 I was just thinking speaking in a very high pitch voice.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.800
 As you might expect, given what we're talking about, it's absolutely a dance thing.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.640
 The press conferences would be great though in the lead up order.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.840
 It has to be in your mouth, right?

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.480
 The food before the count ends, right?

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.900
 So if you're counting down, you know, you've got 10 minutes to eat this many, whatever.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.440
 The food has to be in your mouth and then you get a 30 seconds to swallow it.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.440
 So often the photo finish bit is just, right, just get all of this in your mouth.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.440
 Yeah.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.080
 As long as you get 30 seconds after the clock stops, they used to be all you had to do was

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.940
 swallow it in a timely manner.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.940
 That's all it said.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.940
 Right.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.500
 And they didn't say it was exactly 30 seconds.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.940
 And then there was a guy called Crazy Legs Conti who lost a competition because he couldn't

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.340
 eat it in a timely manner and they thought we're going to have to make it a proper time.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.340
 I think that's right.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.960
 It's like I've started to finish or the bell, the quiz bell goes.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.220
 This makes sense of the final few seconds of Jeff Esper's practice for the prom cocktail

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.620
 because he goes over eight minutes.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.020
 He stops the clock and he has a mouth that is absolutely and I'm going to spit it out

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.000
 and he's, so that's what it is.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.640
 He's using his 30 seconds.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.640
 He's chipmunking.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.640
 Clever.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.640
 I'm very clever.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.640
 Crazy Legs.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.640
 Just probably mentioned him, James.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.440
 He, I read an article, it's his legal name, Crazy Legs Conti.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:37.240
 He compares, I'm quoting here from the article, compares professional eaters to musicians.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.960
 He says the way eaters move and shake is an effort to get breath out of the esophagus,

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.480
 stomach and lower intestine as trumpeters would with their instrument.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.480
 That's interesting.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.920
 You know, circular breathing where you can play like a didgeridoo without breathing because

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.980
 you breathe through your nose and out of your mouth.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:51.980
 Do you reckon they tried that?

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.220
 That could be a new innovation.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.220
 Yeah.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.220
 Is the breath sausage in this?

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.320
 I mean, you shove as much sausage in your mouth while breathing through your nose is

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.320
 what I should say.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320
 Maybe.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.320
 Yeah.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.320
 Yeah.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.320
 Right.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.320
 But like maybe the sausage in the nose is the Fosbury flop moment that no hero has

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.320
 managed to achieve yet.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.320
 Oh, right.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.320
 You found two more entry points.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320
 Yeah.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320
 Right.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.320
 Interesting.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.320
 The perverts.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:20.320
 That's it.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.320
 They're tuning in.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.320
 Okay.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.320
 It is time for fact number two.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.320
 And that is James.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.320
 Okay.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.920
 My fact this week is in the Archie language of southern Russia, a single verb can have

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:35.040
 one million, five hundred and two thousand, eight hundred and thirty nine possible forms.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.560
 Is that normal for most languages or?

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.560
 It is not normal.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.880
 How I would say what's a close second.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.160
 So if you think that in English, like to podcast, right?

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:51.960
 So you podcast, she podcasts, I was podcasting, I podcasted and there's not much else because

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.960
 they're all just.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.960
 I would have been podcasting.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.960
 Yeah.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.960
 I guess.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.960
 But then that's kind of the same ending.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.960
 No, this is tenses as well.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.960
 Okay.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.200
 So in Russian, obviously you would have I, you, she, they, all that kind of stuff.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.800
 But also you have the past tense, which would be different for masculine and feminine.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.640
 You would have the future tense.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.720
 You have gerunds, you have participle, you have all sorts of stuff in Russian, but it's

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.240
 manageable because I've studied it and it's manageable.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.320
 But in Archie, it just goes crazy.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.880
 You have, as well as masculine and feminine, you have different terms for domestic animals,

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.720
 for wild animals, for young animals, old animals.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.640
 So if you say the pig podcasted, you would need to know if it was a wild pig or a domestic

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.640
 pig to know how.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.360
 Which was always my number one.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.160
 You have a different, if it's insects, it's a different ending.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.520
 If it's mythical beings, musical instruments, serials, abstract concepts, they all have

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.520
 different endings.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.520
 Everybody's got a podcast.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:55.600
 How does anyone learn it or get anything done?

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600
 Yeah.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.840
 I think you just, most of it, you just naturally pick up these kinds of things if you live

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.840
 in it.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.040
 Because before you get to that word, you'd have to stop and investigate.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.040
 All right.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.080
 So, wild or domestic, a live or dead.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:15.000
 But also, like the number of things, so if it's one thing or two things or many things,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 it's different.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.280
 Imagine solving a crime based on a phone call because you know that the verb was referring

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.120
 to a thing and you can investigate what that thing was.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:31.920
 We know that they have a wild insect who has a podcast and also it's different depending

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.560
 on how you know it's being done.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.200
 So if you know it's happened, it's different.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.680
 If you're speculating it's happened, it's different.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.400
 If you're admiring something that's happening, it's different.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.360
 If something's forbidden, it's different.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.120
 And you can mix and match all of these different things to get to 1.5 million.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:52.560
 I admired the Forbidden Tame Young Locusts podcast, podcasting, whatever.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.560
 But you think about that.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.560
 You had to use so many words to say that, right?

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.560
 Yeah.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.200
 But they would be able to say it in one word because they would know all of the endings.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.720
 They'd be like, well, that's implied by the way you say it.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.960
 It just stays the same, like all of that stuff.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.200
 You could just say the Locust podcast is so you just a verb and a noun and you would get

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.560
 all of that information by all the different endings.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.960
 It's like anti-German.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.960
 It's the most efficient.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.960
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.560
 As a result, has this language become hugely popular and spoken by tens of millions?

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:23.600
 It's spoken by very, very few people in Dagestan in Russia and it's about 20 kilometers away

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.640
 from the village of Sofkra Adnaya.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.800
 Who do you remember?

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.360
 It was the place where everyone knows how to type.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.360
 Oh, no way.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.360
 Yeah.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.800
 There's a village in Russia where everyone knows how to type rope and it's just over

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.240
 the mountain from there.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.240
 What an amazing pocket of the planet.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.240
 Isn't that amazing?

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.240
 This is incredible.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.600
 And I should also say that Andy, once you've learned all of these one million different

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:50.080
 forms of standard verbs, that helps you with about 170 of the most common verbs, but there

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.240
 are more than a thousand exceptions, which you then have to learn on top of that.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.200
 Oh, and the language can be written in Latin script or in Cyrillic and in either way, the

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.560
 language has got 74 letters.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.640
 So you need to learn 148 letters.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.760
 I was going to ask how many letters can there be for there to be this many endings, because

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.760
 you would just run out of letters for even combination.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.760
 Yeah, this is why I failed my Archie GCSE oral.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.760
 That's why.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.760
 I'm so annoyed.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.760
 So yeah.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.080
 It's just a very, very complicated language and it exists.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.280
 Have you heard of the Foreign Service Institute?

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.800
 I think they're an American outfit.

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.800
 Yeah.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.080
 Basically, they sort of rate languages on how hard they are to learn.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.160
 And for English speakers, sorry, native English speakers.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:37.720
 So like French is category one, you know, like romance languages, because English borrows

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720
 a lot from that.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.720
 We derive from that.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720
 Yeah.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.720
 And you already know how to learn.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720
 That's easy for English people to learn.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.800
 And then category three is Indian, various Indian languages in Swahili.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.640
 Category four, it takes 44 weeks to learn.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.040
 It's sort of going up in the number of weeks, so Russian, Hindi, Tamil.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.640
 How many weeks is it supposed to have taken me to learn Russian?

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.640
 Don't worry about it.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.200
 Well, it's taken me five years and I'm intermediate.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.160
 Yeah, that's about right.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.360
 Category five is Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.160
 Category two only contains German.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.160
 Oh.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.360
 Wait, but English is a Germanic language.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.360
 I know.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.360
 What?

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.040
 I think they decided it's a bit harder than French, but it's the only one.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.800
 It's just there on its own in their categories.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.140
 Actually, German does have quite a lot of conjugations, doesn't it, because you speak

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.140
 German a little bit.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.240
 It's not four basic cases.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.240
 Yeah.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.240
 It's not.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.240
 It's all right.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.640
 It's a bit, it's a bit, because like French and Spanish and Italian, they're all kind

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.860
 of debased Latin, if you like, because they just cut out all the complicated endings and

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.860
 you know.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.500
 And it's because as Latin spread.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.080
 Yeah, I guess it's like they're like how to speak it correctly, because I speak fluent

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.540
 German, but I can't conjugate shit.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.700
 I'm just, I'm always like, you know what I'm saying.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.940
 But do you get it right?

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:47.940
 Do you get it right?

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.940
 Even though you?

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.220
 Like sometimes I'll be like, I'll know a noun, but I won't remember its article.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.880
 I'll like gender it just on a guess alone.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.160
 And I'm sure that I'm sure whoever I'm speaking to will kind of guess, but I always get worried

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.160
 about that.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.720
 Because if I get the gender of a noun wrong, though, like they won't know I'm, if I'm

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720
 saying dash table, whatever.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.720
 I know it's not table.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.320
 I can't remember the table either, but like I think and you're just like, that's just

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320
 dirty.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320
 It's not doing changes.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.320
 But it's a dish.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.320
 So it's fine.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.320
 Relax.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:21.160
 Because I read an article where they interviewed 56 native French speakers and they asked them

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.300
 to assign the gender of 93 masculine words.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:30.380
 And they agreed on only 17 of them to assign the gender of 50 feminine words and they agreed

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.380
 on only one.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.380
 Wow.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.380
 It's just vibes.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.760
 I love that.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.580
 This is you fixed German basically for anyone struggling.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.340
 I think that's a good thing in all languages really is that if you just try people will

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.340
 accept it.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.340
 Yeah, that's true.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.820
 Russian language has three, three genders for any noun.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.100
 But if you get it wrong, I'll still know what you're talking about.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.100
 Okay.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.680
 Sorry, maybe I'm making a lot of German and Russian people really.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.680
 Where is Archie on the list?

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.920
 Archie is not on this list.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.920
 I think there's a secret category.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:07.200
 But Russian is difficult because the stress can matter right in words and that can make

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.200
 a big difference.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.600
 So you can see it written down and you wouldn't know necessarily the difference between say

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:19.760
 Muka and Muka where one of them means flower and the other one means torture.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.900
 So if you just see that written down and they don't have the stress-

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.900
 Well, if you have celiac.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.900
 That kind of flower.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.900
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:27.900
 I was thinking that kind of flower.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.900
 Again.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.900
 Oh my God.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:30.900
 Sorry.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.900
 Oh, flower, flower.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.900
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:33.900
 I don't think, is there any way of telling verbally flower?

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.580
 No, context only, I think.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.580
 Flower.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:37.580
 Maybe Irish accent.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.580
 I always say floor.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.580
 People mistake it for the thing we walk on.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.100
 Valentine's Day is always very disappointing though for your wife, isn't it?

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.100
 It's a lovely floor.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.960
 There was a woman, I wish I could remember this now.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.960
 Oh God.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:56.160
 There was a woman in America who was arrested for throwing a pancake at an American president.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.040
 And I can't remember which president it was, but when she was arrested, they asked her

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.560
 about it and she said she couldn't find any flowers, but this contained flower and she

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.500
 thought it would be just the same.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.500
 Was it really?

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.820
 No, like a hundred years ago, easy.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.300
 Do you remember when I made a karate magazine news article for spitting on someone?

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.440
 And that was a misunderstanding of word as well.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.440
 What?

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.440
 Yeah.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.440
 I don't remember this.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.440
 This is in Hong Kong.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.440
 I was in karate monthly.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.440
 That's a news story rather than pictures.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.440
 That's like one of those little...

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.440
 That's where I know you from.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.440
 What?

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.440
 Is this real?

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.440
 Yeah.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.280
 I was studying Kempo at the time, which is a former martial art, and I was sparring

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.320
 with a kid and the guy who's training me, he's called me Danny, and he had a bit of

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.620
 a lisp and he was yelling, "Spin on him, Danny!

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.620
 Spin on him!"

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.620
 To spin kick him.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:48.500
 I was spitting on him, Danny, and I literally spat on his face and they paused the fight

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.120
 and they were like, "What was that?"

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.120
 Is this true?

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.120
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.120
 How old were you?

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.120
 10, 11.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:24:00.100
 I can't believe, like honestly, Dan, I've known you for 20 years, every week, so amazing,

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.100
 isn't it?

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.300
 The insane thing of that.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.540
 It was, yeah, it was in Hong Kong and it was...

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.300
 You were in a karate based newspaper.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.300
 In a magazine.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.300
 Yeah.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.300
 Sorry, in a magazine.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.140
 I guess it's one of those, like, the funny stories kind of bit of it, you know.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.140
 That's funny.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.140
 It wasn't like international karate news.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.140
 It wasn't heavy.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.140
 No, I like, yeah.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.860
 What was the easiest word on the planet?

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:19.860
 The easiest word.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:20.860
 Yeah.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.860
 So is it the most universal?

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.860
 Mama.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.860
 The most universal.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:24.860
 Not bad.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.860
 Hey.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:26.860
 Hey.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:27.860
 Nearly closer, Olga.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:28.860
 Huh?

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.860
 Bingo.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:30.860
 I knew it.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:31.860
 Sorry, I knew it.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:32.860
 She speaks three languages.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.860
 Of course she knew it.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.420
 It'd be incredible if you would just, you genuinely hadn't heard the question because you weren't

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.420
 listening.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.700
 Yeah, we can edit, edit, fix it in post.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.700
 Huh?

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.700
 Yeah.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.700
 Huh?

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.340
 But what can you please quickly clarify?

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.420
 And in every language it's, "Huh?"

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.260
 Because it would be very annoying if you had to say a sentence to say, "Can you quickly

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.420
 clarify?"

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.420
 So that's it.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.620
 And it means that, you know, it can de-escalate tension between you and someone else, even

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.140
 if you don't speak the same language.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:02.620
 But also, does that also mean that the inflection of a question is the same in every language?

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.620
 No, I didn't.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.580
 Because it's not really a sound much, it's much more, it's literally, in my mind, it's

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.820
 just the sound of a question mark.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:13.780
 I think actually that's not true because some languages have question words, don't they,

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.460
 like English and Russian do, like who, what, when, all that kind of stuff.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:22.300
 But some languages, it depends on the inflection about whether it's a question or not a question.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.940
 But English has that a bit, doesn't it, you could say, "I live here?"

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:26.940
 And that's a question.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.940
 Yeah.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:28.940
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.940
 Well, that's an Aussie inflection as well.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:30.940
 That's true.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:31.940
 I live here?

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.940
 In Australia?

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:33.940
 Yeah.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.420
 We had that thing, David Crystal, the linguist, said that the Aussie inflection at the end

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:42.740
 was a useful thing because it was both a, I understand the statement, but I also am

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.420
 asking you, it's up to you, you don't need to pick it up as a question, but it works

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.420
 as a question.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.420
 But you can if you like.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.420
 Yeah.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.420
 With the inflection.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.420
 That feels like a mind game you'd play in like a corporate interview.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.420
 Yeah, exactly.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.420
 You got the job?

00:25:53.420 --> 00:26:00.140
 Just as they're walking out of the door.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.620
 We find them guilty?

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.420
 I need to get something off my chest.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:13.420
 So the closest, so far, so far I've ever been to getting cancelled, is thanks to a joke

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.580
 that I wrote about the word empathy in Russian.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.340
 And so the setup of the joke is the Russian language doesn't have the word for empathy.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.580
 Can you imagine what that feels like?

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.580
 I couldn't.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:29.740
 And so I posted this joke online and the avalanche of Russian people going to correct me, just

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.340
 saying that there is actually a word in Russian for empathy and you're actually stupid and

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.900
 dumb and not a patriot.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:43.080
 But I would say 90% of the corrections were the word for sympathy, obviously, that is

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.020
 very easily checked through Google Translate.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:50.420
 So basically the word that they keep suggesting is sympathy, which is sympathy, which is close

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.020
 to empathy, but not quite.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.700
 Then they'd say, which is compassion, which again is close, but not quite.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:02.220
 And then very rarely they will say, which is essentially the same sort of like, I guess

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:08.100
 Greek root for empathy, which is a word that has not been widely used in Russia up until

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.700
 I want to say two years ago.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.700
 And I know this because there's loads of articles in Russia that are essentially titled, what

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.700
 is this word?

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.700
 Empathy.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.700
 What does it mean?

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.220
 And so the setup of the joke, I feel like I'm in court right now.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:27.180
 The setup of the joke is that I don't even know where I'm going with this, but I just

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.820
 think that it's really funny because they think that I'm sort of trying to smite the

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.580
 Russian people or say that Russians don't understand what empathy is, and surely that's

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:39.420
 something that you can explain in more than just one word.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.460
 And to sort of, I guess, make right with the Russians, I'll share a Russian word that

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.140
 we have that you don't in English.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.260
 And that's listapad, which is the word for falling leaves.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.940
 So it's like rainfall, we have leaf fall.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:53.940
 Oh, that's good.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.940
 And you don't.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.940
 Say it again.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.940
 Because you're stupid.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:03.900
 Yeah, but we can actually have some feelings about it when we see it.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:09.260
 If you're speaking to a Russian, you can tell whether they're a virologist or not by the

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.420
 way they talk.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:16.180
 And that is because in Russian, you have animate and inanimate nouns, right?

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.340
 The endings can change up whether something's alive.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:25.740
 And so virus, virus in Russian, is most people would say it's inanimate, but virologists

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.260
 always think it's alive, a virus.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.500
 Because virus, is it alive?

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.500
 Is it not alive?

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.340
 Actually, nobody really knows.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.940
 But virologists think it's alive, and normal people tend to not say it's alive.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:45.080
 So if you say, "On dal manier corona virus," then that would mean he gave me coronavirus,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.300
 but that would be a person who's not a virologist saying it.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:54.460
 But if you said, "On dal manier corona virus," that would be animate, and it would be a virologist

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.740
 saying it, because they think viruses are alive.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.300
 And how useful have you found this change in your life?

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.140
 Again, I think that you could use that to solve a crime.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.140
 Who was the murderer?

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:09.980
 It was the virologist in the library with a candle set.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:10.980
 Probably with the anthrax.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.420
 Do you want to know a fun fact?

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.420
 Yeah.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.420
 Not on this show.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.420
 You've come to the wrong place, lady.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.020
 So do you know how French kiss is making out?

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.020
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.980
 So the first goodbye is leaving without saying goodbye, or a French exit as well.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:34.060
 In Russian, a buffet is a Swedish table, and a family of three, which is like two women

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.860
 and a man, or whatever combination of genders in a throuplet is a Swedish family.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.860
 Get away.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:40.860
 Yeah.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.060
 So "ménage à toi," which is what we would call it?

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.340
 I don't know, because three people living together.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.340
 It's not a threesome.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.340
 It is a relationship of three.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.340
 I threw up.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.340
 I threw up.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.340
 I'm the only one still saying, "Manage à toi."

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:59.220
 Everyone else said, "Trupple," I know they're all the apps, or the pervert apps.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:11.820
 "Ménage à toi" seeks, loves, ESPN, nostril-based, I've got to be in competitions.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.020
 This is for Olga and James.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.020
 Pee-hole dandruff.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.020
 Is that a...?

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.020
 Don't speak.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.020
 I'm not a native Russian speaker.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.020
 But you love dirty words.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.020
 And that's true.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.020
 Yeah.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.020
 I've never heard of Pee-hole dandruff.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:28.260
 I went on a site where it was sort of like weird, rude words from Russia, and this bottom,

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.780
 have you ever heard of that word before?

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.860
 I have never seen this in my life.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:36.300
 I did move from Russian when I was 14, so maybe it's a sort of high school word.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:40.300
 That word is a 15 certificate, so you wouldn't have known about it.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.460
 See, I don't think it's a real word, but it was on a site.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.460
 What does it mean?

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.860
 It kind of doesn't really mean anything.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:52.420
 It's just a beautiful word for when the pollen falls to the trees.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:57.660
 I can't believe we don't have this word in English.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.820
 Do you know the Bicol language of the Philippines doesn't have...

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:07.220
 It has swear words, but people don't really use them because it has a complete other vocabulary

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.780
 if you're angry.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:12.660
 So you speak normal Bicol, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but as soon as you're angry, you

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.980
 just change all the words that you use so that people can tell you're angry.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.980
 That's great.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:21.140
 So you're saying the same stuff, but it's different using different words for it.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.140
 Using different words, yeah.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.900
 So it's a bit like with my daughter when she does something bad.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.220
 I normally call her jelly, but if she does something bad, I go, "Angela!"

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.220
 Yeah.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.220
 So angry.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.100
 But it's a completely different vocabulary, Ethan.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.100
 Yeah.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.100
 That's good.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.380
 I hate to bring it up, but again, such beautiful evidence and a core case.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.380
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:38.900
 Yeah, it's like, was it a crime of passion?

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.900
 I don't know!

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.900
 That's so good.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:50.020
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.320
 That is Andy.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.620
 My fact is, if cars had improved at the same rate as computers since 1971, they would now

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.260
 be able to travel at nearly the speed of light.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.260
 Wouldn't that be cool?

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.260
 And if my grandmother had wheels.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:07.100
 She would also be traveling at the speed of light.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.420
 They would also be smaller.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.420
 The cars, right?

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.220
 They would be about a half an inch long, unfortunately.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:18.820
 And this is based on something that Gordon Moore, who was the co-founder of Intel, huge

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:23.980
 computer company, said in 1965, he noticed that the number of transistors you can fit

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:29.060
 on a chip, a computer chip, had been roughly doubling every year for the previous 10 years.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.340
 And he said, "This is amazing."

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.580
 And he thought it would keep going.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.580
 He thought the principle would apply.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.140
 Maybe it would be every two years, the number you could fit on a chip doubled.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.100
 And he said, "I think it's good for at least 10 more years."

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.780
 And it actually has stayed true for about 50 years at least since he wrote that.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.660
 And it's slowing down a bit now, but cars would be able to travel at the speed of light

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:53.420
 because the number of transistors you can fit on a computer chip now, it's so huge.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.180
 The numbers are just mind boggling of how much things have improved.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.220
 I suppose the thing was that we got to a speed with cars where we thought there's no point

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.540
 going much faster.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.820
 Is that right?

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.820
 Because of safety reasons and stuff like that?

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.820
 I suppose so.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:10.580
 But if we moved to the speed of light, then we'd also go infinite mass and...

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.580
 Oh, that would slow you down?

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.580
 No, it wouldn't slow you down.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:14.580
 Well, yes, it would.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:17.020
 Well, it would break through the car door, you'd see...

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:21.140
 Well, no, because I saw an interview with Lewis Hamilton the other day and he was talking

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.980
 about how when you're driving a Formula 1 car, everything about the structure of your

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:31.420
 body needs to be as strong as possible because when you take a turn at 180 miles an hour,

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:32.900
 your body does not go with the car.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.420
 They have strong necks, don't they?

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.420
 Yeah.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.620
 I think there's no point getting faster than...

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:41.480
 You get cars that can go 200 miles an hour or faster, but there's no point having them

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.980
 because you can't go faster than that.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:43.980
 No, you're right.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.980
 Spaceships are useful, though.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:45.980
 Yes.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:46.980
 Again, it's really just about transistors.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.180
 I feel like I was completely...

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:54.460
 But am I correct in understanding that I remember this distinctly as an example in a textbook

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:58.860
 that at some point it becomes imperceptible to humans?

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:03.540
 So they tried doubling the amount of pixels in computer graphics, but at some point once

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.180
 you double it, a human eye can't see that it's double?

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.180
 That's really good.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.180
 Oh, that's true.

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.180
 Yeah.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:12.420
 I think a computer screen now can show more colors than the human eye can perceive.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.420
 Yeah, so who's that for?

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.420
 Like a really good one.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.420
 Yeah.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:19.580
 If you were traveling at near speed of light, this is kind of a physics question, really,

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.780
 and you had to take a left, right?

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.780
 Yeah.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.780
 You're in space.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.860
 If you needed an exit sign, but I'm traveling at close to the speed of light, how would

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.860
 you do that?

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.860
 As in you won't be able to see it.

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.860
 Yeah.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.860
 At what point?

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.660
 I don't know how far away would it have to be.

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.060
 That's a really good point.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.060
 Leave it with me.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.060
 All right.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.660
 I'll write to Radbottman Rove.

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:41.660
 Yeah.

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:42.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.660
 He is way more qualified than me to do that.

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:44.660
 All right.

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:45.660
 You want to hear something about transistors?

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:46.660
 Sure.

00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:47.660
 This is, no, genuinely.

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:48.660
 Yeah.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:49.660
 They're unbelievably interesting.

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:50.660
 Transistors.

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:51.660
 Yeah.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.660
 Okay.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.660
 The light would still come to you.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.660
 Oh, my God.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:55.660
 Yeah.

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.660
 Sorry.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.660
 Sorry, Andy.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.660
 Because you're going in the opposite direction to the sign, right?

00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:59.660
 So you're going towards the sign.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.660
 Going towards the sign.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.260
 And you just as quickly.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.260
 Ah.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.260
 So just as fast?

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.260
 Faster, if anything?

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.340
 Well, to the point where you're at at any moment, it would just get you at the same

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.340
 speed.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.540
 I think it still needs to be a big sign from that distance.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.540
 Yeah.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:13.540
 Staying left here.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.540
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.020
 I think it's always got to be a big sign in space.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.620
 It's always got to be a big sign in space.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.620
 Happy with that, then?

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.620
 Yeah.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.620
 Yeah.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.620
 That was great.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.620
 Back to your transistors.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.620
 Oh, thank you.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.620
 Yeah.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.620
 Okay.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.620
 I just, like, here's the thing.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.620
 Right.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:28.620
 1971, Intel released their first ever microprocessor.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.620
 All right.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:30.620
 No.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:31.620
 Absolutely not.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:32.620
 No, no, no.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.620
 No.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.620
 The chip was 12 square millimeters.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.620
 Right?

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.620
 Picture that.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.620
 12 square millimeters.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.620
 Okay.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.620
 So 3 millimeters, 10s, 4 millimeters.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:40.620
 Right.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.260
 They had 2,300 transistors fitted onto that space.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.980
 It's pretty good, right?

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:49.780
 The gap between each transistor was 10,000 nanometers, which is the size of a red blood

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.780
 cell.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.780
 Just to give you an idea of what.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.780
 Mm-hmm.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.780
 Okay.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.780
 Yeah.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.780
 They had 2,300 transistors fitted into that space, not 2,300 transistors, but 130 million.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.140
 What does that mean?

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.140
 What does it mean?

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.460
 It's insane.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.680
 The gap is 14 nanometers between them.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.680
 Very, very, very.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.300
 I think the transistors are so, they're so tiny.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.940
 They're so sort of impossibly small.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.740
 Basically, and the transistors, we should say, they're like the taps, as in, like, they're

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.740
 either on or they're off.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.740
 Yes.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.740
 They bake up the ones and zeros.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.180
 They bake up the ones and zeros, which change the state depending on whether an electric

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.140
 current is flowing through them or not.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.860
 And your phone has millions of them in it.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.740
 Your phone will have so many millions.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:33.660
 And it's quite, it's obviously really hard to get your head around because the numbers

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.660
 are just so mind-boggling.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:40.540
 Like, in 2015, I mean, nearly a decade ago, the world created 13 trillion transistors every

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:41.540
 second.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.540
 Wow.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.540
 What?

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.660
 We're more, this is basically a transistor planet now, isn't it?

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:47.660
 Like, pretty much.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:48.660
 There's so many of them.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.660
 Yeah.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.540
 And they're now kind of printed directly onto the chips.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.260
 It's not like there's a big pile of...

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.260
 Yeah.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.260
 Someone's shot.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.260
 Shuler.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.260
 No, I've dropped it.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.260
 I've dropped it.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.260
 Nobody moved.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.260
 Nobody moved.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:04.260
 Just one old man in a cave in Turkey who's just putting each one together.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.260
 Yeah.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.260
 It's just mind-blowing.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.300
 And this stuff is what the entire world has made of.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:12.220
 All the, everything you're listening to this podcast through is transistor based.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.420
 It's all based on this stuff.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:17.900
 And it's so far beyond most people's comprehension, unless you spend years on it.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:18.900
 You know.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.900
 It's insane.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.900
 It's so big, aren't they?

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.580
 It's just hard to really get your head around any of the numbers.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.580
 Yeah.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.740
 Like, for instance, the new Google computer, the quantum one that they're supposed to

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.220
 have made and no one's sure if they've made it or not.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.580
 If they have, then...

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.820
 That's so funny for a quantum computer.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.820
 Yeah.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.580
 Yeah, it exists and it doesn't exist at the same time.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.580
 Yeah.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:43.220
 It can do as many calculations in two seconds as if you've got the entire population of

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:47.780
 India to do a sum every second since the beginning of the universe.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.780
 Wow.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.740
 That would be the same as this computer can do in two seconds.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.860
 And again, that's, it's so hard to understand.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.860
 It's amazing.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.860
 Wow.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.820
 And the reason the transistors have been getting so much smaller is partly, is a really good

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:05.020
 thing partly because when they get smaller, you get less electricity wasted and less heat

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.020
 wastage.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.020
 Yeah.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.740
 Obviously, the process generates a lot of heat.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:12.380
 So actually making them smaller means you save huge amounts of energy, which is part

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.180
 of the reason they can do it and that it's a good thing.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.500
 Because I think Ma said at the very start, he said one of the problems is going to be

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.300
 we're going to get more and more transistors, but everything's just going to get hotter

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.300
 and hotter and hotter.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.300
 Yes.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.420
 And if you've got a million transistors in your phone, you just won't be able to pick

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.420
 it up.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.180
 It'll just set fire to the table as soon as you put it on the table.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.180
 Exactly.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.700
 But then they found that ways to counteract that.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.700
 Yeah.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.700
 Yeah.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.700
 But now they are so small.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:39.140
 Again, this is mad that quantum effects are starting to come into play and the gates are

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.940
 no longer functioning properly because they're so small that you get some electrons leaking

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.980
 through even when it's supposed to be off because they're now down to kind of electron size.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:47.980
 Right.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:48.980
 The barrier in the gate.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:53.180
 So they're having to work out new shapes of transistor to re-exert some control over

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.500
 this gate because it's too leaky for individual electrons.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.140
 I've got a question for Dan.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.140
 Oh yeah.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.140
 You're travelling on an electron.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.140
 Yeah.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.180
 There's a neutron on your left hand side.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.180
 Yeah.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.060
 How big would the sign have to be in order for you to see it?

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:11.820
 For me to, well, I'm glad you brought that up because I did have a additional question

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:16.500
 I wanted to ask earlier, which is how, if you saw the sign saying take a left, you're travelling

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.500
 near to the speed of light.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.500
 Yeah.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.500
 You're going to have to slow down.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.620
 How far away does the sign need to be for you to de-accelerate?

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:22.620
 Decelerate.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.620
 Decelerate.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.780
 Where you go slow enough that you can take a left.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.340
 I mean, it depends how fast you're going because you said it's close to the speed of light.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.340
 Is it 99% the speed of light?

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.340
 Yeah.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.340
 Is it 98%?

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.340
 Is it 97%?

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:39.340
 That's a classic follow-up question of a person who does not know the answer.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:44.060
 I've just suddenly remembered this is to do with cars, but also to do with transistors.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.940
 And I remember that there was a guy, the co-creator of the transistor, won a Nobel Prize for it.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.300
 I'm going off the top of my head here, but he's one of the only few people to win two

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.340
 Nobel Prizes, right?

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:59.100
 So the second time that he got announced as the Nobel Prize winner, there was a party

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.300
 that was going to, because you know they kind of know that something's coming up, was being

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.380
 thrown for him.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:08.260
 And he almost didn't make it to the party because he couldn't open his electric garage because

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.260
 the transistor had broken that allowed for it to switch over.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.260
 Lovely.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:15.620
 And he had to come and pick him up and take him to the party.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.620
 More, Gordon Moore.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.700
 He was a very cool guy, very interesting guy, co-founded Intel.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:25.140
 He became incredibly rich obviously and gave loads and loads of his money away to protect

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.940
 the Amazon, protecting Salmon Rivers because he's a very keen fisherman.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:32.980
 But he founded Intel with Robert Noyce, was his colleague.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.980
 Noyce.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.460
 And they invented Brooklyn Nine-Nine, didn't they?

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.580
 They wanted to call the company More Noyce.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:40.580
 More Noyce.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.500
 This is more Noyce than anything else.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.900
 And certainly they thought it wouldn't be right for an electronics company, it wouldn't

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.900
 be appropriate or something.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.900
 Really?

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.900
 So they called it Intel.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.900
 Noyce Computers.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.900
 Intel.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.900
 I know.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.900
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:56.340
 But I also love that his sort of contribution to managing is just coming to his team every

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.260
 year and saying, "Double it."

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.260
 Yeah.

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.260
 That's it.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.260
 Well, yeah.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:05.980
 Because actually quite a lot of it with Mars Law became like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.340
 They knew that it was going to have to double in a year or in two years and so that's what

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.340
 they did.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.140
 They hadn't gone faster but they were like, "Oh no, it has to do this."

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.140
 Right.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.820
 It's still holding up, I think.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.020
 It depends who you speak to.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.060
 People have been predicting that it's kind of, we can't possibly keep on doubling it every

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.380
 two, and maybe it's now close to every three or something.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.380
 But it's...

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.260
 Well, have you heard of Bremerman's Limit?

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.260
 No.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.260
 Bremerman's Limit.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.940
 So there was a guy called Hans Bremerman and he said that there was a limit on the maximum

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:35.740
 rate of computation that could be achieved in a self-contained system in the material

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.740
 universe.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.460
 So we would get to a limit of how much...

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.460
 I see.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.460
 And he used...

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.540
 I don't understand the mathematics of it, but he uses Einstein's equations in order to

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.540
 make sense of it.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:53.840
 So Bremerman, who was born in Bremen in Germany, to Bernard Bremenent and Bertha Bremenent.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.840
 Really.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.840
 So cool.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:01.020
 Do you know what the fastest supercomputer in England is called?

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.020
 In England?

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.020
 Oh.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.020
 So is it a classic English name like Nigel or...?

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.020
 Yeah.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.020
 It is.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.020
 Less patriarchal.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.020
 Betty.

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.020
 Betty.

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.020
 That's nice.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.780
 Betty is the 457th most powerful computer in the world.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.700
 Have you got a list that goes up to the 457?

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:20.700
 It goes up to 500.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.180
 I'll say Elizabeth.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.180
 No.

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.180
 Oh.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.180
 Okay.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.180
 I mean, it's almost impossible to guess.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.180
 Oh, no.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.180
 Okay.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.180
 Well...

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.180
 But it's a woman's name.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.180
 It's a woman's name.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.180
 It's a woman's name.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.180
 Okay.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.180
 It's quite an old-fashioned woman's name.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.180
 Apologies to any of the people with this name.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.180
 Oh.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.180
 Margaret.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.180
 Oh.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.180
 It's Dawn.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.180
 Dawn.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:45.500
 Dawn is the fastest supercomputer in England and other supercomputers.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:52.820
 Robert is the 103rd, Alex is the 187th, Gene is the 288th, and Henry is the 293rd.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.900
 Some of the most uninspiring names.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:56.900
 It feels that way, doesn't it?

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.700
 Well, because Dawn is really good because you can say the dawn of a new age, or as you

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.700
 can't say, this is the Robert of a new age.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:08.420
 Maybe supercomputers stop being super, like surely supercomputers from 20 years ago are

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.420
 no longer super.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.420
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:11.420
 Great point.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:12.420
 It's all the number of calculations per second, isn't it?

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:13.420
 Yeah.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.420
 And surely the bar keeps rising.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.420
 Right?

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.420
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.540
 We had, using old computers, a very big problem a couple of years ago, four years ago.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:24.220
 So while the pandemic was breaking out, one thing that went a bit unnoticed is that hundreds

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.740
 of places got hit by the Millennium Bug Y2K.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:27.740
 What?

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.740
 In 2020.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.740
 In 2020.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.740
 Yeah.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:31.740
 Why?

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.740
 Because what happened was at the time.

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.860
 It was a big problem, right?

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:37.060
 The problem was is that when we hit 2000, the computers thought it was 1900.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.060
 Yeah.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:39.060
 So it was jumping backwards.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:43.780
 So you would go 1997, 1998, 1999, 1900.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.780
 Yeah, exactly.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:45.780
 And that was going to mess up.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.780
 And I was going to mess up everything.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.620
 That's the best setup for a romcom I have ever heard in my life.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:54.020
 A singleton in 1999 at a New Year's party travels back in time and falls in love with

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.020
 someone from 1900.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.020
 That's great.

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.020
 That's great.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.100
 That's very nice with a computer that glitches and gets them.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.100
 Yes.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.140
 But what ended up happening was in that period where everyone was desperately trying to fix

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:09.340
 the Y2K bug, they changed the coding so that was 2020.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:12.980
 And they thought what would happen is, so 20 became the number, right?

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.340
 And they thought in the 20 years subsequent, they're going to become obsolete.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.420
 We'll have new computers.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:18.500
 This is not going to be an issue.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.500
 I see.

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:23.620
 So computers thought it was 2020, but actually it was 2000, is that right?

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:24.620
 Yeah.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:25.620
 Yeah.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.780
 Exactly.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.980
 So then we got to 2020 and everyone went, like Brexit, we've been kicking it down the

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:31.980
 road.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.980
 We kicked it down the road.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.780
 Now a lot of places had changed their systems, but a bunch hadn't.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:40.620
 So there was, and it was weird things like there was a version of the game of WWF, which

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.740
 crashed because it was an online download.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:43.740
 Oh my God.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.740
 So they had to agree.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:45.740
 What did we do?

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:49.580
 Because I thought like planes were going to fall from the sky and stuff.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.860
 Not people won't be able to play WWF on the place.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.660
 We now work out how Dad knows about this problem.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.300
 His plans for lockdown were completely right.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.020
 This is a huge issue.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.580
 We could download WWF, also other things.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.700
 I imagine that.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:09.420
 Oh yeah, and 5,000 players fell out of the sky.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.420
 Yeah.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.980
 And it was like things like grocery stores that had till systems that were automated.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:14.980
 Right.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:15.980
 Suddenly those were crashing.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:16.980
 So you couldn't buy the game in the first place.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:17.980
 Exactly.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:18.980
 It was a nightmare.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:19.980
 It was horrible.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.980
 There was a website called Splunk, which suffered from it.

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:23.980
 Not Splunk!

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:28.260
 Splunk is a website that looks for errors in computers.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.620
 How did you accidentally end up on that website?

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.820
 I'll tell you one more thing.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.820
 Yeah.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:35.820
 Okay.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.260
 This is about how your phone CPU is made, sort of, what is that, central processing unit?

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:40.260
 Yes.

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.260
 Okay.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.740
 This is from an interview with a guy called Chris Miller, who's written a book called

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:43.740
 Chip War.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.740
 Okay.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:45.740
 I'm quoting him directly.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.620
 "This is what gets into your modern phones, right?

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:52.820
 A ball of tin falls at a rate of several hundred miles an hour through a vacuum.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.500
 It's only about 30 millionths of a metre across."

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.500
 Okay.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:57.500
 Small ball of tin.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.620
 "It's pulverized by two shots from one of the most powerful lasers ever deployed and

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:06.700
 explodes into a plasma measuring several times hotter than the surface of the sun.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:14.100
 This plasma emits extreme ultraviolet light at exactly the right wavelength of 13.5 nanometers,

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.740
 which is then collected via a dozen mirrors, which are themselves the flattest mirrors

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:20.020
 humans have ever produced.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:23.900
 The mirrors reflect the light at just the right angle so it hits the silicon wafer and

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:27.940
 carves the circuits onto the chips that make your iPhone possible."

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:28.940
 What?

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.060
 "And that's so that Dan can play WWF games on his phone."

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.100
 It's the biggest step down for this system.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.100
 Isn't that nuts?

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.460
 I don't think I understood any of that.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.460
 I'll be honest.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.460
 I'm clinging on.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:41.460
 I mean, it's incredible.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.460
 Oh, we should say, Kenny Stoltz, a listener sent that in a little while ago, that interview

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.460
 with Chris Miller.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.620
 It's just, hey, it's nuts, isn't it?

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:51.420
 These machines, they're so accurate that it's like shooting a laser from the moon and hitting

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.100
 an individual coin on Earth.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:57.060
 Apple deserve every penny they get, don't they?

00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:00.700
 Especially the podcasting team.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:10.420
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.540
 My fact this week is that on the same day that Joni Mitchell released the Greatest Hits

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:18.700
 album, she also released a Greatest Misses album.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.700
 Brilliant.

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:20.700
 Yeah.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.700
 So good.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:22.700
 I know.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.700
 Is it terrible?

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.700
 Like, is it absolutely awful?

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:26.700
 Bad songs.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.700
 A case of you is on it.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.700
 What's that?

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.700
 So good.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.700
 That's one of her songs.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.700
 Okay.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:33.700
 Yeah.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:34.700
 But I mean, it's a collection from other albums, right?

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:35.700
 Yeah, exactly.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:36.700
 It's her favorite ones that weren't commercially successful.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:37.700
 Exactly.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:38.700
 That's right.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:39.700
 Okay.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:43.900
 And she was so happy with it, she tried to release Misses 2, but the record label rejected

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:44.900
 that.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.060
 And the only reason it came out, the record label didn't want to do it, but it was like

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.060
 a compromise.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.060
 It was a bargaining.

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.420
 She said, "You can do the greatest hits if I can do the greatest misses."

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.420
 Yeah.

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:53.820
 I don't know much about Joni Mitchell.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:54.820
 She's an incredible artist.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:48:00.020
 I mean, you know, she's, she had a really nice moment a few weeks ago at the Grammys.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:01.420
 She performed for the first time.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.060
 She's 80 years old.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:04.060
 She sang a song.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.060
 Not for the first time.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.060
 Yeah.

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.060
 For the first time ever.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.060
 How's she ever...

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.100
 Yeah, she's never, she's won, I think, 10 Grammys, but she's never performed at the

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.100
 Grammys.

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:12.100
 Oh, at the Grammys?

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.100
 Yeah.

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.100
 Sorry, you said she performed for the first time.

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:16.420
 I think I said where she performed at the first time.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.420
 No, right, right, okay.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:21.100
 Regardless, she's 80 and she sits, you know, in a chair, she sings this beautiful song.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:25.660
 She wins a Grammy for best folk album, for a live album that she did, which is a bit

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:29.700
 annoying, I think, for the other folk artists, I would say.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.700
 Okay.

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.740
 Controversial, okay.

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:38.340
 And yeah, she's someone who was a part of the whole scene with Dylan, Bob Dylan, and

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.980
 Leonard Cohen and all that, for listeners that don't know her.

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.700
 You won't find much of her stuff on Spotify.

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:46.220
 She's one of those artists where you probably have to go to YouTube or...

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:48.900
 She took it off because of Joe Rogan, right?

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:49.900
 Did she?

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:50.900
 Yeah.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.180
 Yeah, Joe Rogan was Spotify.

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.180
 Yeah.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:55.180
 Exclusive.

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.180
 Exclusive, right?

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.580
 And he was saying some things that people didn't agree with.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.700
 I've got to say, I'm a big fan of Spotify as I am with Apple and all podcast profiles.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.660
 I'm so glad that the end to that sentence wasn't Joe Rogan.

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.660
 I had to say, I'm a big fan.

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:11.100
 Yeah, but a load of people took their stuff off Spotify because of that, and she was one

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.100
 of them.

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.700
 I mean, do we know it wasn't because of us, because we are on Spotify?

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.100
 Yeah, but we're not an exclusive Spotify.

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:21.300
 Maybe it was Parenting Hell with Josh Wickham that she hated.

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.300
 Wow.

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.300
 Okay.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:24.300
 She's amazing.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.300
 She's pretty cool.

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:30.900
 She had polio when she was nine years old, and interesting thing about that is I was

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.260
 reading about other people who had polio around the time.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:38.740
 Mia Farrow had polio when she was nine, and she wrote that she was taken to an isolation

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:43.420
 unit because it's catching polio, obviously, and she was taken away from all of her family

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:46.500
 for months, and all of her belongings were burned.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.020
 Is this Mia Farrow?

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:49.020
 Right.

00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.020
 Blimey.

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.020
 It's not amazing.

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:52.860
 You're basically, at nine years old, you've got this disease.

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.580
 They take you away, and they burn everything that you own.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:50:00.100
 Is that the case with polio, that if you touch your toy, you could get it from that, or was

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:01.940
 that a, we weren't sure what it was?

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:02.940
 No, it can.

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.700
 It can go through bodily fluids and stuff like that.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.980
 Obviously, we have vaccines for it now.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:11.540
 Joe Rogan told me to say that they don't want that.

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:16.380
 No, we have vaccines for it now, so it's not as much of a problem, obviously.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:20.260
 Yeah, it can go through feces, through spits, through esophageal urethra.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.700
 The speed with which we went from Joni Mitchell to feces.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:24.700
 Yeah!

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:28.660
 Well, that's our pipeline, I'm afraid, that's how we roll.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.460
 It comes through our pipeline, yeah.

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:33.860
 No, Ian Dury of Ian Dury and the Blockets had polio as a child.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:34.860
 Did he?

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:35.860
 Yeah, yeah, so a lot of musicians.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:36.860
 Yeah.

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:37.860
 Yeah.

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:38.860
 How interesting.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:43.500
 Supposedly gave her an edge to how she tuned her guitar and so polio, because, Joni, yeah,

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:48.860
 so she got into guitaring about 15 years old at school and she was recovering from polio

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.900
 and it just meant that it must have been harder to tune a guitar for her.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:55.500
 Yeah, it kind of changes the way that your bone structure works and stuff like that.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:59.420
 There was a footballer called Grincha who had polio as a child and it made his legs

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:03.740
 bandy, but it meant that he kind of ran in a way that no one else ran and it kind of

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.860
 helped him to play football, supposedly.

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:06.860
 Right.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:12.380
 She started smoking at the age of nine and she started singing because she wanted to

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:19.180
 get smoking money, so she was in a cafe in Calgary in Canada and she was the resident

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:24.140
 artist and she was drawing people and pictures would go up on the walls and then she needed

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:29.060
 a bit more money, so she started singing and everyone said, "You're a pretty good singer."

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:34.100
 And so she went home and asked her mum if her mum would buy her a ukulele and her mum

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.580
 said, "Who do you think you are?

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:36.580
 Kitty Wells?"

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.060
 A good one.

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.420
 I think it was a different time.

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.140
 At the time, that was probably a really sick burn.

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:50.260
 Kitty Wells, she was the first female country singer to get to the top of the US charts.

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:54.020
 With her song, it wasn't God who made honky-tonk angels.

00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:56.820
 This is the kind of song I'd like to listen to actually.

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:57.820
 Yeah.

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.580
 So was it that she started singing at the age of nine and then people thought, you know,

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:02.780
 what would make this nine-year-old's voice even better?

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:07.100
 Twenty bent on it and it was a day and then she got into it that way.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.460
 It wasn't that.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:14.540
 She started smoking at the age of nine and then at the age of like 14 or 15, she was

00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.060
 like, "I need money for cigarettes."

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:18.740
 So let me write a masterpiece.

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.740
 Yeah, exactly.

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:23.300
 Calgary, Alberta, Canada, that's where Bret the Hitman Heart is from as you would know

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.500
 if you had the WWE wrestling game.

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:30.900
 Oh, you would also know that if you spent any time with Dan over the last 20 years.

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:36.180
 And then she started dating David Crosby from Crosby Stills and Nash.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:42.580
 And Crosby sort of invited Eric Clapton over to kind of check out this Joni Mitchell and

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:48.660
 he said that Clapton sat mesmerised by her playing and her different tunings of her guitar,

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:51.860
 although he also said that it might have been slightly due to the fact of all the weed that

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:52.860
 he'd smelt at the time.

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:53.860
 Absolutely.

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.940
 He said, "I mean, she has no kitty wells."

00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:02.420
 She is, I mean, to watch footage of her in that period is spectacular.

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:03.500
 Her music is extraordinary.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.500
 The songwriting is incredible.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.620
 And Blue is just consistently voted as one of the greatest albums.

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:12.820
 Yeah, it's one of her albums, which is always very near the top of greatest albums of all

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:13.820
 time.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:19.460
 If you're a millennial, you know Joni Mitchell from the heartbreaking scene in the film Love

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:26.060
 Actually, where Emma Thompson receives a gift from her husband, Alan Rickman, and she thinks

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.940
 it's a necklace, but it's really just a Joni Mitchell CD.

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:29.940
 Oh, yes.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:30.940
 And then she's playing it.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:34.340
 And are you saying that, actually, that's quite a good present to give because she's

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:35.340
 an incredible shunter.

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:36.340
 Better than a necklace.

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.340
 Yeah.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:39.580
 But then it turns out he gave the necklace to his mistress.

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:40.580
 That's the thing.

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:44.780
 But if you're going to find out that your husband's taken on a mistress, that's a good present

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:45.780
 to receive.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:46.780
 Oh, yeah.

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.260
 Joni Mitchell is great soundtrack for...

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:49.260
 Right.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.780
 And did they split up because of that moment in the film?

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:52.780
 I don't remember.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:53.780
 I don't think they don't.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:54.780
 No, she takes...

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:55.780
 He takes her back.

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:56.780
 Basically.

00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:00.260
 He very generously takes her back.

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.260
 She takes him back.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.180
 She says, "Oh, he's just been a bit silly until now.

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.180
 It's all fine."

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.180
 She doesn't quite do it like that.

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.180
 Yeah.

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.180
 Well, it's not far off.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:10.740
 Joni Mitchell split up with David Crosby by singing him a song at a party.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.740
 Oh, really?

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:12.740
 Oh, that's brutal.

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:16.340
 He has been cheating on her and she wrote this song, which basically, I haven't heard

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:20.100
 the song, but I imagine in the middle it goes, "You're fucking dumps, mate."

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.100
 Yeah.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:22.100
 Whatever.

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.780
 But she played it once and then he was like, "Oh, that's really good."

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.780
 And she went, "Ugh."

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.940
 And played it again because he didn't get it.

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.420
 Do we know what it's called?

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:31.420
 Do we have lyrics?

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.900
 It's called "The Song About the Midway," but I haven't seen the lyrics.

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:39.420
 I would have called it something like, "Nick is on the backseat," or something that really

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.660
 makes him worried even as you're starting to hear the song.

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:42.660
 Oh, I see.

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:46.140
 When you overdo it on the metaphor so much, people can't quite...

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.140
 The Midway.

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:48.140
 Sorry.

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:51.220
 Is that the rift that goes through Jillingers that you're talking about?

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:56.620
 We're talking about the Battle of Medway.

00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:01.420
 People who've never done their greatest hits album, AC/DC, you know the reason why?

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:02.740
 Because they're all greatest hits albums.

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:03.740
 Yeah.

00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:04.740
 Thank you.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.460
 Is that what they said or are you saying?

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:07.460
 I think we agree.

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.780
 I and AC/DC agree on this.

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:10.780
 Yeah.

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:16.380
 No, I think a lot of artists fear the slight kind of creative death of, "Here are your

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.780
 best songs," and that's it.

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:22.460
 But you can just do another, Aaron Carter, his most requested hit.

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:23.460
 Who?

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.460
 Aaron Carter.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.460
 Aaron Carter.

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.460
 Aaron Carter.

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:27.460
 Yeah.

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.980
 Like the American Backstreet Boys.

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.140
 He was the younger brother.

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:32.460
 He passed away very sadly, not too long ago.

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.460
 Did he?

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:34.460
 Yeah.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:35.460
 I didn't know that.

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:36.460
 Because most...

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.460
 I was looking up a huge list of greatest hits albums.

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:38.460
 Yeah.

00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:39.460
 Long list.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.460
 They're almost all called greatest hits, which I think is quite dull.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.460
 You were looking at this list and then you stopped at A.A.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.460
 Run.

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.460
 Yes.

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:45.460
 Yeah.

00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:47.460
 Anything about ZZ Top?

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:54.140
 That's why you keep coming up with crime things all day.

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:56.300
 It's like, "I've been busted by the alphabet.

00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.300
 I'm gutted."

00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:03.100
 But his was called "Most Requested Hits," which I think is a nice, slight twist

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.100
 on the formula.

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:07.220
 And then the second one is called "Come Get It," the very best of Aaron Carter.

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:11.020
 It must be one of his songs or something, followed by "Too Good, Too Be True."

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.020
 So I just think he's good for...

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.020
 Oh, so they're all greatest hits.

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.020
 Every single one of them.

00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.620
 He's got three albums of greatest hits.

00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:16.620
 So I think that is...

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:17.620
 Wow.

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:21.620
 According to Reddit, and it does seem to be true when I checked it, Kiss have had more

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:25.300
 greatest hit compilations than they have studio albums.

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.300
 Okay.

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.300
 That's great.

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:32.300
 They've had 20 studio albums, and as far as I can see, they've either had 21 or I counted

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.820
 23 greatest hits on them.

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:35.820
 Wow.

00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:40.740
 They did a farewell tour in 2000 and 2001, and since then, they've done 13 tours.

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:41.740
 Hell yeah.

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:42.740
 Isn't that amazing?

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:43.740
 Yeah.

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.820
 Do you know the biggest selling album in America of all time?

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:46.940
 Are they greatest hits?

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:49.660
 I'm going to guess Abba Gold.

00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:52.260
 Well, that's because you've only got to A/B in the alphabet.

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:56.420
 No, it's happened again.

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.860
 It's the Eagles, isn't it?

00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:58.860
 That's correct.

00:56:58.860 --> 00:56:59.860
 Yeah.

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:00.860
 It's the Eagles.

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:02.620
 Now, so this is their greatest hits album.

00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:04.220
 Who here can name a song by the Eagles?

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.220
 How about California?

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.220
 California.

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:07.220
 That's not on the greatest album.

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:08.220
 No!

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.220
 Yeah.

00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.220
 Isn't that incredible?

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.380
 This is from a period where they hadn't yet written that song.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:16.260
 They must have felt like chumps coming up with that song after they've done it.

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:18.260
 We've already done a greatest hit album.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.260
 Oh, man.

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.520
 So this is now Canon.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:25.140
 This is not a greatest hit, and honestly, let's do a few Eagles albums.

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:27.580
 It's their greatest hit.

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:32.140
 The best selling album in the UK is the greatest hits.

00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.140
 Oh, Queen.

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:34.140
 Queen, you got it.

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:39.820
 At the same time, they released Greatest Flicks, which was a video of all their best songs.

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:40.820
 Oh, very cool.

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.380
 And Greatest Picks, which was photographs from that.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.140
 That's really clever.

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.660
 Who here owns Queen's Greatest Hits?

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:48.660
 Yeah.

00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:49.660
 Oh, my God.

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.660
 Two of us.

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:51.660
 Cassettes and then CD.

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:55.860
 So I own it and Dan owns it, and that makes sense, because one in four British households

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.660
 owns Queen's Greatest Hits.

00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:58.660
 Really?

00:57:58.660 --> 00:57:59.660
 It's still, really.

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:00.660
 I think probably still.

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:05.060
 There probably is some generational churn happening, but in 2021, Abba Gold, which is

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:11.660
 the other huge Greatest Hits album after Queens, it got to a thousand weeks in the top hundred

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.660
 chart.

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:13.660
 That's amazing.

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:14.660
 That's amazing.

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:15.660
 It's a perfect album.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:16.660
 Yeah.

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.660
 Perfect band.

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:26.660
 It's not too high way to hell, but it's, by the way, AA, AP, and then AC/DC.

00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:30.660
 Anything about Adam and the Ants?

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:36.260
 There was an album that was released in 1977 by the BBC called Death and Horror.

00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:40.100
 Basically, you know how you can just buy incidental sounds, right?

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.100
 Like a door creaking.

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:43.100
 Yeah, door creaking.

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:46.020
 Sorry, the BBC would have like an archive of incidental sounds.

00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:49.060
 So this was all sounds of horrific things.

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:56.020
 Tracks included head chopped off, assorted creepy creaks, red hot poker in the eye.

00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:57.020
 That was it.

00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.020
 And it was a top 100 charting album.

00:58:58.020 --> 00:58:59.020
 Gaths were crazy.

00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:00.020
 Exactly.

00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.020
 Team Gaths.

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:05.340
 And then this is, this is the one I'd love to get, but I don't think it necessarily would

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:10.900
 have charted, but there was an album called Recorded Delivery by a guy called Yannick Schaefer.

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:15.860
 So basically what he did was he put a dictaphone inside a package and he put it through the

00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:21.820
 Royal Mail and he recorded the entire journey that this dictaphone went on as it was travelling

00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:26.340
 through the parcel, going through the mailbox being picked up, put in the van.

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:29.620
 And so what you hear is whistling postmen just sort of walking along.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.300
 You get sliding van doors.

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.540
 There's lots of clunks.

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:36.180
 You get early morning mail workers talking about their dirty sex lives.

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:41.140
 There's a sudden unexpected shout of, "Anus!"

00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:45.660
 That was me.

00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:48.300
 And 500 of them were printed.

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.500
 Brian Eno said he wished he thought of it first.

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.500
 It was a...

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.500
 It's very Eno, isn't it?

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.580
 It is very, very Eno.

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:57.740
 The first Greatest Hits album ever.

00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.740
 Johnny Maffis.

00:59:58.740 --> 00:59:59.740
 Johnny Maffis.

00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:03.540
 In fact, if you look in the Oxford English Dictionary, it's the first use of the phrase

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.540
 "Gracest Hits".

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.540
 Right.

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.780
 He wrote a single song called Chances Are, which was in Mad Men.

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:09.780
 Well...

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:10.780
 Chances Are he did.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:11.780
 If you remember it.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.780
 I don't know.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:13.780
 He was late 50s, wasn't he?

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:14.780
 So it's perfect timing for Mad Men.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.780
 Yes, he was.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.780
 I looked him up.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.100
 He's still alive, Johnny Maffis.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.100
 Yeah.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.660
 He's sort of mid-90s, I think.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.660
 Cool.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.660
 He's old, but he's still kicking around.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.660
 Yeah.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:28.900
 He was a high jumper for the US Olympic team before he became a singer, but he was kind

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:35.660
 of singing in the clubs and stuff, and the head of popular music at Columbia was on holiday

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:41.100
 in San Francisco and heard him singing and sent a telegram to the company saying, "Have

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:46.340
 found phenomenal 19-year-old boy who could go all the way, send blank contracts."

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.180
 Oh, that's great.

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:51.620
 And he was an Olympian at that time, at 19 or...?

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.620
 He'd been trying out.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.620
 He kind of...

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:54.620
 He got the call to go to the trials.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:55.620
 This is a cool thing.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:00.180
 In 1956, he got the call to go to the Olympic trials, but he had just got his recording contract.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:03.620
 He said to his dad, "Should I become a high jumper or should I become a musician?"

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.260
 It's annoying, isn't it, when people are world-class at not one thing but two.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:11.540
 You could do both Vanilla Ice as a rapper and a real estate agent.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.300
 You could do both.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:19.060
 Well, Cody Simpson, the Australian singer-actor, also swam for their Olympic team.

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.060
 Oh, yeah.

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.060
 Very nice.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.060
 And also is a Gina Davis who almost qualified for Archery for the US.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:24.060
 Oh, that's right.

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:25.060
 Get away.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.060
 There you go.

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:27.060
 You could do both.

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:28.060
 Yeah.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.060
 Okay.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.060
 You can do both.

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.060
 And it's fine that I've done neither.

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:32.060
 Johnny Mathis.

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.060
 It wasn't actually any greatest hits.

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:36.140
 It was just something they rushed out because he was about to go on tour in the UK.

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:39.500
 He didn't have time to record any new tracks, so they just bundled together his first four

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.500
 recordings.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.500
 Oh, is that right?

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.500
 Record them Johnny's Greatest Hits.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.580
 It was in the charts for nine years.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.580
 So they manifested it?

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:46.580
 Pretty much.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:47.580
 Yeah.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.580
 They're like, "The Greatest Hits?

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.580
 Australian and Flucking Question."

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:53.580
 And there's a reason why you'd love him, James.

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.580
 He used to play golf 300 times a year.

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:56.580
 Oh, he sounds great.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.740
 He's a great guy.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.980
 And he has a cookbook library.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.820
 He loves cookbooks so much.

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:03.100
 He bought thousands of them.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.780
 He had Office Kitchen, his own library of cookbooks.

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:10.660
 And in 1982, he wrote his own cookbook called "Cooking for You Alone," which is all about

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:13.620
 meals for one and how you can make them delicious and lovely.

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:14.620
 Isn't that...

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.620
 Isn't that...

01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:17.420
 I just think you seem like a really nice, sweet guy.

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.420
 He's so sweet.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.420
 I know.

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:23.660
 That does sound nice, but if you think that you're going to get a necklace for Valentine's

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:28.660
 Day and you get the meals for one book, that's a real sign.

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.340
 That's how Johnny Mitchell dumped her next boyfriend.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:37.340
 OK, that's it.

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.340
 That is all of our facts.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.700

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.940

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.620
 You'll just be eating it.

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.620
 Don't stop.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:13.540
 And I promise it's going to be 100% high quality prawns and never a cheap meatball.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.540

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:38.180
 Hey, Ness.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:44.140
 Lovely Easter egg.

01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.720
 (upbeat music)

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:56.720
