00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish."
00:00:03,00:00:08,"Before we get going, I just want to let you know we have a very exciting comedian joining us on the show today."
00:00:08,00:00:14,"So Anna's away for this ep, but in her place we are joined by the brilliant Olga Koch."
00:00:14,00:00:20,"Olga is the perfect fish guest. Not only is she incredibly funny, but she's also an absolute thunderdork."
00:00:20,00:00:26,"She studied computer sciences, she speaks three different languages, she has a very confused and unplaceable accent like I do,"
00:00:26,00:00:30,and she is absolutely blitzing the comedy scene at the moment.
00:00:30,00:00:36,"You will have seen her no doubt on shows like Live at the Apollo, she's done pointless celebrities, and of course she's been on QI."
00:00:36,00:00:42,"But the best place, the absolutely best place to see Olga is Live in person at one of her stand-up shows,"
00:00:42,00:00:46,and she is currently on tour with her new show which is called Prawn Cocktail.
00:00:46,00:00:50,"She's traveling the UK, and then for any Aussie listeners out there, she's heading down under."
00:00:50,00:00:54,"So Aussies go and see her, she's absolutely brilliant live,"
00:00:54,00:00:59,"and if you want to get a taste of what a full show by Olga is like, she's actually got a few specials up online."
00:00:59,00:01:05,"So if you go to YouTube, you're going to be able to see her 2022 show Just Friends, the full show is there, check it out,"
00:01:05,00:01:08,and then on Amazon Prime she has another special called Homecoming.
00:01:08,00:01:14,"Go to her website generally, rockandrolga.com, it has a list of all the things that she's done from podcasts to other bits and pieces."
00:01:14,00:01:18,"But for now, here she is, on no searching as a fish. On with the show."
00:01:18,00:01:20,[Music]
00:01:20,00:01:39,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:01:39,00:01:42,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:01:42,00:01:48,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Olga Koch,"
00:01:48,00:01:52,"and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:01:52,00:01:58,"and in a particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is Olga."
00:01:58,00:02:04,The world's best prawn cocktail eater practices his technique with budget meatballs.
00:02:04,00:02:06,Wow.
00:02:06,00:02:14,"I would say that a prawn is different to a meatball, different enough that I wouldn't think it was useful for my training montage."
00:02:14,00:02:21,"I accept what you've just said, and I challenge you to a better replacement to a prawn, a better budget replacement to a prawn."
00:02:21,00:02:24,"Yeah, can I give you a better replacement to a prawn?"
00:02:24,00:02:25,Please.
00:02:25,00:02:31,"There was a guy called Stefan Gates, who wrote a book about eating insects, and he said if you don't have any prawns,"
00:02:31,00:02:37,"let's say you don't live near the sea, then a woodlouse is a good replacement, and it will taste about the same."
00:02:37,00:02:40,"And budget too, I mean, all over the garden."
00:02:40,00:02:41,"Yeah, exactly."
00:02:41,00:02:43,I don't think I can even picture a woodlouse.
00:02:43,00:02:44,Is that a caterpillar?
00:02:44,00:02:45,It's like a pill bug?
00:02:45,00:02:46,No.
00:02:46,00:02:48,I regret having that.
00:02:48,00:02:49,"So, insect armadillo."
00:02:49,00:02:51,"So, they're the little gray bears."
00:02:51,00:02:54,"Okay, so then if you de-shell it, it is still soft on the inside."
00:02:54,00:02:55,"Yeah, yeah."
00:02:55,00:02:57,"It'd be very fiddly to de-shell, wouldn't it?"
00:02:57,00:02:59,For the number that you need as well for the challenge.
00:02:59,00:03:03,"No, I think maybe I'm growing back and saying meatball's fine, as in that probably is the best."
00:03:03,00:03:04,Maybe grabstick?
00:03:04,00:03:05,Yeah.
00:03:05,00:03:08,"I mean, this guy probably knows what he's-- do we know his name?"
00:03:08,00:03:10,"Yes, his name is Jeff Esper."
00:03:10,00:03:11,Okay.
00:03:11,00:03:14,"And also, a very interesting thing about his technique is that he tries to mimic a prawn"
00:03:14,00:03:20,"cocktail as much as he can, so he does eat them cold, and he eats them tossed in cocktail"
00:03:20,00:03:25,"sauce, as opposed to, like, marinara or whatever you'd have your meatballs with."
00:03:25,00:03:29,There's this amazing video of him online where you see the practice run where he uses the
00:03:29,00:03:31,"meatballs, and it's so weird."
00:03:31,00:03:35,"He's just on his own in his laundry with a camera running, and he's about to eat eight"
00:03:35,00:03:38,"minutes worth of, like, meatball in his face."
00:03:38,00:03:40,"He says things like, ""So, exactly, I'm going to use the same sauce."""
00:03:40,00:03:45,"He's going 90% of the video, so I'm going 100%, and he's given it 90%."
00:03:45,00:03:46,You know what?
00:03:46,00:03:47,It's just for YouTube.
00:03:47,00:03:48,Exactly.
00:03:48,00:03:49,Yeah.
00:03:49,00:03:51,"So he's going 90, and then he says, ""Really, I should be doing this outside, because I"
00:03:51,00:03:54,"think the competition is outside, and I need to acclimatize."""
00:03:54,00:03:55,Sorry.
00:03:55,00:03:56,Which geographical location is this happening in?
00:03:56,00:04:00,"If it's not the equator or the Antarctic, I don't think he needs to acclimatize."
00:04:00,00:04:04,"Well, that's the thing, so it was too cold for him to do it that day, so he didn't."
00:04:04,00:04:08,"But that factors into it. I guess it messes with your, like, capacity to swallow, your"
00:04:08,00:04:09,speed.
00:04:09,00:04:10,Yeah.
00:04:10,00:04:13,Can I explain one more reason why the meatballs were fine as a substitute?
00:04:13,00:04:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:14,00:04:18,"It's because the sauce is the most important part of this particular competition, because"
00:04:18,00:04:21,"it is a seafood sauce, but it's really spicy."
00:04:21,00:04:24,It's supposed to be the spiciest seafood sauce you can get.
00:04:24,00:04:27,"Someone who had it said, ""It's like being electrocuted when you eat it."""
00:04:27,00:04:31,"And so, really, he's more about getting through all this spicy sauce than it is about getting"
00:04:31,00:04:32,through the problems.
00:04:32,00:04:35,"Oh, his face almost melted right at the end of the video."
00:04:35,00:04:40,"I watched all eight minutes, and the final mouthful, he's on the brink of vomiting, and"
00:04:40,00:04:43,"you watch for about 30 seconds, whether or not it's going to happen."
00:04:43,00:04:44,"Yeah, yeah."
00:04:44,00:04:45,It's really close.
00:04:45,00:04:46,Can I give you a few of his records?
00:04:46,00:04:47,His other records?
00:04:47,00:04:51,"Because Jeff Esper, he's a big, big player in what is known as the MLE, the major league"
00:04:51,00:04:53,of eating.
00:04:53,00:04:58,"It's an official body, like you'd have the baseball league or the NBA, the MLE exists."
00:04:58,00:05:01,So he's the record holder at certain points.
00:05:01,00:05:06,"He may have been broken since he set them for spam, eating 9.75 pounds of spam."
00:05:06,00:05:14,"Chicken wings, Fortune Bay Indian tacos, pretzels, pizzas, Jack's donut holes."
00:05:14,00:05:15,Donut holes.
00:05:15,00:05:16,Yeah.
00:05:16,00:05:17,"Oh, those are a thing, aren't they?"
00:05:17,00:05:18,Sorry.
00:05:18,00:05:19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:19,00:05:20,I was thinking.
00:05:20,00:05:21,It's the bit that used to be in the donut.
00:05:21,00:05:22,It's not just the answers.
00:05:22,00:05:23,He's eating them all.
00:05:23,00:05:24,That's why they're not there.
00:05:24,00:05:25,"Yeah, Texas sausage."
00:05:25,00:05:26,"Yeah, Texas sausage."
00:05:26,00:05:27,"Well, very impressive."
00:05:27,00:05:30,"For me, it seems like, you know, in Olympic swimming, how people get loads of medals because"
00:05:30,00:05:36,"you get a medal for 100 meters, for 50 meters, for 200 meters is all basically the same thing."
00:05:36,00:05:40,"It feels to me like once you can eat a load of shrimp, then you could probably eat a load"
00:05:40,00:05:42,of donuts and you could probably eat a load of everything.
00:05:42,00:05:43,Oh.
00:05:43,00:05:44,He's only got one skill and he's getting all these records.
00:05:44,00:05:46,"I think it's all to do with training, right?"
00:05:46,00:05:52,"Well, I think in major league eating, if you are some plucky kid out of nowhere, the best"
00:05:52,00:05:55,things to go for are things where you can innovate because there are some which are
00:05:55,00:05:56,volume based.
00:05:56,00:05:57,I see.
00:05:57,00:06:00,"Where you just have to drink as much honey as you can, whatever."
00:06:00,00:06:02,And that depends on how big your stomach is.
00:06:02,00:06:03,Exactly.
00:06:03,00:06:04,That is just about.
00:06:04,00:06:10,You do have to do that competition in just a top no pants pool.
00:06:10,00:06:16,"But if you're some like, you know, upstart, you might be able to develop a new technique."
00:06:16,00:06:17,I see.
00:06:17,00:06:20,"So before we started today, you just had a cheese and what was it?"
00:06:20,00:06:21,Celery.
00:06:21,00:06:22,Yeah.
00:06:22,00:06:26,"You might come up with a new way of eating that, like taking the celery out first."
00:06:26,00:06:27,Exactly.
00:06:27,00:06:28,Improving the sandwich by taking out the celery.
00:06:28,00:06:32,"I've already had a lot of slacking off about the sandwich, okay?"
00:06:32,00:06:35,But you might have exactly a new way to eat corn on the cob faster.
00:06:35,00:06:40,"You could attach it to like a black and decker, so it spins round."
00:06:40,00:06:45,So those are the ones where if you're trying to get into this game and why would you?
00:06:45,00:06:46,That's what you should do.
00:06:46,00:06:51,"Arriving in New York City on a greyhound bus, with just a corn in your bag."
00:06:51,00:06:55,And do you think that you start by going to like breakfast restaurants that have those
00:06:55,00:06:59,"like breakfast challenges that put you on the, put your photo on the wall and then there's"
00:06:59,00:07:03,"like a Tom Hanks in Elvis, like agent in a corner."
00:07:03,00:07:04,Yes.
00:07:04,00:07:05,Smoking a cigar.
00:07:05,00:07:06,I think you've got promise kid.
00:07:06,00:07:09,I went to a breakfast place the other day that had a breakfast challenge.
00:07:09,00:07:13,"You had to eat this entire, this huge list of like 40 sausages, 20 eggs."
00:07:13,00:07:15,"It wasn't as big as that, but it was, it looked doable."
00:07:15,00:07:17,You had 20 minutes to do it.
00:07:17,00:07:20,"And if you managed it, you got the meal for free or you had to pay for the whole thing."
00:07:20,00:07:22,"And there was a leaderboard, right?"
00:07:22,00:07:25,"That had the current champion, Pete Docherty of the Liberties."
00:07:25,00:07:26,No.
00:07:26,00:07:27,What?
00:07:27,00:07:30,"Is that the breakfast that was in the newspapers when you had that big breakfast, wasn't it?"
00:07:30,00:07:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:31,00:07:32,"Yeah, exactly."
00:07:32,00:07:33,So no one's beat it since.
00:07:33,00:07:34,No one's beat it since.
00:07:34,00:07:35,No.
00:07:35,00:07:36,Wow.
00:07:36,00:07:39,I once went to one of these restaurants for like burgers and stuff and my sister ordered
00:07:39,00:07:40,the huge sort of challenge thing.
00:07:40,00:07:42,"She's quite small, my sister."
00:07:42,00:07:45,"And she was really getting through it and the waiters are all looking at her going, bloody"
00:07:45,00:07:47,"hell, she's doing good."
00:07:47,00:07:51,And I just ordered one hamburger and it was really small and I ate it really quickly and
00:07:51,00:07:53,"I was like, I'm going to get another hamburger."
00:07:53,00:07:54,And then I got my sister to order it.
00:07:54,00:08:01,"So she's wolfing down all this thing and she went, can I have another hamburger please?"
00:08:01,00:08:03,I read an interview with Jeff Esper.
00:08:03,00:08:04,Oh yeah.
00:08:04,00:08:06,His favorite movie is Cool Hand Luke.
00:08:06,00:08:07,"Oh, I haven't seen that."
00:08:07,00:08:13,"Well, in it, there's a guy who has to eat 50 eggs in an hour and that's I think why he"
00:08:13,00:08:14,likes it.
00:08:14,00:08:15,Paul Newman.
00:08:15,00:08:16,"Paul Newman, yeah."
00:08:16,00:08:17,"No, hang on."
00:08:17,00:08:20,Paul Newman then opened a very successful line of mayonnaise and salad dressing.
00:08:20,00:08:22,Was that to eat with the eggs?
00:08:22,00:08:26,It was the film viral marketing for Paul Newman Ranch.
00:08:26,00:08:27,First ever.
00:08:27,00:08:28,Yeah.
00:08:28,00:08:30,"Because the fastest way to eat 50 eggs is actually whip them up on the mayo, emuls them."
00:08:30,00:08:31,"Oh, really?"
00:08:31,00:08:33,He doesn't do that in the movie.
00:08:33,00:08:34,He just numbs on them.
00:08:34,00:08:41,"But in the TV ads, he would be walking saying, I like my 50 eggs, 50 eggs per bottle."
00:08:41,00:08:42,Come on.
00:08:42,00:08:43,That would be amazing.
00:08:43,00:08:47,"Anyway, this interview then asked Jeff Esper what a movie of his life would be called"
00:08:47,00:08:49,"and he said, Cool Hand Jeff."
00:08:49,00:08:52,So he's quite a witty guy as well.
00:08:52,00:08:53,Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:54,Poor Jeff.
00:08:54,00:08:55,"We love you, Jeff."
00:08:55,00:09:01,"But then in 2023, the second and third place in this shrimp eating competition were Miki,"
00:09:01,00:09:04,Pseudo and Nick Wehry and they're married to each other.
00:09:04,00:09:05,Cool.
00:09:05,00:09:06,Did they meet?
00:09:06,00:09:09,"Oh, did they meet doing the lady in the tramp?"
00:09:09,00:09:13,But it's like an 18 foot lung sausage and they're both slowly eating towards each other.
00:09:13,00:09:15,I think they met in the competitive eating sphere.
00:09:15,00:09:16,That's adorable.
00:09:16,00:09:23,"We locked eyes as we were both throwing up 100,000 marshmallows into a bucket."
00:09:23,00:09:27,"And they said they have a child, the two of them, and they said the child can do anything"
00:09:27,00:09:30,"they want when they grow up, except become a competitive eater."
00:09:30,00:09:31,Why?
00:09:31,00:09:34,I think they're just in it and they don't feel like it's a good job to have.
00:09:34,00:09:36,Feels like you're worried it's going to be a Darth Vader situation where the child's
00:09:36,00:09:39,going to knock them off.
00:09:39,00:09:42,"What I want to say about Miki Pseudo is that she is, I believe the reigning champion of"
00:09:42,00:09:46,"the Nathan's hot dog eating competitions, women's category."
00:09:46,00:09:50,"And Nathan's, the Nathan's Coney Island hot dog eating competition is really the biggest"
00:09:50,00:09:55,competition in the competitive eating league and the one that put competitive eating on
00:09:55,00:09:56,the map.
00:09:56,00:09:57,Major league eating.
00:09:57,00:09:58,It was born out of Nathan.
00:09:58,00:09:59,There you go.
00:09:59,00:10:00,Yeah.
00:10:00,00:10:04,"But it's only been split by gender, I believe since 2011, before that women used to compete"
00:10:04,00:10:08,with men together and they used to place in the top three routinely.
00:10:08,00:10:09,And then they split them.
00:10:09,00:10:12,And I know all this from a book called Raw Dog by Jamie Loftus.
00:10:12,00:10:13,It's an incredible book.
00:10:13,00:10:14,I recommend it to everybody.
00:10:14,00:10:16,"And basically they were like, it's going to be the same, it's going to be the same."
00:10:16,00:10:20,But the men's one is televised and the women's isn't.
00:10:20,00:10:21,And women get less prize money.
00:10:21,00:10:22,What?
00:10:22,00:10:23,"Oh, that's actually quite sorry."
00:10:23,00:10:24,The men's is televised and the women's isn't.
00:10:24,00:10:25,Yeah.
00:10:25,00:10:26,That surprises me.
00:10:26,00:10:27,You think it would be the other way around.
00:10:27,00:10:31,I think a lot of perverts would be like nothing more than to see a woman eating 75 pot buns.
00:10:31,00:10:34,It's either not televised or televised on like ESPN3 as opposed to ESPN1.
00:10:34,00:10:35,Like it's something like that.
00:10:35,00:10:36,It sucks.
00:10:36,00:10:39,And it is the only competitive eating which is gender split.
00:10:39,00:10:40,It's sausage eating.
00:10:40,00:10:41,Right.
00:10:41,00:10:42,It's the only one.
00:10:42,00:10:43,"Oh, really?"
00:10:43,00:10:44,"Yeah, yeah."
00:10:44,00:10:45,All the others are mixed.
00:10:45,00:10:46,"Oh, I was like, is that an innuender?"
00:10:46,00:10:47,"You're like, no."
00:10:47,00:10:48,That's up to the audience to make the innuender there.
00:10:48,00:10:54,I'm just trying to picture you pitching why it should be back on TV and really isolating
00:10:54,00:10:55,the pervert market.
00:10:55,00:10:56,Yeah.
00:10:56,00:10:57,I was thinking.
00:10:57,00:10:58,They got big bucks.
00:10:58,00:11:02,"I would do an incredibly subtle pitch, which made it very, very clear who's tuning in."
00:11:02,00:11:03,Joey Chestnut.
00:11:03,00:11:04,Yeah.
00:11:04,00:11:08,So he's managed 76 hot dogs in one go.
00:11:08,00:11:11,"And I think, I think we may have even mentioned before the thing to do is to dip the bun in"
00:11:11,00:11:14,"the water so it gets all slides down, slides down."
00:11:14,00:11:16,"But I love this, the 1984 competition."
00:11:16,00:11:17,I think this was Nathan's.
00:11:17,00:11:18,I'm not sure.
00:11:18,00:11:19,It might have been a different league one.
00:11:19,00:11:20,It was one by someone.
00:11:20,00:11:23,She was a 17 year old West German judo.
00:11:23,00:11:24,What do you do?
00:11:24,00:11:25,A judo artist?
00:11:25,00:11:26,Judoka.
00:11:26,00:11:29,And she had never had a hot dog before the competition.
00:11:29,00:11:30,No.
00:11:30,00:11:31,But then that's that.
00:11:31,00:11:32,Incredible.
00:11:32,00:11:33,"And you're like, oh my God, this stuff is incredible."
00:11:33,00:11:34,I could eat a million.
00:11:34,00:11:35,Yeah.
00:11:35,00:11:38,And that was incredible.
00:11:38,00:11:40,Was it like she looked at it and she'd never seen one.
00:11:40,00:11:42,So she didn't know how to eat it.
00:11:42,00:11:44,"And she was like, maybe I just have 10 of them in my mouth."
00:11:44,00:11:45,She innovated.
00:11:45,00:11:50,Where did they find a German who's never had a salsa?
00:11:50,00:11:59,"Apparently Chestnut, Joey Chestnut was saying, once you have that many hot dogs, you immediately"
00:11:59,00:12:04,"need the toilet and the problem, they don't really digest fully."
00:12:04,00:12:08,So you kind of shit hot dogs out.
00:12:08,00:12:09,Clean out.
00:12:09,00:12:10,Clean out.
00:12:10,00:12:11,Come on.
00:12:11,00:12:12,That's what he said.
00:12:12,00:12:13,"How can you tell the difference, realistically?"
00:12:13,00:12:15,I think when you feel a solid hot dog coming at you for 35 times.
00:12:15,00:12:17,The fun also comes out of that stuff.
00:12:17,00:12:19,His shit is inside the bun.
00:12:19,00:12:25,Let me tell you a little something about corn.
00:12:25,00:12:30,Also I'm basically the Nathan's hot dog eating contest was put on the map in the mid-2000s
00:12:30,00:12:36,"by a Japanese competitor called Tekeru Kobayashi, Tekeru Tsunami Kobayashi."
00:12:36,00:12:39,And then he basically made it super popular in America.
00:12:39,00:12:43,And then Joey Chestnut was introduced to him as like the American down home alternative.
00:12:43,00:12:48,"And so it was again, it's the Nathan's hot dog eating competition is a story of sexism"
00:12:48,00:12:51,and racism and hot dogs.
00:12:51,00:12:55,"And the advertising, they mostly stress the hot dog part of it, don't they?"
00:12:55,00:12:56,Fine friend.
00:12:56,00:12:57,Fine friend.
00:12:57,00:13:01,And then you get perverts into that fantastic strap line.
00:13:01,00:13:03,Do you know what chipmunking is?
00:13:03,00:13:04,You might have seen this in your...
00:13:04,00:13:08,"So I would think it's like, oh, you know I hadn't thought of it and then Dan just did"
00:13:08,00:13:09,an action.
00:13:09,00:13:10,I did an action.
00:13:10,00:13:11,Yeah.
00:13:11,00:13:12,It's storing in your cheeks.
00:13:12,00:13:13,That's it.
00:13:13,00:13:14,That's it.
00:13:14,00:13:15,Now.
00:13:15,00:13:16,Were you going to say it was like getting naked at dad's seat?
00:13:16,00:13:22,I was just thinking speaking in a very high pitch voice.
00:13:22,00:13:27,"As you might expect, given what we're talking about, it's absolutely a dance thing."
00:13:27,00:13:31,The press conferences would be great though in the lead up order.
00:13:31,00:13:32,"It has to be in your mouth, right?"
00:13:32,00:13:34,"The food before the count ends, right?"
00:13:34,00:13:37,"So if you're counting down, you know, you've got 10 minutes to eat this many, whatever."
00:13:37,00:13:41,The food has to be in your mouth and then you get a 30 seconds to swallow it.
00:13:41,00:13:46,"So often the photo finish bit is just, right, just get all of this in your mouth."
00:13:46,00:13:47,Yeah.
00:13:47,00:13:51,"As long as you get 30 seconds after the clock stops, they used to be all you had to do was"
00:13:51,00:13:52,swallow it in a timely manner.
00:13:52,00:13:53,That's all it said.
00:13:53,00:13:54,Right.
00:13:54,00:13:56,And they didn't say it was exactly 30 seconds.
00:13:56,00:14:00,And then there was a guy called Crazy Legs Conti who lost a competition because he couldn't
00:14:00,00:14:04,eat it in a timely manner and they thought we're going to have to make it a proper time.
00:14:04,00:14:05,I think that's right.
00:14:05,00:14:08,"It's like I've started to finish or the bell, the quiz bell goes."
00:14:08,00:14:14,This makes sense of the final few seconds of Jeff Esper's practice for the prom cocktail
00:14:14,00:14:15,because he goes over eight minutes.
00:14:15,00:14:20,He stops the clock and he has a mouth that is absolutely and I'm going to spit it out
00:14:20,00:14:22,"and he's, so that's what it is."
00:14:22,00:14:23,He's using his 30 seconds.
00:14:23,00:14:24,He's chipmunking.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Clever.
00:14:25,00:14:26,I'm very clever.
00:14:26,00:14:27,Crazy Legs.
00:14:27,00:14:28,"Just probably mentioned him, James."
00:14:28,00:14:32,"He, I read an article, it's his legal name, Crazy Legs Conti."
00:14:32,00:14:37,"He compares, I'm quoting here from the article, compares professional eaters to musicians."
00:14:37,00:14:40,"He says the way eaters move and shake is an effort to get breath out of the esophagus,"
00:14:40,00:14:44,stomach and lower intestine as trumpeters would with their instrument.
00:14:44,00:14:45,That's interesting.
00:14:45,00:14:48,"You know, circular breathing where you can play like a didgeridoo without breathing because"
00:14:48,00:14:50,you breathe through your nose and out of your mouth.
00:14:50,00:14:51,Do you reckon they tried that?
00:14:51,00:14:53,That could be a new innovation.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Yeah.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Is the breath sausage in this?
00:14:55,00:14:59,"I mean, you shove as much sausage in your mouth while breathing through your nose is"
00:14:59,00:15:00,what I should say.
00:15:00,00:15:01,Maybe.
00:15:01,00:15:02,Yeah.
00:15:02,00:15:03,Yeah.
00:15:03,00:15:04,Right.
00:15:04,00:15:06,But like maybe the sausage in the nose is the Fosbury flop moment that no hero has
00:15:06,00:15:07,managed to achieve yet.
00:15:07,00:15:08,"Oh, right."
00:15:08,00:15:09,You found two more entry points.
00:15:09,00:15:10,Yeah.
00:15:10,00:15:11,Right.
00:15:11,00:15:12,Interesting.
00:15:12,00:15:13,The perverts.
00:15:13,00:15:20,That's it.
00:15:20,00:15:21,They're tuning in.
00:15:21,00:15:22,Okay.
00:15:22,00:15:23,It is time for fact number two.
00:15:23,00:15:24,And that is James.
00:15:24,00:15:25,Okay.
00:15:25,00:15:28,"My fact this week is in the Archie language of southern Russia, a single verb can have"
00:15:28,00:15:35,"one million, five hundred and two thousand, eight hundred and thirty nine possible forms."
00:15:35,00:15:37,Is that normal for most languages or?
00:15:37,00:15:38,It is not normal.
00:15:38,00:15:40,How I would say what's a close second.
00:15:40,00:15:44,"So if you think that in English, like to podcast, right?"
00:15:44,00:15:51,"So you podcast, she podcasts, I was podcasting, I podcasted and there's not much else because"
00:15:51,00:15:52,they're all just.
00:15:52,00:15:53,I would have been podcasting.
00:15:53,00:15:54,Yeah.
00:15:54,00:15:55,I guess.
00:15:55,00:15:56,But then that's kind of the same ending.
00:15:56,00:15:57,"No, this is tenses as well."
00:15:57,00:15:58,Okay.
00:15:58,00:16:03,"So in Russian, obviously you would have I, you, she, they, all that kind of stuff."
00:16:03,00:16:07,"But also you have the past tense, which would be different for masculine and feminine."
00:16:07,00:16:09,You would have the future tense.
00:16:09,00:16:12,"You have gerunds, you have participle, you have all sorts of stuff in Russian, but it's"
00:16:12,00:16:15,manageable because I've studied it and it's manageable.
00:16:15,00:16:18,"But in Archie, it just goes crazy."
00:16:18,00:16:22,"You have, as well as masculine and feminine, you have different terms for domestic animals,"
00:16:22,00:16:26,"for wild animals, for young animals, old animals."
00:16:26,00:16:31,"So if you say the pig podcasted, you would need to know if it was a wild pig or a domestic"
00:16:31,00:16:32,pig to know how.
00:16:32,00:16:36,Which was always my number one.
00:16:36,00:16:40,"You have a different, if it's insects, it's a different ending."
00:16:40,00:16:45,"If it's mythical beings, musical instruments, serials, abstract concepts, they all have"
00:16:45,00:16:46,different endings.
00:16:46,00:16:47,Everybody's got a podcast.
00:16:47,00:16:55,How does anyone learn it or get anything done?
00:16:55,00:16:56,Yeah.
00:16:56,00:16:59,"I think you just, most of it, you just naturally pick up these kinds of things if you live"
00:16:59,00:17:00,in it.
00:17:00,00:17:04,"Because before you get to that word, you'd have to stop and investigate."
00:17:04,00:17:05,All right.
00:17:05,00:17:08,"So, wild or domestic, a live or dead."
00:17:08,00:17:15,"But also, like the number of things, so if it's one thing or two things or many things,"
00:17:15,00:17:16,it's different.
00:17:16,00:17:20,Imagine solving a crime based on a phone call because you know that the verb was referring
00:17:20,00:17:23,to a thing and you can investigate what that thing was.
00:17:23,00:17:31,We know that they have a wild insect who has a podcast and also it's different depending
00:17:31,00:17:33,on how you know it's being done.
00:17:33,00:17:35,"So if you know it's happened, it's different."
00:17:35,00:17:37,"If you're speculating it's happened, it's different."
00:17:37,00:17:40,"If you're admiring something that's happening, it's different."
00:17:40,00:17:42,"If something's forbidden, it's different."
00:17:42,00:17:46,And you can mix and match all of these different things to get to 1.5 million.
00:17:46,00:17:52,"I admired the Forbidden Tame Young Locusts podcast, podcasting, whatever."
00:17:52,00:17:53,But you think about that.
00:17:53,00:17:55,"You had to use so many words to say that, right?"
00:17:55,00:17:56,Yeah.
00:17:56,00:17:59,But they would be able to say it in one word because they would know all of the endings.
00:17:59,00:18:01,"They'd be like, well, that's implied by the way you say it."
00:18:01,00:18:03,"It just stays the same, like all of that stuff."
00:18:03,00:18:08,You could just say the Locust podcast is so you just a verb and a noun and you would get
00:18:08,00:18:10,all of that information by all the different endings.
00:18:10,00:18:11,It's like anti-German.
00:18:11,00:18:12,It's the most efficient.
00:18:12,00:18:13,"Yeah, yeah."
00:18:13,00:18:17,"As a result, has this language become hugely popular and spoken by tens of millions?"
00:18:17,00:18:23,"It's spoken by very, very few people in Dagestan in Russia and it's about 20 kilometers away"
00:18:23,00:18:26,from the village of Sofkra Adnaya.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Who do you remember?
00:18:27,00:18:30,It was the place where everyone knows how to type.
00:18:30,00:18:31,"Oh, no way."
00:18:31,00:18:32,Yeah.
00:18:32,00:18:34,There's a village in Russia where everyone knows how to type rope and it's just over
00:18:34,00:18:36,the mountain from there.
00:18:36,00:18:39,What an amazing pocket of the planet.
00:18:39,00:18:40,Isn't that amazing?
00:18:40,00:18:41,This is incredible.
00:18:41,00:18:44,"And I should also say that Andy, once you've learned all of these one million different"
00:18:44,00:18:50,"forms of standard verbs, that helps you with about 170 of the most common verbs, but there"
00:18:50,00:18:54,"are more than a thousand exceptions, which you then have to learn on top of that."
00:18:54,00:18:59,"Oh, and the language can be written in Latin script or in Cyrillic and in either way, the"
00:18:59,00:19:01,language has got 74 letters.
00:19:01,00:19:04,So you need to learn 148 letters.
00:19:04,00:19:08,"I was going to ask how many letters can there be for there to be this many endings, because"
00:19:08,00:19:10,you would just run out of letters for even combination.
00:19:10,00:19:13,"Yeah, this is why I failed my Archie GCSE oral."
00:19:13,00:19:14,That's why.
00:19:14,00:19:15,I'm so annoyed.
00:19:15,00:19:16,So yeah.
00:19:16,00:19:20,"It's just a very, very complicated language and it exists."
00:19:20,00:19:22,Have you heard of the Foreign Service Institute?
00:19:22,00:19:23,I think they're an American outfit.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Yeah.
00:19:24,00:19:27,"Basically, they sort of rate languages on how hard they are to learn."
00:19:27,00:19:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:28,00:19:31,"And for English speakers, sorry, native English speakers."
00:19:31,00:19:37,"So like French is category one, you know, like romance languages, because English borrows"
00:19:37,00:19:38,a lot from that.
00:19:38,00:19:39,We derive from that.
00:19:39,00:19:40,Yeah.
00:19:40,00:19:41,And you already know how to learn.
00:19:41,00:19:42,That's easy for English people to learn.
00:19:42,00:19:43,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:43,00:19:46,"And then category three is Indian, various Indian languages in Swahili."
00:19:46,00:19:48,"Category four, it takes 44 weeks to learn."
00:19:48,00:19:52,"It's sort of going up in the number of weeks, so Russian, Hindi, Tamil."
00:19:52,00:19:55,How many weeks is it supposed to have taken me to learn Russian?
00:19:55,00:19:56,Don't worry about it.
00:19:56,00:19:59,"Well, it's taken me five years and I'm intermediate."
00:19:59,00:20:03,"Yeah, that's about right."
00:20:03,00:20:07,"Category five is Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic."
00:20:07,00:20:09,Category two only contains German.
00:20:09,00:20:10,Oh.
00:20:10,00:20:12,"Wait, but English is a Germanic language."
00:20:12,00:20:13,I know.
00:20:13,00:20:14,What?
00:20:14,00:20:17,"I think they decided it's a bit harder than French, but it's the only one."
00:20:17,00:20:18,It's just there on its own in their categories.
00:20:18,00:20:22,"Actually, German does have quite a lot of conjugations, doesn't it, because you speak"
00:20:22,00:20:23,German a little bit.
00:20:23,00:20:24,It's not four basic cases.
00:20:24,00:20:25,Yeah.
00:20:25,00:20:26,It's not.
00:20:26,00:20:27,It's all right.
00:20:27,00:20:30,"It's a bit, it's a bit, because like French and Spanish and Italian, they're all kind"
00:20:30,00:20:34,"of debased Latin, if you like, because they just cut out all the complicated endings and"
00:20:34,00:20:35,you know.
00:20:35,00:20:37,And it's because as Latin spread.
00:20:37,00:20:41,"Yeah, I guess it's like they're like how to speak it correctly, because I speak fluent"
00:20:41,00:20:43,"German, but I can't conjugate shit."
00:20:43,00:20:45,"I'm just, I'm always like, you know what I'm saying."
00:20:45,00:20:46,But do you get it right?
00:20:46,00:20:47,Do you get it right?
00:20:47,00:20:48,Even though you?
00:20:48,00:20:52,"Like sometimes I'll be like, I'll know a noun, but I won't remember its article."
00:20:52,00:20:54,I'll like gender it just on a guess alone.
00:20:54,00:20:59,"And I'm sure that I'm sure whoever I'm speaking to will kind of guess, but I always get worried"
00:20:59,00:21:00,about that.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"Because if I get the gender of a noun wrong, though, like they won't know I'm, if I'm"
00:21:02,00:21:03,"saying dash table, whatever."
00:21:03,00:21:04,I know it's not table.
00:21:04,00:21:09,"I can't remember the table either, but like I think and you're just like, that's just"
00:21:09,00:21:10,dirty.
00:21:10,00:21:11,It's not doing changes.
00:21:11,00:21:12,But it's a dish.
00:21:12,00:21:13,So it's fine.
00:21:13,00:21:14,Relax.
00:21:14,00:21:21,Because I read an article where they interviewed 56 native French speakers and they asked them
00:21:21,00:21:24,to assign the gender of 93 masculine words.
00:21:24,00:21:30,And they agreed on only 17 of them to assign the gender of 50 feminine words and they agreed
00:21:30,00:21:31,on only one.
00:21:31,00:21:32,Wow.
00:21:32,00:21:33,It's just vibes.
00:21:33,00:21:35,I love that.
00:21:35,00:21:39,This is you fixed German basically for anyone struggling.
00:21:39,00:21:44,I think that's a good thing in all languages really is that if you just try people will
00:21:44,00:21:45,accept it.
00:21:45,00:21:46,"Yeah, that's true."
00:21:46,00:21:48,"Russian language has three, three genders for any noun."
00:21:48,00:21:51,"But if you get it wrong, I'll still know what you're talking about."
00:21:51,00:21:52,Okay.
00:21:52,00:21:56,"Sorry, maybe I'm making a lot of German and Russian people really."
00:21:56,00:21:58,Where is Archie on the list?
00:21:58,00:21:59,Archie is not on this list.
00:21:59,00:22:01,I think there's a secret category.
00:22:01,00:22:07,But Russian is difficult because the stress can matter right in words and that can make
00:22:07,00:22:08,a big difference.
00:22:08,00:22:12,So you can see it written down and you wouldn't know necessarily the difference between say
00:22:12,00:22:19,Muka and Muka where one of them means flower and the other one means torture.
00:22:19,00:22:21,So if you just see that written down and they don't have the stress-
00:22:21,00:22:24,"Well, if you have celiac."
00:22:24,00:22:25,That kind of flower.
00:22:25,00:22:26,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:26,00:22:27,I was thinking that kind of flower.
00:22:27,00:22:28,Again.
00:22:28,00:22:29,Oh my God.
00:22:29,00:22:30,Sorry.
00:22:30,00:22:31,"Oh, flower, flower."
00:22:31,00:22:32,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:32,00:22:33,"I don't think, is there any way of telling verbally flower?"
00:22:33,00:22:35,"No, context only, I think."
00:22:35,00:22:36,Flower.
00:22:36,00:22:37,Maybe Irish accent.
00:22:37,00:22:38,I always say floor.
00:22:38,00:22:42,People mistake it for the thing we walk on.
00:22:42,00:22:46,"Valentine's Day is always very disappointing though for your wife, isn't it?"
00:22:46,00:22:47,It's a lovely floor.
00:22:47,00:22:49,"There was a woman, I wish I could remember this now."
00:22:49,00:22:50,Oh God.
00:22:50,00:22:56,There was a woman in America who was arrested for throwing a pancake at an American president.
00:22:56,00:23:00,"And I can't remember which president it was, but when she was arrested, they asked her"
00:23:00,00:23:04,"about it and she said she couldn't find any flowers, but this contained flower and she"
00:23:04,00:23:06,thought it would be just the same.
00:23:06,00:23:07,Was it really?
00:23:07,00:23:10,"No, like a hundred years ago, easy."
00:23:10,00:23:15,Do you remember when I made a karate magazine news article for spitting on someone?
00:23:15,00:23:17,And that was a misunderstanding of word as well.
00:23:17,00:23:18,What?
00:23:18,00:23:19,Yeah.
00:23:19,00:23:20,I don't remember this.
00:23:20,00:23:21,This is in Hong Kong.
00:23:21,00:23:22,I was in karate monthly.
00:23:22,00:23:23,That's a news story rather than pictures.
00:23:23,00:23:24,That's like one of those little...
00:23:24,00:23:25,That's where I know you from.
00:23:25,00:23:26,What?
00:23:26,00:23:27,Is this real?
00:23:27,00:23:28,Yeah.
00:23:28,00:23:33,"I was studying Kempo at the time, which is a former martial art, and I was sparring"
00:23:33,00:23:38,"with a kid and the guy who's training me, he's called me Danny, and he had a bit of"
00:23:38,00:23:41,"a lisp and he was yelling, ""Spin on him, Danny!"
00:23:41,00:23:42,"Spin on him!"""
00:23:42,00:23:43,To spin kick him.
00:23:43,00:23:48,"I was spitting on him, Danny, and I literally spat on his face and they paused the fight"
00:23:48,00:23:50,"and they were like, ""What was that?"""
00:23:50,00:23:51,Is this true?
00:23:51,00:23:52,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:52,00:23:53,How old were you?
00:23:53,00:23:54,"10, 11."
00:23:54,00:24:00,"I can't believe, like honestly, Dan, I've known you for 20 years, every week, so amazing,"
00:24:00,00:24:01,isn't it?
00:24:01,00:24:03,The insane thing of that.
00:24:03,00:24:05,"It was, yeah, it was in Hong Kong and it was..."
00:24:05,00:24:07,You were in a karate based newspaper.
00:24:07,00:24:08,In a magazine.
00:24:08,00:24:09,Yeah.
00:24:09,00:24:10,"Sorry, in a magazine."
00:24:10,00:24:13,"I guess it's one of those, like, the funny stories kind of bit of it, you know."
00:24:13,00:24:14,That's funny.
00:24:14,00:24:15,It wasn't like international karate news.
00:24:15,00:24:16,It wasn't heavy.
00:24:16,00:24:17,"No, I like, yeah."
00:24:17,00:24:18,What was the easiest word on the planet?
00:24:18,00:24:19,The easiest word.
00:24:19,00:24:20,Yeah.
00:24:20,00:24:21,So is it the most universal?
00:24:21,00:24:22,Mama.
00:24:22,00:24:23,The most universal.
00:24:23,00:24:24,Not bad.
00:24:24,00:24:25,Hey.
00:24:25,00:24:26,Hey.
00:24:26,00:24:27,"Nearly closer, Olga."
00:24:27,00:24:28,Huh?
00:24:28,00:24:29,Bingo.
00:24:29,00:24:30,I knew it.
00:24:30,00:24:31,"Sorry, I knew it."
00:24:31,00:24:32,She speaks three languages.
00:24:32,00:24:33,Of course she knew it.
00:24:33,00:24:36,"It'd be incredible if you would just, you genuinely hadn't heard the question because you weren't"
00:24:36,00:24:37,listening.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"Yeah, we can edit, edit, fix it in post."
00:24:39,00:24:40,Huh?
00:24:40,00:24:41,Yeah.
00:24:41,00:24:42,Huh?
00:24:42,00:24:44,But what can you please quickly clarify?
00:24:44,00:24:46,"And in every language it's, ""Huh?"""
00:24:46,00:24:49,"Because it would be very annoying if you had to say a sentence to say, ""Can you quickly"
00:24:49,00:24:50,"clarify?"""
00:24:50,00:24:51,So that's it.
00:24:51,00:24:55,"And it means that, you know, it can de-escalate tension between you and someone else, even"
00:24:55,00:24:57,if you don't speak the same language.
00:24:57,00:25:02,"But also, does that also mean that the inflection of a question is the same in every language?"
00:25:02,00:25:03,"No, I didn't."
00:25:03,00:25:07,"Because it's not really a sound much, it's much more, it's literally, in my mind, it's"
00:25:07,00:25:08,just the sound of a question mark.
00:25:08,00:25:13,"I think actually that's not true because some languages have question words, don't they,"
00:25:13,00:25:17,"like English and Russian do, like who, what, when, all that kind of stuff."
00:25:17,00:25:22,"But some languages, it depends on the inflection about whether it's a question or not a question."
00:25:22,00:25:25,"But English has that a bit, doesn't it, you could say, ""I live here?"""
00:25:25,00:25:26,And that's a question.
00:25:26,00:25:27,Yeah.
00:25:27,00:25:28,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:28,00:25:29,"Well, that's an Aussie inflection as well."
00:25:29,00:25:30,That's true.
00:25:30,00:25:31,I live here?
00:25:31,00:25:32,In Australia?
00:25:32,00:25:33,Yeah.
00:25:33,00:25:37,"We had that thing, David Crystal, the linguist, said that the Aussie inflection at the end"
00:25:37,00:25:42,"was a useful thing because it was both a, I understand the statement, but I also am"
00:25:42,00:25:46,"asking you, it's up to you, you don't need to pick it up as a question, but it works"
00:25:46,00:25:47,as a question.
00:25:47,00:25:48,But you can if you like.
00:25:48,00:25:49,Yeah.
00:25:49,00:25:50,With the inflection.
00:25:50,00:25:51,That feels like a mind game you'd play in like a corporate interview.
00:25:51,00:25:52,"Yeah, exactly."
00:25:52,00:25:53,You got the job?
00:25:53,00:26:00,Just as they're walking out of the door.
00:26:00,00:26:04,We find them guilty?
00:26:04,00:26:07,I need to get something off my chest.
00:26:07,00:26:13,"So the closest, so far, so far I've ever been to getting cancelled, is thanks to a joke"
00:26:13,00:26:16,that I wrote about the word empathy in Russian.
00:26:16,00:26:20,And so the setup of the joke is the Russian language doesn't have the word for empathy.
00:26:20,00:26:21,Can you imagine what that feels like?
00:26:21,00:26:22,I couldn't.
00:26:22,00:26:29,"And so I posted this joke online and the avalanche of Russian people going to correct me, just"
00:26:29,00:26:33,saying that there is actually a word in Russian for empathy and you're actually stupid and
00:26:33,00:26:36,dumb and not a patriot.
00:26:36,00:26:43,"But I would say 90% of the corrections were the word for sympathy, obviously, that is"
00:26:43,00:26:45,very easily checked through Google Translate.
00:26:45,00:26:50,"So basically the word that they keep suggesting is sympathy, which is sympathy, which is close"
00:26:50,00:26:52,"to empathy, but not quite."
00:26:52,00:26:56,"Then they'd say, which is compassion, which again is close, but not quite."
00:26:56,00:27:02,"And then very rarely they will say, which is essentially the same sort of like, I guess"
00:27:02,00:27:08,"Greek root for empathy, which is a word that has not been widely used in Russia up until"
00:27:08,00:27:09,I want to say two years ago.
00:27:09,00:27:13,"And I know this because there's loads of articles in Russia that are essentially titled, what"
00:27:13,00:27:14,is this word?
00:27:14,00:27:15,Empathy.
00:27:15,00:27:16,What does it mean?
00:27:16,00:27:20,"And so the setup of the joke, I feel like I'm in court right now."
00:27:20,00:27:27,"The setup of the joke is that I don't even know where I'm going with this, but I just"
00:27:27,00:27:31,think that it's really funny because they think that I'm sort of trying to smite the
00:27:31,00:27:35,"Russian people or say that Russians don't understand what empathy is, and surely that's"
00:27:35,00:27:39,something that you can explain in more than just one word.
00:27:39,00:27:44,"And to sort of, I guess, make right with the Russians, I'll share a Russian word that"
00:27:44,00:27:47,we have that you don't in English.
00:27:47,00:27:51,"And that's listapad, which is the word for falling leaves."
00:27:51,00:27:52,"So it's like rainfall, we have leaf fall."
00:27:52,00:27:53,"Oh, that's good."
00:27:53,00:27:54,And you don't.
00:27:54,00:27:55,Say it again.
00:27:55,00:27:56,Because you're stupid.
00:27:56,00:28:03,"Yeah, but we can actually have some feelings about it when we see it."
00:28:03,00:28:09,"If you're speaking to a Russian, you can tell whether they're a virologist or not by the"
00:28:09,00:28:10,way they talk.
00:28:10,00:28:16,"And that is because in Russian, you have animate and inanimate nouns, right?"
00:28:16,00:28:18,The endings can change up whether something's alive.
00:28:18,00:28:25,"And so virus, virus in Russian, is most people would say it's inanimate, but virologists"
00:28:25,00:28:28,"always think it's alive, a virus."
00:28:28,00:28:29,"Because virus, is it alive?"
00:28:29,00:28:30,Is it not alive?
00:28:30,00:28:32,"Actually, nobody really knows."
00:28:32,00:28:36,"But virologists think it's alive, and normal people tend to not say it's alive."
00:28:36,00:28:45,"So if you say, ""On dal manier corona virus,"" then that would mean he gave me coronavirus,"
00:28:45,00:28:48,but that would be a person who's not a virologist saying it.
00:28:48,00:28:54,"But if you said, ""On dal manier corona virus,"" that would be animate, and it would be a virologist"
00:28:54,00:28:56,"saying it, because they think viruses are alive."
00:28:56,00:28:59,And how useful have you found this change in your life?
00:28:59,00:29:02,"Again, I think that you could use that to solve a crime."
00:29:02,00:29:04,Who was the murderer?
00:29:04,00:29:09,It was the virologist in the library with a candle set.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Probably with the anthrax.
00:29:10,00:29:15,Do you want to know a fun fact?
00:29:15,00:29:16,Yeah.
00:29:16,00:29:17,Not on this show.
00:29:17,00:29:20,"You've come to the wrong place, lady."
00:29:20,00:29:23,So do you know how French kiss is making out?
00:29:23,00:29:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:24,00:29:27,"So the first goodbye is leaving without saying goodbye, or a French exit as well."
00:29:27,00:29:34,"In Russian, a buffet is a Swedish table, and a family of three, which is like two women"
00:29:34,00:29:38,"and a man, or whatever combination of genders in a throuplet is a Swedish family."
00:29:38,00:29:39,Get away.
00:29:39,00:29:40,Yeah.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"So ""ménage à toi,"" which is what we would call it?"
00:29:43,00:29:45,"I don't know, because three people living together."
00:29:45,00:29:46,It's not a threesome.
00:29:46,00:29:48,It is a relationship of three.
00:29:48,00:29:49,I threw up.
00:29:49,00:29:50,I threw up.
00:29:50,00:29:51,"I'm the only one still saying, ""Manage à toi."""
00:29:51,00:29:59,"Everyone else said, ""Trupple,"" I know they're all the apps, or the pervert apps."
00:29:59,00:30:11,"""Ménage à toi"" seeks, loves, ESPN, nostril-based, I've got to be in competitions."
00:30:11,00:30:13,This is for Olga and James.
00:30:13,00:30:14,Pee-hole dandruff.
00:30:14,00:30:15,Is that a...?
00:30:15,00:30:16,Don't speak.
00:30:16,00:30:17,I'm not a native Russian speaker.
00:30:17,00:30:18,But you love dirty words.
00:30:18,00:30:19,And that's true.
00:30:19,00:30:20,Yeah.
00:30:20,00:30:21,I've never heard of Pee-hole dandruff.
00:30:21,00:30:28,"I went on a site where it was sort of like weird, rude words from Russia, and this bottom,"
00:30:28,00:30:29,have you ever heard of that word before?
00:30:29,00:30:31,I have never seen this in my life.
00:30:31,00:30:36,"I did move from Russian when I was 14, so maybe it's a sort of high school word."
00:30:36,00:30:40,"That word is a 15 certificate, so you wouldn't have known about it."
00:30:40,00:30:43,"See, I don't think it's a real word, but it was on a site."
00:30:43,00:30:44,What does it mean?
00:30:44,00:30:46,It kind of doesn't really mean anything.
00:30:46,00:30:52,It's just a beautiful word for when the pollen falls to the trees.
00:30:52,00:30:57,I can't believe we don't have this word in English.
00:30:57,00:31:01,Do you know the Bicol language of the Philippines doesn't have...
00:31:01,00:31:07,"It has swear words, but people don't really use them because it has a complete other vocabulary"
00:31:07,00:31:08,if you're angry.
00:31:08,00:31:12,"So you speak normal Bicol, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but as soon as you're angry, you"
00:31:12,00:31:15,just change all the words that you use so that people can tell you're angry.
00:31:15,00:31:16,That's great.
00:31:16,00:31:21,"So you're saying the same stuff, but it's different using different words for it."
00:31:21,00:31:22,"Using different words, yeah."
00:31:22,00:31:24,So it's a bit like with my daughter when she does something bad.
00:31:24,00:31:28,"I normally call her jelly, but if she does something bad, I go, ""Angela!"""
00:31:28,00:31:29,Yeah.
00:31:29,00:31:30,So angry.
00:31:30,00:31:32,"But it's a completely different vocabulary, Ethan."
00:31:32,00:31:33,Yeah.
00:31:33,00:31:34,That's good.
00:31:34,00:31:36,"I hate to bring it up, but again, such beautiful evidence and a core case."
00:31:36,00:31:37,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:31:37,00:31:38,"Yeah, it's like, was it a crime of passion?"
00:31:38,00:31:39,I don't know!
00:31:39,00:31:40,That's so good.
00:31:40,00:31:50,"Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:31:50,00:31:51,That is Andy.
00:31:51,00:31:56,"My fact is, if cars had improved at the same rate as computers since 1971, they would now"
00:31:56,00:31:59,be able to travel at nearly the speed of light.
00:31:59,00:32:01,Wouldn't that be cool?
00:32:01,00:32:03,And if my grandmother had wheels.
00:32:03,00:32:07,She would also be traveling at the speed of light.
00:32:07,00:32:08,They would also be smaller.
00:32:08,00:32:09,"The cars, right?"
00:32:09,00:32:13,"They would be about a half an inch long, unfortunately."
00:32:13,00:32:18,"And this is based on something that Gordon Moore, who was the co-founder of Intel, huge"
00:32:18,00:32:23,"computer company, said in 1965, he noticed that the number of transistors you can fit"
00:32:23,00:32:29,"on a chip, a computer chip, had been roughly doubling every year for the previous 10 years."
00:32:29,00:32:31,"And he said, ""This is amazing."""
00:32:31,00:32:32,And he thought it would keep going.
00:32:32,00:32:33,He thought the principle would apply.
00:32:33,00:32:37,"Maybe it would be every two years, the number you could fit on a chip doubled."
00:32:37,00:32:41,"And he said, ""I think it's good for at least 10 more years."""
00:32:41,00:32:45,And it actually has stayed true for about 50 years at least since he wrote that.
00:32:45,00:32:48,"And it's slowing down a bit now, but cars would be able to travel at the speed of light"
00:32:48,00:32:53,"because the number of transistors you can fit on a computer chip now, it's so huge."
00:32:53,00:32:56,The numbers are just mind boggling of how much things have improved.
00:32:56,00:33:00,I suppose the thing was that we got to a speed with cars where we thought there's no point
00:33:00,00:33:01,going much faster.
00:33:01,00:33:02,Is that right?
00:33:02,00:33:04,Because of safety reasons and stuff like that?
00:33:04,00:33:05,I suppose so.
00:33:05,00:33:10,"But if we moved to the speed of light, then we'd also go infinite mass and..."
00:33:10,00:33:11,"Oh, that would slow you down?"
00:33:11,00:33:13,"No, it wouldn't slow you down."
00:33:13,00:33:14,"Well, yes, it would."
00:33:14,00:33:17,"Well, it would break through the car door, you'd see..."
00:33:17,00:33:21,"Well, no, because I saw an interview with Lewis Hamilton the other day and he was talking"
00:33:21,00:33:25,"about how when you're driving a Formula 1 car, everything about the structure of your"
00:33:25,00:33:31,"body needs to be as strong as possible because when you take a turn at 180 miles an hour,"
00:33:31,00:33:32,your body does not go with the car.
00:33:32,00:33:34,"They have strong necks, don't they?"
00:33:34,00:33:35,Yeah.
00:33:35,00:33:37,I think there's no point getting faster than...
00:33:37,00:33:41,"You get cars that can go 200 miles an hour or faster, but there's no point having them"
00:33:41,00:33:42,because you can't go faster than that.
00:33:42,00:33:43,"No, you're right."
00:33:43,00:33:44,"Spaceships are useful, though."
00:33:44,00:33:45,Yes.
00:33:45,00:33:46,"Again, it's really just about transistors."
00:33:46,00:33:49,I feel like I was completely...
00:33:49,00:33:54,But am I correct in understanding that I remember this distinctly as an example in a textbook
00:33:54,00:33:58,that at some point it becomes imperceptible to humans?
00:33:58,00:34:03,"So they tried doubling the amount of pixels in computer graphics, but at some point once"
00:34:03,00:34:06,"you double it, a human eye can't see that it's double?"
00:34:06,00:34:07,That's really good.
00:34:07,00:34:08,"Oh, that's true."
00:34:08,00:34:09,Yeah.
00:34:09,00:34:12,I think a computer screen now can show more colors than the human eye can perceive.
00:34:12,00:34:13,"Yeah, so who's that for?"
00:34:13,00:34:14,Like a really good one.
00:34:14,00:34:15,Yeah.
00:34:15,00:34:19,"If you were traveling at near speed of light, this is kind of a physics question, really,"
00:34:19,00:34:21,"and you had to take a left, right?"
00:34:21,00:34:22,Yeah.
00:34:22,00:34:23,You're in space.
00:34:23,00:34:27,"If you needed an exit sign, but I'm traveling at close to the speed of light, how would"
00:34:27,00:34:28,you do that?
00:34:28,00:34:29,As in you won't be able to see it.
00:34:29,00:34:30,Yeah.
00:34:30,00:34:31,At what point?
00:34:31,00:34:34,I don't know how far away would it have to be.
00:34:34,00:34:37,That's a really good point.
00:34:37,00:34:38,Leave it with me.
00:34:38,00:34:39,All right.
00:34:39,00:34:40,I'll write to Radbottman Rove.
00:34:40,00:34:41,Yeah.
00:34:41,00:34:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:34:42,00:34:43,He is way more qualified than me to do that.
00:34:43,00:34:44,All right.
00:34:44,00:34:45,You want to hear something about transistors?
00:34:45,00:34:46,Sure.
00:34:46,00:34:47,"This is, no, genuinely."
00:34:47,00:34:48,Yeah.
00:34:48,00:34:49,They're unbelievably interesting.
00:34:49,00:34:50,Transistors.
00:34:50,00:34:51,Yeah.
00:34:51,00:34:52,Okay.
00:34:52,00:34:53,The light would still come to you.
00:34:53,00:34:54,"Oh, my God."
00:34:54,00:34:55,Yeah.
00:34:55,00:34:56,Sorry.
00:34:56,00:34:57,"Sorry, Andy."
00:34:57,00:34:58,"Because you're going in the opposite direction to the sign, right?"
00:34:58,00:34:59,So you're going towards the sign.
00:34:59,00:35:00,Going towards the sign.
00:35:00,00:35:02,And you just as quickly.
00:35:02,00:35:03,Ah.
00:35:03,00:35:04,So just as fast?
00:35:04,00:35:05,"Faster, if anything?"
00:35:05,00:35:08,"Well, to the point where you're at at any moment, it would just get you at the same"
00:35:08,00:35:09,speed.
00:35:09,00:35:11,I think it still needs to be a big sign from that distance.
00:35:11,00:35:12,Yeah.
00:35:12,00:35:13,Staying left here.
00:35:13,00:35:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:35:14,00:35:16,I think it's always got to be a big sign in space.
00:35:16,00:35:17,It's always got to be a big sign in space.
00:35:17,00:35:18,"Happy with that, then?"
00:35:18,00:35:19,Yeah.
00:35:19,00:35:20,Yeah.
00:35:20,00:35:21,That was great.
00:35:21,00:35:22,Back to your transistors.
00:35:22,00:35:23,"Oh, thank you."
00:35:23,00:35:24,Yeah.
00:35:24,00:35:25,Okay.
00:35:25,00:35:26,"I just, like, here's the thing."
00:35:26,00:35:27,Right.
00:35:27,00:35:28,"1971, Intel released their first ever microprocessor."
00:35:28,00:35:29,All right.
00:35:29,00:35:30,No.
00:35:30,00:35:31,Absolutely not.
00:35:31,00:35:32,"No, no, no."
00:35:32,00:35:33,No.
00:35:33,00:35:34,The chip was 12 square millimeters.
00:35:34,00:35:35,Right?
00:35:35,00:35:36,Picture that.
00:35:36,00:35:37,12 square millimeters.
00:35:37,00:35:38,Okay.
00:35:38,00:35:39,"So 3 millimeters, 10s, 4 millimeters."
00:35:39,00:35:40,Right.
00:35:40,00:35:43,"They had 2,300 transistors fitted onto that space."
00:35:43,00:35:45,"It's pretty good, right?"
00:35:45,00:35:49,"The gap between each transistor was 10,000 nanometers, which is the size of a red blood"
00:35:49,00:35:50,cell.
00:35:50,00:35:51,Just to give you an idea of what.
00:35:51,00:35:52,Mm-hmm.
00:35:52,00:35:53,Okay.
00:35:53,00:35:54,Yeah.
00:35:54,00:35:59,"They had 2,300 transistors fitted into that space, not 2,300 transistors, but 130 million."
00:35:59,00:36:02,What does that mean?
00:36:02,00:36:04,What does it mean?
00:36:04,00:36:05,It's insane.
00:36:05,00:36:08,The gap is 14 nanometers between them.
00:36:08,00:36:09,"Very, very, very."
00:36:09,00:36:14,"I think the transistors are so, they're so tiny."
00:36:14,00:36:15,They're so sort of impossibly small.
00:36:15,00:36:19,"Basically, and the transistors, we should say, they're like the taps, as in, like, they're"
00:36:19,00:36:20,either on or they're off.
00:36:20,00:36:21,Yes.
00:36:21,00:36:22,They bake up the ones and zeros.
00:36:22,00:36:25,"They bake up the ones and zeros, which change the state depending on whether an electric"
00:36:25,00:36:27,current is flowing through them or not.
00:36:27,00:36:28,And your phone has millions of them in it.
00:36:28,00:36:30,Your phone will have so many millions.
00:36:30,00:36:33,"And it's quite, it's obviously really hard to get your head around because the numbers"
00:36:33,00:36:34,are just so mind-boggling.
00:36:34,00:36:40,"Like, in 2015, I mean, nearly a decade ago, the world created 13 trillion transistors every"
00:36:40,00:36:41,second.
00:36:41,00:36:42,Wow.
00:36:42,00:36:43,What?
00:36:43,00:36:46,"We're more, this is basically a transistor planet now, isn't it?"
00:36:46,00:36:47,"Like, pretty much."
00:36:47,00:36:48,There's so many of them.
00:36:48,00:36:49,Yeah.
00:36:49,00:36:51,And they're now kind of printed directly onto the chips.
00:36:51,00:36:53,It's not like there's a big pile of...
00:36:53,00:36:54,Yeah.
00:36:54,00:36:55,Someone's shot.
00:36:55,00:36:56,Shuler.
00:36:56,00:36:57,"No, I've dropped it."
00:36:57,00:36:58,I've dropped it.
00:36:58,00:36:59,Nobody moved.
00:36:59,00:37:00,Nobody moved.
00:37:00,00:37:04,Just one old man in a cave in Turkey who's just putting each one together.
00:37:04,00:37:05,Yeah.
00:37:05,00:37:06,It's just mind-blowing.
00:37:06,00:37:08,And this stuff is what the entire world has made of.
00:37:08,00:37:12,"All the, everything you're listening to this podcast through is transistor based."
00:37:12,00:37:13,It's all based on this stuff.
00:37:13,00:37:17,"And it's so far beyond most people's comprehension, unless you spend years on it."
00:37:17,00:37:18,You know.
00:37:18,00:37:19,It's insane.
00:37:19,00:37:20,"It's so big, aren't they?"
00:37:20,00:37:23,It's just hard to really get your head around any of the numbers.
00:37:23,00:37:24,Yeah.
00:37:24,00:37:27,"Like, for instance, the new Google computer, the quantum one that they're supposed to"
00:37:27,00:37:30,have made and no one's sure if they've made it or not.
00:37:30,00:37:31,"If they have, then..."
00:37:31,00:37:33,That's so funny for a quantum computer.
00:37:33,00:37:34,Yeah.
00:37:34,00:37:37,"Yeah, it exists and it doesn't exist at the same time."
00:37:37,00:37:38,Yeah.
00:37:38,00:37:43,It can do as many calculations in two seconds as if you've got the entire population of
00:37:43,00:37:47,India to do a sum every second since the beginning of the universe.
00:37:47,00:37:48,Wow.
00:37:48,00:37:51,That would be the same as this computer can do in two seconds.
00:37:51,00:37:54,"And again, that's, it's so hard to understand."
00:37:54,00:37:55,It's amazing.
00:37:55,00:37:56,Wow.
00:37:56,00:37:59,"And the reason the transistors have been getting so much smaller is partly, is a really good"
00:37:59,00:38:05,"thing partly because when they get smaller, you get less electricity wasted and less heat"
00:38:05,00:38:06,wastage.
00:38:06,00:38:07,Yeah.
00:38:07,00:38:08,"Obviously, the process generates a lot of heat."
00:38:08,00:38:12,"So actually making them smaller means you save huge amounts of energy, which is part"
00:38:12,00:38:14,of the reason they can do it and that it's a good thing.
00:38:14,00:38:17,"Because I think Ma said at the very start, he said one of the problems is going to be"
00:38:17,00:38:20,"we're going to get more and more transistors, but everything's just going to get hotter"
00:38:20,00:38:21,and hotter and hotter.
00:38:21,00:38:22,Yes.
00:38:22,00:38:24,"And if you've got a million transistors in your phone, you just won't be able to pick"
00:38:24,00:38:25,it up.
00:38:25,00:38:27,It'll just set fire to the table as soon as you put it on the table.
00:38:27,00:38:28,Exactly.
00:38:28,00:38:29,But then they found that ways to counteract that.
00:38:29,00:38:30,Yeah.
00:38:30,00:38:31,Yeah.
00:38:31,00:38:32,But now they are so small.
00:38:32,00:38:39,"Again, this is mad that quantum effects are starting to come into play and the gates are"
00:38:39,00:38:42,no longer functioning properly because they're so small that you get some electrons leaking
00:38:42,00:38:46,through even when it's supposed to be off because they're now down to kind of electron size.
00:38:46,00:38:47,Right.
00:38:47,00:38:48,The barrier in the gate.
00:38:48,00:38:53,So they're having to work out new shapes of transistor to re-exert some control over
00:38:53,00:38:56,this gate because it's too leaky for individual electrons.
00:38:56,00:38:58,I've got a question for Dan.
00:38:58,00:38:59,Oh yeah.
00:38:59,00:39:00,You're travelling on an electron.
00:39:00,00:39:01,Yeah.
00:39:01,00:39:03,There's a neutron on your left hand side.
00:39:03,00:39:04,Yeah.
00:39:04,00:39:07,How big would the sign have to be in order for you to see it?
00:39:07,00:39:11,"For me to, well, I'm glad you brought that up because I did have a additional question"
00:39:11,00:39:16,"I wanted to ask earlier, which is how, if you saw the sign saying take a left, you're travelling"
00:39:16,00:39:17,near to the speed of light.
00:39:17,00:39:18,Yeah.
00:39:18,00:39:19,You're going to have to slow down.
00:39:19,00:39:21,How far away does the sign need to be for you to de-accelerate?
00:39:21,00:39:22,Decelerate.
00:39:22,00:39:23,Decelerate.
00:39:23,00:39:25,Where you go slow enough that you can take a left.
00:39:25,00:39:29,"I mean, it depends how fast you're going because you said it's close to the speed of light."
00:39:29,00:39:31,Is it 99% the speed of light?
00:39:31,00:39:32,Yeah.
00:39:32,00:39:33,Is it 98%?
00:39:33,00:39:34,Is it 97%?
00:39:34,00:39:39,That's a classic follow-up question of a person who does not know the answer.
00:39:39,00:39:44,"I've just suddenly remembered this is to do with cars, but also to do with transistors."
00:39:44,00:39:49,"And I remember that there was a guy, the co-creator of the transistor, won a Nobel Prize for it."
00:39:49,00:39:53,"I'm going off the top of my head here, but he's one of the only few people to win two"
00:39:53,00:39:55,"Nobel Prizes, right?"
00:39:55,00:39:59,"So the second time that he got announced as the Nobel Prize winner, there was a party"
00:39:59,00:40:02,"that was going to, because you know they kind of know that something's coming up, was being"
00:40:02,00:40:03,thrown for him.
00:40:03,00:40:08,And he almost didn't make it to the party because he couldn't open his electric garage because
00:40:08,00:40:11,the transistor had broken that allowed for it to switch over.
00:40:11,00:40:12,Lovely.
00:40:12,00:40:15,And he had to come and pick him up and take him to the party.
00:40:15,00:40:16,"More, Gordon Moore."
00:40:16,00:40:19,"He was a very cool guy, very interesting guy, co-founded Intel."
00:40:19,00:40:25,He became incredibly rich obviously and gave loads and loads of his money away to protect
00:40:25,00:40:28,"the Amazon, protecting Salmon Rivers because he's a very keen fisherman."
00:40:28,00:40:32,"But he founded Intel with Robert Noyce, was his colleague."
00:40:32,00:40:33,Noyce.
00:40:33,00:40:37,"And they invented Brooklyn Nine-Nine, didn't they?"
00:40:37,00:40:39,They wanted to call the company More Noyce.
00:40:39,00:40:40,More Noyce.
00:40:40,00:40:42,This is more Noyce than anything else.
00:40:42,00:40:44,"And certainly they thought it wouldn't be right for an electronics company, it wouldn't"
00:40:44,00:40:45,be appropriate or something.
00:40:45,00:40:46,Really?
00:40:46,00:40:47,So they called it Intel.
00:40:47,00:40:48,Noyce Computers.
00:40:48,00:40:49,Intel.
00:40:49,00:40:50,I know.
00:40:50,00:40:51,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:51,00:40:56,But I also love that his sort of contribution to managing is just coming to his team every
00:40:56,00:40:58,"year and saying, ""Double it."""
00:40:58,00:40:59,Yeah.
00:40:59,00:41:00,That's it.
00:41:00,00:41:01,"Well, yeah."
00:41:01,00:41:05,Because actually quite a lot of it with Mars Law became like a self-fulfilling prophecy.
00:41:05,00:41:09,They knew that it was going to have to double in a year or in two years and so that's what
00:41:09,00:41:10,they did.
00:41:10,00:41:13,"They hadn't gone faster but they were like, ""Oh no, it has to do this."""
00:41:13,00:41:14,Right.
00:41:14,00:41:15,"It's still holding up, I think."
00:41:15,00:41:18,It depends who you speak to.
00:41:18,00:41:21,"People have been predicting that it's kind of, we can't possibly keep on doubling it every"
00:41:21,00:41:23,"two, and maybe it's now close to every three or something."
00:41:23,00:41:24,But it's...
00:41:24,00:41:26,"Well, have you heard of Bremerman's Limit?"
00:41:26,00:41:27,No.
00:41:27,00:41:28,Bremerman's Limit.
00:41:28,00:41:31,So there was a guy called Hans Bremerman and he said that there was a limit on the maximum
00:41:31,00:41:35,rate of computation that could be achieved in a self-contained system in the material
00:41:35,00:41:36,universe.
00:41:36,00:41:38,So we would get to a limit of how much...
00:41:38,00:41:39,I see.
00:41:39,00:41:40,And he used...
00:41:40,00:41:44,"I don't understand the mathematics of it, but he uses Einstein's equations in order to"
00:41:44,00:41:46,make sense of it.
00:41:46,00:41:53,"So Bremerman, who was born in Bremen in Germany, to Bernard Bremenent and Bertha Bremenent."
00:41:53,00:41:54,Really.
00:41:54,00:41:55,So cool.
00:41:55,00:42:01,Do you know what the fastest supercomputer in England is called?
00:42:01,00:42:02,In England?
00:42:02,00:42:03,Oh.
00:42:03,00:42:06,So is it a classic English name like Nigel or...?
00:42:06,00:42:07,Yeah.
00:42:07,00:42:08,It is.
00:42:08,00:42:10,Less patriarchal.
00:42:10,00:42:11,Betty.
00:42:11,00:42:12,Betty.
00:42:12,00:42:13,That's nice.
00:42:13,00:42:16,Betty is the 457th most powerful computer in the world.
00:42:16,00:42:19,Have you got a list that goes up to the 457?
00:42:19,00:42:20,It goes up to 500.
00:42:20,00:42:22,I'll say Elizabeth.
00:42:22,00:42:23,No.
00:42:23,00:42:24,Oh.
00:42:24,00:42:25,Okay.
00:42:25,00:42:26,"I mean, it's almost impossible to guess."
00:42:26,00:42:27,"Oh, no."
00:42:27,00:42:28,Okay.
00:42:28,00:42:29,Well...
00:42:29,00:42:30,But it's a woman's name.
00:42:30,00:42:31,It's a woman's name.
00:42:31,00:42:32,It's a woman's name.
00:42:32,00:42:33,Okay.
00:42:33,00:42:34,It's quite an old-fashioned woman's name.
00:42:34,00:42:35,Apologies to any of the people with this name.
00:42:35,00:42:36,Oh.
00:42:36,00:42:37,Margaret.
00:42:37,00:42:38,Oh.
00:42:38,00:42:39,It's Dawn.
00:42:39,00:42:40,Dawn.
00:42:40,00:42:45,Dawn is the fastest supercomputer in England and other supercomputers.
00:42:45,00:42:52,"Robert is the 103rd, Alex is the 187th, Gene is the 288th, and Henry is the 293rd."
00:42:52,00:42:55,Some of the most uninspiring names.
00:42:55,00:42:56,"It feels that way, doesn't it?"
00:42:56,00:42:59,"Well, because Dawn is really good because you can say the dawn of a new age, or as you"
00:42:59,00:43:03,"can't say, this is the Robert of a new age."
00:43:03,00:43:08,"Maybe supercomputers stop being super, like surely supercomputers from 20 years ago are"
00:43:08,00:43:09,no longer super.
00:43:09,00:43:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:43:10,00:43:11,Great point.
00:43:11,00:43:12,"It's all the number of calculations per second, isn't it?"
00:43:12,00:43:13,Yeah.
00:43:13,00:43:14,And surely the bar keeps rising.
00:43:14,00:43:15,Right?
00:43:15,00:43:16,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:16,00:43:19,"We had, using old computers, a very big problem a couple of years ago, four years ago."
00:43:19,00:43:24,"So while the pandemic was breaking out, one thing that went a bit unnoticed is that hundreds"
00:43:24,00:43:26,of places got hit by the Millennium Bug Y2K.
00:43:26,00:43:27,What?
00:43:27,00:43:28,In 2020.
00:43:28,00:43:29,In 2020.
00:43:29,00:43:30,Yeah.
00:43:30,00:43:31,Why?
00:43:31,00:43:32,Because what happened was at the time.
00:43:32,00:43:33,"It was a big problem, right?"
00:43:33,00:43:37,"The problem was is that when we hit 2000, the computers thought it was 1900."
00:43:37,00:43:38,Yeah.
00:43:38,00:43:39,So it was jumping backwards.
00:43:39,00:43:43,"So you would go 1997, 1998, 1999, 1900."
00:43:43,00:43:44,"Yeah, exactly."
00:43:44,00:43:45,And that was going to mess up.
00:43:45,00:43:46,And I was going to mess up everything.
00:43:46,00:43:49,That's the best setup for a romcom I have ever heard in my life.
00:43:49,00:43:54,A singleton in 1999 at a New Year's party travels back in time and falls in love with
00:43:54,00:43:55,someone from 1900.
00:43:55,00:43:56,That's great.
00:43:56,00:43:57,That's great.
00:43:57,00:44:00,That's very nice with a computer that glitches and gets them.
00:44:00,00:44:01,Yes.
00:44:01,00:44:04,But what ended up happening was in that period where everyone was desperately trying to fix
00:44:04,00:44:09,"the Y2K bug, they changed the coding so that was 2020."
00:44:09,00:44:12,"And they thought what would happen is, so 20 became the number, right?"
00:44:12,00:44:16,"And they thought in the 20 years subsequent, they're going to become obsolete."
00:44:16,00:44:17,We'll have new computers.
00:44:17,00:44:18,This is not going to be an issue.
00:44:18,00:44:19,I see.
00:44:19,00:44:23,"So computers thought it was 2020, but actually it was 2000, is that right?"
00:44:23,00:44:24,Yeah.
00:44:24,00:44:25,Yeah.
00:44:25,00:44:26,Exactly.
00:44:26,00:44:30,"So then we got to 2020 and everyone went, like Brexit, we've been kicking it down the"
00:44:30,00:44:31,road.
00:44:31,00:44:32,We kicked it down the road.
00:44:32,00:44:35,"Now a lot of places had changed their systems, but a bunch hadn't."
00:44:35,00:44:40,"So there was, and it was weird things like there was a version of the game of WWF, which"
00:44:40,00:44:42,crashed because it was an online download.
00:44:42,00:44:43,Oh my God.
00:44:43,00:44:44,So they had to agree.
00:44:44,00:44:45,What did we do?
00:44:45,00:44:49,Because I thought like planes were going to fall from the sky and stuff.
00:44:49,00:44:52,Not people won't be able to play WWF on the place.
00:44:52,00:44:55,We now work out how Dad knows about this problem.
00:44:55,00:44:58,His plans for lockdown were completely right.
00:44:58,00:45:00,This is a huge issue.
00:45:00,00:45:03,"We could download WWF, also other things."
00:45:03,00:45:05,I imagine that.
00:45:05,00:45:09,"Oh yeah, and 5,000 players fell out of the sky."
00:45:09,00:45:10,Yeah.
00:45:10,00:45:13,And it was like things like grocery stores that had till systems that were automated.
00:45:13,00:45:14,Right.
00:45:14,00:45:15,Suddenly those were crashing.
00:45:15,00:45:16,So you couldn't buy the game in the first place.
00:45:16,00:45:17,Exactly.
00:45:17,00:45:18,It was a nightmare.
00:45:18,00:45:19,It was horrible.
00:45:19,00:45:22,"There was a website called Splunk, which suffered from it."
00:45:22,00:45:23,Not Splunk!
00:45:23,00:45:28,Splunk is a website that looks for errors in computers.
00:45:28,00:45:31,How did you accidentally end up on that website?
00:45:31,00:45:33,I'll tell you one more thing.
00:45:33,00:45:34,Yeah.
00:45:34,00:45:35,Okay.
00:45:35,00:45:39,"This is about how your phone CPU is made, sort of, what is that, central processing unit?"
00:45:39,00:45:40,Yes.
00:45:40,00:45:41,Okay.
00:45:41,00:45:42,"This is from an interview with a guy called Chris Miller, who's written a book called"
00:45:42,00:45:43,Chip War.
00:45:43,00:45:44,Okay.
00:45:44,00:45:45,I'm quoting him directly.
00:45:45,00:45:47,"""This is what gets into your modern phones, right?"
00:45:47,00:45:52,A ball of tin falls at a rate of several hundred miles an hour through a vacuum.
00:45:52,00:45:55,"It's only about 30 millionths of a metre across."""
00:45:55,00:45:56,Okay.
00:45:56,00:45:57,Small ball of tin.
00:45:57,00:46:01,"""It's pulverized by two shots from one of the most powerful lasers ever deployed and"
00:46:01,00:46:06,explodes into a plasma measuring several times hotter than the surface of the sun.
00:46:06,00:46:14,"This plasma emits extreme ultraviolet light at exactly the right wavelength of 13.5 nanometers,"
00:46:14,00:46:17,"which is then collected via a dozen mirrors, which are themselves the flattest mirrors"
00:46:17,00:46:20,humans have ever produced.
00:46:20,00:46:23,The mirrors reflect the light at just the right angle so it hits the silicon wafer and
00:46:23,00:46:27,"carves the circuits onto the chips that make your iPhone possible."""
00:46:27,00:46:28,What?
00:46:28,00:46:32,"""And that's so that Dan can play WWF games on his phone."""
00:46:32,00:46:35,It's the biggest step down for this system.
00:46:35,00:46:36,Isn't that nuts?
00:46:36,00:46:38,I don't think I understood any of that.
00:46:38,00:46:39,I'll be honest.
00:46:39,00:46:40,I'm clinging on.
00:46:40,00:46:41,"I mean, it's incredible."
00:46:41,00:46:44,"Oh, we should say, Kenny Stoltz, a listener sent that in a little while ago, that interview"
00:46:44,00:46:45,with Chris Miller.
00:46:45,00:46:47,"It's just, hey, it's nuts, isn't it?"
00:46:47,00:46:51,"These machines, they're so accurate that it's like shooting a laser from the moon and hitting"
00:46:51,00:46:53,an individual coin on Earth.
00:46:53,00:46:57,"Apple deserve every penny they get, don't they?"
00:46:57,00:47:00,Especially the podcasting team.
00:47:00,00:47:10,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:47:10,00:47:14,My fact this week is that on the same day that Joni Mitchell released the Greatest Hits
00:47:14,00:47:18,"album, she also released a Greatest Misses album."
00:47:18,00:47:19,Brilliant.
00:47:19,00:47:20,Yeah.
00:47:20,00:47:21,So good.
00:47:21,00:47:22,I know.
00:47:22,00:47:23,Is it terrible?
00:47:23,00:47:25,"Like, is it absolutely awful?"
00:47:25,00:47:26,Bad songs.
00:47:26,00:47:28,A case of you is on it.
00:47:28,00:47:29,What's that?
00:47:29,00:47:30,So good.
00:47:30,00:47:31,That's one of her songs.
00:47:31,00:47:32,Okay.
00:47:32,00:47:33,Yeah.
00:47:33,00:47:34,"But I mean, it's a collection from other albums, right?"
00:47:34,00:47:35,"Yeah, exactly."
00:47:35,00:47:36,It's her favorite ones that weren't commercially successful.
00:47:36,00:47:37,Exactly.
00:47:37,00:47:38,That's right.
00:47:38,00:47:39,Okay.
00:47:39,00:47:43,"And she was so happy with it, she tried to release Misses 2, but the record label rejected"
00:47:43,00:47:44,that.
00:47:44,00:47:47,"And the only reason it came out, the record label didn't want to do it, but it was like"
00:47:47,00:47:48,a compromise.
00:47:48,00:47:49,It was a bargaining.
00:47:49,00:47:51,"She said, ""You can do the greatest hits if I can do the greatest misses."""
00:47:51,00:47:52,Yeah.
00:47:52,00:47:53,I don't know much about Joni Mitchell.
00:47:53,00:47:54,She's an incredible artist.
00:47:54,00:48:00,"I mean, you know, she's, she had a really nice moment a few weeks ago at the Grammys."
00:48:00,00:48:01,She performed for the first time.
00:48:01,00:48:03,She's 80 years old.
00:48:03,00:48:04,She sang a song.
00:48:04,00:48:05,Not for the first time.
00:48:05,00:48:06,Yeah.
00:48:06,00:48:07,For the first time ever.
00:48:07,00:48:08,How's she ever...
00:48:08,00:48:10,"Yeah, she's never, she's won, I think, 10 Grammys, but she's never performed at the"
00:48:10,00:48:11,Grammys.
00:48:11,00:48:12,"Oh, at the Grammys?"
00:48:12,00:48:13,Yeah.
00:48:13,00:48:14,"Sorry, you said she performed for the first time."
00:48:14,00:48:16,I think I said where she performed at the first time.
00:48:16,00:48:17,"No, right, right, okay."
00:48:17,00:48:21,"Regardless, she's 80 and she sits, you know, in a chair, she sings this beautiful song."
00:48:21,00:48:25,"She wins a Grammy for best folk album, for a live album that she did, which is a bit"
00:48:25,00:48:29,"annoying, I think, for the other folk artists, I would say."
00:48:29,00:48:30,Okay.
00:48:30,00:48:32,"Controversial, okay."
00:48:32,00:48:38,"And yeah, she's someone who was a part of the whole scene with Dylan, Bob Dylan, and"
00:48:38,00:48:40,"Leonard Cohen and all that, for listeners that don't know her."
00:48:40,00:48:42,You won't find much of her stuff on Spotify.
00:48:42,00:48:46,She's one of those artists where you probably have to go to YouTube or...
00:48:46,00:48:48,"She took it off because of Joe Rogan, right?"
00:48:48,00:48:49,Did she?
00:48:49,00:48:50,Yeah.
00:48:50,00:48:53,"Yeah, Joe Rogan was Spotify."
00:48:53,00:48:54,Yeah.
00:48:54,00:48:55,Exclusive.
00:48:55,00:48:56,"Exclusive, right?"
00:48:56,00:48:58,And he was saying some things that people didn't agree with.
00:48:58,00:49:02,"I've got to say, I'm a big fan of Spotify as I am with Apple and all podcast profiles."
00:49:02,00:49:05,I'm so glad that the end to that sentence wasn't Joe Rogan.
00:49:05,00:49:07,"I had to say, I'm a big fan."
00:49:07,00:49:11,"Yeah, but a load of people took their stuff off Spotify because of that, and she was one"
00:49:11,00:49:12,of them.
00:49:12,00:49:14,"I mean, do we know it wasn't because of us, because we are on Spotify?"
00:49:14,00:49:17,"Yeah, but we're not an exclusive Spotify."
00:49:17,00:49:21,Maybe it was Parenting Hell with Josh Wickham that she hated.
00:49:21,00:49:22,Wow.
00:49:22,00:49:23,Okay.
00:49:23,00:49:24,She's amazing.
00:49:24,00:49:25,She's pretty cool.
00:49:25,00:49:30,"She had polio when she was nine years old, and interesting thing about that is I was"
00:49:30,00:49:33,reading about other people who had polio around the time.
00:49:33,00:49:38,"Mia Farrow had polio when she was nine, and she wrote that she was taken to an isolation"
00:49:38,00:49:43,"unit because it's catching polio, obviously, and she was taken away from all of her family"
00:49:43,00:49:46,"for months, and all of her belongings were burned."
00:49:46,00:49:48,Is this Mia Farrow?
00:49:48,00:49:49,Right.
00:49:49,00:49:50,Blimey.
00:49:50,00:49:51,It's not amazing.
00:49:51,00:49:52,"You're basically, at nine years old, you've got this disease."
00:49:52,00:49:55,"They take you away, and they burn everything that you own."
00:49:55,00:50:00,"Is that the case with polio, that if you touch your toy, you could get it from that, or was"
00:50:00,00:50:01,"that a, we weren't sure what it was?"
00:50:01,00:50:02,"No, it can."
00:50:02,00:50:05,It can go through bodily fluids and stuff like that.
00:50:05,00:50:07,"Obviously, we have vaccines for it now."
00:50:07,00:50:11,Joe Rogan told me to say that they don't want that.
00:50:11,00:50:16,"No, we have vaccines for it now, so it's not as much of a problem, obviously."
00:50:16,00:50:20,"Yeah, it can go through feces, through spits, through esophageal urethra."
00:50:20,00:50:23,The speed with which we went from Joni Mitchell to feces.
00:50:23,00:50:24,Yeah!
00:50:24,00:50:28,"Well, that's our pipeline, I'm afraid, that's how we roll."
00:50:28,00:50:30,"It comes through our pipeline, yeah."
00:50:30,00:50:33,"No, Ian Dury of Ian Dury and the Blockets had polio as a child."
00:50:33,00:50:34,Did he?
00:50:34,00:50:35,"Yeah, yeah, so a lot of musicians."
00:50:35,00:50:36,Yeah.
00:50:36,00:50:37,Yeah.
00:50:37,00:50:38,How interesting.
00:50:38,00:50:43,"Supposedly gave her an edge to how she tuned her guitar and so polio, because, Joni, yeah,"
00:50:43,00:50:48,so she got into guitaring about 15 years old at school and she was recovering from polio
00:50:48,00:50:51,and it just meant that it must have been harder to tune a guitar for her.
00:50:51,00:50:55,"Yeah, it kind of changes the way that your bone structure works and stuff like that."
00:50:55,00:50:59,There was a footballer called Grincha who had polio as a child and it made his legs
00:50:59,00:51:03,"bandy, but it meant that he kind of ran in a way that no one else ran and it kind of"
00:51:03,00:51:05,"helped him to play football, supposedly."
00:51:05,00:51:06,Right.
00:51:06,00:51:12,She started smoking at the age of nine and she started singing because she wanted to
00:51:12,00:51:19,"get smoking money, so she was in a cafe in Calgary in Canada and she was the resident"
00:51:19,00:51:24,artist and she was drawing people and pictures would go up on the walls and then she needed
00:51:24,00:51:29,"a bit more money, so she started singing and everyone said, ""You're a pretty good singer."""
00:51:29,00:51:34,And so she went home and asked her mum if her mum would buy her a ukulele and her mum
00:51:34,00:51:35,"said, ""Who do you think you are?"
00:51:35,00:51:36,"Kitty Wells?"""
00:51:36,00:51:39,A good one.
00:51:39,00:51:41,I think it was a different time.
00:51:41,00:51:44,"At the time, that was probably a really sick burn."
00:51:44,00:51:50,"Kitty Wells, she was the first female country singer to get to the top of the US charts."
00:51:50,00:51:54,"With her song, it wasn't God who made honky-tonk angels."
00:51:54,00:51:56,This is the kind of song I'd like to listen to actually.
00:51:56,00:51:57,Yeah.
00:51:57,00:52:00,"So was it that she started singing at the age of nine and then people thought, you know,"
00:52:00,00:52:02,what would make this nine-year-old's voice even better?
00:52:02,00:52:07,Twenty bent on it and it was a day and then she got into it that way.
00:52:07,00:52:09,It wasn't that.
00:52:09,00:52:14,"She started smoking at the age of nine and then at the age of like 14 or 15, she was"
00:52:14,00:52:16,"like, ""I need money for cigarettes."""
00:52:16,00:52:18,So let me write a masterpiece.
00:52:18,00:52:19,"Yeah, exactly."
00:52:19,00:52:23,"Calgary, Alberta, Canada, that's where Bret the Hitman Heart is from as you would know"
00:52:23,00:52:25,if you had the WWE wrestling game.
00:52:25,00:52:30,"Oh, you would also know that if you spent any time with Dan over the last 20 years."
00:52:30,00:52:36,And then she started dating David Crosby from Crosby Stills and Nash.
00:52:36,00:52:42,And Crosby sort of invited Eric Clapton over to kind of check out this Joni Mitchell and
00:52:42,00:52:48,"he said that Clapton sat mesmerised by her playing and her different tunings of her guitar,"
00:52:48,00:52:51,although he also said that it might have been slightly due to the fact of all the weed that
00:52:51,00:52:52,he'd smelt at the time.
00:52:52,00:52:53,Absolutely.
00:52:53,00:52:57,"He said, ""I mean, she has no kitty wells."""
00:52:57,00:53:02,"She is, I mean, to watch footage of her in that period is spectacular."
00:53:02,00:53:03,Her music is extraordinary.
00:53:03,00:53:04,The songwriting is incredible.
00:53:04,00:53:07,And Blue is just consistently voted as one of the greatest albums.
00:53:07,00:53:12,"Yeah, it's one of her albums, which is always very near the top of greatest albums of all"
00:53:12,00:53:13,time.
00:53:13,00:53:19,"If you're a millennial, you know Joni Mitchell from the heartbreaking scene in the film Love"
00:53:19,00:53:26,"Actually, where Emma Thompson receives a gift from her husband, Alan Rickman, and she thinks"
00:53:26,00:53:28,"it's a necklace, but it's really just a Joni Mitchell CD."
00:53:28,00:53:29,"Oh, yes."
00:53:29,00:53:30,And then she's playing it.
00:53:30,00:53:34,"And are you saying that, actually, that's quite a good present to give because she's"
00:53:34,00:53:35,an incredible shunter.
00:53:35,00:53:36,Better than a necklace.
00:53:36,00:53:37,Yeah.
00:53:37,00:53:39,But then it turns out he gave the necklace to his mistress.
00:53:39,00:53:40,That's the thing.
00:53:40,00:53:44,"But if you're going to find out that your husband's taken on a mistress, that's a good present"
00:53:44,00:53:45,to receive.
00:53:45,00:53:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:53:46,00:53:48,Joni Mitchell is great soundtrack for...
00:53:48,00:53:49,Right.
00:53:49,00:53:51,And did they split up because of that moment in the film?
00:53:51,00:53:52,I don't remember.
00:53:52,00:53:53,I don't think they don't.
00:53:53,00:53:54,"No, she takes..."
00:53:54,00:53:55,He takes her back.
00:53:55,00:53:56,Basically.
00:53:56,00:54:00,He very generously takes her back.
00:54:00,00:54:01,She takes him back.
00:54:01,00:54:03,"She says, ""Oh, he's just been a bit silly until now."
00:54:03,00:54:04,"It's all fine."""
00:54:04,00:54:05,She doesn't quite do it like that.
00:54:05,00:54:06,Yeah.
00:54:06,00:54:07,"Well, it's not far off."
00:54:07,00:54:10,Joni Mitchell split up with David Crosby by singing him a song at a party.
00:54:10,00:54:11,"Oh, really?"
00:54:11,00:54:12,"Oh, that's brutal."
00:54:12,00:54:16,"He has been cheating on her and she wrote this song, which basically, I haven't heard"
00:54:16,00:54:20,"the song, but I imagine in the middle it goes, ""You're fucking dumps, mate."""
00:54:20,00:54:21,Yeah.
00:54:21,00:54:22,Whatever.
00:54:22,00:54:23,"But she played it once and then he was like, ""Oh, that's really good."""
00:54:23,00:54:24,"And she went, ""Ugh."""
00:54:24,00:54:27,And played it again because he didn't get it.
00:54:27,00:54:30,Do we know what it's called?
00:54:30,00:54:31,Do we have lyrics?
00:54:31,00:54:34,"It's called ""The Song About the Midway,"" but I haven't seen the lyrics."
00:54:34,00:54:39,"I would have called it something like, ""Nick is on the backseat,"" or something that really"
00:54:39,00:54:41,makes him worried even as you're starting to hear the song.
00:54:41,00:54:42,"Oh, I see."
00:54:42,00:54:46,"When you overdo it on the metaphor so much, people can't quite..."
00:54:46,00:54:47,The Midway.
00:54:47,00:54:48,Sorry.
00:54:48,00:54:51,Is that the rift that goes through Jillingers that you're talking about?
00:54:51,00:54:56,We're talking about the Battle of Medway.
00:54:56,00:55:01,"People who've never done their greatest hits album, AC/DC, you know the reason why?"
00:55:01,00:55:02,Because they're all greatest hits albums.
00:55:02,00:55:03,Yeah.
00:55:03,00:55:04,Thank you.
00:55:04,00:55:06,Is that what they said or are you saying?
00:55:06,00:55:07,I think we agree.
00:55:07,00:55:09,I and AC/DC agree on this.
00:55:09,00:55:10,Yeah.
00:55:10,00:55:16,"No, I think a lot of artists fear the slight kind of creative death of, ""Here are your"
00:55:16,00:55:18,"best songs,"" and that's it."
00:55:18,00:55:22,"But you can just do another, Aaron Carter, his most requested hit."
00:55:22,00:55:23,Who?
00:55:23,00:55:24,Aaron Carter.
00:55:24,00:55:25,Aaron Carter.
00:55:25,00:55:26,Aaron Carter.
00:55:26,00:55:27,Yeah.
00:55:27,00:55:28,Like the American Backstreet Boys.
00:55:28,00:55:30,He was the younger brother.
00:55:30,00:55:32,"He passed away very sadly, not too long ago."
00:55:32,00:55:33,Did he?
00:55:33,00:55:34,Yeah.
00:55:34,00:55:35,I didn't know that.
00:55:35,00:55:36,Because most...
00:55:36,00:55:37,I was looking up a huge list of greatest hits albums.
00:55:37,00:55:38,Yeah.
00:55:38,00:55:39,Long list.
00:55:39,00:55:40,"They're almost all called greatest hits, which I think is quite dull."
00:55:40,00:55:42,You were looking at this list and then you stopped at A.A.
00:55:42,00:55:43,Run.
00:55:43,00:55:44,Yes.
00:55:44,00:55:45,Yeah.
00:55:45,00:55:47,Anything about ZZ Top?
00:55:47,00:55:54,That's why you keep coming up with crime things all day.
00:55:54,00:55:56,"It's like, ""I've been busted by the alphabet."
00:55:56,00:55:57,"I'm gutted."""
00:55:57,00:56:03,"But his was called ""Most Requested Hits,"" which I think is a nice, slight twist"
00:56:03,00:56:04,on the formula.
00:56:04,00:56:07,"And then the second one is called ""Come Get It,"" the very best of Aaron Carter."
00:56:07,00:56:11,"It must be one of his songs or something, followed by ""Too Good, Too Be True."""
00:56:11,00:56:12,So I just think he's good for...
00:56:12,00:56:13,"Oh, so they're all greatest hits."
00:56:13,00:56:14,Every single one of them.
00:56:14,00:56:15,He's got three albums of greatest hits.
00:56:15,00:56:16,So I think that is...
00:56:16,00:56:17,Wow.
00:56:17,00:56:21,"According to Reddit, and it does seem to be true when I checked it, Kiss have had more"
00:56:21,00:56:25,greatest hit compilations than they have studio albums.
00:56:25,00:56:26,Okay.
00:56:26,00:56:27,That's great.
00:56:27,00:56:32,"They've had 20 studio albums, and as far as I can see, they've either had 21 or I counted"
00:56:32,00:56:34,23 greatest hits on them.
00:56:34,00:56:35,Wow.
00:56:35,00:56:40,"They did a farewell tour in 2000 and 2001, and since then, they've done 13 tours."
00:56:40,00:56:41,Hell yeah.
00:56:41,00:56:42,Isn't that amazing?
00:56:42,00:56:43,Yeah.
00:56:43,00:56:45,Do you know the biggest selling album in America of all time?
00:56:45,00:56:46,Are they greatest hits?
00:56:46,00:56:49,I'm going to guess Abba Gold.
00:56:49,00:56:52,"Well, that's because you've only got to A/B in the alphabet."
00:56:52,00:56:56,"No, it's happened again."
00:56:56,00:56:57,"It's the Eagles, isn't it?"
00:56:57,00:56:58,That's correct.
00:56:58,00:56:59,Yeah.
00:56:59,00:57:00,It's the Eagles.
00:57:00,00:57:02,"Now, so this is their greatest hits album."
00:57:02,00:57:04,Who here can name a song by the Eagles?
00:57:04,00:57:05,How about California?
00:57:05,00:57:06,California.
00:57:06,00:57:07,That's not on the greatest album.
00:57:07,00:57:08,No!
00:57:08,00:57:09,Yeah.
00:57:09,00:57:10,Isn't that incredible?
00:57:10,00:57:12,This is from a period where they hadn't yet written that song.
00:57:12,00:57:16,They must have felt like chumps coming up with that song after they've done it.
00:57:16,00:57:18,We've already done a greatest hit album.
00:57:18,00:57:19,"Oh, man."
00:57:19,00:57:21,So this is now Canon.
00:57:21,00:57:25,"This is not a greatest hit, and honestly, let's do a few Eagles albums."
00:57:25,00:57:27,It's their greatest hit.
00:57:27,00:57:32,The best selling album in the UK is the greatest hits.
00:57:32,00:57:33,"Oh, Queen."
00:57:33,00:57:34,"Queen, you got it."
00:57:34,00:57:39,"At the same time, they released Greatest Flicks, which was a video of all their best songs."
00:57:39,00:57:40,"Oh, very cool."
00:57:40,00:57:43,"And Greatest Picks, which was photographs from that."
00:57:43,00:57:46,That's really clever.
00:57:46,00:57:47,Who here owns Queen's Greatest Hits?
00:57:47,00:57:48,Yeah.
00:57:48,00:57:49,"Oh, my God."
00:57:49,00:57:50,Two of us.
00:57:50,00:57:51,Cassettes and then CD.
00:57:51,00:57:55,"So I own it and Dan owns it, and that makes sense, because one in four British households"
00:57:55,00:57:57,owns Queen's Greatest Hits.
00:57:57,00:57:58,Really?
00:57:58,00:57:59,"It's still, really."
00:57:59,00:58:00,I think probably still.
00:58:00,00:58:05,"There probably is some generational churn happening, but in 2021, Abba Gold, which is"
00:58:05,00:58:11,"the other huge Greatest Hits album after Queens, it got to a thousand weeks in the top hundred"
00:58:11,00:58:12,chart.
00:58:12,00:58:13,That's amazing.
00:58:13,00:58:14,That's amazing.
00:58:14,00:58:15,It's a perfect album.
00:58:15,00:58:16,Yeah.
00:58:16,00:58:17,Perfect band.
00:58:17,00:58:26,"It's not too high way to hell, but it's, by the way, AA, AP, and then AC/DC."
00:58:26,00:58:30,Anything about Adam and the Ants?
00:58:30,00:58:36,There was an album that was released in 1977 by the BBC called Death and Horror.
00:58:36,00:58:40,"Basically, you know how you can just buy incidental sounds, right?"
00:58:40,00:58:42,Like a door creaking.
00:58:42,00:58:43,"Yeah, door creaking."
00:58:43,00:58:46,"Sorry, the BBC would have like an archive of incidental sounds."
00:58:46,00:58:49,So this was all sounds of horrific things.
00:58:49,00:58:56,"Tracks included head chopped off, assorted creepy creaks, red hot poker in the eye."
00:58:56,00:58:57,That was it.
00:58:57,00:58:58,And it was a top 100 charting album.
00:58:58,00:58:59,Gaths were crazy.
00:58:59,00:59:00,Exactly.
00:59:00,00:59:01,Team Gaths.
00:59:01,00:59:05,"And then this is, this is the one I'd love to get, but I don't think it necessarily would"
00:59:05,00:59:10,"have charted, but there was an album called Recorded Delivery by a guy called Yannick Schaefer."
00:59:10,00:59:15,So basically what he did was he put a dictaphone inside a package and he put it through the
00:59:15,00:59:21,Royal Mail and he recorded the entire journey that this dictaphone went on as it was travelling
00:59:21,00:59:26,"through the parcel, going through the mailbox being picked up, put in the van."
00:59:26,00:59:29,And so what you hear is whistling postmen just sort of walking along.
00:59:29,00:59:31,You get sliding van doors.
00:59:31,00:59:32,There's lots of clunks.
00:59:32,00:59:36,You get early morning mail workers talking about their dirty sex lives.
00:59:36,00:59:41,"There's a sudden unexpected shout of, ""Anus!"""
00:59:41,00:59:45,That was me.
00:59:45,00:59:48,And 500 of them were printed.
00:59:48,00:59:50,Brian Eno said he wished he thought of it first.
00:59:50,00:59:51,It was a...
00:59:51,00:59:52,"It's very Eno, isn't it?"
00:59:52,00:59:54,"It is very, very Eno."
00:59:54,00:59:57,The first Greatest Hits album ever.
00:59:57,00:59:58,Johnny Maffis.
00:59:58,00:59:59,Johnny Maffis.
00:59:59,01:00:03,"In fact, if you look in the Oxford English Dictionary, it's the first use of the phrase"
01:00:03,01:00:04,"""Gracest Hits""."
01:00:04,01:00:05,Right.
01:00:05,01:00:08,"He wrote a single song called Chances Are, which was in Mad Men."
01:00:08,01:00:09,Well...
01:00:09,01:00:10,Chances Are he did.
01:00:10,01:00:11,If you remember it.
01:00:11,01:00:12,I don't know.
01:00:12,01:00:13,"He was late 50s, wasn't he?"
01:00:13,01:00:14,So it's perfect timing for Mad Men.
01:00:14,01:00:15,"Yes, he was."
01:00:15,01:00:16,I looked him up.
01:00:16,01:00:18,"He's still alive, Johnny Maffis."
01:00:18,01:00:19,Yeah.
01:00:19,01:00:20,"He's sort of mid-90s, I think."
01:00:20,01:00:21,Cool.
01:00:21,01:00:22,"He's old, but he's still kicking around."
01:00:22,01:00:23,Yeah.
01:00:23,01:00:28,"He was a high jumper for the US Olympic team before he became a singer, but he was kind"
01:00:28,01:00:35,"of singing in the clubs and stuff, and the head of popular music at Columbia was on holiday"
01:00:35,01:00:41,"in San Francisco and heard him singing and sent a telegram to the company saying, ""Have"
01:00:41,01:00:46,"found phenomenal 19-year-old boy who could go all the way, send blank contracts."""
01:00:46,01:00:48,"Oh, that's great."
01:00:48,01:00:51,"And he was an Olympian at that time, at 19 or...?"
01:00:51,01:00:52,He'd been trying out.
01:00:52,01:00:53,He kind of...
01:00:53,01:00:54,He got the call to go to the trials.
01:00:54,01:00:55,This is a cool thing.
01:00:55,01:01:00,"In 1956, he got the call to go to the Olympic trials, but he had just got his recording contract."
01:01:00,01:01:03,"He said to his dad, ""Should I become a high jumper or should I become a musician?"""
01:01:03,01:01:07,"It's annoying, isn't it, when people are world-class at not one thing but two."
01:01:07,01:01:11,You could do both Vanilla Ice as a rapper and a real estate agent.
01:01:11,01:01:13,You could do both.
01:01:13,01:01:19,"Well, Cody Simpson, the Australian singer-actor, also swam for their Olympic team."
01:01:19,01:01:20,"Oh, yeah."
01:01:20,01:01:21,Very nice.
01:01:21,01:01:23,And also is a Gina Davis who almost qualified for Archery for the US.
01:01:23,01:01:24,"Oh, that's right."
01:01:24,01:01:25,Get away.
01:01:25,01:01:26,There you go.
01:01:26,01:01:27,You could do both.
01:01:27,01:01:28,Yeah.
01:01:28,01:01:29,Okay.
01:01:29,01:01:30,You can do both.
01:01:30,01:01:31,And it's fine that I've done neither.
01:01:31,01:01:32,Johnny Mathis.
01:01:32,01:01:33,It wasn't actually any greatest hits.
01:01:33,01:01:36,It was just something they rushed out because he was about to go on tour in the UK.
01:01:36,01:01:39,"He didn't have time to record any new tracks, so they just bundled together his first four"
01:01:39,01:01:40,recordings.
01:01:40,01:01:41,"Oh, is that right?"
01:01:41,01:01:42,Record them Johnny's Greatest Hits.
01:01:42,01:01:44,It was in the charts for nine years.
01:01:44,01:01:45,So they manifested it?
01:01:45,01:01:46,Pretty much.
01:01:46,01:01:47,Yeah.
01:01:47,01:01:48,"They're like, ""The Greatest Hits?"
01:01:48,01:01:49,"Australian and Flucking Question."""
01:01:49,01:01:53,"And there's a reason why you'd love him, James."
01:01:53,01:01:55,He used to play golf 300 times a year.
01:01:55,01:01:56,"Oh, he sounds great."
01:01:56,01:01:57,He's a great guy.
01:01:57,01:01:59,And he has a cookbook library.
01:01:59,01:02:01,He loves cookbooks so much.
01:02:01,01:02:03,He bought thousands of them.
01:02:03,01:02:05,"He had Office Kitchen, his own library of cookbooks."
01:02:05,01:02:10,"And in 1982, he wrote his own cookbook called ""Cooking for You Alone,"" which is all about"
01:02:10,01:02:13,meals for one and how you can make them delicious and lovely.
01:02:13,01:02:14,Isn't that...
01:02:14,01:02:15,Isn't that...
01:02:15,01:02:17,"I just think you seem like a really nice, sweet guy."
01:02:17,01:02:18,He's so sweet.
01:02:18,01:02:19,I know.
01:02:19,01:02:23,"That does sound nice, but if you think that you're going to get a necklace for Valentine's"
01:02:23,01:02:28,"Day and you get the meals for one book, that's a real sign."
01:02:28,01:02:30,That's how Johnny Mitchell dumped her next boyfriend.
01:02:30,01:02:37,"OK, that's it."
01:02:37,01:02:38,That is all of our facts.
