00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,720
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,640
 Before we get going, I just want to let you know we have a very exciting comedian joining us on the show today.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,680
 So Anna's away for this ep, but in her place we are joined by the brilliant Olga Koch.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,880
 Olga is the perfect fish guest. Not only is she incredibly funny, but she's also an absolute thunderdork.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,980
 She studied computer sciences, she speaks three different languages, she has a very confused and unplaceable accent like I do,

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,140
 and she is absolutely blitzing the comedy scene at the moment.

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:36,780
 You will have seen her no doubt on shows like Live at the Apollo, she's done pointless celebrities, and of course she's been on QI.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,040
 But the best place, the absolutely best place to see Olga is Live in person at one of her stand-up shows,

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,160
 and she is currently on tour with her new show which is called Prawn Cocktail.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,800
 She's traveling the UK, and then for any Aussie listeners out there, she's heading down under.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,600
 So Aussies go and see her, she's absolutely brilliant live,

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,300
 and if you want to get a taste of what a full show by Olga is like, she's actually got a few specials up online.

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,380
 So if you go to YouTube, you're going to be able to see her 2022 show Just Friends, the full show is there, check it out,

14
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,860
 and then on Amazon Prime she has another special called Homecoming.

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,900
 Go to her website generally, rockandrolga.com, it has a list of all the things that she's done from podcasts to other bits and pieces.

16
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,880
 But for now, here she is, on no searching as a fish. On with the show.

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
 [Music]

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:39,160
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

19
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,940
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

20
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:48,080
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Olga Koch,

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,740
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

22
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,460
 and in a particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is Olga.

23
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:04,180
 The world's best prawn cocktail eater practices his technique with budget meatballs.

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,180
 Wow.

25
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:14,240
 I would say that a prawn is different to a meatball, different enough that I wouldn't think it was useful for my training montage.

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:21,620
 I accept what you've just said, and I challenge you to a better replacement to a prawn, a better budget replacement to a prawn.

27
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,260
 Yeah, can I give you a better replacement to a prawn?

28
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,100
 Please.

29
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:31,780
 There was a guy called Stefan Gates, who wrote a book about eating insects, and he said if you don't have any prawns,

30
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,500
 let's say you don't live near the sea, then a woodlouse is a good replacement, and it will taste about the same.

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,060
 And budget too, I mean, all over the garden.

32
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,580
 Yeah, exactly.

33
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,560
 I don't think I can even picture a woodlouse.

34
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
 Is that a caterpillar?

35
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
 It's like a pill bug?

36
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
 No.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
 I regret having that.

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
 So, insect armadillo.

39
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
 So, they're the little gray bears.

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,560
 Okay, so then if you de-shell it, it is still soft on the inside.

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
 Yeah, yeah.

42
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,560
 It'd be very fiddly to de-shell, wouldn't it?

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,560
 For the number that you need as well for the challenge.

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,560
 No, I think maybe I'm growing back and saying meatball's fine, as in that probably is the best.

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
 Maybe grabstick?

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
 Yeah.

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,560
 I mean, this guy probably knows what he's-- do we know his name?

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
 Yes, his name is Jeff Esper.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
 Okay.

50
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,980
 And also, a very interesting thing about his technique is that he tries to mimic a prawn

51
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,820
 cocktail as much as he can, so he does eat them cold, and he eats them tossed in cocktail

52
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,580
 sauce, as opposed to, like, marinara or whatever you'd have your meatballs with.

53
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,140
 There's this amazing video of him online where you see the practice run where he uses the

54
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,380
 meatballs, and it's so weird.

55
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,060
 He's just on his own in his laundry with a camera running, and he's about to eat eight

56
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,140
 minutes worth of, like, meatball in his face.

57
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,960
 He says things like, "So, exactly, I'm going to use the same sauce."

58
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,000
 He's going 90% of the video, so I'm going 100%, and he's given it 90%.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 You know what?

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 It's just for YouTube.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Exactly.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Yeah.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,160
 So he's going 90, and then he says, "Really, I should be doing this outside, because I

64
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,080
 think the competition is outside, and I need to acclimatize."

65
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
 Sorry.

66
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,760
 Which geographical location is this happening in?

67
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,800
 If it's not the equator or the Antarctic, I don't think he needs to acclimatize.

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,400
 Well, that's the thing, so it was too cold for him to do it that day, so he didn't.

69
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,620
 But that factors into it. I guess it messes with your, like, capacity to swallow, your

70
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
 speed.

71
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
 Yeah.

72
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,540
 Can I explain one more reason why the meatballs were fine as a substitute?

73
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,540
 Oh, yeah.

74
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,100
 It's because the sauce is the most important part of this particular competition, because

75
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,460
 it is a seafood sauce, but it's really spicy.

76
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,380
 It's supposed to be the spiciest seafood sauce you can get.

77
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,980
 Someone who had it said, "It's like being electrocuted when you eat it."

78
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,980
 And so, really, he's more about getting through all this spicy sauce than it is about getting

79
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,980
 through the problems.

80
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,880
 Oh, his face almost melted right at the end of the video.

81
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,120
 I watched all eight minutes, and the final mouthful, he's on the brink of vomiting, and

82
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,080
 you watch for about 30 seconds, whether or not it's going to happen.

83
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
 Yeah, yeah.

84
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
 It's really close.

85
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
 Can I give you a few of his records?

86
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
 His other records?

87
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,960
 Because Jeff Esper, he's a big, big player in what is known as the MLE, the major league

88
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,960
 of eating.

89
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,600
 It's an official body, like you'd have the baseball league or the NBA, the MLE exists.

90
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,140
 So he's the record holder at certain points.

91
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,860
 He may have been broken since he set them for spam, eating 9.75 pounds of spam.

92
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:14,300
 Chicken wings, Fortune Bay Indian tacos, pretzels, pizzas, Jack's donut holes.

93
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,300
 Donut holes.

94
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,300
 Yeah.

95
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
 Oh, those are a thing, aren't they?

96
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
 Sorry.

97
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
 I was thinking.

99
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
 It's the bit that used to be in the donut.

100
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
 It's not just the answers.

101
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,300
 He's eating them all.

102
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,300
 That's why they're not there.

103
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,300
 Yeah, Texas sausage.

104
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,300
 Yeah, Texas sausage.

105
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
 Well, very impressive.

106
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,680
 For me, it seems like, you know, in Olympic swimming, how people get loads of medals because

107
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,440
 you get a medal for 100 meters, for 50 meters, for 200 meters is all basically the same thing.

108
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,440
 It feels to me like once you can eat a load of shrimp, then you could probably eat a load

109
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,360
 of donuts and you could probably eat a load of everything.

110
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
 Oh.

111
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
 He's only got one skill and he's getting all these records.

112
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,160
 I think it's all to do with training, right?

113
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,120
 Well, I think in major league eating, if you are some plucky kid out of nowhere, the best

114
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,340
 things to go for are things where you can innovate because there are some which are

115
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,340
 volume based.

116
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,340
 I see.

117
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,420
 Where you just have to drink as much honey as you can, whatever.

118
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,700
 And that depends on how big your stomach is.

119
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
 Exactly.

120
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
 That is just about.

121
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,620
 You do have to do that competition in just a top no pants pool.

122
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,860
 But if you're some like, you know, upstart, you might be able to develop a new technique.

123
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,860
 I see.

124
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,940
 So before we started today, you just had a cheese and what was it?

125
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,940
 Celery.

126
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,940
 Yeah.

127
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,000
 You might come up with a new way of eating that, like taking the celery out first.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Exactly.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,800
 Improving the sandwich by taking out the celery.

130
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,840
 I've already had a lot of slacking off about the sandwich, okay?

131
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,480
 But you might have exactly a new way to eat corn on the cob faster.

132
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,720
 You could attach it to like a black and decker, so it spins round.

133
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,000
 So those are the ones where if you're trying to get into this game and why would you?

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 That's what you should do.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,880
 Arriving in New York City on a greyhound bus, with just a corn in your bag.

136
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,500
 And do you think that you start by going to like breakfast restaurants that have those

137
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,300
 like breakfast challenges that put you on the, put your photo on the wall and then there's

138
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,060
 like a Tom Hanks in Elvis, like agent in a corner.

139
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,060
 Yes.

140
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
 Smoking a cigar.

141
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,620
 I think you've got promise kid.

142
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,660
 I went to a breakfast place the other day that had a breakfast challenge.

143
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,700
 You had to eat this entire, this huge list of like 40 sausages, 20 eggs.

144
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,740
 It wasn't as big as that, but it was, it looked doable.

145
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,220
 You had 20 minutes to do it.

146
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,460
 And if you managed it, you got the meal for free or you had to pay for the whole thing.

147
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,040
 And there was a leaderboard, right?

148
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,400
 That had the current champion, Pete Docherty of the Liberties.

149
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
 No.

150
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
 What?

151
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
 Is that the breakfast that was in the newspapers when you had that big breakfast, wasn't it?

152
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
 Yeah, yeah.

153
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
 Yeah, exactly.

154
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
 So no one's beat it since.

155
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
 No one's beat it since.

156
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
 No.

157
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
 Wow.

158
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,000
 I once went to one of these restaurants for like burgers and stuff and my sister ordered

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,960
 the huge sort of challenge thing.

160
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
 She's quite small, my sister.

161
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,840
 And she was really getting through it and the waiters are all looking at her going, bloody

162
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,200
 hell, she's doing good.

163
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,180
 And I just ordered one hamburger and it was really small and I ate it really quickly and

164
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,060
 I was like, I'm going to get another hamburger.

165
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,920
 And then I got my sister to order it.

166
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,060
 So she's wolfing down all this thing and she went, can I have another hamburger please?

167
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,420
 I read an interview with Jeff Esper.

168
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420
 Oh yeah.

169
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,260
 His favorite movie is Cool Hand Luke.

170
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,820
 Oh, I haven't seen that.

171
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,340
 Well, in it, there's a guy who has to eat 50 eggs in an hour and that's I think why he

172
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,340
 likes it.

173
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
 Paul Newman.

174
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,340
 Paul Newman, yeah.

175
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,340
 No, hang on.

176
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,640
 Paul Newman then opened a very successful line of mayonnaise and salad dressing.

177
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,440
 Was that to eat with the eggs?

178
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,140
 It was the film viral marketing for Paul Newman Ranch.

179
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
 First ever.

180
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,140
 Yeah.

181
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,620
 Because the fastest way to eat 50 eggs is actually whip them up on the mayo, emuls them.

182
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,620
 Oh, really?

183
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,120
 He doesn't do that in the movie.

184
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,720
 He just numbs on them.

185
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:41,160
 But in the TV ads, he would be walking saying, I like my 50 eggs, 50 eggs per bottle.

186
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
 Come on.

187
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
 That would be amazing.

188
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,060
 Anyway, this interview then asked Jeff Esper what a movie of his life would be called

189
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,300
 and he said, Cool Hand Jeff.

190
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,260
 So he's quite a witty guy as well.

191
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
 Yeah.

192
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
 Poor Jeff.

193
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,660
 We love you, Jeff.

194
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,020
 But then in 2023, the second and third place in this shrimp eating competition were Miki,

195
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,220
 Pseudo and Nick Wehry and they're married to each other.

196
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
 Cool.

197
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,220
 Did they meet?

198
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,340
 Oh, did they meet doing the lady in the tramp?

199
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,020
 But it's like an 18 foot lung sausage and they're both slowly eating towards each other.

200
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,920
 I think they met in the competitive eating sphere.

201
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
 That's adorable.

202
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,960
 We locked eyes as we were both throwing up 100,000 marshmallows into a bucket.

203
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,360
 And they said they have a child, the two of them, and they said the child can do anything

204
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,280
 they want when they grow up, except become a competitive eater.

205
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
 Why?

206
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,360
 I think they're just in it and they don't feel like it's a good job to have.

207
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,880
 Feels like you're worried it's going to be a Darth Vader situation where the child's

208
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,080
 going to knock them off.

209
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,840
 What I want to say about Miki Pseudo is that she is, I believe the reigning champion of

210
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,580
 the Nathan's hot dog eating competitions, women's category.

211
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,940
 And Nathan's, the Nathan's Coney Island hot dog eating competition is really the biggest

212
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,540
 competition in the competitive eating league and the one that put competitive eating on

213
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,540
 the map.

214
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
 Major league eating.

215
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
 It was born out of Nathan.

216
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
 There you go.

217
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,540
 Yeah.

218
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,380
 But it's only been split by gender, I believe since 2011, before that women used to compete

219
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,300
 with men together and they used to place in the top three routinely.

220
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,780
 And then they split them.

221
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,460
 And I know all this from a book called Raw Dog by Jamie Loftus.

222
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,460
 It's an incredible book.

223
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,460
 I recommend it to everybody.

224
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,800
 And basically they were like, it's going to be the same, it's going to be the same.

225
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,040
 But the men's one is televised and the women's isn't.

226
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,540
 And women get less prize money.

227
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,540
 What?

228
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,540
 Oh, that's actually quite sorry.

229
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,540
 The men's is televised and the women's isn't.

230
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,540
 Yeah.

231
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,540
 That surprises me.

232
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,540
 You think it would be the other way around.

233
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,900
 I think a lot of perverts would be like nothing more than to see a woman eating 75 pot buns.

234
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,360
 It's either not televised or televised on like ESPN3 as opposed to ESPN1.

235
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
 Like it's something like that.

236
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
 It sucks.

237
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,760
 And it is the only competitive eating which is gender split.

238
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
 It's sausage eating.

239
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
 Right.

240
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
 It's the only one.

241
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
 Oh, really?

242
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
 Yeah, yeah.

243
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
 All the others are mixed.

244
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
 Oh, I was like, is that an innuender?

245
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
 You're like, no.

246
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
 That's up to the audience to make the innuender there.

247
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,420
 I'm just trying to picture you pitching why it should be back on TV and really isolating

248
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,420
 the pervert market.

249
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,420
 Yeah.

250
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,420
 I was thinking.

251
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,420
 They got big bucks.

252
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,220
 I would do an incredibly subtle pitch, which made it very, very clear who's tuning in.

253
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,220
 Joey Chestnut.

254
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,220
 Yeah.

255
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,060
 So he's managed 76 hot dogs in one go.

256
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,600
 And I think, I think we may have even mentioned before the thing to do is to dip the bun in

257
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,520
 the water so it gets all slides down, slides down.

258
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,800
 But I love this, the 1984 competition.

259
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
 I think this was Nathan's.

260
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
 I'm not sure.

261
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
 It might have been a different league one.

262
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 It was one by someone.

263
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,960
 She was a 17 year old West German judo.

264
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
 What do you do?

265
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
 A judo artist?

266
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
 Judoka.

267
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,560
 And she had never had a hot dog before the competition.

268
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
 No.

269
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
 But then that's that.

270
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
 Incredible.

271
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
 And you're like, oh my God, this stuff is incredible.

272
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
 I could eat a million.

273
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
 Yeah.

274
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,860
 And that was incredible.

275
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,900
 Was it like she looked at it and she'd never seen one.

276
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,140
 So she didn't know how to eat it.

277
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,700
 And she was like, maybe I just have 10 of them in my mouth.

278
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
 She innovated.

279
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,800
 Where did they find a German who's never had a salsa?

280
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:59,020
 Apparently Chestnut, Joey Chestnut was saying, once you have that many hot dogs, you immediately

281
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,380
 need the toilet and the problem, they don't really digest fully.

282
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,060
 So you kind of shit hot dogs out.

283
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,060
 Clean out.

284
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,060
 Clean out.

285
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
 Come on.

286
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,060
 That's what he said.

287
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,060
 How can you tell the difference, realistically?

288
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,560
 I think when you feel a solid hot dog coming at you for 35 times.

289
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,800
 The fun also comes out of that stuff.

290
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,640
 His shit is inside the bun.

291
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,320
 Let me tell you a little something about corn.

292
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,920
 Also I'm basically the Nathan's hot dog eating contest was put on the map in the mid-2000s

293
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,580
 by a Japanese competitor called Tekeru Kobayashi, Tekeru Tsunami Kobayashi.

294
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,440
 And then he basically made it super popular in America.

295
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,760
 And then Joey Chestnut was introduced to him as like the American down home alternative.

296
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,380
 And so it was again, it's the Nathan's hot dog eating competition is a story of sexism

297
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,320
 and racism and hot dogs.

298
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,220
 And the advertising, they mostly stress the hot dog part of it, don't they?

299
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,220
 Fine friend.

300
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
 Fine friend.

301
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,360
 And then you get perverts into that fantastic strap line.

302
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,020
 Do you know what chipmunking is?

303
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,180
 You might have seen this in your...

304
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,640
 So I would think it's like, oh, you know I hadn't thought of it and then Dan just did

305
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
 an action.

306
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
 I did an action.

307
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
 Yeah.

308
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
 It's storing in your cheeks.

309
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
 That's it.

310
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
 That's it.

311
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
 Now.

312
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
 Were you going to say it was like getting naked at dad's seat?

313
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,180
 I was just thinking speaking in a very high pitch voice.

314
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,800
 As you might expect, given what we're talking about, it's absolutely a dance thing.

315
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,640
 The press conferences would be great though in the lead up order.

316
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,840
 It has to be in your mouth, right?

317
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,480
 The food before the count ends, right?

318
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,900
 So if you're counting down, you know, you've got 10 minutes to eat this many, whatever.

319
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,440
 The food has to be in your mouth and then you get a 30 seconds to swallow it.

320
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,440
 So often the photo finish bit is just, right, just get all of this in your mouth.

321
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
 Yeah.

322
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,080
 As long as you get 30 seconds after the clock stops, they used to be all you had to do was

323
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,940
 swallow it in a timely manner.

324
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,940
 That's all it said.

325
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,940
 Right.

326
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,500
 And they didn't say it was exactly 30 seconds.

327
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,940
 And then there was a guy called Crazy Legs Conti who lost a competition because he couldn't

328
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,340
 eat it in a timely manner and they thought we're going to have to make it a proper time.

329
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,340
 I think that's right.

330
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,960
 It's like I've started to finish or the bell, the quiz bell goes.

331
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,220
 This makes sense of the final few seconds of Jeff Esper's practice for the prom cocktail

332
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,620
 because he goes over eight minutes.

333
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,020
 He stops the clock and he has a mouth that is absolutely and I'm going to spit it out

334
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,000
 and he's, so that's what it is.

335
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,640
 He's using his 30 seconds.

336
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
 He's chipmunking.

337
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
 Clever.

338
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
 I'm very clever.

339
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
 Crazy Legs.

340
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
 Just probably mentioned him, James.

341
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,440
 He, I read an article, it's his legal name, Crazy Legs Conti.

342
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,240
 He compares, I'm quoting here from the article, compares professional eaters to musicians.

343
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,960
 He says the way eaters move and shake is an effort to get breath out of the esophagus,

344
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,480
 stomach and lower intestine as trumpeters would with their instrument.

345
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
 That's interesting.

346
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,920
 You know, circular breathing where you can play like a didgeridoo without breathing because

347
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,980
 you breathe through your nose and out of your mouth.

348
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,980
 Do you reckon they tried that?

349
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,220
 That could be a new innovation.

350
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,220
 Yeah.

351
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,220
 Is the breath sausage in this?

352
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,320
 I mean, you shove as much sausage in your mouth while breathing through your nose is

353
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
 what I should say.

354
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
 Maybe.

355
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
 Yeah.

356
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
 Yeah.

357
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
 Right.

358
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
 But like maybe the sausage in the nose is the Fosbury flop moment that no hero has

359
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
 managed to achieve yet.

360
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
 Oh, right.

361
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
 You found two more entry points.

362
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
 Yeah.

363
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
 Right.

364
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
 Interesting.

365
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
 The perverts.

366
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:20,320
 That's it.

367
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
 They're tuning in.

368
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
 Okay.

369
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
 It is time for fact number two.

370
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
 And that is James.

371
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
 Okay.

372
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,920
 My fact this week is in the Archie language of southern Russia, a single verb can have

373
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,040
 one million, five hundred and two thousand, eight hundred and thirty nine possible forms.

374
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,560
 Is that normal for most languages or?

375
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
 It is not normal.

376
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,880
 How I would say what's a close second.

377
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,160
 So if you think that in English, like to podcast, right?

378
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,960
 So you podcast, she podcasts, I was podcasting, I podcasted and there's not much else because

379
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
 they're all just.

380
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
 I would have been podcasting.

381
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
 Yeah.

382
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
 I guess.

383
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
 But then that's kind of the same ending.

384
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
 No, this is tenses as well.

385
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
 Okay.

386
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,200
 So in Russian, obviously you would have I, you, she, they, all that kind of stuff.

387
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,800
 But also you have the past tense, which would be different for masculine and feminine.

388
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,640
 You would have the future tense.

389
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,720
 You have gerunds, you have participle, you have all sorts of stuff in Russian, but it's

390
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,240
 manageable because I've studied it and it's manageable.

391
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,320
 But in Archie, it just goes crazy.

392
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,880
 You have, as well as masculine and feminine, you have different terms for domestic animals,

393
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,720
 for wild animals, for young animals, old animals.

394
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,640
 So if you say the pig podcasted, you would need to know if it was a wild pig or a domestic

395
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
 pig to know how.

396
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,360
 Which was always my number one.

397
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,160
 You have a different, if it's insects, it's a different ending.

398
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,520
 If it's mythical beings, musical instruments, serials, abstract concepts, they all have

399
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
 different endings.

400
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
 Everybody's got a podcast.

401
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:55,600
 How does anyone learn it or get anything done?

402
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
 Yeah.

403
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,840
 I think you just, most of it, you just naturally pick up these kinds of things if you live

404
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
 in it.

405
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,040
 Because before you get to that word, you'd have to stop and investigate.

406
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
 All right.

407
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,080
 So, wild or domestic, a live or dead.

408
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:15,000
 But also, like the number of things, so if it's one thing or two things or many things,

409
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 it's different.

410
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,280
 Imagine solving a crime based on a phone call because you know that the verb was referring

411
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,120
 to a thing and you can investigate what that thing was.

412
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:31,920
 We know that they have a wild insect who has a podcast and also it's different depending

413
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,560
 on how you know it's being done.

414
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,200
 So if you know it's happened, it's different.

415
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,680
 If you're speculating it's happened, it's different.

416
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,400
 If you're admiring something that's happening, it's different.

417
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,360
 If something's forbidden, it's different.

418
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,120
 And you can mix and match all of these different things to get to 1.5 million.

419
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,560
 I admired the Forbidden Tame Young Locusts podcast, podcasting, whatever.

420
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
 But you think about that.

421
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
 You had to use so many words to say that, right?

422
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
 Yeah.

423
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,200
 But they would be able to say it in one word because they would know all of the endings.

424
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,720
 They'd be like, well, that's implied by the way you say it.

425
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,960
 It just stays the same, like all of that stuff.

426
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,200
 You could just say the Locust podcast is so you just a verb and a noun and you would get

427
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,560
 all of that information by all the different endings.

428
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,960
 It's like anti-German.

429
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
 It's the most efficient.

430
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
 Yeah, yeah.

431
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,560
 As a result, has this language become hugely popular and spoken by tens of millions?

432
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:23,600
 It's spoken by very, very few people in Dagestan in Russia and it's about 20 kilometers away

433
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,640
 from the village of Sofkra Adnaya.

434
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,800
 Who do you remember?

435
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,360
 It was the place where everyone knows how to type.

436
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
 Oh, no way.

437
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
 Yeah.

438
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,800
 There's a village in Russia where everyone knows how to type rope and it's just over

439
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,240
 the mountain from there.

440
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,240
 What an amazing pocket of the planet.

441
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
 Isn't that amazing?

442
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
 This is incredible.

443
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,600
 And I should also say that Andy, once you've learned all of these one million different

444
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,080
 forms of standard verbs, that helps you with about 170 of the most common verbs, but there

445
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,240
 are more than a thousand exceptions, which you then have to learn on top of that.

446
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,200
 Oh, and the language can be written in Latin script or in Cyrillic and in either way, the

447
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,560
 language has got 74 letters.

448
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,640
 So you need to learn 148 letters.

449
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,760
 I was going to ask how many letters can there be for there to be this many endings, because

450
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
 you would just run out of letters for even combination.

451
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,760
 Yeah, this is why I failed my Archie GCSE oral.

452
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
 That's why.

453
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
 I'm so annoyed.

454
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
 So yeah.

455
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,080
 It's just a very, very complicated language and it exists.

456
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,280
 Have you heard of the Foreign Service Institute?

457
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,800
 I think they're an American outfit.

458
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 Yeah.

459
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,080
 Basically, they sort of rate languages on how hard they are to learn.

460
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
 Oh, yeah.

461
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,160
 And for English speakers, sorry, native English speakers.

462
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:37,720
 So like French is category one, you know, like romance languages, because English borrows

463
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
 a lot from that.

464
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
 We derive from that.

465
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
 Yeah.

466
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
 And you already know how to learn.

467
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
 That's easy for English people to learn.

468
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
 Yeah, yeah.

469
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,800
 And then category three is Indian, various Indian languages in Swahili.

470
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,640
 Category four, it takes 44 weeks to learn.

471
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,040
 It's sort of going up in the number of weeks, so Russian, Hindi, Tamil.

472
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,640
 How many weeks is it supposed to have taken me to learn Russian?

473
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
 Don't worry about it.

474
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,200
 Well, it's taken me five years and I'm intermediate.

475
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,160
 Yeah, that's about right.

476
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,360
 Category five is Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic.

477
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,160
 Category two only contains German.

478
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
 Oh.

479
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,360
 Wait, but English is a Germanic language.

480
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
 I know.

481
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 What?

482
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,040
 I think they decided it's a bit harder than French, but it's the only one.

483
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,800
 It's just there on its own in their categories.

484
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,140
 Actually, German does have quite a lot of conjugations, doesn't it, because you speak

485
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
 German a little bit.

486
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,240
 It's not four basic cases.

487
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,240
 Yeah.

488
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
 It's not.

489
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
 It's all right.

490
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,640
 It's a bit, it's a bit, because like French and Spanish and Italian, they're all kind

491
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,860
 of debased Latin, if you like, because they just cut out all the complicated endings and

492
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
 you know.

493
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,500
 And it's because as Latin spread.

494
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,080
 Yeah, I guess it's like they're like how to speak it correctly, because I speak fluent

495
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,540
 German, but I can't conjugate shit.

496
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,700
 I'm just, I'm always like, you know what I'm saying.

497
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,940
 But do you get it right?

498
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,940
 Do you get it right?

499
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
 Even though you?

500
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,220
 Like sometimes I'll be like, I'll know a noun, but I won't remember its article.

501
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,880
 I'll like gender it just on a guess alone.

502
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,160
 And I'm sure that I'm sure whoever I'm speaking to will kind of guess, but I always get worried

503
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
 about that.

504
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,720
 Because if I get the gender of a noun wrong, though, like they won't know I'm, if I'm

505
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
 saying dash table, whatever.

506
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
 I know it's not table.

507
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,320
 I can't remember the table either, but like I think and you're just like, that's just

508
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,320
 dirty.

509
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
 It's not doing changes.

510
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
 But it's a dish.

511
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
 So it's fine.

512
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
 Relax.

513
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,160
 Because I read an article where they interviewed 56 native French speakers and they asked them

514
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,300
 to assign the gender of 93 masculine words.

515
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:30,380
 And they agreed on only 17 of them to assign the gender of 50 feminine words and they agreed

516
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,380
 on only one.

517
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,380
 Wow.

518
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,380
 It's just vibes.

519
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,760
 I love that.

520
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,580
 This is you fixed German basically for anyone struggling.

521
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,340
 I think that's a good thing in all languages really is that if you just try people will

522
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,340
 accept it.

523
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,340
 Yeah, that's true.

524
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,820
 Russian language has three, three genders for any noun.

525
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,100
 But if you get it wrong, I'll still know what you're talking about.

526
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
 Okay.

527
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,680
 Sorry, maybe I'm making a lot of German and Russian people really.

528
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
 Where is Archie on the list?

529
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,920
 Archie is not on this list.

530
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
 I think there's a secret category.

531
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:07,200
 But Russian is difficult because the stress can matter right in words and that can make

532
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
 a big difference.

533
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,600
 So you can see it written down and you wouldn't know necessarily the difference between say

534
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:19,760
 Muka and Muka where one of them means flower and the other one means torture.

535
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,900
 So if you just see that written down and they don't have the stress-

536
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,900
 Well, if you have celiac.

537
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
 That kind of flower.

538
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

539
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
 I was thinking that kind of flower.

540
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
 Again.

541
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900
 Oh my God.

542
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,900
 Sorry.

543
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
 Oh, flower, flower.

544
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

545
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,900
 I don't think, is there any way of telling verbally flower?

546
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,580
 No, context only, I think.

547
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
 Flower.

548
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,580
 Maybe Irish accent.

549
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
 I always say floor.

550
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,580
 People mistake it for the thing we walk on.

551
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,100
 Valentine's Day is always very disappointing though for your wife, isn't it?

552
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
 It's a lovely floor.

553
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,960
 There was a woman, I wish I could remember this now.

554
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
 Oh God.

555
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,160
 There was a woman in America who was arrested for throwing a pancake at an American president.

556
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,040
 And I can't remember which president it was, but when she was arrested, they asked her

557
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,560
 about it and she said she couldn't find any flowers, but this contained flower and she

558
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,500
 thought it would be just the same.

559
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
 Was it really?

560
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,820
 No, like a hundred years ago, easy.

561
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,300
 Do you remember when I made a karate magazine news article for spitting on someone?

562
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,440
 And that was a misunderstanding of word as well.

563
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
 What?

564
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
 Yeah.

565
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
 I don't remember this.

566
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
 This is in Hong Kong.

567
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
 I was in karate monthly.

568
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
 That's a news story rather than pictures.

569
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
 That's like one of those little...

570
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
 That's where I know you from.

571
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
 What?

572
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
 Is this real?

573
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
 Yeah.

574
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,280
 I was studying Kempo at the time, which is a former martial art, and I was sparring

575
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,320
 with a kid and the guy who's training me, he's called me Danny, and he had a bit of

576
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,620
 a lisp and he was yelling, "Spin on him, Danny!

577
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,620
 Spin on him!"

578
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,620
 To spin kick him.

579
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,500
 I was spitting on him, Danny, and I literally spat on his face and they paused the fight

580
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,120
 and they were like, "What was that?"

581
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
 Is this true?

582
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
 Yeah, yeah.

583
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
 How old were you?

584
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
 10, 11.

585
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:00,100
 I can't believe, like honestly, Dan, I've known you for 20 years, every week, so amazing,

586
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
 isn't it?

587
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,300
 The insane thing of that.

588
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,540
 It was, yeah, it was in Hong Kong and it was...

589
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,300
 You were in a karate based newspaper.

590
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
 In a magazine.

591
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
 Yeah.

592
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
 Sorry, in a magazine.

593
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,140
 I guess it's one of those, like, the funny stories kind of bit of it, you know.

594
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,140
 That's funny.

595
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,140
 It wasn't like international karate news.

596
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,140
 It wasn't heavy.

597
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,140
 No, I like, yeah.

598
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,860
 What was the easiest word on the planet?

599
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,860
 The easiest word.

600
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
 Yeah.

601
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
 So is it the most universal?

602
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
 Mama.

603
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
 The most universal.

604
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,860
 Not bad.

605
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
 Hey.

606
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
 Hey.

607
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,860
 Nearly closer, Olga.

608
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,860
 Huh?

609
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,860
 Bingo.

610
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,860
 I knew it.

611
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
 Sorry, I knew it.

612
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,860
 She speaks three languages.

613
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,860
 Of course she knew it.

614
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,420
 It'd be incredible if you would just, you genuinely hadn't heard the question because you weren't

615
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,420
 listening.

616
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,700
 Yeah, we can edit, edit, fix it in post.

617
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
 Huh?

618
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,700
 Yeah.

619
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
 Huh?

620
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,340
 But what can you please quickly clarify?

621
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,420
 And in every language it's, "Huh?"

622
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,260
 Because it would be very annoying if you had to say a sentence to say, "Can you quickly

623
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,420
 clarify?"

624
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
 So that's it.

625
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,620
 And it means that, you know, it can de-escalate tension between you and someone else, even

626
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,140
 if you don't speak the same language.

627
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:02,620
 But also, does that also mean that the inflection of a question is the same in every language?

628
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,620
 No, I didn't.

629
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,580
 Because it's not really a sound much, it's much more, it's literally, in my mind, it's

630
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,820
 just the sound of a question mark.

631
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,780
 I think actually that's not true because some languages have question words, don't they,

632
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,460
 like English and Russian do, like who, what, when, all that kind of stuff.

633
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,300
 But some languages, it depends on the inflection about whether it's a question or not a question.

634
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,940
 But English has that a bit, doesn't it, you could say, "I live here?"

635
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,940
 And that's a question.

636
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,940
 Yeah.

637
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,940
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

638
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,940
 Well, that's an Aussie inflection as well.

639
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
 That's true.

640
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
 I live here?

641
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,940
 In Australia?

642
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,940
 Yeah.

643
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,420
 We had that thing, David Crystal, the linguist, said that the Aussie inflection at the end

644
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:42,740
 was a useful thing because it was both a, I understand the statement, but I also am

645
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,420
 asking you, it's up to you, you don't need to pick it up as a question, but it works

646
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,420
 as a question.

647
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,420
 But you can if you like.

648
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
 Yeah.

649
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,420
 With the inflection.

650
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,420
 That feels like a mind game you'd play in like a corporate interview.

651
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,420
 Yeah, exactly.

652
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,420
 You got the job?

653
00:25:53,420 --> 00:26:00,140
 Just as they're walking out of the door.

654
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,620
 We find them guilty?

655
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,420
 I need to get something off my chest.

656
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:13,420
 So the closest, so far, so far I've ever been to getting cancelled, is thanks to a joke

657
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,580
 that I wrote about the word empathy in Russian.

658
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,340
 And so the setup of the joke is the Russian language doesn't have the word for empathy.

659
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,580
 Can you imagine what that feels like?

660
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
 I couldn't.

661
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:29,740
 And so I posted this joke online and the avalanche of Russian people going to correct me, just

662
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,340
 saying that there is actually a word in Russian for empathy and you're actually stupid and

663
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,900
 dumb and not a patriot.

664
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:43,080
 But I would say 90% of the corrections were the word for sympathy, obviously, that is

665
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,020
 very easily checked through Google Translate.

666
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,420
 So basically the word that they keep suggesting is sympathy, which is sympathy, which is close

667
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,020
 to empathy, but not quite.

668
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,700
 Then they'd say, which is compassion, which again is close, but not quite.

669
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:02,220
 And then very rarely they will say, which is essentially the same sort of like, I guess

670
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:08,100
 Greek root for empathy, which is a word that has not been widely used in Russia up until

671
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,700
 I want to say two years ago.

672
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,700
 And I know this because there's loads of articles in Russia that are essentially titled, what

673
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
 is this word?

674
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
 Empathy.

675
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,700
 What does it mean?

676
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,220
 And so the setup of the joke, I feel like I'm in court right now.

677
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:27,180
 The setup of the joke is that I don't even know where I'm going with this, but I just

678
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,820
 think that it's really funny because they think that I'm sort of trying to smite the

679
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,580
 Russian people or say that Russians don't understand what empathy is, and surely that's

680
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,420
 something that you can explain in more than just one word.

681
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,460
 And to sort of, I guess, make right with the Russians, I'll share a Russian word that

682
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,140
 we have that you don't in English.

683
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,260
 And that's listapad, which is the word for falling leaves.

684
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,940
 So it's like rainfall, we have leaf fall.

685
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,940
 Oh, that's good.

686
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,940
 And you don't.

687
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,940
 Say it again.

688
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,940
 Because you're stupid.

689
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:03,900
 Yeah, but we can actually have some feelings about it when we see it.

690
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:09,260
 If you're speaking to a Russian, you can tell whether they're a virologist or not by the

691
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,420
 way they talk.

692
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:16,180
 And that is because in Russian, you have animate and inanimate nouns, right?

693
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,340
 The endings can change up whether something's alive.

694
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:25,740
 And so virus, virus in Russian, is most people would say it's inanimate, but virologists

695
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,260
 always think it's alive, a virus.

696
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,500
 Because virus, is it alive?

697
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
 Is it not alive?

698
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,340
 Actually, nobody really knows.

699
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,940
 But virologists think it's alive, and normal people tend to not say it's alive.

700
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:45,080
 So if you say, "On dal manier corona virus," then that would mean he gave me coronavirus,

701
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,300
 but that would be a person who's not a virologist saying it.

702
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,460
 But if you said, "On dal manier corona virus," that would be animate, and it would be a virologist

703
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,740
 saying it, because they think viruses are alive.

704
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,300
 And how useful have you found this change in your life?

705
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,140
 Again, I think that you could use that to solve a crime.

706
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,140
 Who was the murderer?

707
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:09,980
 It was the virologist in the library with a candle set.

708
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,980
 Probably with the anthrax.

709
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,420
 Do you want to know a fun fact?

710
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,420
 Yeah.

711
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,420
 Not on this show.

712
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,420
 You've come to the wrong place, lady.

713
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,020
 So do you know how French kiss is making out?

714
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
 Oh, yeah.

715
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,980
 So the first goodbye is leaving without saying goodbye, or a French exit as well.

716
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:34,060
 In Russian, a buffet is a Swedish table, and a family of three, which is like two women

717
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,860
 and a man, or whatever combination of genders in a throuplet is a Swedish family.

718
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,860
 Get away.

719
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,860
 Yeah.

720
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,060
 So "ménage à toi," which is what we would call it?

721
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,340
 I don't know, because three people living together.

722
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,340
 It's not a threesome.

723
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,340
 It is a relationship of three.

724
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
 I threw up.

725
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
 I threw up.

726
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
 I'm the only one still saying, "Manage à toi."

727
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:59,220
 Everyone else said, "Trupple," I know they're all the apps, or the pervert apps.

728
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:11,820
 "Ménage à toi" seeks, loves, ESPN, nostril-based, I've got to be in competitions.

729
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,020
 This is for Olga and James.

730
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,020
 Pee-hole dandruff.

731
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
 Is that a...?

732
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,020
 Don't speak.

733
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,020
 I'm not a native Russian speaker.

734
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,020
 But you love dirty words.

735
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,020
 And that's true.

736
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
 Yeah.

737
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,020
 I've never heard of Pee-hole dandruff.

738
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:28,260
 I went on a site where it was sort of like weird, rude words from Russia, and this bottom,

739
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,780
 have you ever heard of that word before?

740
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,860
 I have never seen this in my life.

741
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,300
 I did move from Russian when I was 14, so maybe it's a sort of high school word.

742
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,300
 That word is a 15 certificate, so you wouldn't have known about it.

743
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,460
 See, I don't think it's a real word, but it was on a site.

744
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,460
 What does it mean?

745
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,860
 It kind of doesn't really mean anything.

746
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:52,420
 It's just a beautiful word for when the pollen falls to the trees.

747
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,660
 I can't believe we don't have this word in English.

748
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,820
 Do you know the Bicol language of the Philippines doesn't have...

749
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:07,220
 It has swear words, but people don't really use them because it has a complete other vocabulary

750
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,780
 if you're angry.

751
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,660
 So you speak normal Bicol, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but as soon as you're angry, you

752
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,980
 just change all the words that you use so that people can tell you're angry.

753
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
 That's great.

754
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,140
 So you're saying the same stuff, but it's different using different words for it.

755
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,140
 Using different words, yeah.

756
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,900
 So it's a bit like with my daughter when she does something bad.

757
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,220
 I normally call her jelly, but if she does something bad, I go, "Angela!"

758
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
 Yeah.

759
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,220
 So angry.

760
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,100
 But it's a completely different vocabulary, Ethan.

761
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,100
 Yeah.

762
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,100
 That's good.

763
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,380
 I hate to bring it up, but again, such beautiful evidence and a core case.

764
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,380
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

765
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,900
 Yeah, it's like, was it a crime of passion?

766
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
 I don't know!

767
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
 That's so good.

768
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:50,020
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

769
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,320
 That is Andy.

770
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,620
 My fact is, if cars had improved at the same rate as computers since 1971, they would now

771
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,260
 be able to travel at nearly the speed of light.

772
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,260
 Wouldn't that be cool?

773
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,260
 And if my grandmother had wheels.

774
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,100
 She would also be traveling at the speed of light.

775
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,420
 They would also be smaller.

776
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
 The cars, right?

777
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,220
 They would be about a half an inch long, unfortunately.

778
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,820
 And this is based on something that Gordon Moore, who was the co-founder of Intel, huge

779
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,980
 computer company, said in 1965, he noticed that the number of transistors you can fit

780
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:29,060
 on a chip, a computer chip, had been roughly doubling every year for the previous 10 years.

781
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,340
 And he said, "This is amazing."

782
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,580
 And he thought it would keep going.

783
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,580
 He thought the principle would apply.

784
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,140
 Maybe it would be every two years, the number you could fit on a chip doubled.

785
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,100
 And he said, "I think it's good for at least 10 more years."

786
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,780
 And it actually has stayed true for about 50 years at least since he wrote that.

787
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,660
 And it's slowing down a bit now, but cars would be able to travel at the speed of light

788
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,420
 because the number of transistors you can fit on a computer chip now, it's so huge.

789
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,180
 The numbers are just mind boggling of how much things have improved.

790
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,220
 I suppose the thing was that we got to a speed with cars where we thought there's no point

791
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,540
 going much faster.

792
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,820
 Is that right?

793
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,820
 Because of safety reasons and stuff like that?

794
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,820
 I suppose so.

795
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,580
 But if we moved to the speed of light, then we'd also go infinite mass and...

796
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,580
 Oh, that would slow you down?

797
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,580
 No, it wouldn't slow you down.

798
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,580
 Well, yes, it would.

799
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,020
 Well, it would break through the car door, you'd see...

800
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,140
 Well, no, because I saw an interview with Lewis Hamilton the other day and he was talking

801
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,980
 about how when you're driving a Formula 1 car, everything about the structure of your

802
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:31,420
 body needs to be as strong as possible because when you take a turn at 180 miles an hour,

803
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,900
 your body does not go with the car.

804
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,420
 They have strong necks, don't they?

805
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
 Yeah.

806
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,620
 I think there's no point getting faster than...

807
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,480
 You get cars that can go 200 miles an hour or faster, but there's no point having them

808
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,980
 because you can't go faster than that.

809
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,980
 No, you're right.

810
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
 Spaceships are useful, though.

811
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
 Yes.

812
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
 Again, it's really just about transistors.

813
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,180
 I feel like I was completely...

814
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:54,460
 But am I correct in understanding that I remember this distinctly as an example in a textbook

815
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,860
 that at some point it becomes imperceptible to humans?

816
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,540
 So they tried doubling the amount of pixels in computer graphics, but at some point once

817
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,180
 you double it, a human eye can't see that it's double?

818
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,180
 That's really good.

819
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,180
 Oh, that's true.

820
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,180
 Yeah.

821
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,420
 I think a computer screen now can show more colors than the human eye can perceive.

822
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,420
 Yeah, so who's that for?

823
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,420
 Like a really good one.

824
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,420
 Yeah.

825
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,580
 If you were traveling at near speed of light, this is kind of a physics question, really,

826
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,780
 and you had to take a left, right?

827
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
 Yeah.

828
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,780
 You're in space.

829
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,860
 If you needed an exit sign, but I'm traveling at close to the speed of light, how would

830
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,860
 you do that?

831
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,860
 As in you won't be able to see it.

832
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,860
 Yeah.

833
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
 At what point?

834
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,660
 I don't know how far away would it have to be.

835
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,060
 That's a really good point.

836
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,060
 Leave it with me.

837
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,060
 All right.

838
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,660
 I'll write to Radbottman Rove.

839
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,660
 Yeah.

840
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,660
 Oh, yeah.

841
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,660
 He is way more qualified than me to do that.

842
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,660
 All right.

843
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,660
 You want to hear something about transistors?

844
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,660
 Sure.

845
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,660
 This is, no, genuinely.

846
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,660
 Yeah.

847
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,660
 They're unbelievably interesting.

848
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,660
 Transistors.

849
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,660
 Yeah.

850
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
 Okay.

851
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,660
 The light would still come to you.

852
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,660
 Oh, my God.

853
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,660
 Yeah.

854
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,660
 Sorry.

855
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,660
 Sorry, Andy.

856
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,660
 Because you're going in the opposite direction to the sign, right?

857
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,660
 So you're going towards the sign.

858
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,660
 Going towards the sign.

859
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,260
 And you just as quickly.

860
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
 Ah.

861
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,260
 So just as fast?

862
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,260
 Faster, if anything?

863
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,340
 Well, to the point where you're at at any moment, it would just get you at the same

864
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
 speed.

865
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,540
 I think it still needs to be a big sign from that distance.

866
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
 Yeah.

867
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,540
 Staying left here.

868
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
 Oh, yeah.

869
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,020
 I think it's always got to be a big sign in space.

870
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,620
 It's always got to be a big sign in space.

871
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,620
 Happy with that, then?

872
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,620
 Yeah.

873
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,620
 Yeah.

874
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,620
 That was great.

875
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,620
 Back to your transistors.

876
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,620
 Oh, thank you.

877
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,620
 Yeah.

878
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,620
 Okay.

879
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,620
 I just, like, here's the thing.

880
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,620
 Right.

881
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,620
 1971, Intel released their first ever microprocessor.

882
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,620
 All right.

883
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,620
 No.

884
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,620
 Absolutely not.

885
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,620
 No, no, no.

886
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
 No.

887
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,620
 The chip was 12 square millimeters.

888
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,620
 Right?

889
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,620
 Picture that.

890
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,620
 12 square millimeters.

891
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,620
 Okay.

892
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
 So 3 millimeters, 10s, 4 millimeters.

893
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,620
 Right.

894
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,260
 They had 2,300 transistors fitted onto that space.

895
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,980
 It's pretty good, right?

896
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,780
 The gap between each transistor was 10,000 nanometers, which is the size of a red blood

897
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
 cell.

898
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
 Just to give you an idea of what.

899
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
 Mm-hmm.

900
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,780
 Okay.

901
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
 Yeah.

902
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,780
 They had 2,300 transistors fitted into that space, not 2,300 transistors, but 130 million.

903
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,140
 What does that mean?

904
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,140
 What does it mean?

905
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,460
 It's insane.

906
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,680
 The gap is 14 nanometers between them.

907
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
 Very, very, very.

908
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,300
 I think the transistors are so, they're so tiny.

909
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,940
 They're so sort of impossibly small.

910
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,740
 Basically, and the transistors, we should say, they're like the taps, as in, like, they're

911
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,740
 either on or they're off.

912
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,740
 Yes.

913
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,740
 They bake up the ones and zeros.

914
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,180
 They bake up the ones and zeros, which change the state depending on whether an electric

915
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,140
 current is flowing through them or not.

916
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,860
 And your phone has millions of them in it.

917
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,740
 Your phone will have so many millions.

918
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,660
 And it's quite, it's obviously really hard to get your head around because the numbers

919
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,660
 are just so mind-boggling.

920
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:40,540
 Like, in 2015, I mean, nearly a decade ago, the world created 13 trillion transistors every

921
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,540
 second.

922
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,540
 Wow.

923
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,540
 What?

924
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,660
 We're more, this is basically a transistor planet now, isn't it?

925
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,660
 Like, pretty much.

926
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,660
 There's so many of them.

927
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,660
 Yeah.

928
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,540
 And they're now kind of printed directly onto the chips.

929
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,260
 It's not like there's a big pile of...

930
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,260
 Yeah.

931
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,260
 Someone's shot.

932
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,260
 Shuler.

933
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,260
 No, I've dropped it.

934
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,260
 I've dropped it.

935
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,260
 Nobody moved.

936
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,260
 Nobody moved.

937
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,260
 Just one old man in a cave in Turkey who's just putting each one together.

938
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
 Yeah.

939
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,260
 It's just mind-blowing.

940
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,300
 And this stuff is what the entire world has made of.

941
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,220
 All the, everything you're listening to this podcast through is transistor based.

942
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,420
 It's all based on this stuff.

943
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,900
 And it's so far beyond most people's comprehension, unless you spend years on it.

944
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,900
 You know.

945
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
 It's insane.

946
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,900
 It's so big, aren't they?

947
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,580
 It's just hard to really get your head around any of the numbers.

948
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,580
 Yeah.

949
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,740
 Like, for instance, the new Google computer, the quantum one that they're supposed to

950
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,220
 have made and no one's sure if they've made it or not.

951
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,580
 If they have, then...

952
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,820
 That's so funny for a quantum computer.

953
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,820
 Yeah.

954
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,580
 Yeah, it exists and it doesn't exist at the same time.

955
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,580
 Yeah.

956
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:43,220
 It can do as many calculations in two seconds as if you've got the entire population of

957
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,780
 India to do a sum every second since the beginning of the universe.

958
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
 Wow.

959
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,740
 That would be the same as this computer can do in two seconds.

960
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,860
 And again, that's, it's so hard to understand.

961
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,860
 It's amazing.

962
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,860
 Wow.

963
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,820
 And the reason the transistors have been getting so much smaller is partly, is a really good

964
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:05,020
 thing partly because when they get smaller, you get less electricity wasted and less heat

965
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,020
 wastage.

966
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
 Yeah.

967
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,740
 Obviously, the process generates a lot of heat.

968
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,380
 So actually making them smaller means you save huge amounts of energy, which is part

969
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,180
 of the reason they can do it and that it's a good thing.

970
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,500
 Because I think Ma said at the very start, he said one of the problems is going to be

971
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,300
 we're going to get more and more transistors, but everything's just going to get hotter

972
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,300
 and hotter and hotter.

973
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,300
 Yes.

974
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,420
 And if you've got a million transistors in your phone, you just won't be able to pick

975
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,420
 it up.

976
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,180
 It'll just set fire to the table as soon as you put it on the table.

977
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,180
 Exactly.

978
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,700
 But then they found that ways to counteract that.

979
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,700
 Yeah.

980
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
 Yeah.

981
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,700
 But now they are so small.

982
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:39,140
 Again, this is mad that quantum effects are starting to come into play and the gates are

983
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,940
 no longer functioning properly because they're so small that you get some electrons leaking

984
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,980
 through even when it's supposed to be off because they're now down to kind of electron size.

985
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,980
 Right.

986
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
 The barrier in the gate.

987
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,180
 So they're having to work out new shapes of transistor to re-exert some control over

988
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,500
 this gate because it's too leaky for individual electrons.

989
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,140
 I've got a question for Dan.

990
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,140
 Oh yeah.

991
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,140
 You're travelling on an electron.

992
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,140
 Yeah.

993
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,180
 There's a neutron on your left hand side.

994
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,180
 Yeah.

995
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,060
 How big would the sign have to be in order for you to see it?

996
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,820
 For me to, well, I'm glad you brought that up because I did have a additional question

997
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,500
 I wanted to ask earlier, which is how, if you saw the sign saying take a left, you're travelling

998
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,500
 near to the speed of light.

999
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
 Yeah.

1000
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
 You're going to have to slow down.

1001
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,620
 How far away does the sign need to be for you to de-accelerate?

1002
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,620
 Decelerate.

1003
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,620
 Decelerate.

1004
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,780
 Where you go slow enough that you can take a left.

1005
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,340
 I mean, it depends how fast you're going because you said it's close to the speed of light.

1006
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,340
 Is it 99% the speed of light?

1007
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,340
 Yeah.

1008
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,340
 Is it 98%?

1009
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,340
 Is it 97%?

1010
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,340
 That's a classic follow-up question of a person who does not know the answer.

1011
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:44,060
 I've just suddenly remembered this is to do with cars, but also to do with transistors.

1012
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:49,940
 And I remember that there was a guy, the co-creator of the transistor, won a Nobel Prize for it.

1013
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,300
 I'm going off the top of my head here, but he's one of the only few people to win two

1014
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,340
 Nobel Prizes, right?

1015
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,100
 So the second time that he got announced as the Nobel Prize winner, there was a party

1016
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,300
 that was going to, because you know they kind of know that something's coming up, was being

1017
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,380
 thrown for him.

1018
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,260
 And he almost didn't make it to the party because he couldn't open his electric garage because

1019
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,260
 the transistor had broken that allowed for it to switch over.

1020
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,260
 Lovely.

1021
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,620
 And he had to come and pick him up and take him to the party.

1022
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,620
 More, Gordon Moore.

1023
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,700
 He was a very cool guy, very interesting guy, co-founded Intel.

1024
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:25,140
 He became incredibly rich obviously and gave loads and loads of his money away to protect

1025
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,940
 the Amazon, protecting Salmon Rivers because he's a very keen fisherman.

1026
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,980
 But he founded Intel with Robert Noyce, was his colleague.

1027
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,980
 Noyce.

1028
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,460
 And they invented Brooklyn Nine-Nine, didn't they?

1029
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,580
 They wanted to call the company More Noyce.

1030
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,580
 More Noyce.

1031
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,500
 This is more Noyce than anything else.

1032
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,900
 And certainly they thought it wouldn't be right for an electronics company, it wouldn't

1033
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
 be appropriate or something.

1034
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
 Really?

1035
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,900
 So they called it Intel.

1036
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,900
 Noyce Computers.

1037
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,900
 Intel.

1038
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,900
 I know.

1039
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,900
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1040
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,340
 But I also love that his sort of contribution to managing is just coming to his team every

1041
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,260
 year and saying, "Double it."

1042
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,260
 Yeah.

1043
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,260
 That's it.

1044
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,260
 Well, yeah.

1045
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,980
 Because actually quite a lot of it with Mars Law became like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

1046
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,340
 They knew that it was going to have to double in a year or in two years and so that's what

1047
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
 they did.

1048
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,140
 They hadn't gone faster but they were like, "Oh no, it has to do this."

1049
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,140
 Right.

1050
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,820
 It's still holding up, I think.

1051
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,020
 It depends who you speak to.

1052
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,060
 People have been predicting that it's kind of, we can't possibly keep on doubling it every

1053
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,380
 two, and maybe it's now close to every three or something.

1054
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,380
 But it's...

1055
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,260
 Well, have you heard of Bremerman's Limit?

1056
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,260
 No.

1057
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,260
 Bremerman's Limit.

1058
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,940
 So there was a guy called Hans Bremerman and he said that there was a limit on the maximum

1059
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,740
 rate of computation that could be achieved in a self-contained system in the material

1060
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,740
 universe.

1061
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,460
 So we would get to a limit of how much...

1062
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,460
 I see.

1063
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,460
 And he used...

1064
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,540
 I don't understand the mathematics of it, but he uses Einstein's equations in order to

1065
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,540
 make sense of it.

1066
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:53,840
 So Bremerman, who was born in Bremen in Germany, to Bernard Bremenent and Bertha Bremenent.

1067
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
 Really.

1068
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
 So cool.

1069
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,020
 Do you know what the fastest supercomputer in England is called?

1070
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,020
 In England?

1071
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,020
 Oh.

1072
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,020
 So is it a classic English name like Nigel or...?

1073
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
 Yeah.

1074
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,020
 It is.

1075
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,020
 Less patriarchal.

1076
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,020
 Betty.

1077
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,020
 Betty.

1078
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,020
 That's nice.

1079
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,780
 Betty is the 457th most powerful computer in the world.

1080
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,700
 Have you got a list that goes up to the 457?

1081
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,700
 It goes up to 500.

1082
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,180
 I'll say Elizabeth.

1083
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
 No.

1084
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,180
 Oh.

1085
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,180
 Okay.

1086
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,180
 I mean, it's almost impossible to guess.

1087
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,180
 Oh, no.

1088
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,180
 Okay.

1089
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
 Well...

1090
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,180
 But it's a woman's name.

1091
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,180
 It's a woman's name.

1092
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,180
 It's a woman's name.

1093
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,180
 Okay.

1094
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,180
 It's quite an old-fashioned woman's name.

1095
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,180
 Apologies to any of the people with this name.

1096
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,180
 Oh.

1097
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,180
 Margaret.

1098
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,180
 Oh.

1099
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
 It's Dawn.

1100
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,180
 Dawn.

1101
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:45,500
 Dawn is the fastest supercomputer in England and other supercomputers.

1102
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:52,820
 Robert is the 103rd, Alex is the 187th, Gene is the 288th, and Henry is the 293rd.

1103
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,900
 Some of the most uninspiring names.

1104
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,900
 It feels that way, doesn't it?

1105
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,700
 Well, because Dawn is really good because you can say the dawn of a new age, or as you

1106
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,700
 can't say, this is the Robert of a new age.

1107
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,420
 Maybe supercomputers stop being super, like surely supercomputers from 20 years ago are

1108
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,420
 no longer super.

1109
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
 Oh, yeah.

1110
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,420
 Great point.

1111
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,420
 It's all the number of calculations per second, isn't it?

1112
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,420
 Yeah.

1113
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,420
 And surely the bar keeps rising.

1114
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,420
 Right?

1115
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,420
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1116
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,540
 We had, using old computers, a very big problem a couple of years ago, four years ago.

1117
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:24,220
 So while the pandemic was breaking out, one thing that went a bit unnoticed is that hundreds

1118
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,740
 of places got hit by the Millennium Bug Y2K.

1119
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,740
 What?

1120
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,740
 In 2020.

1121
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,740
 In 2020.

1122
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,740
 Yeah.

1123
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,740
 Why?

1124
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,740
 Because what happened was at the time.

1125
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,860
 It was a big problem, right?

1126
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,060
 The problem was is that when we hit 2000, the computers thought it was 1900.

1127
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,060
 Yeah.

1128
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,060
 So it was jumping backwards.

1129
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,780
 So you would go 1997, 1998, 1999, 1900.

1130
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,780
 Yeah, exactly.

1131
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,780
 And that was going to mess up.

1132
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,780
 And I was going to mess up everything.

1133
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,620
 That's the best setup for a romcom I have ever heard in my life.

1134
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:54,020
 A singleton in 1999 at a New Year's party travels back in time and falls in love with

1135
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,020
 someone from 1900.

1136
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,020
 That's great.

1137
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,020
 That's great.

1138
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,100
 That's very nice with a computer that glitches and gets them.

1139
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,100
 Yes.

1140
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,140
 But what ended up happening was in that period where everyone was desperately trying to fix

1141
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,340
 the Y2K bug, they changed the coding so that was 2020.

1142
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,980
 And they thought what would happen is, so 20 became the number, right?

1143
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,340
 And they thought in the 20 years subsequent, they're going to become obsolete.

1144
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,420
 We'll have new computers.

1145
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,500
 This is not going to be an issue.

1146
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,500
 I see.

1147
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,620
 So computers thought it was 2020, but actually it was 2000, is that right?

1148
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,620
 Yeah.

1149
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,620
 Yeah.

1150
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,780
 Exactly.

1151
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,980
 So then we got to 2020 and everyone went, like Brexit, we've been kicking it down the

1152
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:31,980
 road.

1153
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,980
 We kicked it down the road.

1154
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,780
 Now a lot of places had changed their systems, but a bunch hadn't.

1155
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,620
 So there was, and it was weird things like there was a version of the game of WWF, which

1156
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,740
 crashed because it was an online download.

1157
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,740
 Oh my God.

1158
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,740
 So they had to agree.

1159
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,740
 What did we do?

1160
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:49,580
 Because I thought like planes were going to fall from the sky and stuff.

1161
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,860
 Not people won't be able to play WWF on the place.

1162
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,660
 We now work out how Dad knows about this problem.

1163
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,300
 His plans for lockdown were completely right.

1164
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,020
 This is a huge issue.

1165
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,580
 We could download WWF, also other things.

1166
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,700
 I imagine that.

1167
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,420
 Oh yeah, and 5,000 players fell out of the sky.

1168
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,420
 Yeah.

1169
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,980
 And it was like things like grocery stores that had till systems that were automated.

1170
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,980
 Right.

1171
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,980
 Suddenly those were crashing.

1172
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,980
 So you couldn't buy the game in the first place.

1173
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,980
 Exactly.

1174
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,980
 It was a nightmare.

1175
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:19,980
 It was horrible.

1176
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,980
 There was a website called Splunk, which suffered from it.

1177
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,980
 Not Splunk!

1178
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:28,260
 Splunk is a website that looks for errors in computers.

1179
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,620
 How did you accidentally end up on that website?

1180
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,820
 I'll tell you one more thing.

1181
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,820
 Yeah.

1182
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,820
 Okay.

1183
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,260
 This is about how your phone CPU is made, sort of, what is that, central processing unit?

1184
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,260
 Yes.

1185
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,260
 Okay.

1186
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,740
 This is from an interview with a guy called Chris Miller, who's written a book called

1187
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,740
 Chip War.

1188
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,740
 Okay.

1189
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,740
 I'm quoting him directly.

1190
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,620
 "This is what gets into your modern phones, right?

1191
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:52,820
 A ball of tin falls at a rate of several hundred miles an hour through a vacuum.

1192
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,500
 It's only about 30 millionths of a metre across."

1193
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,500
 Okay.

1194
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,500
 Small ball of tin.

1195
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,620
 "It's pulverized by two shots from one of the most powerful lasers ever deployed and

1196
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:06,700
 explodes into a plasma measuring several times hotter than the surface of the sun.

1197
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:14,100
 This plasma emits extreme ultraviolet light at exactly the right wavelength of 13.5 nanometers,

1198
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,740
 which is then collected via a dozen mirrors, which are themselves the flattest mirrors

1199
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,020
 humans have ever produced.

1200
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,900
 The mirrors reflect the light at just the right angle so it hits the silicon wafer and

1201
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,940
 carves the circuits onto the chips that make your iPhone possible."

1202
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,940
 What?

1203
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,060
 "And that's so that Dan can play WWF games on his phone."

1204
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,100
 It's the biggest step down for this system.

1205
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,100
 Isn't that nuts?

1206
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,460
 I don't think I understood any of that.

1207
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,460
 I'll be honest.

1208
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,460
 I'm clinging on.

1209
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,460
 I mean, it's incredible.

1210
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,460
 Oh, we should say, Kenny Stoltz, a listener sent that in a little while ago, that interview

1211
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,460
 with Chris Miller.

1212
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,620
 It's just, hey, it's nuts, isn't it?

1213
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,420
 These machines, they're so accurate that it's like shooting a laser from the moon and hitting

1214
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,100
 an individual coin on Earth.

1215
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,060
 Apple deserve every penny they get, don't they?

1216
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,700
 Especially the podcasting team.

1217
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:10,420
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

1218
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,540
 My fact this week is that on the same day that Joni Mitchell released the Greatest Hits

1219
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,700
 album, she also released a Greatest Misses album.

1220
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,700
 Brilliant.

1221
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,700
 Yeah.

1222
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,700
 So good.

1223
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,700
 I know.

1224
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,700
 Is it terrible?

1225
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,700
 Like, is it absolutely awful?

1226
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,700
 Bad songs.

1227
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,700
 A case of you is on it.

1228
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,700
 What's that?

1229
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,700
 So good.

1230
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,700
 That's one of her songs.

1231
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,700
 Okay.

1232
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,700
 Yeah.

1233
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,700
 But I mean, it's a collection from other albums, right?

1234
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,700
 Yeah, exactly.

1235
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,700
 It's her favorite ones that weren't commercially successful.

1236
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,700
 Exactly.

1237
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,700
 That's right.

1238
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,700
 Okay.

1239
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,900
 And she was so happy with it, she tried to release Misses 2, but the record label rejected

1240
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,900
 that.

1241
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,060
 And the only reason it came out, the record label didn't want to do it, but it was like

1242
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,060
 a compromise.

1243
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,060
 It was a bargaining.

1244
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,420
 She said, "You can do the greatest hits if I can do the greatest misses."

1245
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,420
 Yeah.

1246
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,820
 I don't know much about Joni Mitchell.

1247
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,820
 She's an incredible artist.

1248
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:00,020
 I mean, you know, she's, she had a really nice moment a few weeks ago at the Grammys.

1249
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,420
 She performed for the first time.

1250
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,060
 She's 80 years old.

1251
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,060
 She sang a song.

1252
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,060
 Not for the first time.

1253
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,060
 Yeah.

1254
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,060
 For the first time ever.

1255
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,060
 How's she ever...

1256
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,100
 Yeah, she's never, she's won, I think, 10 Grammys, but she's never performed at the

1257
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,100
 Grammys.

1258
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,100
 Oh, at the Grammys?

1259
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,100
 Yeah.

1260
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,100
 Sorry, you said she performed for the first time.

1261
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,420
 I think I said where she performed at the first time.

1262
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,420
 No, right, right, okay.

1263
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,100
 Regardless, she's 80 and she sits, you know, in a chair, she sings this beautiful song.

1264
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,660
 She wins a Grammy for best folk album, for a live album that she did, which is a bit

1265
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:29,700
 annoying, I think, for the other folk artists, I would say.

1266
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,700
 Okay.

1267
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,740
 Controversial, okay.

1268
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:38,340
 And yeah, she's someone who was a part of the whole scene with Dylan, Bob Dylan, and

1269
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,980
 Leonard Cohen and all that, for listeners that don't know her.

1270
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,700
 You won't find much of her stuff on Spotify.

1271
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,220
 She's one of those artists where you probably have to go to YouTube or...

1272
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,900
 She took it off because of Joe Rogan, right?

1273
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,900
 Did she?

1274
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,900
 Yeah.

1275
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,180
 Yeah, Joe Rogan was Spotify.

1276
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,180
 Yeah.

1277
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,180
 Exclusive.

1278
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,180
 Exclusive, right?

1279
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,580
 And he was saying some things that people didn't agree with.

1280
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,700
 I've got to say, I'm a big fan of Spotify as I am with Apple and all podcast profiles.

1281
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,660
 I'm so glad that the end to that sentence wasn't Joe Rogan.

1282
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,660
 I had to say, I'm a big fan.

1283
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,100
 Yeah, but a load of people took their stuff off Spotify because of that, and she was one

1284
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,100
 of them.

1285
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,700
 I mean, do we know it wasn't because of us, because we are on Spotify?

1286
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,100
 Yeah, but we're not an exclusive Spotify.

1287
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:21,300
 Maybe it was Parenting Hell with Josh Wickham that she hated.

1288
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,300
 Wow.

1289
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,300
 Okay.

1290
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,300
 She's amazing.

1291
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,300
 She's pretty cool.

1292
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:30,900
 She had polio when she was nine years old, and interesting thing about that is I was

1293
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,260
 reading about other people who had polio around the time.

1294
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:38,740
 Mia Farrow had polio when she was nine, and she wrote that she was taken to an isolation

1295
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:43,420
 unit because it's catching polio, obviously, and she was taken away from all of her family

1296
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,500
 for months, and all of her belongings were burned.

1297
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,020
 Is this Mia Farrow?

1298
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,020
 Right.

1299
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,020
 Blimey.

1300
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,020
 It's not amazing.

1301
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,860
 You're basically, at nine years old, you've got this disease.

1302
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,580
 They take you away, and they burn everything that you own.

1303
00:49:55,580 --> 00:50:00,100
 Is that the case with polio, that if you touch your toy, you could get it from that, or was

1304
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,940
 that a, we weren't sure what it was?

1305
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,940
 No, it can.

1306
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,700
 It can go through bodily fluids and stuff like that.

1307
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,980
 Obviously, we have vaccines for it now.

1308
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,540
 Joe Rogan told me to say that they don't want that.

1309
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:16,380
 No, we have vaccines for it now, so it's not as much of a problem, obviously.

1310
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,260
 Yeah, it can go through feces, through spits, through esophageal urethra.

1311
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,700
 The speed with which we went from Joni Mitchell to feces.

1312
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,700
 Yeah!

1313
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,660
 Well, that's our pipeline, I'm afraid, that's how we roll.

1314
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,460
 It comes through our pipeline, yeah.

1315
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:33,860
 No, Ian Dury of Ian Dury and the Blockets had polio as a child.

1316
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,860
 Did he?

1317
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,860
 Yeah, yeah, so a lot of musicians.

1318
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,860
 Yeah.

1319
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,860
 Yeah.

1320
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,860
 How interesting.

1321
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:43,500
 Supposedly gave her an edge to how she tuned her guitar and so polio, because, Joni, yeah,

1322
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,860
 so she got into guitaring about 15 years old at school and she was recovering from polio

1323
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:51,900
 and it just meant that it must have been harder to tune a guitar for her.

1324
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,500
 Yeah, it kind of changes the way that your bone structure works and stuff like that.

1325
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,420
 There was a footballer called Grincha who had polio as a child and it made his legs

1326
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:03,740
 bandy, but it meant that he kind of ran in a way that no one else ran and it kind of

1327
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,860
 helped him to play football, supposedly.

1328
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,860
 Right.

1329
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:12,380
 She started smoking at the age of nine and she started singing because she wanted to

1330
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:19,180
 get smoking money, so she was in a cafe in Calgary in Canada and she was the resident

1331
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:24,140
 artist and she was drawing people and pictures would go up on the walls and then she needed

1332
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:29,060
 a bit more money, so she started singing and everyone said, "You're a pretty good singer."

1333
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:34,100
 And so she went home and asked her mum if her mum would buy her a ukulele and her mum

1334
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,580
 said, "Who do you think you are?

1335
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,580
 Kitty Wells?"

1336
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,060
 A good one.

1337
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,420
 I think it was a different time.

1338
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,140
 At the time, that was probably a really sick burn.

1339
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:50,260
 Kitty Wells, she was the first female country singer to get to the top of the US charts.

1340
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:54,020
 With her song, it wasn't God who made honky-tonk angels.

1341
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,820
 This is the kind of song I'd like to listen to actually.

1342
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:57,820
 Yeah.

1343
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,580
 So was it that she started singing at the age of nine and then people thought, you know,

1344
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,780
 what would make this nine-year-old's voice even better?

1345
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:07,100
 Twenty bent on it and it was a day and then she got into it that way.

1346
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,460
 It wasn't that.

1347
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:14,540
 She started smoking at the age of nine and then at the age of like 14 or 15, she was

1348
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,060
 like, "I need money for cigarettes."

1349
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,740
 So let me write a masterpiece.

1350
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,740
 Yeah, exactly.

1351
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,300
 Calgary, Alberta, Canada, that's where Bret the Hitman Heart is from as you would know

1352
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,500
 if you had the WWE wrestling game.

1353
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,900
 Oh, you would also know that if you spent any time with Dan over the last 20 years.

1354
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:36,180
 And then she started dating David Crosby from Crosby Stills and Nash.

1355
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:42,580
 And Crosby sort of invited Eric Clapton over to kind of check out this Joni Mitchell and

1356
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:48,660
 he said that Clapton sat mesmerised by her playing and her different tunings of her guitar,

1357
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,860
 although he also said that it might have been slightly due to the fact of all the weed that

1358
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,860
 he'd smelt at the time.

1359
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,860
 Absolutely.

1360
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,940
 He said, "I mean, she has no kitty wells."

1361
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,420
 She is, I mean, to watch footage of her in that period is spectacular.

1362
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,500
 Her music is extraordinary.

1363
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,500
 The songwriting is incredible.

1364
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,620
 And Blue is just consistently voted as one of the greatest albums.

1365
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:12,820
 Yeah, it's one of her albums, which is always very near the top of greatest albums of all

1366
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,820
 time.

1367
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:19,460
 If you're a millennial, you know Joni Mitchell from the heartbreaking scene in the film Love

1368
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:26,060
 Actually, where Emma Thompson receives a gift from her husband, Alan Rickman, and she thinks

1369
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,940
 it's a necklace, but it's really just a Joni Mitchell CD.

1370
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,940
 Oh, yes.

1371
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,940
 And then she's playing it.

1372
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:34,340
 And are you saying that, actually, that's quite a good present to give because she's

1373
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,340
 an incredible shunter.

1374
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,340
 Better than a necklace.

1375
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,340
 Yeah.

1376
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,580
 But then it turns out he gave the necklace to his mistress.

1377
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,580
 That's the thing.

1378
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,780
 But if you're going to find out that your husband's taken on a mistress, that's a good present

1379
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,780
 to receive.

1380
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,780
 Oh, yeah.

1381
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,260
 Joni Mitchell is great soundtrack for...

1382
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,260
 Right.

1383
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,780
 And did they split up because of that moment in the film?

1384
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,780
 I don't remember.

1385
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,780
 I don't think they don't.

1386
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,780
 No, she takes...

1387
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,780
 He takes her back.

1388
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,780
 Basically.

1389
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,260
 He very generously takes her back.

1390
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,260
 She takes him back.

1391
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,180
 She says, "Oh, he's just been a bit silly until now.

1392
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,180
 It's all fine."

1393
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,180
 She doesn't quite do it like that.

1394
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,180
 Yeah.

1395
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,180
 Well, it's not far off.

1396
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:10,740
 Joni Mitchell split up with David Crosby by singing him a song at a party.

1397
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,740
 Oh, really?

1398
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,740
 Oh, that's brutal.

1399
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,340
 He has been cheating on her and she wrote this song, which basically, I haven't heard

1400
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,100
 the song, but I imagine in the middle it goes, "You're fucking dumps, mate."

1401
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,100
 Yeah.

1402
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,100
 Whatever.

1403
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,780
 But she played it once and then he was like, "Oh, that's really good."

1404
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,780
 And she went, "Ugh."

1405
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,940
 And played it again because he didn't get it.

1406
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,420
 Do we know what it's called?

1407
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,420
 Do we have lyrics?

1408
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:34,900
 It's called "The Song About the Midway," but I haven't seen the lyrics.

1409
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:39,420
 I would have called it something like, "Nick is on the backseat," or something that really

1410
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,660
 makes him worried even as you're starting to hear the song.

1411
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,660
 Oh, I see.

1412
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:46,140
 When you overdo it on the metaphor so much, people can't quite...

1413
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,140
 The Midway.

1414
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,140
 Sorry.

1415
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:51,220
 Is that the rift that goes through Jillingers that you're talking about?

1416
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:56,620
 We're talking about the Battle of Medway.

1417
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:01,420
 People who've never done their greatest hits album, AC/DC, you know the reason why?

1418
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,740
 Because they're all greatest hits albums.

1419
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,740
 Yeah.

1420
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,740
 Thank you.

1421
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,460
 Is that what they said or are you saying?

1422
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,460
 I think we agree.

1423
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,780
 I and AC/DC agree on this.

1424
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,780
 Yeah.

1425
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:16,380
 No, I think a lot of artists fear the slight kind of creative death of, "Here are your

1426
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,780
 best songs," and that's it.

1427
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,460
 But you can just do another, Aaron Carter, his most requested hit.

1428
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,460
 Who?

1429
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,460
 Aaron Carter.

1430
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,460
 Aaron Carter.

1431
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,460
 Aaron Carter.

1432
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,460
 Yeah.

1433
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,980
 Like the American Backstreet Boys.

1434
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,140
 He was the younger brother.

1435
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,460
 He passed away very sadly, not too long ago.

1436
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,460
 Did he?

1437
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,460
 Yeah.

1438
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,460
 I didn't know that.

1439
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,460
 Because most...

1440
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,460
 I was looking up a huge list of greatest hits albums.

1441
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,460
 Yeah.

1442
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,460
 Long list.

1443
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,460
 They're almost all called greatest hits, which I think is quite dull.

1444
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,460
 You were looking at this list and then you stopped at A.A.

1445
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,460
 Run.

1446
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,460
 Yes.

1447
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,460
 Yeah.

1448
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,460
 Anything about ZZ Top?

1449
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:54,140
 That's why you keep coming up with crime things all day.

1450
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,300
 It's like, "I've been busted by the alphabet.

1451
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,300
 I'm gutted."

1452
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:03,100
 But his was called "Most Requested Hits," which I think is a nice, slight twist

1453
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,100
 on the formula.

1454
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,220
 And then the second one is called "Come Get It," the very best of Aaron Carter.

1455
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:11,020
 It must be one of his songs or something, followed by "Too Good, Too Be True."

1456
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,020
 So I just think he's good for...

1457
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,020
 Oh, so they're all greatest hits.

1458
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,020
 Every single one of them.

1459
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,620
 He's got three albums of greatest hits.

1460
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,620
 So I think that is...

1461
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,620
 Wow.

1462
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:21,620
 According to Reddit, and it does seem to be true when I checked it, Kiss have had more

1463
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:25,300
 greatest hit compilations than they have studio albums.

1464
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,300
 Okay.

1465
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,300
 That's great.

1466
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:32,300
 They've had 20 studio albums, and as far as I can see, they've either had 21 or I counted

1467
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,820
 23 greatest hits on them.

1468
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,820
 Wow.

1469
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,740
 They did a farewell tour in 2000 and 2001, and since then, they've done 13 tours.

1470
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,740
 Hell yeah.

1471
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:42,740
 Isn't that amazing?

1472
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,740
 Yeah.

1473
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,820
 Do you know the biggest selling album in America of all time?

1474
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,940
 Are they greatest hits?

1475
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:49,660
 I'm going to guess Abba Gold.

1476
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,260
 Well, that's because you've only got to A/B in the alphabet.

1477
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,420
 No, it's happened again.

1478
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,860
 It's the Eagles, isn't it?

1479
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:58,860
 That's correct.

1480
00:56:58,860 --> 00:56:59,860
 Yeah.

1481
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,860
 It's the Eagles.

1482
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,620
 Now, so this is their greatest hits album.

1483
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,220
 Who here can name a song by the Eagles?

1484
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,220
 How about California?

1485
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,220
 California.

1486
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,220
 That's not on the greatest album.

1487
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,220
 No!

1488
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,220
 Yeah.

1489
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,220
 Isn't that incredible?

1490
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,380
 This is from a period where they hadn't yet written that song.

1491
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:16,260
 They must have felt like chumps coming up with that song after they've done it.

1492
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,260
 We've already done a greatest hit album.

1493
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,260
 Oh, man.

1494
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,520
 So this is now Canon.

1495
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,140
 This is not a greatest hit, and honestly, let's do a few Eagles albums.

1496
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,580
 It's their greatest hit.

1497
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:32,140
 The best selling album in the UK is the greatest hits.

1498
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,140
 Oh, Queen.

1499
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,140
 Queen, you got it.

1500
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:39,820
 At the same time, they released Greatest Flicks, which was a video of all their best songs.

1501
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:40,820
 Oh, very cool.

1502
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,380
 And Greatest Picks, which was photographs from that.

1503
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,140
 That's really clever.

1504
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:47,660
 Who here owns Queen's Greatest Hits?

1505
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,660
 Yeah.

1506
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,660
 Oh, my God.

1507
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,660
 Two of us.

1508
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,660
 Cassettes and then CD.

1509
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:55,860
 So I own it and Dan owns it, and that makes sense, because one in four British households

1510
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,660
 owns Queen's Greatest Hits.

1511
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:58,660
 Really?

1512
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,660
 It's still, really.

1513
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,660
 I think probably still.

1514
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:05,060
 There probably is some generational churn happening, but in 2021, Abba Gold, which is

1515
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:11,660
 the other huge Greatest Hits album after Queens, it got to a thousand weeks in the top hundred

1516
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,660
 chart.

1517
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,660
 That's amazing.

1518
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,660
 That's amazing.

1519
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:15,660
 It's a perfect album.

1520
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:16,660
 Yeah.

1521
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,660
 Perfect band.

1522
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:26,660
 It's not too high way to hell, but it's, by the way, AA, AP, and then AC/DC.

1523
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:30,660
 Anything about Adam and the Ants?

1524
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:36,260
 There was an album that was released in 1977 by the BBC called Death and Horror.

1525
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,100
 Basically, you know how you can just buy incidental sounds, right?

1526
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,100
 Like a door creaking.

1527
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,100
 Yeah, door creaking.

1528
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,020
 Sorry, the BBC would have like an archive of incidental sounds.

1529
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:49,060
 So this was all sounds of horrific things.

1530
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:56,020
 Tracks included head chopped off, assorted creepy creaks, red hot poker in the eye.

1531
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,020
 That was it.

1532
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:58,020
 And it was a top 100 charting album.

1533
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,020
 Gaths were crazy.

1534
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,020
 Exactly.

1535
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:01,020
 Team Gaths.

1536
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:05,340
 And then this is, this is the one I'd love to get, but I don't think it necessarily would

1537
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:10,900
 have charted, but there was an album called Recorded Delivery by a guy called Yannick Schaefer.

1538
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,860
 So basically what he did was he put a dictaphone inside a package and he put it through the

1539
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:21,820
 Royal Mail and he recorded the entire journey that this dictaphone went on as it was travelling

1540
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:26,340
 through the parcel, going through the mailbox being picked up, put in the van.

1541
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,620
 And so what you hear is whistling postmen just sort of walking along.

1542
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,300
 You get sliding van doors.

1543
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,540
 There's lots of clunks.

1544
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:36,180
 You get early morning mail workers talking about their dirty sex lives.

1545
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:41,140
 There's a sudden unexpected shout of, "Anus!"

1546
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:45,660
 That was me.

1547
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,300
 And 500 of them were printed.

1548
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,500
 Brian Eno said he wished he thought of it first.

1549
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,500
 It was a...

1550
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,500
 It's very Eno, isn't it?

1551
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,580
 It is very, very Eno.

1552
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:57,740
 The first Greatest Hits album ever.

1553
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:58,740
 Johnny Maffis.

1554
00:59:58,740 --> 00:59:59,740
 Johnny Maffis.

1555
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:03,540
 In fact, if you look in the Oxford English Dictionary, it's the first use of the phrase

1556
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,540
 "Gracest Hits".

1557
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,540
 Right.

1558
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,780
 He wrote a single song called Chances Are, which was in Mad Men.

1559
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,780
 Well...

1560
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,780
 Chances Are he did.

1561
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:11,780
 If you remember it.

1562
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,780
 I don't know.

1563
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,780
 He was late 50s, wasn't he?

1564
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,780
 So it's perfect timing for Mad Men.

1565
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:15,780
 Yes, he was.

1566
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,780
 I looked him up.

1567
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,100
 He's still alive, Johnny Maffis.

1568
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,100
 Yeah.

1569
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,660
 He's sort of mid-90s, I think.

1570
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,660
 Cool.

1571
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,660
 He's old, but he's still kicking around.

1572
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:23,660
 Yeah.

1573
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:28,900
 He was a high jumper for the US Olympic team before he became a singer, but he was kind

1574
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:35,660
 of singing in the clubs and stuff, and the head of popular music at Columbia was on holiday

1575
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:41,100
 in San Francisco and heard him singing and sent a telegram to the company saying, "Have

1576
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:46,340
 found phenomenal 19-year-old boy who could go all the way, send blank contracts."

1577
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,180
 Oh, that's great.

1578
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:51,620
 And he was an Olympian at that time, at 19 or...?

1579
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,620
 He'd been trying out.

1580
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,620
 He kind of...

1581
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,620
 He got the call to go to the trials.

1582
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,620
 This is a cool thing.

1583
01:00:55,620 --> 01:01:00,180
 In 1956, he got the call to go to the Olympic trials, but he had just got his recording contract.

1584
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:03,620
 He said to his dad, "Should I become a high jumper or should I become a musician?"

1585
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:07,260
 It's annoying, isn't it, when people are world-class at not one thing but two.

1586
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:11,540
 You could do both Vanilla Ice as a rapper and a real estate agent.

1587
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,300
 You could do both.

1588
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:19,060
 Well, Cody Simpson, the Australian singer-actor, also swam for their Olympic team.

1589
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,060
 Oh, yeah.

1590
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,060
 Very nice.

1591
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:23,060
 And also is a Gina Davis who almost qualified for Archery for the US.

1592
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,060
 Oh, that's right.

1593
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,060
 Get away.

1594
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,060
 There you go.

1595
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:27,060
 You could do both.

1596
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,060
 Yeah.

1597
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,060
 Okay.

1598
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,060
 You can do both.

1599
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,060
 And it's fine that I've done neither.

1600
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,060
 Johnny Mathis.

1601
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,060
 It wasn't actually any greatest hits.

1602
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:36,140
 It was just something they rushed out because he was about to go on tour in the UK.

1603
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:39,500
 He didn't have time to record any new tracks, so they just bundled together his first four

1604
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,500
 recordings.

1605
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,500
 Oh, is that right?

1606
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,500
 Record them Johnny's Greatest Hits.

1607
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,580
 It was in the charts for nine years.

1608
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,580
 So they manifested it?

1609
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,580
 Pretty much.

1610
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,580
 Yeah.

1611
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,580
 They're like, "The Greatest Hits?

1612
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,580
 Australian and Flucking Question."

1613
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:53,580
 And there's a reason why you'd love him, James.

1614
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,580
 He used to play golf 300 times a year.

1615
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:56,580
 Oh, he sounds great.

1616
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,740
 He's a great guy.

1617
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,980
 And he has a cookbook library.

1618
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,820
 He loves cookbooks so much.

1619
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,100
 He bought thousands of them.

1620
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,780
 He had Office Kitchen, his own library of cookbooks.

1621
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:10,660
 And in 1982, he wrote his own cookbook called "Cooking for You Alone," which is all about

1622
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,620
 meals for one and how you can make them delicious and lovely.

1623
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:14,620
 Isn't that...

1624
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,620
 Isn't that...

1625
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,420
 I just think you seem like a really nice, sweet guy.

1626
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,420
 He's so sweet.

1627
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,420
 I know.

1628
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:23,660
 That does sound nice, but if you think that you're going to get a necklace for Valentine's

1629
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:28,660
 Day and you get the meals for one book, that's a real sign.

1630
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,340
 That's how Johnny Mitchell dumped her next boyfriend.

1631
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:37,340
 OK, that's it.

1632
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,340
 That is all of our facts.

1633
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,700

 Also, do make sure to go and see Olga live, prawn cocktail, you're on tour right now.

1645
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,060
 Prawn cocktail, that's the name of my show.

1646
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,620
 You'll just be eating it.

1647
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,620
 Don't stop.

1648
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:13,540
 And I promise it's going to be 100% high quality prawns and never a cheap meatball.

1649
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,540
 Yep.

01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,180
 Good bye.

1658
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:33,180
.

1659
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:38,180
 Hey, Ness.

1660
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:44,140
 Lovely Easter egg.

1661
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,720
 (upbeat music)
