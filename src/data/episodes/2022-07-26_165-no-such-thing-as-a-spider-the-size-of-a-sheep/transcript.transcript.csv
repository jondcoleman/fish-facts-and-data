00:00:00,00:00:19,"â™ª Hello and welcome to another episode, a no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:23,"coming to you from the QI offices in Covern, Garden."
00:00:23,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Andrew Huntamari, Anna Chizinski and"
00:00:27,00:00:31,James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:31,00:00:36,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:36,00:00:39,Starting with fact number one and that's my fact.
00:00:39,00:00:44,My fact this week is that the Chinese government are planning on giving their national anthem
00:00:44,00:00:47,a speed limit.
00:00:47,00:00:51,So this is a plan at the moment.
00:00:51,00:00:55,"They haven't enforced it yet, apparently in the next month or so a paper will be proposed"
00:00:55,00:00:56,to enforce this.
00:00:56,00:01:01,They believe that the anthem is being abused by the people singing it.
00:01:01,00:01:02,Really?
00:01:02,00:01:07,"Yeah, they've called it a damaging situation, they're saying it's not universally respected"
00:01:07,00:01:08,and cherished.
00:01:08,00:01:11,"People are laughing when they're singing, they're singing too fast, they're singing"
00:01:11,00:01:12,too slow.
00:01:12,00:01:13,They're singing too furious?
00:01:13,00:01:16,"Yeah, they're singing."
00:01:16,00:01:19,So the song is called March of the Volunteers.
00:01:19,00:01:20,Right.
00:01:20,00:01:25,"It's originally, although anyone not volunteering will be in trouble."
00:01:25,00:01:28,It originally appeared in a movie soundtrack.
00:01:28,00:01:30,It was part of a movie.
00:01:30,00:01:31,The movie was cool.
00:01:31,00:01:36,You're now not allowed to fast forward that movie anymore.
00:01:36,00:01:41,"Yeah, it was in a movie called Children of Trouble Times and it was actually quite a political"
00:01:41,00:01:46,movie and the song was wrote in specifically for it and what ended up happening was people
00:01:46,00:01:50,started singing it and it caught on more and more and people thought this would make
00:01:50,00:01:51,a good anthem.
00:01:51,00:01:52,So it became the official anthem.
00:01:52,00:01:56,How are they going to deal with the laughter issue because you can still laugh at tempo?
00:01:56,00:01:57,You can.
00:01:57,00:01:58,They've got any plan to...
00:01:58,00:01:59,Welcome back.
00:01:59,00:02:03,"Yeah, there's going to be... you're going to get dressed down basically, you'll be criticised"
00:02:03,00:02:04,and corrected.
00:02:04,00:02:06,"What, put in more casual clothes?"
00:02:06,00:02:07,Yeah.
00:02:07,00:02:08,Yeah.
00:02:08,00:02:09,So it's like Mufti Day.
00:02:09,00:02:10,No.
00:02:10,00:02:13,"No, it's different because dress down Friday isn't where you come in and just get told"
00:02:13,00:02:14,off all day.
00:02:14,00:02:18,It is one I do it.
00:02:18,00:02:23,"But interestingly, the Chinese government, they banned their own national anthem three years"
00:02:23,00:02:29,ago from all sorts of places so they said you're not allowed to sing it outside major sporting
00:02:29,00:02:33,events or formal diplomatic occasions so you're not allowed to sing it at your wedding
00:02:33,00:02:37,if you want to or at a funeral or anywhere which has apparently an inappropriate atmosphere.
00:02:37,00:02:38,Right.
00:02:38,00:02:42,Do weddings if you're not allowed to have particularly similar atmospheres?
00:02:42,00:02:50,"So Germany banned their own... some of their own anthem, didn't they?"
00:02:50,00:02:51,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:51,00:02:53,"Wait, I mean like a bit of the song or..."
00:02:53,00:02:57,"Yeah, they banned the first couple of verses because it was associated with the Nazi regime"
00:02:57,00:03:00,and there was that really embarrassing moment.
00:03:00,00:03:05,"I think it was last year or a couple of years ago, it was a US-Germany football match, like"
00:03:05,00:03:08,a friendly football match I think and there was an opera singer there from America called
00:03:08,00:03:12,"Will Kimball who was singing as a mark of respect to the Germans, the German national"
00:03:12,00:03:17,"anthem, but he started singing the lines that were associated only with Nazi Germany."
00:03:17,00:03:19,"With Dutchland, Dutchland, Uber-Allers."
00:03:19,00:03:20,Yeah.
00:03:20,00:03:24,"Which, when you hear those words, you do think immediately of Hitler."
00:03:24,00:03:27,"That's the version I've been singing this whole time, is that really not the version"
00:03:27,00:03:28,anymore?
00:03:28,00:03:29,Yeah.
00:03:29,00:03:30,You're not meant to sing that.
00:03:30,00:03:31,It's the thing.
00:03:31,00:03:32,"It's in German, I didn't know."
00:03:32,00:03:33,I didn't know what I'm singing.
00:03:33,00:03:38,"It's because the only words you know really are Dutch and Dutch and Uber means good, right?"
00:03:38,00:03:39,"Good, yeah."
00:03:39,00:03:43,"So, until you get to that level, it sounds like quite a good lyrics, right?"
00:03:43,00:03:45,What's the word that tips it over?
00:03:45,00:03:47,"There's no word that's bad, it just means Germany, Germany, overall."
00:03:47,00:03:51,"It's just like the fact that Hitler itself is not a bad sound, but the association now"
00:03:51,00:03:55,"with Hitler, the man, made it a name you probably, hopefully, won't call your child."
00:03:55,00:03:56,But I shouldn't.
00:03:56,00:03:59,"And in the same way, the National Anthem was often sung by the Nazis."
00:03:59,00:04:01,So now it's got those bad associations.
00:04:01,00:04:09,"Speaking of people who made National Anthem full par, is it full par or false par?"
00:04:09,00:04:10,I think.
00:04:10,00:04:16,"Have we ever mentioned about opera singer Tony Henry, who's sang the Croatian National Anthem"
00:04:16,00:04:17,before England v. Croatia?
00:04:17,00:04:18,No.
00:04:18,00:04:24,"And instead of singing Milla Cuda C. Planina, meaning my dear, how much we love your mountains,"
00:04:24,00:04:29,"he sang Milla Cura C. Planina, meaning my dear, my penis is a mountain."
00:04:29,00:04:30,Oh.
00:04:30,00:04:33,There was a dozi for Milla I winner.
00:04:33,00:04:34,We spoke about him on the show.
00:04:34,00:04:35,Do you remember his name?
00:04:35,00:04:36,I can't remember his name off the top of my head.
00:04:36,00:04:37,Australia for me.
00:04:37,00:04:38,Not the one who pushed his car.
00:04:38,00:04:39,"Yeah, who won it on foot."
00:04:39,00:04:40,My problem was it.
00:04:40,00:04:41,"Yeah, Jack Rowan."
00:04:41,00:04:43,I think it's him when he won the Formula One once.
00:04:43,00:04:47,"They realized they didn't have the ozzy National Anthem, because they thought it was God save"
00:04:47,00:04:48,the Queen.
00:04:48,00:04:50,"And so they were like, what do we do?"
00:04:50,00:04:54,And all they could think to do was find a drunken trumpet player who just played happy
00:04:54,00:04:55,both days.
00:04:55,00:05:00,It burns amazing.
00:05:00,00:05:04,"In Luxembourg, not in Luxembourg, in the Olympics in 1952 Luxembourg weren't expected to win"
00:05:04,00:05:06,anything.
00:05:06,00:05:10,"And they won the 1500 meters, I think, and they got gold."
00:05:10,00:05:13,"And the band, who was supposed to play all the anthems, hadn't been given the score and"
00:05:13,00:05:16,"didn't know the Luxembourg National Anthem, because they'd all seen the Luxembourg wouldn't"
00:05:16,00:05:17,win anything.
00:05:17,00:05:20,"And you can see a bit of it on YouTube, but they just improvised the whole thing."
00:05:20,00:05:22,They just completely make it up.
00:05:22,00:05:27,"It's like when an actor puts on his resume, yeah, I can speak Hungarian, yeah, definitely."
00:05:27,00:05:29,And he gets to the casting.
00:05:29,00:05:32,I was looking into music in China generally.
00:05:32,00:05:39,"Now, in terms of record sales, where do you think China sits, rank-wise, worldwide, in terms"
00:05:39,00:05:41,of people who buy music?
00:05:41,00:05:42,"Well, interesting."
00:05:42,00:05:45,"Do you mean are we including things like streaming and stuff like that, just basically spending"
00:05:45,00:05:46,money on music?
00:05:46,00:05:47,"You know, spending money on music, yeah."
00:05:47,00:05:51,"I tend to say, because they've got a billion people there at the top, or at least in the top"
00:05:51,00:05:53,"five, I would say."
00:05:53,00:05:54,They're 12.
00:05:54,00:05:57,They're 12 in the world.
00:05:57,00:06:01,"And largely that's to do with piracy, that they've only just started to crack down on."
00:06:01,00:06:05,But they're only starting to boom now because of this crackdown that's gone on.
00:06:05,00:06:09,"But if you look at their lists of best-selling albums, it's still really back in the day"
00:06:09,00:06:10,where...
00:06:10,00:06:11,"So, what do you mean?"
00:06:11,00:06:14,"It's like they listen to stuff from the '80s, like Bon Jovier."
00:06:14,00:06:16,"Well, just nothing's taken."
00:06:16,00:06:20,"So, it's mainly Chinese artists and Korean artists and Taiwanese artists that you wouldn't"
00:06:20,00:06:21,have heard of.
00:06:21,00:06:27,"But number four, best-selling album, physical album, of all time in China is Titanic, the soundtrack."
00:06:27,00:06:28,"Oh, okay."
00:06:28,00:06:29,Yeah.
00:06:29,00:06:35,"In 1998, or 1912, depending on when, which soundtrack you're talking about."
00:06:35,00:06:38,Just live recording a feeble screening.
00:06:38,00:06:41,"Just the bang going down, because they're current on playing the night."
00:06:41,00:06:42,"But, wait a minute."
00:06:42,00:06:46,"But our best-selling single of all time, at least until recently, was White Christmas."
00:06:46,00:06:50,"So, it's not like our best-selling songs are all new, is it?"
00:06:50,00:06:51,"No, no, but it's because people just weren't buying."
00:06:51,00:06:53,They were buying pirated albums.
00:06:53,00:06:54,I have a question.
00:06:54,00:06:55,Yes.
00:06:55,00:06:59,"When Bon Jovier introduces himself, do you think he says the name?"
00:06:59,00:07:06,"James Jovier, Bon Jovier, and then he pauses, and then he says, John Bon Jovier."
00:07:06,00:07:07,"Actually, it doesn't in three steps."
00:07:07,00:07:08,I think you both.
00:07:08,00:07:11,"Is Bon Jovier, is Bon his middle name?"
00:07:11,00:07:12,This is what I'm trying to get at.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"Is it his real name, first of all?"
00:07:14,00:07:15,I don't know.
00:07:15,00:07:16,"No, I don't think it is."
00:07:16,00:07:18,"But if it is, it must be his middle, because it's not hyphenated, is it?"
00:07:18,00:07:19,"So, it's not a double-barrelled."
00:07:19,00:07:23,But it doesn't get Mother Bon by the Jovier.
00:07:23,00:07:24,Lowercase though.
00:07:24,00:07:25,"Lowercase though, the Bon."
00:07:25,00:07:26,"No, no."
00:07:26,00:07:27,It's uppercase.
00:07:27,00:07:33,"I think that when Jacob Riesmog introduces himself, he says, the name's Mog, Riesmog."
00:07:33,00:07:34,Jacob Riesmog.
00:07:34,00:07:35,"Yes, I do."
00:07:35,00:07:36,Do you?
00:07:36,00:07:37,"OK, all right."
00:07:37,00:07:41,"Well, yeah, in that case, maybe he does, because I imagine those two are the same."
00:07:41,00:07:43,I like the name's Mog very much.
00:07:43,00:07:44,Mog the cat.
00:07:44,00:07:53,"Did you know that in Tang Dynasty, China, so just over a thousand years ago, I think that was,"
00:07:53,00:07:58,"then, you were supposed to greet and bid goodbye to people by improvising verse on the spot"
00:07:58,00:07:59,whenever you did it.
00:07:59,00:08:03,"If you were an educated person, you had to improvise a bit of poetry."
00:08:03,00:08:04,How did you do the improv?
00:08:04,00:08:06,Did you ask for a word?
00:08:06,00:08:10,"Just a non-geographical location, like a school."
00:08:10,00:08:11,A school?
00:08:11,00:08:16,"They've actually just banned some songs, haven't they?"
00:08:16,00:08:17,"Oh, I think, sorry."
00:08:17,00:08:19,"I think in 2015, they banned some songs."
00:08:19,00:08:24,So the Chinese Ministry of Culture released a list of 120 songs that are banned for being
00:08:24,00:08:25,immoral.
00:08:25,00:08:30,"And just on that list, there was included a song called ""College Self Study Room,"" which"
00:08:30,00:08:36,"is about a guy having a difficult time finding a place to study for university, banned"
00:08:36,00:08:37,from being immoral.
00:08:37,00:08:38,Wow.
00:08:38,00:08:40,What does he do instead of study?
00:08:40,00:08:43,"I didn't actually understand this song, because I'm not fluent."
00:08:43,00:08:47,I'm just trying to think what immorality there might be in this song.
00:08:47,00:08:50,So you think he gave up on trying to find the study and ended up masturbating instead of
00:08:50,00:08:51,something?
00:08:51,00:08:52,Panache.
00:08:52,00:08:57,It's like he could read my mind.
00:08:57,00:09:06,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James Harkin."
00:09:06,00:09:14,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1921, 78% of shaving brushes sold in New York contained"
00:09:14,00:09:15,anthrax.
00:09:15,00:09:18,And did it make it froth better or were they putting that in there?
00:09:18,00:09:21,It wasn't put in there on purpose.
00:09:21,00:09:27,"It is the fact that shaving brushes used to be and sometimes still are made out of badger,"
00:09:27,00:09:32,"and they used to get high quality badger fur from Russia, and then they would disinfect"
00:09:32,00:09:34,it in France.
00:09:34,00:09:39,"But then around the war time, they stopped sanitizing it."
00:09:39,00:09:44,"And badger hair is actually okay, because it's not that susceptible to anthrax poisoning."
00:09:44,00:09:50,"But when Russia fell apart a bit, we had to start importing horse hair from China and Japan,"
00:09:50,00:09:55,"and horse hair is much more susceptible to anthrax, and so suddenly that became an issue."
00:09:55,00:09:56,"Ah, yes, you're right."
00:09:56,00:10:00,And what people thought at the time during the war was it there was diabolical tactics
00:10:00,00:10:01,of the enemy.
00:10:01,00:10:05,"They said it was down to, but then they realised that it wasn't anything to do with that."
00:10:05,00:10:07,Occam's razor is the simplest thing.
00:10:07,00:10:09,We're not cleaning our hair properly.
00:10:09,00:10:10,Occam's razor.
00:10:10,00:10:12,"Love it, because you're shaving."
00:10:12,00:10:13,Yeah.
00:10:13,00:10:20,"Actually these brushes are still a problem, because people love to buy antique shaving brushes"
00:10:20,00:10:24,"or anything to do with what people like to collect vintage things, and they like to use it"
00:10:24,00:10:29,"hipsters mainly, and they'll be using these brushes, and they hipsters all have beards."
00:10:29,00:10:34,"Ah, because they're aware about the anthrax situation going on."
00:10:34,00:10:40,"After they lost some key hipster members of their party to anthrax, do you know just"
00:10:40,00:10:45,on shaving how they use the train barbers?
00:10:45,00:10:50,"Well, so you can't take them to someone's face immediately because they have a sharp"
00:10:50,00:10:51,object.
00:10:51,00:10:52,"No, exactly."
00:10:52,00:10:53,So was it on an animal?
00:10:53,00:10:55,It wasn't on an animal that would have been good.
00:10:55,00:10:56,Maybe there was some animal training.
00:10:56,00:10:57,I'm sure there was.
00:10:57,00:10:58,Was it on an arm?
00:10:58,00:10:59,You do it on your arm.
00:10:59,00:11:01,That's a good idea.
00:11:01,00:11:05,Was it on dead bearded people?
00:11:05,00:11:07,That is good thought.
00:11:07,00:11:08,Good thought.
00:11:08,00:11:11,You're doing a apprenticeship at the morgue.
00:11:11,00:11:14,"Actually, that would be quite good at the morgue, although if you made a mistake, you wouldn't"
00:11:14,00:11:16,know about it because they don't bleed.
00:11:16,00:11:17,You're right.
00:11:17,00:11:18,"Ah, yeah."
00:11:18,00:11:19,You have to.
00:11:19,00:11:20,That's why they ended the policy.
00:11:20,00:11:23,I'm the best barber in the world.
00:11:23,00:11:24,"Um, no."
00:11:24,00:11:25,"Okay, what else could it be then?"
00:11:25,00:11:27,It's something with very thin skin.
00:11:27,00:11:30,I still don't trample.
00:11:30,00:11:31,Um.
00:11:31,00:11:32,I got a testicle.
00:11:32,00:11:33,I'm going to...
00:11:33,00:11:34,"No, I'm going to..."
00:11:34,00:11:35,What?
00:11:35,00:11:38,"No, you're right, this."
00:11:38,00:11:40,I thought that was sick of your face.
00:11:40,00:11:41,What kind of...
00:11:41,00:11:42,"Well, they're delicate."
00:11:42,00:11:43,We've got a...
00:11:43,00:11:45,We've got a trainee barber in here today.
00:11:45,00:11:51,"But you find within your balls out for us, then we will do your face, I promise."
00:11:51,00:11:57,"It's his first day, but he's been great in the theory, modules."
00:11:57,00:12:00,Something with thin skin.
00:12:00,00:12:01,Eyelids.
00:12:01,00:12:02,"Oh, god, eyelids."
00:12:02,00:12:04,I'm going to put you out of your misery.
00:12:04,00:12:05,Balloons.
00:12:05,00:12:06,What?
00:12:06,00:12:07,Hairy balloon.
00:12:07,00:12:08,Hairy balloon.
00:12:08,00:12:09,Hairy balloon.
00:12:09,00:12:12,It just sounds like testicles.
00:12:12,00:12:15,I had no idea.
00:12:15,00:12:16,Balloons start off hairy.
00:12:16,00:12:22,And all the ones you get have been through the trainee barber.
00:12:22,00:12:23,Right.
00:12:23,00:12:24,"So, do you put..."
00:12:24,00:12:25,You must put hair onto the balloon.
00:12:25,00:12:27,You don't put hair on.
00:12:27,00:12:28,You put shaving foam.
00:12:28,00:12:29,"Well, this is..."
00:12:29,00:12:32,I saw a British pathophone from the '50s.
00:12:32,00:12:34,Talked about the training process.
00:12:34,00:12:39,"If they draw a face, they draw little face on the balloon."
00:12:39,00:12:41,"It is a good idea, though, isn't it?"
00:12:41,00:12:43,"Because if you nick them, they pop."
00:12:43,00:12:44,"If you nick them, they pop."
00:12:44,00:12:46,"I'm like, the corpse is..."
00:12:46,00:12:47,So...
00:12:47,00:12:51,It could be a bloated corpse with a lot of hair inside it.
00:12:51,00:12:53,"So, no, you paint the face on."
00:12:53,00:12:57,"And then you put the shaving foam on, and then the trainee has to scrape it off."
00:12:57,00:12:58,Right.
00:12:58,00:12:59,"Oh, god."
00:12:59,00:13:00,That's really interesting.
00:13:00,00:13:02,How do they do it now?
00:13:02,00:13:03,I don't know.
00:13:03,00:13:05,"Well, there's so little gold for it these days."
00:13:05,00:13:06,"Oh, well, yes."
00:13:06,00:13:11,"But, you know, there's hairdressers nearby here that does shaving them."
00:13:11,00:13:16,"So, I had my beard done, but not a clean shave, not with a razor."
00:13:16,00:13:20,"But, yeah, what they do is they have someone standing over and they train someone to do it."
00:13:20,00:13:23,And you just have to accept whatever happens.
00:13:23,00:13:24,That's the...
00:13:24,00:13:26,They just say this might not work.
00:13:26,00:13:30,And how is your testicle these days?
00:13:30,00:13:32,Do you know how you shave in space?
00:13:32,00:13:38,"I think it would be just as easy as out of space, but not in space."
00:13:38,00:13:40,I think I know a bit of the answer to this.
00:13:40,00:13:42,"But, should I say it?"
00:13:42,00:13:43,"Yeah, go for it."
00:13:43,00:13:50,"Is it that you do normal shaving with a buzzer, but you have a vacuum cleaner next to your head and you suck in all the hairs."
00:13:50,00:13:52,"So, you vacuum your face as you..."
00:13:52,00:13:54,"Oh, so you don't fill the air with hair?"
00:13:54,00:13:55,Exactly. This is what they have to avoid.
00:13:55,00:14:01,"They have the special really sticky shaving foam. It's called Astro Edge, right?"
00:14:01,00:14:03,"And it sticks to the face, but it traps stubble in it."
00:14:03,00:14:05,And then you have to...
00:14:05,00:14:09,"Well, actually, you can just sort of wipe that into a bag or something and then it's in right back."
00:14:09,00:14:12,"But, when you have your hair cut in space, you have to have a vacuum cleaner next to you."
00:14:12,00:14:14,That's it. When you have your teeth...
00:14:14,00:14:15,"And then suck, suck."
00:14:15,00:14:16,Yeah.
00:14:16,00:14:18,Slippery.
00:14:18,00:14:21,I don't know what kind of hairdressers you got.
00:14:23,00:14:26,"In shaving news, in recent shaving news."
00:14:26,00:14:27,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:27,00:14:35,"So, since December, there are cats in this small town in Virginia that have been being taken away, having their bellies shaved"
00:14:35,00:14:38,and then returned to their owners otherwise unharmed.
00:14:38,00:14:41,And no one knows who's doing this or what's happening.
00:14:41,00:14:43,Police say they're not sure what crime has been committed.
00:14:43,00:14:46,"There's upsetting the owners, so can the perpetrator please stop?"
00:14:46,00:14:49,I suppose it's someone who can't get hold of balloons.
00:14:49,00:14:51,Yeah.
00:14:51,00:15:01,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:15:01,00:15:08,My fact is that the cargo hold of the largest plane in service is longer than the first flight of the Wright brothers.
00:15:08,00:15:11,How long is it?
00:15:11,00:15:13,"It's pretty long, Anna."
00:15:13,00:15:15,Pretty long.
00:15:15,00:15:17,"Okay, on we go."
00:15:17,00:15:21,"I wonder if, because they didn't go very high, the Wright brothers either."
00:15:21,00:15:23,I wonder if they could have actually done the whole flight in there.
00:15:23,00:15:25,I think they might have been able to do that.
00:15:25,00:15:27,That first flight was 120 feet long.
00:15:27,00:15:28,Yeah.
00:15:28,00:15:29,Okay.
00:15:29,00:15:30,And how long is this cargo hold?
00:15:30,00:15:34,"As I said to Anna, it's quite long."
00:15:34,00:15:37,Let's talk about some other statistics.
00:15:37,00:15:43,The whole plane measures 275 feet in length.
00:15:43,00:15:44,"In length, yeah."
00:15:44,00:15:45,Okay.
00:15:45,00:15:47,So that's about 100 metres.
00:15:47,00:15:49,"Yeah, it shouldn't sound very long."
00:15:49,00:15:51,"84 metres, but it's very wide."
00:15:51,00:15:53,And how long did you say this the Wright brothers thing was?
00:15:53,00:15:54,120 feet.
00:15:54,00:15:56,"Okay, so that figure doesn't it?"
00:15:56,00:15:57,Yeah.
00:15:57,00:15:59,"God, that doesn't sound that long."
00:15:59,00:16:03,Because I thought that was the longest plane that's going back to overtake this one.
00:16:03,00:16:06,"It's being built by Paul Allen, who's the co-founder of Microsoft."
00:16:06,00:16:11,"And that is going to be, apparently it's going to be wider than a football field."
00:16:11,00:16:13,"Oh no, this one is wider than a football field."
00:16:13,00:16:15,"Well, that's unbelievably wide."
00:16:15,00:16:16,It's very wide.
00:16:16,00:16:22,"Football field is between, I think you're allowed between 50 metres and 100 metres for a width of a football field."
00:16:22,00:16:24,So these planes are all metres?
00:16:24,00:16:25,Yeah.
00:16:25,00:16:26,That's right.
00:16:26,00:16:27,That's right.
00:16:27,00:16:29,And he's playing that you're talking about.
00:16:29,00:16:30,Yeah.
00:16:30,00:16:32,Is 275 feet in length.
00:16:32,00:16:33,Yeah.
00:16:33,00:16:35,And its wing span is 290 feet.
00:16:35,00:16:36,There we go.
00:16:36,00:16:37,Oh wow.
00:16:37,00:16:39,It's wider than it is long.
00:16:39,00:16:40,Yes.
00:16:40,00:16:46,"So I've just realised that when I was thinking about width, I forgot to include the wings."
00:16:46,00:16:47,Yeah.
00:16:47,00:16:48,Which is why I should never design planes.
00:16:48,00:16:49,Right.
00:16:49,00:16:50,Right.
00:16:50,00:16:51,You've made a car.
00:16:51,00:16:52,That's what you meant.
00:16:52,00:16:54,I was including wings.
00:16:54,00:16:55,"Well, that's not that impressive."
00:16:55,00:16:56,Okay.
00:16:56,00:16:57,As you were.
00:16:57,00:16:59,And there is only one of it.
00:16:59,00:17:01,It's an amazing thing.
00:17:01,00:17:02,They've built one.
00:17:02,00:17:06,"There is a second one, which they've been working on for 30 years on and off."
00:17:06,00:17:08,Mostly off.
00:17:08,00:17:09,"Anyway, sorry."
00:17:09,00:17:14,"It's called the Antonov AN225 Maria, which is a Ukrainian plane."
00:17:14,00:17:15,Yeah.
00:17:15,00:17:20,And it can fit 10 tanks inside or 50 cars depending on what you need to move around.
00:17:20,00:17:25,So its maximum takeoff weight is 640 tons.
00:17:25,00:17:26,Yeah.
00:17:26,00:17:27,"I mean, that is."
00:17:27,00:17:30,So I checked out a few things that are about that weight.
00:17:30,00:17:31,Yeah.
00:17:31,00:17:33,Christ the Redeemer statue is about that weight.
00:17:33,00:17:34,Is it in Rio?
00:17:34,00:17:37,And you can strap it on top with the arms over the wings.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"Well, it looks like an aeroplane, doesn't it?"
00:17:39,00:17:40,It does.
00:17:40,00:17:41,It does.
00:17:41,00:17:46,"It's quite wide if you include the arms, which had a problem it doesn't have."
00:17:46,00:17:47,Wow.
00:17:47,00:17:48,That was 640 tons.
00:17:48,00:17:49,Wow.
00:17:49,00:17:50,That was incredible.
00:17:50,00:17:55,"So actually, if you had a plane carrying that, you wouldn't even be able to get pilot in there."
00:17:55,00:17:57,Because you'd already be exceeding the weight limit.
00:17:57,00:17:58,Yeah.
00:17:58,00:18:00,Christ would have to be flying the plane himself.
00:18:00,00:18:02,You'd have to chop off like a finger or something.
00:18:02,00:18:03,You were not even that.
00:18:03,00:18:04,You're not even that.
00:18:04,00:18:07,"You haven't kidnapped him, Dan."
00:18:07,00:18:15,"But that's the takeoff weight includes the weight of the plane, I think, doesn't it?"
00:18:15,00:18:16,Yeah.
00:18:16,00:18:18,"So actually, it would be too heavy to carry."
00:18:18,00:18:20,Is that including the pedestal of the Christ the Redeemer?
00:18:20,00:18:21,Because it's most of the pedestal.
00:18:21,00:18:22,"I'm not sure, actually."
00:18:22,00:18:23,I don't know.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"I don't know if it's not, and you didn't include the pedestal."
00:18:25,00:18:26,I guess you just wouldn't take off.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Yeah.
00:18:27,00:18:30,So here's something that you could carry possibly.
00:18:30,00:18:36,"The volume of this cargo hold is 46,000 cubic feet."
00:18:36,00:18:41,And that is approximately the same volume as the second largest tree in the world.
00:18:41,00:18:46,"Now, the problem is the tree is tree-shaped and the cargo hold isn't tree-shaped."
00:18:46,00:18:47,So you need to chop it up a lot.
00:18:47,00:18:48,Right.
00:18:48,00:18:53,But you theoretically could chop it up and get it in if you put it nicely in light Tetris.
00:18:53,00:18:56,Turn it into a book or a series of books and have it as a library.
00:18:56,00:18:58,"Speaking of books, do we have a book coming out soon?"
00:18:58,00:18:59,Certainly do.
00:18:59,00:19:02,November made from the biggest tree in the world.
00:19:02,00:19:05,I'm not sure I want it if it's made from the biggest tree in the world.
00:19:05,00:19:06,No.
00:19:06,00:19:07,"Yeah, you do."
00:19:07,00:19:09,Transported here by the biggest plane in the world.
00:19:09,00:19:10,"No, it wouldn't work."
00:19:10,00:19:15,"It wouldn't work because you had water to make paper, don't you?"
00:19:15,00:19:18,I was reading about the world's biggest private jet.
00:19:18,00:19:19,Okay.
00:19:19,00:19:21,So the world's biggest private jet.
00:19:21,00:19:26,It's been bought by Prince Al Saud of Saudi Arabia.
00:19:26,00:19:31,He's a Saudi prince and he has done some extraordinary things to it.
00:19:31,00:19:32,So it's ginormous.
00:19:32,00:19:34,It can fly 800 passengers.
00:19:34,00:19:36,"It can go 8,000 miles before refueling."
00:19:36,00:19:38,But obviously it's his own private plane.
00:19:38,00:19:39,He doesn't want 800 people on there.
00:19:39,00:19:44,So he's transformed the plane into this incredible mansion-esque house.
00:19:44,00:19:46,It's got a cinema in there.
00:19:46,00:19:47,It's got a steam room in there.
00:19:47,00:19:48,It's got the most impressively of all.
00:19:48,00:19:53,It's got a prayer room where all of the mats are on the ground are electronic.
00:19:53,00:19:57,"And no matter where you are in the sky, they electronically turn towards Mecca."
00:19:57,00:19:59,"So when you go into prayer, it's facing Mecca."
00:19:59,00:20:00,That is pretty clever.
00:20:00,00:20:03,But what if you're hovering directly above Mecca?
00:20:03,00:20:04,They're cool.
00:20:04,00:20:05,Yeah.
00:20:05,00:20:07,"They just kind of go vertical, do they?"
00:20:07,00:20:08,I thought of that.
00:20:08,00:20:09,That's true.
00:20:09,00:20:12,Trump's private plane is pretty pimped out as well.
00:20:12,00:20:16,He didn't interview before he became president where he was talking about it.
00:20:16,00:20:19,"And he said, describing his own plane."
00:20:19,00:20:22,"It's bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way."
00:20:22,00:20:24,It's not bigger than Air Force One.
00:20:24,00:20:25,Don't know why he said that.
00:20:25,00:20:26,It's much smaller than it.
00:20:26,00:20:28,It's because he's a pathological liar.
00:20:28,00:20:34,"But the president has her private fleet of planes, which are not Air Force One."
00:20:34,00:20:35,Right?
00:20:35,00:20:36,For his own.
00:20:36,00:20:41,"So we all hear about Air Force One, but actually there's a set of planes."
00:20:41,00:20:46,They're four special Boeing 747s and they are called together.
00:20:46,00:20:49,They are what is known as the National Airborne Operations Centre.
00:20:49,00:20:50,Right?
00:20:50,00:20:55,"Where Air Force One is kind of ceremonial and comfortable, these planes are basically war rooms."
00:20:55,00:20:56,Right.
00:20:56,00:20:59,And so they're built in the 70s and they're staffed by military analysts and strategists.
00:20:59,00:21:02,"And it was if you were in a nuclear war, you would be flying around in these things."
00:21:02,00:21:03,Not an Air Force One.
00:21:03,00:21:05,Why aren't there not to be comfortable?
00:21:05,00:21:08,Because you need to fit more soldiers in.
00:21:08,00:21:09,Okay.
00:21:09,00:21:13,"And they have five mile long antenna, which trail behind them, right?"
00:21:13,00:21:14,"No, they don't."
00:21:14,00:21:15,Why?
00:21:15,00:21:16,A mile long.
00:21:16,00:21:18,"Trailing, wire antenna."
00:21:18,00:21:19,Yeah.
00:21:19,00:21:20,With a banner on it.
00:21:20,00:21:21,One of those advertising banners.
00:21:21,00:21:22,No.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Make America a great again.
00:21:23,00:21:24,"Listen, I'm quoting."
00:21:24,00:21:25,There was a whole feature about these on Politico.
00:21:25,00:21:28,It said the plane's included a special gear like a five mile long training wire antenna.
00:21:28,00:21:32,"That would ensure that the president could remain in contact with the nuclear submarine fleet,"
00:21:32,00:21:35,even after ground-based communications have been destroyed.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"Is it attached to a submarine, though?"
00:21:37,00:21:38,"No, no."
00:21:38,00:21:39,"No, no."
00:21:39,00:21:40,It's not submarine at the other end.
00:21:40,00:21:42,You're writing through the air.
00:21:42,00:21:43,No.
00:21:43,00:21:45,"But if ground-based communications have been destroyed, you need a very long antenna."
00:21:45,00:21:46,Yeah.
00:21:46,00:21:48,Five miles is a long antenna.
00:21:48,00:21:49,"It's very long, but what's behind you?"
00:21:49,00:21:51,As long as there's no one flying in the five miles behind you.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"And you're moving so far through this guy, there won't be."
00:21:53,00:21:54,No.
00:21:54,00:21:57,"I just don't get why you're denying this thing, which I have a direct source for."
00:21:57,00:21:58,Five miles.
00:21:58,00:21:59,I just think five miles is a very long antenna.
00:21:59,00:22:00,It's an extremely long antenna.
00:22:00,00:22:03,"That's, so that's going to collect radio signals."
00:22:03,00:22:07,That was disputing the length of the antenna.
00:22:07,00:22:09,How high are you up in the air when you're in a normal flight?
00:22:09,00:22:13,Because maybe they attach a message to the end of the antenna and they point it at once.
00:22:13,00:22:15,So you just grab a piece of paper as they fly by.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"I mean, yeah."
00:22:16,00:22:17,You're actually all right.
00:22:17,00:22:18,Five miles is very long.
00:22:18,00:22:20,Because five miles is so long.
00:22:20,00:22:23,"You're not, are you normally five miles up in the air?"
00:22:23,00:22:25,"If you're 30,000 feet, what that is, what?"
00:22:25,00:22:26,"10,000 yards."
00:22:26,00:22:27,Yeah.
00:22:27,00:22:28,And how many yards?
00:22:28,00:22:29,It's 1560 yards in the miles.
00:22:29,00:22:30,Yeah.
00:22:30,00:22:32,"So it's about 5,000 miles."
00:22:32,00:22:33,It's about five miles.
00:22:33,00:22:36,So it's just a trailer you're longer than that.
00:22:36,00:22:38,"Quick spell, SOS in the sand."
00:22:38,00:22:42,So do people have to jump out of the way of it when it comes along the ground towards you?
00:22:42,00:22:45,"Look, I think we must have said it wasn't used, okay?"
00:22:45,00:22:51,It just sounds like you guys keep on asking clever dick questions about it.
00:22:51,00:22:54,Do we think maybe Trump said it was five miles?
00:22:54,00:22:59,You know North Korea has a plane that can fly backwards?
00:22:59,00:23:00,"No, it doesn't."
00:23:00,00:23:01,It does.
00:23:01,00:23:02,It's called the hummingbird.
00:23:02,00:23:05,It's a very tiny plane.
00:23:05,00:23:10,"But this is, A, it's really cool because it's camouflaged as in."
00:23:10,00:23:11,It's painted.
00:23:11,00:23:13,"It's so welcome from, and I want to see it."
00:23:13,00:23:15,No one's ever seen it.
00:23:15,00:23:16,There it goes.
00:23:16,00:23:19,It's disguised as a backwards plane.
00:23:19,00:23:22,This may look like a plane going forward.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"But actually, it's a backwards plane going backwards."
00:23:25,00:23:27,"Thank God, the enemy are flying away."
00:23:27,00:23:28,Oh no!
00:23:28,00:23:34,The way you could tell is there's a five mile antenna at the front.
00:23:34,00:23:44,"Okay, it is time for our final facts of the show."
00:23:44,00:23:46,And that is Anitazansky.
00:23:46,00:23:53,My fact this week is that poo on a table will look closer to you than it actually is.
00:23:53,00:23:56,And this is just if there's poo on a table.
00:23:56,00:23:58,And you think it's only a meter away.
00:23:58,00:24:01,It's actually probably like just over a meter away.
00:24:01,00:24:05,"Yeah, and then we all thought you were being really weird downstairs when you put that on the table."
00:24:05,00:24:07,"But actually, some first-hand research."
00:24:07,00:24:09,Just testing it out.
00:24:09,00:24:13,"Yeah, I read this on the website Nautilus, which is a very good website."
00:24:13,00:24:16,And there was an article about how we perceive distance.
00:24:16,00:24:21,"And I think it was a study that was done by someone called Janine Stefanucci,"
00:24:21,00:24:25,"who's a professor of Neural Science in Utah, the University of Utah."
00:24:25,00:24:29,"And yeah, it said that she put kind of a blob of chocolate on a table"
00:24:29,00:24:35,and let her study subjects to believe that it was species.
00:24:35,00:24:37,And then made it look like feces.
00:24:37,00:24:39,And then they thought it was closer than it actually was.
00:24:39,00:24:42,"Actually, it's quite an ethical experiment, isn't it?"
00:24:42,00:24:45,She's decided not to put actual poo on the table.
00:24:45,00:24:48,"Well, then she's lied to people. Is that ethical?"
00:24:48,00:24:50,"White lies are fine, I think."
00:24:50,00:24:52,"Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean."
00:24:52,00:24:56,"But yeah, this is about how if we're afraid of things,"
00:24:56,00:25:00,then we perceive them as being closer. And loads of studies have been done that confirm this.
00:25:00,00:25:04,"If you'd were to try and throw a bean bag at a poo,"
00:25:04,00:25:07,then you would be likely to miss it on the far side.
00:25:07,00:25:08,You'd throw it too far.
00:25:08,00:25:11,Whereas if you were going to throw a bean bag at something nice like a bar of chocolate
00:25:11,00:25:15,"that didn't look like a poo, then you would miss on the shot side."
00:25:15,00:25:19,And they've done experiments where people haven't done that.
00:25:19,00:25:23,"I'm just extrapolating slightly, but they've done experiments"
00:25:23,00:25:27,where they would give you a $25 gift card
00:25:27,00:25:29,and ask you to throw a bean bag at it.
00:25:29,00:25:33,And they found that people were always short of that because it's desirable
00:25:33,00:25:35,and they think that it's close closer.
00:25:35,00:25:39,"If anything, that's a teleformat just waiting to happen."
00:25:39,00:25:41,You're right. Throw the bean bag at the poo.
00:25:41,00:25:44,"No, no. Well, yeah, we could do it that way."
00:25:44,00:25:46,Or we could do it just with like gift cards and stuff.
00:25:46,00:25:48,"Because the thing is, no one really wants to win the poo."
00:25:48,00:25:51,So it's also what the prize is at the end of the throw the bean bag at the poo game.
00:25:51,00:25:55,"You don't have to, you can win the $25. It's hidden in the poo."
00:25:55,00:25:59,"It's basically, we have all these boxes from Deal or No Deal."
00:25:59,00:26:01,They're probably just in a warehouse somewhere.
00:26:01,00:26:04,So we can get them. And if we get the million pound box
00:26:04,00:26:06,"and then get people to try and throw bean bags into it,"
00:26:06,00:26:07,they're always going to be short.
00:26:07,00:26:08,Yeah.
00:26:08,00:26:11,So we never have to pay anything out and it's a great farmer.
00:26:11,00:26:13,Although Andy raises a really good point.
00:26:13,00:26:16,If you put poo around the voucher.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"And you know there's a voucher in there,"
00:26:18,00:26:20,but you can also see that it's covered in poo.
00:26:20,00:26:22,Do you see it as closer or further away?
00:26:22,00:26:25,I suppose that's where the jeopardy comes in in our format.
00:26:25,00:26:28,What's the show called again?
00:26:28,00:26:32,It's throw the bean bag at the million pounds covered in poo.
00:26:32,00:26:34,"I think it's an ITV2 show, isn't it?"
00:26:34,00:26:39,And spiders look bigger if you're scared of them.
00:26:39,00:26:40,Yeah.
00:26:40,00:26:41,"Yes, that's right."
00:26:41,00:26:43,And then direct proportion to how scared you are.
00:26:43,00:26:44,Exactly.
00:26:44,00:26:46,And they tested it by getting people who were very scared
00:26:46,00:26:48,and then only slightly scared of spiders.
00:26:48,00:26:50,And they showed them a sliding scale.
00:26:50,00:26:52,"So literally a slide and go,"
00:26:52,00:26:54,"you could drag it a little, a clicker along."
00:26:54,00:26:56,And there was a picture of a fly at one end
00:26:56,00:26:58,and a lamb at the other.
00:26:58,00:27:00,And you had to rate the spider.
00:27:00,00:27:01,But surely.
00:27:01,00:27:03,People who are really scared of spiders.
00:27:03,00:27:05,I don't care how scared you are of a spider.
00:27:05,00:27:08,You don't think it's the same size as a sheep.
00:27:08,00:27:11,I think it was very slightly further along.
00:27:11,00:27:12,Right.
00:27:12,00:27:13,Okay.
00:27:13,00:27:15,I believe so.
00:27:15,00:27:18,In other science poo news.
00:27:18,00:27:19,Okay.
00:27:19,00:27:21,Very exciting study has been published.
00:27:21,00:27:23,James and I were talking about this the other day.
00:27:23,00:27:26,Scientists have finally worked out how long it takes animals to poo.
00:27:26,00:27:27,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:27,00:27:28,Finally.
00:27:28,00:27:29,"Finally, finally."
00:27:29,00:27:31,"Well, we've cracked so many secrets."
00:27:31,00:27:33,But this last one has eluded us for so long.
00:27:33,00:27:36,"Well, 2016 was the year that we cracked how long it takes them to urinate."
00:27:36,00:27:37,Right.
00:27:37,00:27:39,And 2017 is a fantastic sequel.
00:27:39,00:27:40,What?
00:27:40,00:27:41,What next year?
00:27:41,00:27:43,A horrible thing when we discover next year.
00:27:43,00:27:45,"But they studied a bunch of animals, right?"
00:27:45,00:27:48,"So this applies to both, let's say, something as big as an elephant."
00:27:48,00:27:50,All the way down to something as small as a mouse.
00:27:50,00:27:52,They both spend 12 seconds.
00:27:52,00:27:53,Amazing.
00:27:53,00:27:56,So from the size of a spider to the size of a spider.
00:27:56,00:27:57,Yes.
00:27:57,00:28:02,So this is the researcher Patricia Yang.
00:28:02,00:28:05,I guess this should technically apply to humans as well.
00:28:05,00:28:06,Yeah.
00:28:06,00:28:09,"Because she's saying if it takes longer than 12 seconds,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,I'd say you should go see someone about it.
00:28:11,00:28:14,But then she says you have to factor in the fact that you might be reading a book
00:28:14,00:28:17,or a newspaper or playing an iPhone game on.
00:28:17,00:28:20,Doing on the table for an experiment.
00:28:20,00:28:24,They published their scientific paper in a journal called Soft Matter.
00:28:24,00:28:25,No.
00:28:25,00:28:26,Yeah.
00:28:26,00:28:27,Yeah.
00:28:27,00:28:30,"So yeah, it's quite an exciting discovery."
00:28:30,00:28:34,And is it the same as the year in discovery as in all animals?
00:28:34,00:28:36,It's the same for regardless of size.
00:28:36,00:28:37,So is that the discovery?
00:28:37,00:28:38,"All mammals, yeah."
00:28:38,00:28:41,And obviously there's quite a big difference.
00:28:41,00:28:45,But I think David who did the year in one is part of this group as well.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:51,"And the idea being that with humans if you have a problem with a urinary or defecation or something,"
00:28:51,00:28:54,then you can kind of just talk to the doctor and tell him.
00:28:54,00:28:57,"But with an animal, it's sometimes hard to tell if there's a problem."
00:28:57,00:29:03,"But if you're animal, if you've got a horse and it's taking 40 seconds to we or two seconds to we,"
00:29:03,00:29:06,then that's so far out of the range that you know there's something wrong.
00:29:06,00:29:10,"I mean, so it's just a way of telling illness or..."
00:29:10,00:29:12,"So it's useful science, yeah."
00:29:12,00:29:14,"It's useful science, yeah."
00:29:14,00:29:20,"And 12 seconds, just an interesting relevant amount of time for this particular podcast."
00:29:20,00:29:21,Anyone know why 12 seconds?
00:29:21,00:29:23,Are we only been recording for 12 seconds?
00:29:23,00:29:28,12 seconds is the same length of time that the right brother's first flight was.
00:29:28,00:29:29,Wow!
00:29:29,00:29:31,I flew for 12 seconds.
00:29:31,00:29:42,"One of them stopped pooing at the top of the...land is it, land is it?"
00:29:42,00:29:43,"Okay, that's it."
00:29:43,00:29:44,That's all of our facts.
