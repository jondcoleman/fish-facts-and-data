00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.900
 â™ª Hello and welcome to another episode, a no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.060
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covern, Garden.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.320
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Andrew Huntamari, Anna Chizinski and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.760
 James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.560
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.120
 Starting with fact number one and that's my fact.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.360
 My fact this week is that the Chinese government are planning on giving their national anthem

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.000
 a speed limit.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.160
 So this is a plan at the moment.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.720
 They haven't enforced it yet, apparently in the next month or so a paper will be proposed

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.880
 to enforce this.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.600
 They believe that the anthem is being abused by the people singing it.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.600
 Really?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.120
 Yeah, they've called it a damaging situation, they're saying it's not universally respected

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.200
 and cherished.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.440
 People are laughing when they're singing, they're singing too fast, they're singing

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.440
 too slow.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.440
 They're singing too furious?

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.040
 Yeah, they're singing.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.240
 So the song is called March of the Volunteers.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.240
 Right.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.960
 It's originally, although anyone not volunteering will be in trouble.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.560
 It originally appeared in a movie soundtrack.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.400
 It was part of a movie.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.480
 The movie was cool.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.680
 You're now not allowed to fast forward that movie anymore.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.040
 Yeah, it was in a movie called Children of Trouble Times and it was actually quite a political

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.400
 movie and the song was wrote in specifically for it and what ended up happening was people

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.240
 started singing it and it caught on more and more and people thought this would make

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.240
 a good anthem.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 So it became the official anthem.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.920
 How are they going to deal with the laughter issue because you can still laugh at tempo?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.920
 You can.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 They've got any plan to...

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.920
 Welcome back.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 Yeah, there's going to be... you're going to get dressed down basically, you'll be criticised

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 and corrected.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.440
 What, put in more casual clothes?

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.440
 Yeah.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.440
 Yeah.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.440
 So it's like Mufti Day.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.440
 No.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.080
 No, it's different because dress down Friday isn't where you come in and just get told

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.080
 off all day.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.040
 It is one I do it.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.080
 But interestingly, the Chinese government, they banned their own national anthem three years

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.400
 ago from all sorts of places so they said you're not allowed to sing it outside major sporting

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.720
 events or formal diplomatic occasions so you're not allowed to sing it at your wedding

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.960
 if you want to or at a funeral or anywhere which has apparently an inappropriate atmosphere.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.960
 Right.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.960
 Do weddings if you're not allowed to have particularly similar atmospheres?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.200
 So Germany banned their own... some of their own anthem, didn't they?

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.160
 Wait, I mean like a bit of the song or...

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.920
 Yeah, they banned the first couple of verses because it was associated with the Nazi regime

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.440
 and there was that really embarrassing moment.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.800
 I think it was last year or a couple of years ago, it was a US-Germany football match, like

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.800
 a friendly football match I think and there was an opera singer there from America called

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.800
 Will Kimball who was singing as a mark of respect to the Germans, the German national

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.600
 anthem, but he started singing the lines that were associated only with Nazi Germany.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.680
 With Dutchland, Dutchland, Uber-Allers.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.680
 Yeah.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.280
 Which, when you hear those words, you do think immediately of Hitler.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.120
 That's the version I've been singing this whole time, is that really not the version

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.120
 anymore?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.120
 Yeah.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.120
 You're not meant to sing that.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.120
 It's the thing.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.120
 It's in German, I didn't know.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.120
 I didn't know what I'm singing.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.760
 It's because the only words you know really are Dutch and Dutch and Uber means good, right?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.760
 Good, yeah.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.800
 So, until you get to that level, it sounds like quite a good lyrics, right?

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.280
 What's the word that tips it over?

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.760
 There's no word that's bad, it just means Germany, Germany, overall.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.840
 It's just like the fact that Hitler itself is not a bad sound, but the association now

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.840
 with Hitler, the man, made it a name you probably, hopefully, won't call your child.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.840
 But I shouldn't.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.760
 And in the same way, the National Anthem was often sung by the Nazis.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.880
 So now it's got those bad associations.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:09.680
 Speaking of people who made National Anthem full par, is it full par or false par?

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680
 I think.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.280
 Have we ever mentioned about opera singer Tony Henry, who's sang the Croatian National Anthem

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.680
 before England v. Croatia?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680
 No.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.000
 And instead of singing Milla Cuda C. Planina, meaning my dear, how much we love your mountains,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.120
 he sang Milla Cura C. Planina, meaning my dear, my penis is a mountain.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120
 Oh.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.000
 There was a dozi for Milla I winner.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.200
 We spoke about him on the show.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200
 Do you remember his name?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.440
 I can't remember his name off the top of my head.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.440
 Australia for me.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.440
 Not the one who pushed his car.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.440
 Yeah, who won it on foot.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.440
 My problem was it.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440
 Yeah, Jack Rowan.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.720
 I think it's him when he won the Formula One once.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.400
 They realized they didn't have the ozzy National Anthem, because they thought it was God save

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.400
 the Queen.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.160
 And so they were like, what do we do?

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.080
 And all they could think to do was find a drunken trumpet player who just played happy

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.880
 both days.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.480
 It burns amazing.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.760
 In Luxembourg, not in Luxembourg, in the Olympics in 1952 Luxembourg weren't expected to win

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.000
 anything.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.280
 And they won the 1500 meters, I think, and they got gold.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.560
 And the band, who was supposed to play all the anthems, hadn't been given the score and

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.280
 didn't know the Luxembourg National Anthem, because they'd all seen the Luxembourg wouldn't

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.280
 win anything.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.240
 And you can see a bit of it on YouTube, but they just improvised the whole thing.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.480
 They just completely make it up.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.720
 It's like when an actor puts on his resume, yeah, I can speak Hungarian, yeah, definitely.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.920
 And he gets to the casting.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.520
 I was looking into music in China generally.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.360
 Now, in terms of record sales, where do you think China sits, rank-wise, worldwide, in terms

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.160
 of people who buy music?

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160
 Well, interesting.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.440
 Do you mean are we including things like streaming and stuff like that, just basically spending

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.440
 money on music?

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.440
 You know, spending money on music, yeah.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.760
 I tend to say, because they've got a billion people there at the top, or at least in the top

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.760
 five, I would say.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.760
 They're 12.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.280
 They're 12 in the world.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.720
 And largely that's to do with piracy, that they've only just started to crack down on.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.560
 But they're only starting to boom now because of this crackdown that's gone on.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.800
 But if you look at their lists of best-selling albums, it's still really back in the day

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.800
 where...

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.800
 So, what do you mean?

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.600
 It's like they listen to stuff from the '80s, like Bon Jovier.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.040
 Well, just nothing's taken.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.360
 So, it's mainly Chinese artists and Korean artists and Taiwanese artists that you wouldn't

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.360
 have heard of.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.240
 But number four, best-selling album, physical album, of all time in China is Titanic, the soundtrack.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.240
 Oh, okay.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.240
 Yeah.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.240
 In 1998, or 1912, depending on when, which soundtrack you're talking about.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.080
 Just live recording a feeble screening.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.400
 Just the bang going down, because they're current on playing the night.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.400
 But, wait a minute.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.440
 But our best-selling single of all time, at least until recently, was White Christmas.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.000
 So, it's not like our best-selling songs are all new, is it?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.800
 No, no, but it's because people just weren't buying.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.080
 They were buying pirated albums.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.080
 I have a question.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.080
 Yes.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.200
 When Bon Jovier introduces himself, do you think he says the name?

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:06.320
 James Jovier, Bon Jovier, and then he pauses, and then he says, John Bon Jovier.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.560
 Actually, it doesn't in three steps.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.560
 I think you both.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.200
 Is Bon Jovier, is Bon his middle name?

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.920
 This is what I'm trying to get at.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.080
 Is it his real name, first of all?

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.080
 I don't know.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.080
 No, I don't think it is.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.520
 But if it is, it must be his middle, because it's not hyphenated, is it?

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.920
 So, it's not a double-barrelled.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.040
 But it doesn't get Mother Bon by the Jovier.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.040
 Lowercase though.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.040
 Lowercase though, the Bon.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.040
 No, no.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.040
 It's uppercase.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.560
 I think that when Jacob Riesmog introduces himself, he says, the name's Mog, Riesmog.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.560
 Jacob Riesmog.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.560
 Yes, I do.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.560
 Do you?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.560
 OK, all right.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.160
 Well, yeah, in that case, maybe he does, because I imagine those two are the same.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.640
 I like the name's Mog very much.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.720
 Mog the cat.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:53.320
 Did you know that in Tang Dynasty, China, so just over a thousand years ago, I think that was,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.040
 then, you were supposed to greet and bid goodbye to people by improvising verse on the spot

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.040
 whenever you did it.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.320
 If you were an educated person, you had to improvise a bit of poetry.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.320
 How did you do the improv?

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.600
 Did you ask for a word?

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.240
 Just a non-geographical location, like a school.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.240
 A school?

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.080
 They've actually just banned some songs, haven't they?

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.080
 Oh, I think, sorry.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.560
 I think in 2015, they banned some songs.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.200
 So the Chinese Ministry of Culture released a list of 120 songs that are banned for being

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.600
 immoral.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.880
 And just on that list, there was included a song called "College Self Study Room," which

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.240
 is about a guy having a difficult time finding a place to study for university, banned

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.240
 from being immoral.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.240
 Wow.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.440
 What does he do instead of study?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.680
 I didn't actually understand this song, because I'm not fluent.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.080
 I'm just trying to think what immorality there might be in this song.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.920
 So you think he gave up on trying to find the study and ended up masturbating instead of

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.920
 something?

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.920
 Panache.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.000
 It's like he could read my mind.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:06.760
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James Harkin.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:14.080
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1921, 78% of shaving brushes sold in New York contained

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.080
 anthrax.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.480
 And did it make it froth better or were they putting that in there?

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.280
 It wasn't put in there on purpose.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:27.360
 It is the fact that shaving brushes used to be and sometimes still are made out of badger,

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.840
 and they used to get high quality badger fur from Russia, and then they would disinfect

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.600
 it in France.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.240
 But then around the war time, they stopped sanitizing it.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.040
 And badger hair is actually okay, because it's not that susceptible to anthrax poisoning.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:50.960
 But when Russia fell apart a bit, we had to start importing horse hair from China and Japan,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.120
 and horse hair is much more susceptible to anthrax, and so suddenly that became an issue.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.520
 Ah, yes, you're right.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.720
 And what people thought at the time during the war was it there was diabolical tactics

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.720
 of the enemy.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.720
 They said it was down to, but then they realised that it wasn't anything to do with that.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.320
 Occam's razor is the simplest thing.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.080
 We're not cleaning our hair properly.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.080
 Occam's razor.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.040
 Love it, because you're shaving.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040
 Yeah.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:20.880
 Actually these brushes are still a problem, because people love to buy antique shaving brushes

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.960
 or anything to do with what people like to collect vintage things, and they like to use it

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.640
 hipsters mainly, and they'll be using these brushes, and they hipsters all have beards.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.840
 Ah, because they're aware about the anthrax situation going on.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.940
 After they lost some key hipster members of their party to anthrax, do you know just

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.100
 on shaving how they use the train barbers?

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:50.400
 Well, so you can't take them to someone's face immediately because they have a sharp

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.400
 object.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.400
 No, exactly.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400
 So was it on an animal?

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.860
 It wasn't on an animal that would have been good.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.860
 Maybe there was some animal training.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.860
 I'm sure there was.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.860
 Was it on an arm?

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.860
 You do it on your arm.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.860
 That's a good idea.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.540
 Was it on dead bearded people?

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.260
 That is good thought.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.260
 Good thought.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.340
 You're doing a apprenticeship at the morgue.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.340
 Actually, that would be quite good at the morgue, although if you made a mistake, you wouldn't

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.340
 know about it because they don't bleed.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.340
 You're right.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.340
 Ah, yeah.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.340
 You have to.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.340
 That's why they ended the policy.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.340
 I'm the best barber in the world.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.340
 Um, no.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.820
 Okay, what else could it be then?

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.180
 It's something with very thin skin.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.180
 I still don't trample.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.180
 Um.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.180
 I got a testicle.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.180
 I'm going to...

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.180
 No, I'm going to...

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.180
 What?

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.180
 No, you're right, this.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.100
 I thought that was sick of your face.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.100
 What kind of...

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.100
 Well, they're delicate.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.100
 We've got a...

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.100
 We've got a trainee barber in here today.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:51.260
 But you find within your balls out for us, then we will do your face, I promise.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:57.100
 It's his first day, but he's been great in the theory, modules.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.100
 Something with thin skin.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.100
 Eyelids.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.100
 Oh, god, eyelids.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.100
 I'm going to put you out of your misery.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.100
 Balloons.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.100
 What?

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.100
 Hairy balloon.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.100
 Hairy balloon.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.100
 Hairy balloon.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.100
 It just sounds like testicles.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.100
 I had no idea.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.100
 Balloons start off hairy.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:22.100
 And all the ones you get have been through the trainee barber.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.100
 Right.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.100
 So, do you put...

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.100
 You must put hair onto the balloon.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.100
 You don't put hair on.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.100
 You put shaving foam.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.100
 Well, this is...

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.100
 I saw a British pathophone from the '50s.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.100
 Talked about the training process.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:39.100
 If they draw a face, they draw little face on the balloon.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.100
 It is a good idea, though, isn't it?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.100
 Because if you nick them, they pop.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.100
 If you nick them, they pop.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.100
 I'm like, the corpse is...

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.100
 So...

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:51.100
 It could be a bloated corpse with a lot of hair inside it.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.100
 So, no, you paint the face on.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.100
 And then you put the shaving foam on, and then the trainee has to scrape it off.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.100
 Right.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.100
 Oh, god.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.100
 That's really interesting.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.100
 How do they do it now?

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.100
 I don't know.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.100
 Well, there's so little gold for it these days.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.100
 Oh, well, yes.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.100
 But, you know, there's hairdressers nearby here that does shaving them.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:16.100
 So, I had my beard done, but not a clean shave, not with a razor.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.100
 But, yeah, what they do is they have someone standing over and they train someone to do it.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.100
 And you just have to accept whatever happens.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.100
 That's the...

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.100
 They just say this might not work.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.100
 And how is your testicle these days?

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.100
 Do you know how you shave in space?

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:38.100
 I think it would be just as easy as out of space, but not in space.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.100
 I think I know a bit of the answer to this.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.100
 But, should I say it?

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.100
 Yeah, go for it.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:50.100
 Is it that you do normal shaving with a buzzer, but you have a vacuum cleaner next to your head and you suck in all the hairs.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.100
 So, you vacuum your face as you...

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.100
 Oh, so you don't fill the air with hair?

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.100
 Exactly. This is what they have to avoid.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:01.100
 They have the special really sticky shaving foam. It's called Astro Edge, right?

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.100
 And it sticks to the face, but it traps stubble in it.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.100
 And then you have to...

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.100
 Well, actually, you can just sort of wipe that into a bag or something and then it's in right back.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.100
 But, when you have your hair cut in space, you have to have a vacuum cleaner next to you.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.100
 That's it. When you have your teeth...

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.100
 And then suck, suck.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.100
 Yeah.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.100
 Slippery.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.100
 I don't know what kind of hairdressers you got.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.100
 In shaving news, in recent shaving news.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.100
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:35.100
 So, since December, there are cats in this small town in Virginia that have been being taken away, having their bellies shaved

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.100
 and then returned to their owners otherwise unharmed.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.100
 And no one knows who's doing this or what's happening.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.100
 Police say they're not sure what crime has been committed.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.100
 There's upsetting the owners, so can the perpetrator please stop?

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.100
 I suppose it's someone who can't get hold of balloons.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.100
 Yeah.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:15:01.100
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:08.100
 My fact is that the cargo hold of the largest plane in service is longer than the first flight of the Wright brothers.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.100
 How long is it?

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.100
 It's pretty long, Anna.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.100
 Pretty long.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.100
 Okay, on we go.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.100
 I wonder if, because they didn't go very high, the Wright brothers either.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.100
 I wonder if they could have actually done the whole flight in there.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.100
 I think they might have been able to do that.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.100
 That first flight was 120 feet long.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.100
 Yeah.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.100
 Okay.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.100
 And how long is this cargo hold?

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.100
 As I said to Anna, it's quite long.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.100
 Let's talk about some other statistics.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:43.100
 The whole plane measures 275 feet in length.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.100
 In length, yeah.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.100
 Okay.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.100
 So that's about 100 metres.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.100
 Yeah, it shouldn't sound very long.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.100
 84 metres, but it's very wide.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.100
 And how long did you say this the Wright brothers thing was?

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.100
 120 feet.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.100
 Okay, so that figure doesn't it?

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.100
 Yeah.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.100
 God, that doesn't sound that long.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.100
 Because I thought that was the longest plane that's going back to overtake this one.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.100
 It's being built by Paul Allen, who's the co-founder of Microsoft.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:11.100
 And that is going to be, apparently it's going to be wider than a football field.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.100
 Oh no, this one is wider than a football field.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.100
 Well, that's unbelievably wide.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.100
 It's very wide.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:22.100
 Football field is between, I think you're allowed between 50 metres and 100 metres for a width of a football field.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.100
 So these planes are all metres?

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.100
 Yeah.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.100
 That's right.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.100
 That's right.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.100
 And he's playing that you're talking about.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.100
 Yeah.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.100
 Is 275 feet in length.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.100
 Yeah.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.100
 And its wing span is 290 feet.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.100
 There we go.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.100
 Oh wow.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.100
 It's wider than it is long.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.100
 Yes.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:46.100
 So I've just realised that when I was thinking about width, I forgot to include the wings.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.100
 Yeah.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.100
 Which is why I should never design planes.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.100
 Right.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.100
 Right.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.100
 You've made a car.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.100
 That's what you meant.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.100
 I was including wings.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.100
 Well, that's not that impressive.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.100
 Okay.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.100
 As you were.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.100
 And there is only one of it.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.100
 It's an amazing thing.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.100
 They've built one.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.100
 There is a second one, which they've been working on for 30 years on and off.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.100
 Mostly off.

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.100
 Anyway, sorry.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:14.100
 It's called the Antonov AN225 Maria, which is a Ukrainian plane.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.100
 Yeah.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:20.100
 And it can fit 10 tanks inside or 50 cars depending on what you need to move around.

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:25.100
 So its maximum takeoff weight is 640 tons.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.100
 Yeah.

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.100
 I mean, that is.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.100
 So I checked out a few things that are about that weight.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.100
 Yeah.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.100
 Christ the Redeemer statue is about that weight.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.100
 Is it in Rio?

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.100
 And you can strap it on top with the arms over the wings.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.100
 Well, it looks like an aeroplane, doesn't it?

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.100
 It does.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.100
 It does.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.100
 It's quite wide if you include the arms, which had a problem it doesn't have.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.100
 Wow.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.100
 That was 640 tons.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.100
 Wow.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.100
 That was incredible.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.100
 So actually, if you had a plane carrying that, you wouldn't even be able to get pilot in there.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.100
 Because you'd already be exceeding the weight limit.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.100
 Yeah.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.100
 Christ would have to be flying the plane himself.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.100
 You'd have to chop off like a finger or something.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.100
 You were not even that.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.100
 You're not even that.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.100
 You haven't kidnapped him, Dan.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:15.100
 But that's the takeoff weight includes the weight of the plane, I think, doesn't it?

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.100
 Yeah.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.100
 So actually, it would be too heavy to carry.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.100
 Is that including the pedestal of the Christ the Redeemer?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.100
 Because it's most of the pedestal.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.100
 I'm not sure, actually.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.100
 I don't know.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.100
 I don't know if it's not, and you didn't include the pedestal.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.100
 I guess you just wouldn't take off.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.100
 Yeah.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.100
 So here's something that you could carry possibly.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:36.100
 The volume of this cargo hold is 46,000 cubic feet.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:41.100
 And that is approximately the same volume as the second largest tree in the world.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:46.100
 Now, the problem is the tree is tree-shaped and the cargo hold isn't tree-shaped.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.100
 So you need to chop it up a lot.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.100
 Right.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:53.100
 But you theoretically could chop it up and get it in if you put it nicely in light Tetris.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.100
 Turn it into a book or a series of books and have it as a library.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.100
 Speaking of books, do we have a book coming out soon?

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.100
 Certainly do.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.100
 November made from the biggest tree in the world.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.100
 I'm not sure I want it if it's made from the biggest tree in the world.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.100
 No.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.100
 Yeah, you do.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.100
 Transported here by the biggest plane in the world.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.100
 No, it wouldn't work.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:15.100
 It wouldn't work because you had water to make paper, don't you?

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.100
 I was reading about the world's biggest private jet.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.100
 Okay.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.100
 So the world's biggest private jet.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:26.100
 It's been bought by Prince Al Saud of Saudi Arabia.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.100
 He's a Saudi prince and he has done some extraordinary things to it.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.100
 So it's ginormous.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.100
 It can fly 800 passengers.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.100
 It can go 8,000 miles before refueling.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.100
 But obviously it's his own private plane.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.100
 He doesn't want 800 people on there.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:44.100
 So he's transformed the plane into this incredible mansion-esque house.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.100
 It's got a cinema in there.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.100
 It's got a steam room in there.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.100
 It's got the most impressively of all.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:53.100
 It's got a prayer room where all of the mats are on the ground are electronic.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.100
 And no matter where you are in the sky, they electronically turn towards Mecca.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.100
 So when you go into prayer, it's facing Mecca.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.100
 That is pretty clever.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.100
 But what if you're hovering directly above Mecca?

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.100
 They're cool.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.100
 Yeah.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.100
 They just kind of go vertical, do they?

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.100
 I thought of that.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.100
 That's true.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.100
 Trump's private plane is pretty pimped out as well.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:16.100
 He didn't interview before he became president where he was talking about it.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.100
 And he said, describing his own plane.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.100
 It's bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.100
 It's not bigger than Air Force One.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.100
 Don't know why he said that.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.100
 It's much smaller than it.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.100
 It's because he's a pathological liar.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:34.100
 But the president has her private fleet of planes, which are not Air Force One.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.100
 Right?

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.100
 For his own.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:41.100
 So we all hear about Air Force One, but actually there's a set of planes.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:46.100
 They're four special Boeing 747s and they are called together.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.100
 They are what is known as the National Airborne Operations Centre.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.100
 Right?

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:55.100
 Where Air Force One is kind of ceremonial and comfortable, these planes are basically war rooms.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.100
 Right.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.100
 And so they're built in the 70s and they're staffed by military analysts and strategists.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.100
 And it was if you were in a nuclear war, you would be flying around in these things.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.100
 Not an Air Force One.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.100
 Why aren't there not to be comfortable?

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.100
 Because you need to fit more soldiers in.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.100
 Okay.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.100
 And they have five mile long antenna, which trail behind them, right?

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.100
 No, they don't.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.100
 Why?

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.100
 A mile long.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.100
 Trailing, wire antenna.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.100
 Yeah.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.100
 With a banner on it.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.100
 One of those advertising banners.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.100
 No.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.100
 Make America a great again.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.100
 Listen, I'm quoting.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.100
 There was a whole feature about these on Politico.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.100
 It said the plane's included a special gear like a five mile long training wire antenna.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.100
 That would ensure that the president could remain in contact with the nuclear submarine fleet,

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.100
 even after ground-based communications have been destroyed.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.100
 Is it attached to a submarine, though?

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.100
 No, no.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.100
 No, no.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.100
 It's not submarine at the other end.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.100
 You're writing through the air.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.100
 No.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.100
 But if ground-based communications have been destroyed, you need a very long antenna.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.100
 Yeah.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.100
 Five miles is a long antenna.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.100
 It's very long, but what's behind you?

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.100
 As long as there's no one flying in the five miles behind you.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.100
 And you're moving so far through this guy, there won't be.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.100
 No.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.100
 I just don't get why you're denying this thing, which I have a direct source for.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.100
 Five miles.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.100
 I just think five miles is a very long antenna.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.100
 It's an extremely long antenna.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.100
 That's, so that's going to collect radio signals.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:07.100
 That was disputing the length of the antenna.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.100
 How high are you up in the air when you're in a normal flight?

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.100
 Because maybe they attach a message to the end of the antenna and they point it at once.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.100
 So you just grab a piece of paper as they fly by.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.100
 I mean, yeah.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.100
 You're actually all right.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.100
 Five miles is very long.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.100
 Because five miles is so long.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.100
 You're not, are you normally five miles up in the air?

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.100
 If you're 30,000 feet, what that is, what?

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.100
 10,000 yards.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.100
 Yeah.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.100
 And how many yards?

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.100
 It's 1560 yards in the miles.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.100
 Yeah.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.100
 So it's about 5,000 miles.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.100
 It's about five miles.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.100
 So it's just a trailer you're longer than that.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.100
 Quick spell, SOS in the sand.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.100
 So do people have to jump out of the way of it when it comes along the ground towards you?

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.100
 Look, I think we must have said it wasn't used, okay?

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:51.100
 It just sounds like you guys keep on asking clever dick questions about it.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.100
 Do we think maybe Trump said it was five miles?

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:59.100
 You know North Korea has a plane that can fly backwards?

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.100
 No, it doesn't.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.100
 It does.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.100
 It's called the hummingbird.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.100
 It's a very tiny plane.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:10.100
 But this is, A, it's really cool because it's camouflaged as in.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.100
 It's painted.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.100
 It's so welcome from, and I want to see it.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.100
 No one's ever seen it.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.100
 There it goes.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.100
 It's disguised as a backwards plane.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.100
 This may look like a plane going forward.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.100
 But actually, it's a backwards plane going backwards.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.100
 Thank God, the enemy are flying away.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.100
 Oh no!

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:34.100
 The way you could tell is there's a five mile antenna at the front.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:44.100
 Okay, it is time for our final facts of the show.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.100
 And that is Anitazansky.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:53.100
 My fact this week is that poo on a table will look closer to you than it actually is.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.100
 And this is just if there's poo on a table.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.100
 And you think it's only a meter away.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.100
 It's actually probably like just over a meter away.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.100
 Yeah, and then we all thought you were being really weird downstairs when you put that on the table.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.100
 But actually, some first-hand research.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.100
 Just testing it out.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.100
 Yeah, I read this on the website Nautilus, which is a very good website.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.100
 And there was an article about how we perceive distance.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:21.100
 And I think it was a study that was done by someone called Janine Stefanucci,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.100
 who's a professor of Neural Science in Utah, the University of Utah.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:29.100
 And yeah, it said that she put kind of a blob of chocolate on a table

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:35.100
 and let her study subjects to believe that it was species.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.100
 And then made it look like feces.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.100
 And then they thought it was closer than it actually was.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.100
 Actually, it's quite an ethical experiment, isn't it?

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.100
 She's decided not to put actual poo on the table.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.100
 Well, then she's lied to people. Is that ethical?

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.100
 White lies are fine, I think.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.100
 Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:56.100
 But yeah, this is about how if we're afraid of things,

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.100
 then we perceive them as being closer. And loads of studies have been done that confirm this.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.100
 If you'd were to try and throw a bean bag at a poo,

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.100
 then you would be likely to miss it on the far side.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.100
 You'd throw it too far.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.100
 Whereas if you were going to throw a bean bag at something nice like a bar of chocolate

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.100
 that didn't look like a poo, then you would miss on the shot side.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.100
 And they've done experiments where people haven't done that.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.100
 I'm just extrapolating slightly, but they've done experiments

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.100
 where they would give you a $25 gift card

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.100
 and ask you to throw a bean bag at it.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:33.100
 And they found that people were always short of that because it's desirable

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.100
 and they think that it's close closer.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.100
 If anything, that's a teleformat just waiting to happen.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.100
 You're right. Throw the bean bag at the poo.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.100
 No, no. Well, yeah, we could do it that way.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.100
 Or we could do it just with like gift cards and stuff.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.100
 Because the thing is, no one really wants to win the poo.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.100
 So it's also what the prize is at the end of the throw the bean bag at the poo game.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:55.100
 You don't have to, you can win the $25. It's hidden in the poo.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.100
 It's basically, we have all these boxes from Deal or No Deal.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.100
 They're probably just in a warehouse somewhere.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.100
 So we can get them. And if we get the million pound box

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.100
 and then get people to try and throw bean bags into it,

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.100
 they're always going to be short.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.100
 Yeah.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.100
 So we never have to pay anything out and it's a great farmer.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.100
 Although Andy raises a really good point.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.100
 If you put poo around the voucher.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.100
 And you know there's a voucher in there,

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.100
 but you can also see that it's covered in poo.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.100
 Do you see it as closer or further away?

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.100
 I suppose that's where the jeopardy comes in in our format.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.100
 What's the show called again?

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.100
 It's throw the bean bag at the million pounds covered in poo.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.100
 I think it's an ITV2 show, isn't it?

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:39.100
 And spiders look bigger if you're scared of them.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.100
 Yeah.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.100
 Yes, that's right.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.100
 And then direct proportion to how scared you are.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.100
 Exactly.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.100
 And they tested it by getting people who were very scared

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.100
 and then only slightly scared of spiders.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.100
 And they showed them a sliding scale.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.100
 So literally a slide and go,

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.100
 you could drag it a little, a clicker along.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.100
 And there was a picture of a fly at one end

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.100
 and a lamb at the other.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.100
 And you had to rate the spider.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.100
 But surely.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.100
 People who are really scared of spiders.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.100
 I don't care how scared you are of a spider.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.100
 You don't think it's the same size as a sheep.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.100
 I think it was very slightly further along.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.100
 Right.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.100
 Okay.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.100
 I believe so.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.100
 In other science poo news.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.100
 Okay.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.100
 Very exciting study has been published.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.100
 James and I were talking about this the other day.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.100
 Scientists have finally worked out how long it takes animals to poo.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.100
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.100
 Finally.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.100
 Finally, finally.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.100
 Well, we've cracked so many secrets.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.100
 But this last one has eluded us for so long.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.100
 Well, 2016 was the year that we cracked how long it takes them to urinate.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.100
 Right.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.100
 And 2017 is a fantastic sequel.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.100
 What?

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.100
 What next year?

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.100
 A horrible thing when we discover next year.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.100
 But they studied a bunch of animals, right?

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.100
 So this applies to both, let's say, something as big as an elephant.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.100
 All the way down to something as small as a mouse.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.100
 They both spend 12 seconds.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.100
 Amazing.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.100
 So from the size of a spider to the size of a spider.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.100
 Yes.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:02.100
 So this is the researcher Patricia Yang.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.100
 I guess this should technically apply to humans as well.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.100
 Yeah.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.100
 Because she's saying if it takes longer than 12 seconds,

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.100
 I'd say you should go see someone about it.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.100
 But then she says you have to factor in the fact that you might be reading a book

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.100
 or a newspaper or playing an iPhone game on.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.100
 Doing on the table for an experiment.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.100
 They published their scientific paper in a journal called Soft Matter.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.100
 No.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.100
 Yeah.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.100
 Yeah.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.100
 So yeah, it's quite an exciting discovery.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.100
 And is it the same as the year in discovery as in all animals?

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.100
 It's the same for regardless of size.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.100
 So is that the discovery?

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.100
 All mammals, yeah.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.100
 And obviously there's quite a big difference.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.100
 But I think David who did the year in one is part of this group as well.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.100
 Yeah.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:51.100
 And the idea being that with humans if you have a problem with a urinary or defecation or something,

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.100
 then you can kind of just talk to the doctor and tell him.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.100
 But with an animal, it's sometimes hard to tell if there's a problem.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:03.100
 But if you're animal, if you've got a horse and it's taking 40 seconds to we or two seconds to we,

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.100
 then that's so far out of the range that you know there's something wrong.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.100
 I mean, so it's just a way of telling illness or...

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.100
 So it's useful science, yeah.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.100
 It's useful science, yeah.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:20.100
 And 12 seconds, just an interesting relevant amount of time for this particular podcast.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.100
 Anyone know why 12 seconds?

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.100
 Are we only been recording for 12 seconds?

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:28.100
 12 seconds is the same length of time that the right brother's first flight was.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.100
 Wow!

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.100
 I flew for 12 seconds.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:42.100
 One of them stopped pooing at the top of the...land is it, land is it?

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.100
 Okay, that's it.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.100
 That's all of our facts.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.100
 Thank you so much for listening.
