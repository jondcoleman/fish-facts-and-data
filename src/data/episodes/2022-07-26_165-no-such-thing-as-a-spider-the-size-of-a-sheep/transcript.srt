00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,900
 â™ª Hello and welcome to another episode, a no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

2
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,060
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covern, Garden.

3
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,320
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Andrew Huntamari, Anna Chizinski and

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,760
 James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,560
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,120
 Starting with fact number one and that's my fact.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,360
 My fact this week is that the Chinese government are planning on giving their national anthem

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,000
 a speed limit.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,160
 So this is a plan at the moment.

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,720
 They haven't enforced it yet, apparently in the next month or so a paper will be proposed

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,880
 to enforce this.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,600
 They believe that the anthem is being abused by the people singing it.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
 Really?

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,120
 Yeah, they've called it a damaging situation, they're saying it's not universally respected

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,200
 and cherished.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,440
 People are laughing when they're singing, they're singing too fast, they're singing

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
 too slow.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
 They're singing too furious?

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,040
 Yeah, they're singing.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,240
 So the song is called March of the Volunteers.

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
 Right.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,960
 It's originally, although anyone not volunteering will be in trouble.

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,560
 It originally appeared in a movie soundtrack.

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,400
 It was part of a movie.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,480
 The movie was cool.

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,680
 You're now not allowed to fast forward that movie anymore.

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,040
 Yeah, it was in a movie called Children of Trouble Times and it was actually quite a political

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,400
 movie and the song was wrote in specifically for it and what ended up happening was people

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,240
 started singing it and it caught on more and more and people thought this would make

30
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
 a good anthem.

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
 So it became the official anthem.

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,920
 How are they going to deal with the laughter issue because you can still laugh at tempo?

33
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
 You can.

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
 They've got any plan to...

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
 Welcome back.

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,920
 Yeah, there's going to be... you're going to get dressed down basically, you'll be criticised

37
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
 and corrected.

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,440
 What, put in more casual clothes?

39
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
 Yeah.

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
 Yeah.

41
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
 So it's like Mufti Day.

42
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
 No.

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,080
 No, it's different because dress down Friday isn't where you come in and just get told

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
 off all day.

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,040
 It is one I do it.

46
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,080
 But interestingly, the Chinese government, they banned their own national anthem three years

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,400
 ago from all sorts of places so they said you're not allowed to sing it outside major sporting

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,720
 events or formal diplomatic occasions so you're not allowed to sing it at your wedding

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,960
 if you want to or at a funeral or anywhere which has apparently an inappropriate atmosphere.

50
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
 Right.

51
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,960
 Do weddings if you're not allowed to have particularly similar atmospheres?

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,200
 So Germany banned their own... some of their own anthem, didn't they?

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
 Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,160
 Wait, I mean like a bit of the song or...

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,920
 Yeah, they banned the first couple of verses because it was associated with the Nazi regime

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,440
 and there was that really embarrassing moment.

57
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,800
 I think it was last year or a couple of years ago, it was a US-Germany football match, like

58
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
 a friendly football match I think and there was an opera singer there from America called

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
 Will Kimball who was singing as a mark of respect to the Germans, the German national

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,600
 anthem, but he started singing the lines that were associated only with Nazi Germany.

61
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,680
 With Dutchland, Dutchland, Uber-Allers.

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
 Yeah.

63
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,280
 Which, when you hear those words, you do think immediately of Hitler.

64
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,120
 That's the version I've been singing this whole time, is that really not the version

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
 anymore?

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
 Yeah.

67
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
 You're not meant to sing that.

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
 It's the thing.

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
 It's in German, I didn't know.

70
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
 I didn't know what I'm singing.

71
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,760
 It's because the only words you know really are Dutch and Dutch and Uber means good, right?

72
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
 Good, yeah.

73
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,800
 So, until you get to that level, it sounds like quite a good lyrics, right?

74
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,280
 What's the word that tips it over?

75
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,760
 There's no word that's bad, it just means Germany, Germany, overall.

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,840
 It's just like the fact that Hitler itself is not a bad sound, but the association now

77
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,840
 with Hitler, the man, made it a name you probably, hopefully, won't call your child.

78
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
 But I shouldn't.

79
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,760
 And in the same way, the National Anthem was often sung by the Nazis.

80
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,880
 So now it's got those bad associations.

81
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:09,680
 Speaking of people who made National Anthem full par, is it full par or false par?

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
 I think.

83
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,280
 Have we ever mentioned about opera singer Tony Henry, who's sang the Croatian National Anthem

84
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,680
 before England v. Croatia?

85
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
 No.

86
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,000
 And instead of singing Milla Cuda C. Planina, meaning my dear, how much we love your mountains,

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,120
 he sang Milla Cura C. Planina, meaning my dear, my penis is a mountain.

88
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
 Oh.

89
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,000
 There was a dozi for Milla I winner.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,200
 We spoke about him on the show.

91
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
 Do you remember his name?

92
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,440
 I can't remember his name off the top of my head.

93
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
 Australia for me.

94
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
 Not the one who pushed his car.

95
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
 Yeah, who won it on foot.

96
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
 My problem was it.

97
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
 Yeah, Jack Rowan.

98
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,720
 I think it's him when he won the Formula One once.

99
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,400
 They realized they didn't have the ozzy National Anthem, because they thought it was God save

100
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
 the Queen.

101
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
 And so they were like, what do we do?

102
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,080
 And all they could think to do was find a drunken trumpet player who just played happy

103
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,880
 both days.

104
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,480
 It burns amazing.

105
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,760
 In Luxembourg, not in Luxembourg, in the Olympics in 1952 Luxembourg weren't expected to win

106
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,000
 anything.

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,280
 And they won the 1500 meters, I think, and they got gold.

108
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,560
 And the band, who was supposed to play all the anthems, hadn't been given the score and

109
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,280
 didn't know the Luxembourg National Anthem, because they'd all seen the Luxembourg wouldn't

110
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
 win anything.

111
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,240
 And you can see a bit of it on YouTube, but they just improvised the whole thing.

112
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,480
 They just completely make it up.

113
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,720
 It's like when an actor puts on his resume, yeah, I can speak Hungarian, yeah, definitely.

114
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,920
 And he gets to the casting.

115
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,520
 I was looking into music in China generally.

116
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,360
 Now, in terms of record sales, where do you think China sits, rank-wise, worldwide, in terms

117
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,160
 of people who buy music?

118
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
 Well, interesting.

119
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,440
 Do you mean are we including things like streaming and stuff like that, just basically spending

120
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
 money on music?

121
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
 You know, spending money on music, yeah.

122
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,760
 I tend to say, because they've got a billion people there at the top, or at least in the top

123
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
 five, I would say.

124
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
 They're 12.

125
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,280
 They're 12 in the world.

126
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,720
 And largely that's to do with piracy, that they've only just started to crack down on.

127
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,560
 But they're only starting to boom now because of this crackdown that's gone on.

128
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,800
 But if you look at their lists of best-selling albums, it's still really back in the day

129
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
 where...

130
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
 So, what do you mean?

131
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,600
 It's like they listen to stuff from the '80s, like Bon Jovier.

132
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,040
 Well, just nothing's taken.

133
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,360
 So, it's mainly Chinese artists and Korean artists and Taiwanese artists that you wouldn't

134
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
 have heard of.

135
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,240
 But number four, best-selling album, physical album, of all time in China is Titanic, the soundtrack.

136
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
 Oh, okay.

137
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
 Yeah.

138
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,240
 In 1998, or 1912, depending on when, which soundtrack you're talking about.

139
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,080
 Just live recording a feeble screening.

140
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,400
 Just the bang going down, because they're current on playing the night.

141
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
 But, wait a minute.

142
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,440
 But our best-selling single of all time, at least until recently, was White Christmas.

143
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,000
 So, it's not like our best-selling songs are all new, is it?

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,800
 No, no, but it's because people just weren't buying.

145
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,080
 They were buying pirated albums.

146
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
 I have a question.

147
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
 Yes.

148
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,200
 When Bon Jovier introduces himself, do you think he says the name?

149
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:06,320
 James Jovier, Bon Jovier, and then he pauses, and then he says, John Bon Jovier.

150
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,560
 Actually, it doesn't in three steps.

151
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
 I think you both.

152
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,200
 Is Bon Jovier, is Bon his middle name?

153
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,920
 This is what I'm trying to get at.

154
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,080
 Is it his real name, first of all?

155
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
 I don't know.

156
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
 No, I don't think it is.

157
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,520
 But if it is, it must be his middle, because it's not hyphenated, is it?

158
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,920
 So, it's not a double-barrelled.

159
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,040
 But it doesn't get Mother Bon by the Jovier.

160
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
 Lowercase though.

161
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
 Lowercase though, the Bon.

162
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
 No, no.

163
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
 It's uppercase.

164
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,560
 I think that when Jacob Riesmog introduces himself, he says, the name's Mog, Riesmog.

165
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
 Jacob Riesmog.

166
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
 Yes, I do.

167
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
 Do you?

168
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
 OK, all right.

169
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,160
 Well, yeah, in that case, maybe he does, because I imagine those two are the same.

170
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,640
 I like the name's Mog very much.

171
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,720
 Mog the cat.

172
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:53,320
 Did you know that in Tang Dynasty, China, so just over a thousand years ago, I think that was,

173
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,040
 then, you were supposed to greet and bid goodbye to people by improvising verse on the spot

174
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
 whenever you did it.

175
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,320
 If you were an educated person, you had to improvise a bit of poetry.

176
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
 How did you do the improv?

177
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,600
 Did you ask for a word?

178
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,240
 Just a non-geographical location, like a school.

179
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
 A school?

180
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,080
 They've actually just banned some songs, haven't they?

181
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
 Oh, I think, sorry.

182
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,560
 I think in 2015, they banned some songs.

183
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,200
 So the Chinese Ministry of Culture released a list of 120 songs that are banned for being

184
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,600
 immoral.

185
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,880
 And just on that list, there was included a song called "College Self Study Room," which

186
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,240
 is about a guy having a difficult time finding a place to study for university, banned

187
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
 from being immoral.

188
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
 Wow.

189
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,440
 What does he do instead of study?

190
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,680
 I didn't actually understand this song, because I'm not fluent.

191
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,080
 I'm just trying to think what immorality there might be in this song.

192
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,920
 So you think he gave up on trying to find the study and ended up masturbating instead of

193
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
 something?

194
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
 Panache.

195
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,000
 It's like he could read my mind.

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:06,760
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James Harkin.

197
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:14,080
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1921, 78% of shaving brushes sold in New York contained

198
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
 anthrax.

199
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,480
 And did it make it froth better or were they putting that in there?

200
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,280
 It wasn't put in there on purpose.

201
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,360
 It is the fact that shaving brushes used to be and sometimes still are made out of badger,

202
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,840
 and they used to get high quality badger fur from Russia, and then they would disinfect

203
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,600
 it in France.

204
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,240
 But then around the war time, they stopped sanitizing it.

205
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,040
 And badger hair is actually okay, because it's not that susceptible to anthrax poisoning.

206
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,960
 But when Russia fell apart a bit, we had to start importing horse hair from China and Japan,

207
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,120
 and horse hair is much more susceptible to anthrax, and so suddenly that became an issue.

208
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,520
 Ah, yes, you're right.

209
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,720
 And what people thought at the time during the war was it there was diabolical tactics

210
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
 of the enemy.

211
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,720
 They said it was down to, but then they realised that it wasn't anything to do with that.

212
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,320
 Occam's razor is the simplest thing.

213
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,080
 We're not cleaning our hair properly.

214
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
 Occam's razor.

215
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,040
 Love it, because you're shaving.

216
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
 Yeah.

217
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,880
 Actually these brushes are still a problem, because people love to buy antique shaving brushes

218
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,960
 or anything to do with what people like to collect vintage things, and they like to use it

219
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,640
 hipsters mainly, and they'll be using these brushes, and they hipsters all have beards.

220
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,840
 Ah, because they're aware about the anthrax situation going on.

221
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,940
 After they lost some key hipster members of their party to anthrax, do you know just

222
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,100
 on shaving how they use the train barbers?

223
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,400
 Well, so you can't take them to someone's face immediately because they have a sharp

224
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
 object.

225
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
 No, exactly.

226
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
 So was it on an animal?

227
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,860
 It wasn't on an animal that would have been good.

228
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,860
 Maybe there was some animal training.

229
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
 I'm sure there was.

230
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,860
 Was it on an arm?

231
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
 You do it on your arm.

232
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,860
 That's a good idea.

233
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,540
 Was it on dead bearded people?

234
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,260
 That is good thought.

235
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
 Good thought.

236
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,340
 You're doing a apprenticeship at the morgue.

237
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,340
 Actually, that would be quite good at the morgue, although if you made a mistake, you wouldn't

238
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
 know about it because they don't bleed.

239
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
 You're right.

240
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,340
 Ah, yeah.

241
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,340
 You have to.

242
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,340
 That's why they ended the policy.

243
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,340
 I'm the best barber in the world.

244
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,340
 Um, no.

245
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,820
 Okay, what else could it be then?

246
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,180
 It's something with very thin skin.

247
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,180
 I still don't trample.

248
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,180
 Um.

249
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,180
 I got a testicle.

250
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,180
 I'm going to...

251
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,180
 No, I'm going to...

252
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
 What?

253
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,180
 No, you're right, this.

254
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,100
 I thought that was sick of your face.

255
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,100
 What kind of...

256
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
 Well, they're delicate.

257
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
 We've got a...

258
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
 We've got a trainee barber in here today.

259
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,260
 But you find within your balls out for us, then we will do your face, I promise.

260
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,100
 It's his first day, but he's been great in the theory, modules.

261
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,100
 Something with thin skin.

262
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
 Eyelids.

263
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
 Oh, god, eyelids.

264
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
 I'm going to put you out of your misery.

265
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
 Balloons.

266
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
 What?

267
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
 Hairy balloon.

268
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
 Hairy balloon.

269
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
 Hairy balloon.

270
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,100
 It just sounds like testicles.

271
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,100
 I had no idea.

272
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,100
 Balloons start off hairy.

273
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,100
 And all the ones you get have been through the trainee barber.

274
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
 Right.

275
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
 So, do you put...

276
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
 You must put hair onto the balloon.

277
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,100
 You don't put hair on.

278
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
 You put shaving foam.

279
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
 Well, this is...

280
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,100
 I saw a British pathophone from the '50s.

281
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
 Talked about the training process.

282
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,100
 If they draw a face, they draw little face on the balloon.

283
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
 It is a good idea, though, isn't it?

284
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
 Because if you nick them, they pop.

285
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
 If you nick them, they pop.

286
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
 I'm like, the corpse is...

287
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
 So...

288
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,100
 It could be a bloated corpse with a lot of hair inside it.

289
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,100
 So, no, you paint the face on.

290
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,100
 And then you put the shaving foam on, and then the trainee has to scrape it off.

291
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
 Right.

292
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
 Oh, god.

293
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,100
 That's really interesting.

294
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
 How do they do it now?

295
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,100
 I don't know.

296
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,100
 Well, there's so little gold for it these days.

297
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
 Oh, well, yes.

298
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,100
 But, you know, there's hairdressers nearby here that does shaving them.

299
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,100
 So, I had my beard done, but not a clean shave, not with a razor.

300
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,100
 But, yeah, what they do is they have someone standing over and they train someone to do it.

301
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,100
 And you just have to accept whatever happens.

302
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
 That's the...

303
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
 They just say this might not work.

304
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,100
 And how is your testicle these days?

305
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
 Do you know how you shave in space?

306
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:38,100
 I think it would be just as easy as out of space, but not in space.

307
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
 I think I know a bit of the answer to this.

308
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
 But, should I say it?

309
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
 Yeah, go for it.

310
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:50,100
 Is it that you do normal shaving with a buzzer, but you have a vacuum cleaner next to your head and you suck in all the hairs.

311
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,100
 So, you vacuum your face as you...

312
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,100
 Oh, so you don't fill the air with hair?

313
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
 Exactly. This is what they have to avoid.

314
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:01,100
 They have the special really sticky shaving foam. It's called Astro Edge, right?

315
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
 And it sticks to the face, but it traps stubble in it.

316
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100
 And then you have to...

317
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,100
 Well, actually, you can just sort of wipe that into a bag or something and then it's in right back.

318
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,100
 But, when you have your hair cut in space, you have to have a vacuum cleaner next to you.

319
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,100
 That's it. When you have your teeth...

320
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
 And then suck, suck.

321
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
 Yeah.

322
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
 Slippery.

323
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,100
 I don't know what kind of hairdressers you got.

324
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,100
 In shaving news, in recent shaving news.

325
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,100
 Oh, yeah.

326
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:35,100
 So, since December, there are cats in this small town in Virginia that have been being taken away, having their bellies shaved

327
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,100
 and then returned to their owners otherwise unharmed.

328
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,100
 And no one knows who's doing this or what's happening.

329
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
 Police say they're not sure what crime has been committed.

330
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,100
 There's upsetting the owners, so can the perpetrator please stop?

331
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,100
 I suppose it's someone who can't get hold of balloons.

332
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,100
 Yeah.

333
00:14:51,100 --> 00:15:01,100
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

334
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:08,100
 My fact is that the cargo hold of the largest plane in service is longer than the first flight of the Wright brothers.

335
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,100
 How long is it?

336
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
 It's pretty long, Anna.

337
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
 Pretty long.

338
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
 Okay, on we go.

339
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,100
 I wonder if, because they didn't go very high, the Wright brothers either.

340
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
 I wonder if they could have actually done the whole flight in there.

341
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
 I think they might have been able to do that.

342
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
 That first flight was 120 feet long.

343
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,100
 Yeah.

344
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
 Okay.

345
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
 And how long is this cargo hold?

346
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,100
 As I said to Anna, it's quite long.

347
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,100
 Let's talk about some other statistics.

348
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,100
 The whole plane measures 275 feet in length.

349
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
 In length, yeah.

350
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,100
 Okay.

351
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
 So that's about 100 metres.

352
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
 Yeah, it shouldn't sound very long.

353
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
 84 metres, but it's very wide.

354
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
 And how long did you say this the Wright brothers thing was?

355
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
 120 feet.

356
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
 Okay, so that figure doesn't it?

357
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
 Yeah.

358
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
 God, that doesn't sound that long.

359
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,100
 Because I thought that was the longest plane that's going back to overtake this one.

360
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,100
 It's being built by Paul Allen, who's the co-founder of Microsoft.

361
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,100
 And that is going to be, apparently it's going to be wider than a football field.

362
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
 Oh no, this one is wider than a football field.

363
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
 Well, that's unbelievably wide.

364
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
 It's very wide.

365
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,100
 Football field is between, I think you're allowed between 50 metres and 100 metres for a width of a football field.

366
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
 So these planes are all metres?

367
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
 Yeah.

368
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,100
 That's right.

369
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
 That's right.

370
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
 And he's playing that you're talking about.

371
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
 Yeah.

372
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
 Is 275 feet in length.

373
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
 Yeah.

374
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,100
 And its wing span is 290 feet.

375
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
 There we go.

376
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
 Oh wow.

377
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
 It's wider than it is long.

378
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,100
 Yes.

379
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,100
 So I've just realised that when I was thinking about width, I forgot to include the wings.

380
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
 Yeah.

381
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
 Which is why I should never design planes.

382
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
 Right.

383
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
 Right.

384
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,100
 You've made a car.

385
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
 That's what you meant.

386
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
 I was including wings.

387
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
 Well, that's not that impressive.

388
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
 Okay.

389
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
 As you were.

390
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
 And there is only one of it.

391
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
 It's an amazing thing.

392
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
 They've built one.

393
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,100
 There is a second one, which they've been working on for 30 years on and off.

394
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
 Mostly off.

395
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100
 Anyway, sorry.

396
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,100
 It's called the Antonov AN225 Maria, which is a Ukrainian plane.

397
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
 Yeah.

398
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,100
 And it can fit 10 tanks inside or 50 cars depending on what you need to move around.

399
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:25,100
 So its maximum takeoff weight is 640 tons.

400
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
 Yeah.

401
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
 I mean, that is.

402
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
 So I checked out a few things that are about that weight.

403
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,100
 Yeah.

404
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
 Christ the Redeemer statue is about that weight.

405
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,100
 Is it in Rio?

406
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,100
 And you can strap it on top with the arms over the wings.

407
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
 Well, it looks like an aeroplane, doesn't it?

408
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
 It does.

409
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,100
 It does.

410
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,100
 It's quite wide if you include the arms, which had a problem it doesn't have.

411
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
 Wow.

412
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
 That was 640 tons.

413
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,100
 Wow.

414
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
 That was incredible.

415
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,100
 So actually, if you had a plane carrying that, you wouldn't even be able to get pilot in there.

416
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,100
 Because you'd already be exceeding the weight limit.

417
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
 Yeah.

418
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
 Christ would have to be flying the plane himself.

419
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
 You'd have to chop off like a finger or something.

420
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
 You were not even that.

421
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
 You're not even that.

422
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
 You haven't kidnapped him, Dan.

423
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:15,100
 But that's the takeoff weight includes the weight of the plane, I think, doesn't it?

424
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
 Yeah.

425
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,100
 So actually, it would be too heavy to carry.

426
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
 Is that including the pedestal of the Christ the Redeemer?

427
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
 Because it's most of the pedestal.

428
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
 I'm not sure, actually.

429
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
 I don't know.

430
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
 I don't know if it's not, and you didn't include the pedestal.

431
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
 I guess you just wouldn't take off.

432
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
 Yeah.

433
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,100
 So here's something that you could carry possibly.

434
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,100
 The volume of this cargo hold is 46,000 cubic feet.

435
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,100
 And that is approximately the same volume as the second largest tree in the world.

436
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,100
 Now, the problem is the tree is tree-shaped and the cargo hold isn't tree-shaped.

437
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,100
 So you need to chop it up a lot.

438
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,100
 Right.

439
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,100
 But you theoretically could chop it up and get it in if you put it nicely in light Tetris.

440
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
 Turn it into a book or a series of books and have it as a library.

441
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
 Speaking of books, do we have a book coming out soon?

442
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,100
 Certainly do.

443
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,100
 November made from the biggest tree in the world.

444
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,100
 I'm not sure I want it if it's made from the biggest tree in the world.

445
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,100
 No.

446
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,100
 Yeah, you do.

447
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
 Transported here by the biggest plane in the world.

448
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,100
 No, it wouldn't work.

449
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,100
 It wouldn't work because you had water to make paper, don't you?

450
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,100
 I was reading about the world's biggest private jet.

451
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,100
 Okay.

452
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,100
 So the world's biggest private jet.

453
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,100
 It's been bought by Prince Al Saud of Saudi Arabia.

454
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,100
 He's a Saudi prince and he has done some extraordinary things to it.

455
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
 So it's ginormous.

456
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
 It can fly 800 passengers.

457
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,100
 It can go 8,000 miles before refueling.

458
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
 But obviously it's his own private plane.

459
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
 He doesn't want 800 people on there.

460
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,100
 So he's transformed the plane into this incredible mansion-esque house.

461
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
 It's got a cinema in there.

462
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,100
 It's got a steam room in there.

463
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,100
 It's got the most impressively of all.

464
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,100
 It's got a prayer room where all of the mats are on the ground are electronic.

465
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,100
 And no matter where you are in the sky, they electronically turn towards Mecca.

466
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,100
 So when you go into prayer, it's facing Mecca.

467
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
 That is pretty clever.

468
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,100
 But what if you're hovering directly above Mecca?

469
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
 They're cool.

470
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,100
 Yeah.

471
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,100
 They just kind of go vertical, do they?

472
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,100
 I thought of that.

473
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
 That's true.

474
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,100
 Trump's private plane is pretty pimped out as well.

475
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,100
 He didn't interview before he became president where he was talking about it.

476
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,100
 And he said, describing his own plane.

477
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,100
 It's bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way.

478
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
 It's not bigger than Air Force One.

479
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
 Don't know why he said that.

480
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
 It's much smaller than it.

481
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
 It's because he's a pathological liar.

482
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,100
 But the president has her private fleet of planes, which are not Air Force One.

483
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
 Right?

484
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
 For his own.

485
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,100
 So we all hear about Air Force One, but actually there's a set of planes.

486
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,100
 They're four special Boeing 747s and they are called together.

487
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,100
 They are what is known as the National Airborne Operations Centre.

488
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,100
 Right?

489
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:55,100
 Where Air Force One is kind of ceremonial and comfortable, these planes are basically war rooms.

490
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
 Right.

491
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,100
 And so they're built in the 70s and they're staffed by military analysts and strategists.

492
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,100
 And it was if you were in a nuclear war, you would be flying around in these things.

493
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
 Not an Air Force One.

494
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
 Why aren't there not to be comfortable?

495
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,100
 Because you need to fit more soldiers in.

496
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
 Okay.

497
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,100
 And they have five mile long antenna, which trail behind them, right?

498
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
 No, they don't.

499
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
 Why?

500
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
 A mile long.

501
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,100
 Trailing, wire antenna.

502
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
 Yeah.

503
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
 With a banner on it.

504
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
 One of those advertising banners.

505
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
 No.

506
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
 Make America a great again.

507
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
 Listen, I'm quoting.

508
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,100
 There was a whole feature about these on Politico.

509
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,100
 It said the plane's included a special gear like a five mile long training wire antenna.

510
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,100
 That would ensure that the president could remain in contact with the nuclear submarine fleet,

511
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,100
 even after ground-based communications have been destroyed.

512
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
 Is it attached to a submarine, though?

513
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,100
 No, no.

514
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,100
 No, no.

515
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,100
 It's not submarine at the other end.

516
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,100
 You're writing through the air.

517
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
 No.

518
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
 But if ground-based communications have been destroyed, you need a very long antenna.

519
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,100
 Yeah.

520
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,100
 Five miles is a long antenna.

521
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,100
 It's very long, but what's behind you?

522
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,100
 As long as there's no one flying in the five miles behind you.

523
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
 And you're moving so far through this guy, there won't be.

524
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,100
 No.

525
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,100
 I just don't get why you're denying this thing, which I have a direct source for.

526
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
 Five miles.

527
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
 I just think five miles is a very long antenna.

528
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,100
 It's an extremely long antenna.

529
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,100
 That's, so that's going to collect radio signals.

530
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,100
 That was disputing the length of the antenna.

531
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
 How high are you up in the air when you're in a normal flight?

532
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,100
 Because maybe they attach a message to the end of the antenna and they point it at once.

533
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,100
 So you just grab a piece of paper as they fly by.

534
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
 I mean, yeah.

535
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,100
 You're actually all right.

536
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
 Five miles is very long.

537
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
 Because five miles is so long.

538
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,100
 You're not, are you normally five miles up in the air?

539
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
 If you're 30,000 feet, what that is, what?

540
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,100
 10,000 yards.

541
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100
 Yeah.

542
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,100
 And how many yards?

543
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,100
 It's 1560 yards in the miles.

544
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,100
 Yeah.

545
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
 So it's about 5,000 miles.

546
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
 It's about five miles.

547
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,100
 So it's just a trailer you're longer than that.

548
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,100
 Quick spell, SOS in the sand.

549
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,100
 So do people have to jump out of the way of it when it comes along the ground towards you?

550
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,100
 Look, I think we must have said it wasn't used, okay?

551
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:51,100
 It just sounds like you guys keep on asking clever dick questions about it.

552
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,100
 Do we think maybe Trump said it was five miles?

553
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,100
 You know North Korea has a plane that can fly backwards?

554
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
 No, it doesn't.

555
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
 It does.

556
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
 It's called the hummingbird.

557
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,100
 It's a very tiny plane.

558
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,100
 But this is, A, it's really cool because it's camouflaged as in.

559
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,100
 It's painted.

560
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,100
 It's so welcome from, and I want to see it.

561
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,100
 No one's ever seen it.

562
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
 There it goes.

563
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,100
 It's disguised as a backwards plane.

564
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,100
 This may look like a plane going forward.

565
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,100
 But actually, it's a backwards plane going backwards.

566
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
 Thank God, the enemy are flying away.

567
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
 Oh no!

568
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,100
 The way you could tell is there's a five mile antenna at the front.

569
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:44,100
 Okay, it is time for our final facts of the show.

570
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,100
 And that is Anitazansky.

571
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:53,100
 My fact this week is that poo on a table will look closer to you than it actually is.

572
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,100
 And this is just if there's poo on a table.

573
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
 And you think it's only a meter away.

574
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,100
 It's actually probably like just over a meter away.

575
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,100
 Yeah, and then we all thought you were being really weird downstairs when you put that on the table.

576
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,100
 But actually, some first-hand research.

577
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
 Just testing it out.

578
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,100
 Yeah, I read this on the website Nautilus, which is a very good website.

579
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,100
 And there was an article about how we perceive distance.

580
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,100
 And I think it was a study that was done by someone called Janine Stefanucci,

581
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,100
 who's a professor of Neural Science in Utah, the University of Utah.

582
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,100
 And yeah, it said that she put kind of a blob of chocolate on a table

583
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:35,100
 and let her study subjects to believe that it was species.

584
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
 And then made it look like feces.

585
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
 And then they thought it was closer than it actually was.

586
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,100
 Actually, it's quite an ethical experiment, isn't it?

587
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,100
 She's decided not to put actual poo on the table.

588
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,100
 Well, then she's lied to people. Is that ethical?

589
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
 White lies are fine, I think.

590
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
 Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean.

591
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,100
 But yeah, this is about how if we're afraid of things,

592
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,100
 then we perceive them as being closer. And loads of studies have been done that confirm this.

593
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,100
 If you'd were to try and throw a bean bag at a poo,

594
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,100
 then you would be likely to miss it on the far side.

595
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
 You'd throw it too far.

596
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,100
 Whereas if you were going to throw a bean bag at something nice like a bar of chocolate

597
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,100
 that didn't look like a poo, then you would miss on the shot side.

598
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,100
 And they've done experiments where people haven't done that.

599
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,100
 I'm just extrapolating slightly, but they've done experiments

600
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,100
 where they would give you a $25 gift card

601
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
 and ask you to throw a bean bag at it.

602
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,100
 And they found that people were always short of that because it's desirable

603
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,100
 and they think that it's close closer.

604
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,100
 If anything, that's a teleformat just waiting to happen.

605
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
 You're right. Throw the bean bag at the poo.

606
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,100
 No, no. Well, yeah, we could do it that way.

607
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
 Or we could do it just with like gift cards and stuff.

608
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
 Because the thing is, no one really wants to win the poo.

609
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,100
 So it's also what the prize is at the end of the throw the bean bag at the poo game.

610
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,100
 You don't have to, you can win the $25. It's hidden in the poo.

611
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,100
 It's basically, we have all these boxes from Deal or No Deal.

612
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
 They're probably just in a warehouse somewhere.

613
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,100
 So we can get them. And if we get the million pound box

614
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
 and then get people to try and throw bean bags into it,

615
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
 they're always going to be short.

616
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,100
 Yeah.

617
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,100
 So we never have to pay anything out and it's a great farmer.

618
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
 Although Andy raises a really good point.

619
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,100
 If you put poo around the voucher.

620
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
 And you know there's a voucher in there,

621
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
 but you can also see that it's covered in poo.

622
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
 Do you see it as closer or further away?

623
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,100
 I suppose that's where the jeopardy comes in in our format.

624
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,100
 What's the show called again?

625
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,100
 It's throw the bean bag at the million pounds covered in poo.

626
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
 I think it's an ITV2 show, isn't it?

627
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,100
 And spiders look bigger if you're scared of them.

628
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
 Yeah.

629
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
 Yes, that's right.

630
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
 And then direct proportion to how scared you are.

631
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
 Exactly.

632
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,100
 And they tested it by getting people who were very scared

633
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,100
 and then only slightly scared of spiders.

634
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
 And they showed them a sliding scale.

635
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
 So literally a slide and go,

636
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,100
 you could drag it a little, a clicker along.

637
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
 And there was a picture of a fly at one end

638
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
 and a lamb at the other.

639
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
 And you had to rate the spider.

640
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
 But surely.

641
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
 People who are really scared of spiders.

642
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
 I don't care how scared you are of a spider.

643
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,100
 You don't think it's the same size as a sheep.

644
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,100
 I think it was very slightly further along.

645
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
 Right.

646
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
 Okay.

647
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
 I believe so.

648
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,100
 In other science poo news.

649
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
 Okay.

650
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
 Very exciting study has been published.

651
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
 James and I were talking about this the other day.

652
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,100
 Scientists have finally worked out how long it takes animals to poo.

653
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
 Oh, yeah.

654
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
 Finally.

655
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
 Finally, finally.

656
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,100
 Well, we've cracked so many secrets.

657
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
 But this last one has eluded us for so long.

658
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,100
 Well, 2016 was the year that we cracked how long it takes them to urinate.

659
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,100
 Right.

660
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,100
 And 2017 is a fantastic sequel.

661
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,100
 What?

662
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,100
 What next year?

663
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
 A horrible thing when we discover next year.

664
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,100
 But they studied a bunch of animals, right?

665
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,100
 So this applies to both, let's say, something as big as an elephant.

666
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,100
 All the way down to something as small as a mouse.

667
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
 They both spend 12 seconds.

668
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
 Amazing.

669
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,100
 So from the size of a spider to the size of a spider.

670
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
 Yes.

671
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,100
 So this is the researcher Patricia Yang.

672
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,100
 I guess this should technically apply to humans as well.

673
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
 Yeah.

674
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,100
 Because she's saying if it takes longer than 12 seconds,

675
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
 I'd say you should go see someone about it.

676
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,100
 But then she says you have to factor in the fact that you might be reading a book

677
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,100
 or a newspaper or playing an iPhone game on.

678
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,100
 Doing on the table for an experiment.

679
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,100
 They published their scientific paper in a journal called Soft Matter.

680
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
 No.

681
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,100
 Yeah.

682
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,100
 Yeah.

683
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,100
 So yeah, it's quite an exciting discovery.

684
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,100
 And is it the same as the year in discovery as in all animals?

685
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
 It's the same for regardless of size.

686
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
 So is that the discovery?

687
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
 All mammals, yeah.

688
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,100
 And obviously there's quite a big difference.

689
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,100
 But I think David who did the year in one is part of this group as well.

690
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
 Yeah.

691
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:51,100
 And the idea being that with humans if you have a problem with a urinary or defecation or something,

692
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,100
 then you can kind of just talk to the doctor and tell him.

693
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,100
 But with an animal, it's sometimes hard to tell if there's a problem.

694
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:03,100
 But if you're animal, if you've got a horse and it's taking 40 seconds to we or two seconds to we,

695
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,100
 then that's so far out of the range that you know there's something wrong.

696
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,100
 I mean, so it's just a way of telling illness or...

697
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
 So it's useful science, yeah.

698
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
 It's useful science, yeah.

699
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:20,100
 And 12 seconds, just an interesting relevant amount of time for this particular podcast.

700
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
 Anyone know why 12 seconds?

701
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,100
 Are we only been recording for 12 seconds?

702
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,100
 12 seconds is the same length of time that the right brother's first flight was.

703
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
 Wow!

704
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
 I flew for 12 seconds.

705
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:42,100
 One of them stopped pooing at the top of the...land is it, land is it?

706
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
 Okay, that's it.

707
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,100
 That's all of our facts.

708
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,100
 Thank you so much for listening.

709
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,100

717
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
