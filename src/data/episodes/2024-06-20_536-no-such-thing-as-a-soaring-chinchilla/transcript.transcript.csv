00:00:02,00:00:03,"- Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:03,00:00:05,"of ""No Sex Things as a Fish,"""
00:00:05,00:00:10,which was recorded at the Nerdland Festival in Belgium.
00:00:10,00:00:12,This is the thing we do every year
00:00:12,00:00:14,we have done for the last few years.
00:00:14,00:00:15,It's a brilliant festival.
00:00:15,00:00:19,It's definitely worth checking out for future years.
00:00:19,00:00:24,"It's basically, imagine Disneyland had nerds instead of mice."
00:00:24,00:00:25,"It is, that's what it is really."
00:00:25,00:00:29,"It's loads of talks, it's loads of exhibitions,"
00:00:29,00:00:31,"it's science, it's nerd culture,"
00:00:31,00:00:34,it's everything you can want if that is your bag.
00:00:34,00:00:36,And we always have an amazing time there
00:00:36,00:00:37,with a great audience.
00:00:37,00:00:42,"And as usual, we were joined by Leven Skela."
00:00:42,00:00:45,"Anna did not make the journey this time,"
00:00:45,00:00:48,so it is the boys and Leven who did this show.
00:00:48,00:00:51,"And Leven, you will know if you are a regular listener"
00:00:51,00:00:53,"to fish, he may well have the record"
00:00:53,00:00:57,as most appearances of a non-elf on fish.
00:00:57,00:00:58,"I'd have to look that up,"
00:00:58,00:01:00,but he's been on quite a few times.
00:01:00,00:01:04,"He is an expert on all things nerdy, all things science,"
00:01:04,00:01:09,but at the moment he's really into AI as many nerds are.
00:01:09,00:01:12,And why that's important is because he has a book
00:01:12,00:01:15,"about AI, the title is AI."
00:01:15,00:01:20,It can be found on Amazon and I'm sure in other places.
00:01:20,00:01:25,"But if you search for his name, L-I-E-V-E-N-S-C-H-E-I-R-E,"
00:01:25,00:01:27,"Leven Skela, then you will be able"
00:01:27,00:01:29,to find his book on AI.
00:01:29,00:01:31,"And actually, if you go to levenskela.com,"
00:01:31,00:01:34,"then you can see all of his recent AI talks,"
00:01:34,00:01:37,which are very informative and very funny.
00:01:37,00:01:39,"If you struggle with Leven Skela's name,"
00:01:39,00:01:44,"then you can also go to www.levingshire.com,"
00:01:44,00:01:48,"as in what hobbits do I presume,"
00:01:48,00:01:49,which apparently also works.
00:01:49,00:01:51,So go to either of those places
00:01:51,00:01:55,and you can find out more about Leven and his works on AI.
00:01:55,00:01:56,"Anyway, enjoy the show."
00:01:56,00:01:58,"Like I say, it was really fun, like always."
00:01:58,00:02:01,"And of course, we are doing lots of live shows,"
00:02:01,00:02:04,which will include Anna towards the end of the year.
00:02:04,00:02:08,So go to www.nosesthingsoffice.com/live
00:02:08,00:02:11,to find out more about what remaining tickets there are
00:02:11,00:02:13,"and there are not many, so get in there fast."
00:02:13,00:02:15,On with the podcast.
00:02:15,00:02:17,(upbeat music)
00:02:17,00:02:20,(upbeat music)
00:02:21,00:02:23,(upbeat music)
00:02:23,00:02:34,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:34,00:02:36,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish,"""
00:02:36,00:02:39,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live
00:02:39,00:02:41,from Nerdland in Belgium.
00:02:41,00:02:44,(audience cheering)
00:02:44,00:02:48,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:48,00:02:50,"I am sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:02:50,00:02:53,Andrew Hunter Murray and Leven Skyra.
00:02:53,00:02:56,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:56,00:02:59,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:59,00:03:02,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:03:02,00:03:05,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Leven."
00:03:05,00:03:07,"- My fact is that in 2017,"
00:03:07,00:03:12,the AI computer AlphaZero was given the rules of chess.
00:03:12,00:03:14,"And four hours later,"
00:03:14,00:03:17,it was better than the human world champion in chess.
00:03:17,00:03:19,- Wow.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"- So it was given just the rules, no strategies,"
00:03:22,00:03:25,"no examples of chess games ever played between humans,"
00:03:25,00:03:28,and it started practicing against itself.
00:03:28,00:03:31,- Did it try any really weird things?
00:03:31,00:03:35,- It plays chess in a different way than humans.
00:03:35,00:03:37,"One chess player said, ""I've always wondered"
00:03:37,00:03:40,"""if the same game was invented on Mars"
00:03:40,00:03:42,"""and without any interaction between the cultures,"
00:03:42,00:03:44,"""we would have developed our own strategies"
00:03:44,00:03:47,"""because everybody learns from the people before them."""
00:03:47,00:03:49,"And he says, ""Now I know."""
00:03:49,00:03:52,"Because it takes more risks, for example."
00:03:52,00:03:54,"It will offer its queen sometimes,"
00:03:54,00:03:57,"without anyone knowing why, and then it wins in the end."
00:03:57,00:03:58,"So, really. - Wow, yeah."
00:03:58,00:04:00,"Can I just say, Leven, I think part of,"
00:04:00,00:04:02,if one of the main parts of playing chess
00:04:02,00:04:04,is being able to pick up the pieces
00:04:04,00:04:06,"and move them from one place to the other,"
00:04:06,00:04:09,"and until it can do that, I think I can beat it."
00:04:09,00:04:12,"- Yeah, well, then you need robotics,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,"and some people are afraid of robots,"
00:04:14,00:04:17,"and I always tell them, ""If at this phase of technology,"
00:04:17,00:04:18,"""you're afraid of robots,"
00:04:18,00:04:20,"""the only thing you need to carry with you at all times"
00:04:20,00:04:23,"""is a bucket of water, and you're safe."""
00:04:23,00:04:25,"- Well, actually, we were in the green room just now,"
00:04:25,00:04:28,and there was a robotic dog in there.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"- Spot robot from Boston Dynamics, yeah."
00:04:30,00:04:33,"- Yeah, and also, yeah, there was, and also a real dog."
00:04:33,00:04:34,And I can tell you that real dogs
00:04:34,00:04:36,do not like robotic dogs either.
00:04:36,00:04:39,- Really? - Yeah.
00:04:39,00:04:40,- I'm just wondering.
00:04:40,00:04:42,"James, I know you like chess, Leven."
00:04:42,00:04:43,I'm sure you like chess. - A bit.
00:04:43,00:04:45,- And I know you know a lot about AI.
00:04:45,00:04:48,Have you ever played against a man called Martin?
00:04:48,00:04:49,(laughing)
00:04:49,00:04:50,- Probably. - Okay.
00:04:50,00:04:51,- Who is he?
00:04:51,00:04:54,- Martin is a middle-aged Bulgarian man
00:04:54,00:04:56,"who wears a turtleneck jumper,"
00:04:56,00:05:01,"and he is the worst possible opponent on chess.com, right?"
00:05:01,00:05:04,"So he's an AI, he's a computer chess player,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,"but he has been programmed to be deliberately,"
00:05:06,00:05:08,unbelievably bad. - That's amazing.
00:05:08,00:05:11,"- He plays 10 million games every week,"
00:05:11,00:05:13,and still he sucks at chess.
00:05:13,00:05:14,- Really?
00:05:14,00:05:16,Does he like call the pawns prongs?
00:05:16,00:05:18,"- Yeah, it does. (laughing)"
00:05:18,00:05:21,"His catchphrase is, ""My four-year-old son just beat me."
00:05:21,00:05:22,"""Ouch."" (laughing)"
00:05:22,00:05:24,"And he's really, really bad at chess."
00:05:24,00:05:27,"He's done experiments with him to test how bad he is,"
00:05:27,00:05:30,'cause he's programmed to be a weak chess player.
00:05:30,00:05:34,"He has been given 31 queens on one board,"
00:05:34,00:05:37,"and the opponent only has pawns,"
00:05:37,00:05:38,and he has still managed to lose that game.
00:05:38,00:05:40,- Really? - Wonderful.
00:05:40,00:05:41,"- See, that feels more in check with where I thought"
00:05:41,00:05:43,we were at.
00:05:43,00:05:46,"The creator of QI, John Lloyd, he always has this line"
00:05:46,00:05:48,"where he says, ""Not only have we not invented"
00:05:48,00:05:51,"""artificial intelligence yet, but we haven't even invented"
00:05:51,00:05:53,"""artificial stupidity."""
00:05:53,00:05:55,"Like, that's how far away we are from taking over."
00:05:55,00:05:56,- I know we have Martin.
00:05:56,00:05:57,"- So that's Martin. - Yeah, yeah."
00:05:57,00:05:59,- So this robot that we're talking about
00:05:59,00:06:01,"that beat the record in chess,"
00:06:01,00:06:03,the way that they trained it was they gave it
00:06:03,00:06:05,"a bunch of games to play, and it had to learn strategy"
00:06:05,00:06:08,"from that, and whoever was the best at learning a game"
00:06:08,00:06:09,would advance to the next level
00:06:09,00:06:11,and train the next AIs together.
00:06:11,00:06:13,"So it didn't just beat chess,"
00:06:13,00:06:15,but it beat multiple Atari games.
00:06:15,00:06:19,"So as part of this program, the AI set a score on Pong."
00:06:19,00:06:23,"The highest score a human has ever set is 56,851."
00:06:23,00:06:28,"It scored 407,864 as part of this programming."
00:06:28,00:06:32,- Important thing there is that the only input it gets
00:06:32,00:06:34,is what is on the screen.
00:06:34,00:06:37,So of course it's easy to program and use the software
00:06:37,00:06:40,of all the positions to have an optimal software running it.
00:06:40,00:06:44,"But this was only fed what a human can see on the screen,"
00:06:44,00:06:46,and then adapted its own neural network
00:06:46,00:06:47,until it could play very well.
00:06:47,00:06:49,They thought it all the Atari games.
00:06:49,00:06:51,"It was at DeepMind, Google DeepMind in London,"
00:06:51,00:06:53,"that's how they did it, all the Atari games,"
00:06:53,00:06:58,"and then go the Chinese-Japanese game, Shoki, and chess."
00:06:58,00:07:02,"And so in fact now they can just give it rules of any game,"
00:07:02,00:07:04,and then it will practice against itself
00:07:04,00:07:07,and improve until it can beat it.
00:07:07,00:07:09,- Is there anything that we can win at?
00:07:09,00:07:12,"- Well, especially when it comes to boxing."
00:07:12,00:07:14,"There's one game that we still win,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,but I don't know how long it will take us.
00:07:16,00:07:18,It's the game diplomacy.
00:07:18,00:07:19,"- Oh, okay."
00:07:19,00:07:20,- It's a bit like risk.
00:07:20,00:07:24,So you have to move around the world and capture areas.
00:07:24,00:07:25,But there's more tactics.
00:07:25,00:07:27,You have different kinds of troops.
00:07:27,00:07:31,"But between every round, there's a round of diplomacy"
00:07:31,00:07:32,where the players can go one-on-one
00:07:32,00:07:34,and talk strategies with each other.
00:07:34,00:07:38,"Like if you move like this, then we can attack Italy there."
00:07:38,00:07:40,"Kissinger loved it, apparently."
00:07:40,00:07:43,Kennedy played the game.
00:07:43,00:07:45,And so now they have taught an AI to play it.
00:07:45,00:07:46,It's a bit scary.
00:07:46,00:07:49,You can see these large language models
00:07:49,00:07:50,talking to other players.
00:07:50,00:07:52,"Like if you do that move there,"
00:07:52,00:07:54,then I will come from that way.
00:07:54,00:07:56,So it figured all of this out.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"It can't win from the world top yet,"
00:07:59,00:08:01,but it ends in top 10 at this moment
00:08:01,00:08:03,in the game of diplomacy.
00:08:03,00:08:07,- I have a feeling that I would be able to beat any AI
00:08:07,00:08:09,"because I'm so dumb,"
00:08:09,00:08:13,it wouldn't be able to guess the strategy that I was playing.
00:08:13,00:08:16,"It would be like, why has he done that?"
00:08:16,00:08:18,That's probably where it learned to give the Queen away first.
00:08:18,00:08:20,"I'd be like, yep, you can have that."
00:08:20,00:08:23,"Like, I feel like stupidity of human error"
00:08:23,00:08:25,would be what confuses AI in a game.
00:08:25,00:08:27,"- Cup two, the year 2030."
00:08:27,00:08:30,The war against the machines has gone terribly badly wrong.
00:08:30,00:08:31,"Step up, Dan."
00:08:32,00:08:36,- But one man survived it and repopulated the Earth.
00:08:36,00:08:41,"- The one AI that's been built this year,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,"this is very exciting, this is a new development this year,"
00:08:43,00:08:47,researchers have built an AI sarcasm detector.
00:08:47,00:08:48,"- Oh yeah, sure they have."
00:08:48,00:08:54,"- It was in Holland, it was in Groningen."
00:08:54,00:08:56,"- Yeah, it was in Holland, and they trained it"
00:08:56,00:08:59,with pieces from the Big Bang Theory and Friends.
00:08:59,00:09:00,"- Oh, really?"
00:09:00,00:09:03,"- Yeah, so it's sitcom sarcasm."
00:09:03,00:09:03,"- Oh, okay."
00:09:03,00:09:05,- It's if they be any more predictable.
00:09:05,00:09:06,(laughing)
00:09:06,00:09:08,"- But I read about it, and there was, you know."
00:09:08,00:09:09,- What does it do?
00:09:09,00:09:10,"- Mostly, it can just detect sarcasm."
00:09:10,00:09:13,"It can detect if you're being sarcastic, which is useful."
00:09:13,00:09:16,But there is a risk that it might start using sarcasm
00:09:16,00:09:17,for its own--
00:09:17,00:09:18,- Against us?
00:09:18,00:09:19,"- Evil purposes, yes."
00:09:19,00:09:20,(laughing)
00:09:20,00:09:21,- Yeah.
00:09:21,00:09:22,- That's amazing.
00:09:22,00:09:24,Do you think even there's anything that AI won't be able
00:09:24,00:09:25,to do in the future?
00:09:25,00:09:27,"- Well, that's a difficult question."
00:09:27,00:09:31,"Basically, you could say AI is a new kind of software"
00:09:31,00:09:33,that is good at pattern recognition
00:09:33,00:09:36,"and recognizing patterns and generating patterns,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,like generating images and language.
00:09:38,00:09:43,But it does it so amazingly well at this point.
00:09:43,00:09:45,"The fact that it can win a game of diplomacy,"
00:09:45,00:09:48,"it kind of makes you think with these large language models,"
00:09:48,00:09:51,it's not unthinkable that I ask an AI
00:09:51,00:09:53,to buy a new car for me.
00:09:53,00:09:55,It can do the negotiations much better.
00:09:55,00:09:59,It's not unthinkable that an AI will sell your house
00:09:59,00:10:02,at a better price because it knows what language to use.
00:10:02,00:10:04,It could be coming.
00:10:04,00:10:07,"And especially when they start combining it with robotics,"
00:10:07,00:10:08,"which is what they're doing now,"
00:10:08,00:10:12,then you give the system sensors and a sense of the world.
00:10:12,00:10:14,And that's what probably the next revolution will be.
00:10:14,00:10:15,- How interesting.
00:10:15,00:10:19,"In February, 2023, so just over a year ago,"
00:10:19,00:10:23,we asked ChatGBT to give us an episode of Fish.
00:10:23,00:10:24,"- Oh yeah, yeah."
00:10:24,00:10:25,- Let's see if they could do our job.
00:10:25,00:10:28,"And they were pretty terrible, let's be honest."
00:10:28,00:10:30,"Anyway, I asked them to do it again this week"
00:10:30,00:10:34,with one more year of ability with the ChatBots.
00:10:34,00:10:35,And they did a pretty good job.
00:10:35,00:10:37,"So it begins with Dan Schreiber says,"
00:10:37,00:10:39,"""Hello and welcome to another episode"
00:10:39,00:10:40,"of No Such Things as a Fish, blah, blah, blah,"
00:10:40,00:10:42,"weekly podcast, all that stuff."""
00:10:42,00:10:44,"And then in no particular order, here we go."
00:10:44,00:10:46,"James, what have you got for us?"
00:10:46,00:10:47,"And then James Harkins says,"
00:10:47,00:10:50,"""My fact this week is that AlphaGo,"
00:10:50,00:10:51,"the AI developed by DeepMind,"
00:10:51,00:10:54,learned to play the game Go at a super human level
00:10:54,00:10:56,"by playing against itself millions of times."""
00:10:56,00:10:58,"- Oh my God, you're doing the AI's fact,"
00:10:58,00:11:00,is it your main fact here?
00:11:00,00:11:01,"- No, but Leven's doing it."
00:11:01,00:11:02,- So Leven didn't know about it.
00:11:02,00:11:05,It predicted what our fact was going to be.
00:11:05,00:11:06,- Are you kidding?
00:11:06,00:11:08,"- Honestly, and literally all I put in was,"
00:11:08,00:11:10,"""Give me a transcript of No Such Things as a Fish."""
00:11:10,00:11:12,"- It's over, let's just go home."
00:11:12,00:11:16,"We just, okay, but some fields, like creative ones,"
00:11:16,00:11:17,surely they're immune.
00:11:17,00:11:18,"- Yeah, surely Andy."
00:11:18,00:11:19,- Surely.
00:11:19,00:11:20,"- Well, hang on, I'm sorry."
00:11:20,00:11:22,Are we just gonna let that fly by?
00:11:22,00:11:25,Are the exact same fact was predicted by the machine?
00:11:25,00:11:26,We're all cool with that?
00:11:26,00:11:28,"- Dan, I guess, I'm sorry."
00:11:28,00:11:28,- No.
00:11:28,00:11:29,- That's the end of the world shit.
00:11:29,00:11:30,"- Dan, it gets worse."
00:11:30,00:11:31,- It gets worse.
00:11:31,00:11:32,"- There's a new podcast, it's out this year."
00:11:32,00:11:34,"It's hosted by a guy called Jake,"
00:11:34,00:11:37,"and it's created by a man called Jacob Redstrom,"
00:11:37,00:11:38,but Jake is AI.
00:11:38,00:11:40,It's a podcast hosted by an AI.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"- Okay, right?"
00:11:41,00:11:42,- Yeah.
00:11:42,00:11:44,"- Surely Andy, I mean, things like beauty,"
00:11:44,00:11:46,"that will never go to AI, will it?"
00:11:46,00:11:47,- Beauty?
00:11:47,00:11:49,"- Yeah, yeah, that'll always be a human trait."
00:11:49,00:11:50,"- Yeah, of course."
00:11:50,00:11:50,- Well.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- Oh no.
00:11:51,00:11:55,- There has been this year a Miss AI competition.
00:11:55,00:11:55,"- Oh, cool."
00:11:55,00:12:00,- Where a lot of chat bots/attractive creations online
00:12:00,00:12:04,went up against each other to see who was the most attractive.
00:12:04,00:12:06,"And not only did that happen,"
00:12:06,00:12:10,two of the judging panel were also AI-generated models.
00:12:10,00:12:12,- Wow.
00:12:12,00:12:14,So the worrying moment will be in that competition
00:12:14,00:12:16,"when they say, what do you hope for?"
00:12:16,00:12:17,"And they say, I would love world peace"
00:12:17,00:12:20,if the judge goes sarcasm detective.
00:12:20,00:12:22,(all laughing)
00:12:22,00:12:27,- That's when we're dead.
00:12:27,00:12:31,- Have you ever asked GPT-4 to write a sonnet?
00:12:31,00:12:32,- No.
00:12:32,00:12:34,"- This is, okay, write a sonnet."
00:12:34,00:12:35,I'm gonna do it live now.
00:12:35,00:12:39,"An animal, what's your favorite animal?"
00:12:39,00:12:40,- A chinchilla.
00:12:40,00:12:41,"- Yeah, chinchilla."
00:12:41,00:12:46,"- A chinchilla, okay, write a sonnet about a chinchilla,"
00:12:46,00:12:51,"okay, a chinchilla who really wants to fly like an eagle."
00:12:51,00:12:53,"Okay, there we go."
00:12:53,00:12:56,"So a chinchilla is kind of rodent, cute."
00:12:56,00:12:57,- I'm not totally clear what it is.
00:12:57,00:12:59,"I just said it 'cause James said it, but."
00:12:59,00:13:03,"- Yeah, kind of, I'm gonna press start now."
00:13:03,00:13:06,So I asked it to write a sonnet about a chinchilla
00:13:06,00:13:08,who really wants to fly like an eagle.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"This is just, this is coming out as we speak."
00:13:10,00:13:12,"It's finished now, there we go."
00:13:12,00:13:15,"In twilight's hush, a chinchilla dreams bright."
00:13:15,00:13:19,With fur as soft as whispers of the breeze.
00:13:19,00:13:22,He gazes high where eagles take their flight
00:13:22,00:13:25,and longs to soar above the tallest trees.
00:13:25,00:13:29,"His heart so bold defies the earthly bind,"
00:13:29,00:13:32,for in his tiny chest a spirit burns.
00:13:32,00:13:36,"With wings of faith, though not by nature's kind,"
00:13:36,00:13:41,he yearns for heights for skies his soul discerns.
00:13:41,00:13:44,He climbs the peaks where shadows kiss the light
00:13:44,00:13:48,and calls to eagles with a hopeful plea.
00:13:48,00:13:51,Their feathers brush the heavens free in flight
00:13:51,00:13:55,while he on ground remains but longs to be.
00:13:55,00:13:59,"Yet in his quest, a truth begins to rise."
00:13:59,00:14:04,"The flight resides in dreams, not just in skies."
00:14:04,00:14:08,"- That's very good, that's right."
00:14:08,00:14:10,"- I thought it was, it was quite long, was it?"
00:14:10,00:14:11,But that's sonnets.
00:14:11,00:14:12,"- That's sonnets, the 14 lines."
00:14:12,00:14:14,- Can we ask for a limerick next time?
00:14:14,00:14:16,"- A limerick, I'll try."
00:14:16,00:14:19,- I'm looking for high coups if we do any more.
00:14:19,00:14:22,"Here's the thing, AI has been very big in the news"
00:14:22,00:14:24,"in the movie industry, I would say."
00:14:24,00:14:27,"Well, you know, a lot of the strike that happened in America"
00:14:27,00:14:30,was off the back of how artists were having to be asked
00:14:30,00:14:34,to sign their voices over as well as the writing to AI.
00:14:34,00:14:35,And a lot of things are coming into place
00:14:35,00:14:38,where they're trying to protect the artist's integrity
00:14:38,00:14:42,"and livelihood and in Tennessee, a law has been passed"
00:14:42,00:14:45,where they are protecting musicians from AI.
00:14:45,00:14:49,So the act is called the ensuring likeness voice
00:14:49,00:14:53,and imagery security act or the Elvis act
00:14:53,00:14:55,because Elvis is from Tennessee
00:14:55,00:14:58,and that's happening in places now where they're gonna say
00:14:58,00:15:01,you can't use the likeness of the voice anymore
00:15:01,00:15:03,'cause it is happening.
00:15:03,00:15:07,- It happened with the new GPT system that talks
00:15:07,00:15:10,and Sam Altman who runs Open AI really wanted
00:15:10,00:15:12,the voice of Scarlett Johansson
00:15:12,00:15:14,"because she was in the movie ""Her"""
00:15:14,00:15:17,and he contacted her a few times and asked for it.
00:15:17,00:15:19,"She thought about it and she said, no, I cannot do it."
00:15:19,00:15:22,I don't want to relate myself with AI
00:15:22,00:15:24,because there's so much criticism of it.
00:15:24,00:15:26,And then the voice came out
00:15:26,00:15:29,and it was almost exactly like Scarlett Johansson.
00:15:29,00:15:33,"They had probably, they say they had found a voice actor"
00:15:33,00:15:35,who sounded really like her and adjusted it a bit.
00:15:35,00:15:39,"But well, she filed a lawsuit and it's all taken down now."
00:15:39,00:15:41,But so they're trying to copy the voices of...
00:15:41,00:15:44,"- Well, James Earl Jones has given over the voice"
00:15:44,00:15:46,"of Darth Vader now to AI based on his voice,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,which is so interesting 'cause that kind of is like
00:15:48,00:15:51,the final step in Darth Vader's journey anyway
00:15:51,00:15:54,"from going human to Android, isn't it?"
00:15:54,00:15:55,- Yes.
00:15:55,00:15:56,- Like a real world.
00:15:56,00:15:58,"- He's more machine now, isn't he?"
00:15:58,00:15:59,- Exactly.
00:15:59,00:16:00,We need to move on guys.
00:16:00,00:16:03,"- Well, what's Belgium best at, Leven?"
00:16:03,00:16:04,- What is Belgium best at?
00:16:04,00:16:07,- It's one of the most proud things that Belgium produces.
00:16:07,00:16:10,- What I just learned at the theme park science show
00:16:10,00:16:12,"that we just had, we are world-class"
00:16:12,00:16:14,in the wheels of roller coasters.
00:16:14,00:16:15,I didn't know.
00:16:15,00:16:16,"- Okay, that's very cool."
00:16:16,00:16:17,- And beer and fries.
00:16:17,00:16:21,"- No, no, no, let's hear you roll the coaster fact, Andy."
00:16:21,00:16:22,- Okay.
00:16:22,00:16:24,"No, an AI has just beaten humans at beer."
00:16:24,00:16:25,- Drinking or making?
00:16:25,00:16:26,- Belgian beer.
00:16:26,00:16:27,- Not drinking.
00:16:27,00:16:28,- Making.
00:16:28,00:16:30,Coming up with new recipes of Belgian beer.
00:16:30,00:16:32,"They had 250 Belgian beers,"
00:16:32,00:16:35,"a panel of the best beer experts on the planet,"
00:16:35,00:16:37,"rated them on all sorts of metrics,"
00:16:37,00:16:40,rated them on 50 different kinds of flavor
00:16:40,00:16:41,"and lab analysis,"
00:16:41,00:16:43,"and then an AI algorithm suggested,"
00:16:43,00:16:45,why didn't you add a bit of this and a bit of that?
00:16:45,00:16:48,And it came out tasting better according to the experts.
00:16:48,00:16:49,- Wow.
00:16:49,00:16:50,- So this is trouble.
00:16:50,00:16:51,"Today beer, tomorrow."
00:16:51,00:16:56,- I didn't speak up because I wasn't beer.
00:16:56,00:16:59,- Tomorrow the roller coaster wheels will be a new shape.
00:16:59,00:17:01,(audience laughing)
00:17:01,00:17:03,(upbeat music)
00:17:03,00:17:08,- It is time for fact number two and that is Andy.
00:17:08,00:17:12,- My fact is that crocodiles can cough up hairballs.
00:17:12,00:17:13,- Ah.
00:17:13,00:17:15,"- This was sent in by Colin Croakshank, thank you Colin."
00:17:15,00:17:17,"This is about, basically, I didn't know this."
00:17:17,00:17:20,"I knew cats produce hairballs and owls and things,"
00:17:20,00:17:23,"but crocodiles, they have the most amazing jaws,"
00:17:23,00:17:24,"they have the most amazing stomachs,"
00:17:24,00:17:26,they produce amazing acid to digest things.
00:17:26,00:17:29,They cannot deal with hair.
00:17:29,00:17:30,"And normally it's not a problem,"
00:17:30,00:17:32,"they don't eat a lot of hair,"
00:17:32,00:17:34,"but occasionally they'll eat a pig,"
00:17:34,00:17:36,and they end up with a hairball
00:17:36,00:17:38,"'cause they cannot deal with the pig's hair,"
00:17:38,00:17:39,"or the hooves,"
00:17:39,00:17:40,and they will just see a crocodile
00:17:40,00:17:43,on the banks of the river going (hissing)
00:17:43,00:17:44,(audience laughing)
00:17:44,00:17:46,- Where are these hairy pigs coming from?
00:17:46,00:17:48,(audience laughing)
00:17:48,00:17:48,"They're bristly, I guess."
00:17:48,00:17:50,- They're bristly sort of wild ones.
00:17:50,00:17:51,"- Well, that's amazing."
00:17:51,00:17:53,"- I know, they're big."
00:17:53,00:17:54,They're collectors in Queensland.
00:17:54,00:17:56,The biggest one is the size of a football.
00:17:56,00:17:57,"Well, that's what's amazing about it as well,"
00:17:57,00:17:59,'cause it's not like it's just they've had a meal
00:17:59,00:18:01,and they want to cough it back up.
00:18:01,00:18:04,"They can store that hairball for like 40 years,"
00:18:04,00:18:05,"so when they cough it up,"
00:18:05,00:18:08,it can give you an idea of the diet over decades
00:18:08,00:18:10,"of while they have eaten,"
00:18:10,00:18:12,"so it'll be like hairy pigs, you know,"
00:18:12,00:18:13,all the other things.
00:18:13,00:18:14,- That's so cool.
00:18:14,00:18:16,"- Human in some cases, an Australian."
00:18:16,00:18:17,"- Yeah, it is the best option"
00:18:17,00:18:19,if you see a crocodile coming towards you
00:18:19,00:18:22,"with its jaws open, that it coughs up a hairball, isn't it?"
00:18:22,00:18:25,"Like, that's what you're hoping for most of the time."
00:18:25,00:18:27,(laughing)
00:18:27,00:18:28,"- That's amazing, hairballs."
00:18:28,00:18:29,"- Hairballs, hairballs are good."
00:18:29,00:18:32,- They used to be thought that they cured poison hairballs.
00:18:32,00:18:33,- Really?
00:18:33,00:18:36,"- Yeah, these are bazoas, which are, you know,"
00:18:36,00:18:39,"hairballs that would come from animals mostly,"
00:18:39,00:18:42,"but there was a guy called Amboise Pare,"
00:18:42,00:18:43,"friend of the podcast actually,"
00:18:43,00:18:45,"you've mentioned him a few times,"
00:18:45,00:18:47,"and he decided to see if this was true,"
00:18:47,00:18:50,so he took a cook at the King's Court
00:18:50,00:18:54,"who had been caught stealing fine cutlery,"
00:18:54,00:18:57,"so he'd been sentenced to death for stealing these spoons,"
00:18:57,00:18:58,"and he said, well, what I'm gonna do"
00:18:58,00:19:00,"is I'm gonna let you off,"
00:19:00,00:19:01,"but I'm gonna give you some poison,"
00:19:01,00:19:03,"and then I'll give you this hairball,"
00:19:03,00:19:05,"which we all know this works, so it'll be fine,"
00:19:05,00:19:07,"and then we'll see what happens,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,"and it turned out it didn't work at all,"
00:19:09,00:19:10,and he died anyway.
00:19:10,00:19:11,"- Oh, wow."
00:19:11,00:19:12,- But that was the first evidence we had
00:19:12,00:19:15,that these hairballs don't cure poisoning.
00:19:15,00:19:17,"- They do, they sound so weird and cool."
00:19:17,00:19:18,- They're incredible.
00:19:18,00:19:21,"- Like the bazoas, or bazoas, or whatever,"
00:19:21,00:19:22,"don't know how you say them,"
00:19:22,00:19:23,"but they were for the rich, you know,"
00:19:23,00:19:26,"'cause real bees are really rare,"
00:19:26,00:19:28,"and if you couldn't afford one,"
00:19:28,00:19:30,"you could maybe buy a sliver of one,"
00:19:30,00:19:33,or you could rent one for the day.
00:19:33,00:19:33,If--
00:19:33,00:19:34,- I don't know what--
00:19:34,00:19:35,- What for?
00:19:35,00:19:36,- I think they were also thought to be useful
00:19:36,00:19:39,"in times of plague, so maybe if you were visiting--"
00:19:39,00:19:41,- Magic spells as well.
00:19:41,00:19:42,"- Magic spells. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:42,00:19:43,"- And if you were very wealthy,"
00:19:43,00:19:44,"you might have one for yourself,"
00:19:44,00:19:45,"but one for your friends,"
00:19:45,00:19:46,"you know, if any friends are visiting,"
00:19:46,00:19:47,so that's nice.
00:19:47,00:19:48,- Have a hairball.
00:19:48,00:19:50,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:50,00:19:52,"No, they're very cool."
00:19:52,00:19:53,- Lions can get hairballs?
00:19:53,00:19:54,"- Oh, really?"
00:19:54,00:19:57,"- Yeah, there was one found in an African lion"
00:19:57,00:19:59,"at the Colorado State Zoo,"
00:19:59,00:20:02,"and it was, how big do you think a lion's hairball would be?"
00:20:02,00:20:06,- The size of a cricket ball.
00:20:06,00:20:06,- Bigger.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"- Okay, two cricket balls."
00:20:08,00:20:09,(laughing)
00:20:09,00:20:13,- Let's go in sizes of animals rather than balls.
00:20:13,00:20:14,- Melon.
00:20:14,00:20:15,- Sizes of animals.
00:20:15,00:20:16,(audience laughing)
00:20:16,00:20:18,"- The famous animal, the melon."
00:20:18,00:20:22,"- The melon, well, there's a kiwi, so who knows?"
00:20:22,00:20:24,(laughing)
00:20:24,00:20:26,"- Lee and Will have come here with the latest research,"
00:20:26,00:20:30,proving that melons are actually technically.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"- I think it was like, I didn't know what a chila was,"
00:20:33,00:20:35,and now I'm not sure I know what a melon is.
00:20:35,00:20:36,(laughing)
00:20:36,00:20:38,It was about the same size as a chihuahua dog.
00:20:38,00:20:39,"- Oh, wow."
00:20:39,00:20:41,"- So I like the size of a small dog, yeah."
00:20:41,00:20:42,- Wow.
00:20:42,00:20:46,- Do you know why chihuahuas were bred in Central America?
00:20:46,00:20:47,"- Mexico, right?"
00:20:47,00:20:47,- Yeah.
00:20:47,00:20:50,"They were religious animals,"
00:20:50,00:20:52,and they were sacrificed to the gods.
00:20:52,00:20:53,- No.
00:20:53,00:20:54,- No.
00:20:54,00:20:55,- It's not much of a sacrifice.
00:20:55,00:20:56,"I've got to say, if I was one of the gods,"
00:20:56,00:20:58,"looking down, and they're bringing me this tiny--"
00:20:58,00:20:59,- And you were hungry?
00:20:59,00:21:00,- I'm hungry.
00:21:00,00:21:01,They're bringing me this tiny--
00:21:01,00:21:02,- You wouldn't want a dain.
00:21:02,00:21:03,"- Yeah, I would."
00:21:03,00:21:04,- A big dog.
00:21:04,00:21:04,- Yeah.
00:21:04,00:21:05,- What was the sacrifice like?
00:21:05,00:21:07,"'Cause if it's burned at the stake, very easy to light."
00:21:07,00:21:08,That's a--
00:21:08,00:21:09,- What?
00:21:09,00:21:11,"- Well, they're gonna just go right up, aren't they?"
00:21:11,00:21:12,That's a--
00:21:12,00:21:13,"- Yeah, that's when they say, ""Woof."""
00:21:13,00:21:15,(laughing)
00:21:15,00:21:18,(audience applauding)
00:21:18,00:21:20,"- So they were sacrificed to the gods,"
00:21:20,00:21:22,"and I love it when I walk in the street,"
00:21:22,00:21:24,"and I see people with a shiwawa to go in,"
00:21:24,00:21:26,"""Oh, sweet dog, what are you gonna ask"
00:21:26,00:21:28,"""from the gods if you sacrifice it?"""
00:21:28,00:21:31,(laughing)
00:21:31,00:21:33,"- Well, do you know, this is a tangential story,"
00:21:33,00:21:35,"but there was a thing in the UK,"
00:21:35,00:21:37,"I don't know if you guys in Belgium heard about it here,"
00:21:37,00:21:40,"but there was a, what looked like a giant hairball,"
00:21:40,00:21:42,was found by a lady.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"But she went, ""Oh, it's a hedgehog."""
00:21:43,00:21:46,"And so she brought it home, and she put it into a box,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,"and she gave it a hot water bottle,"
00:21:48,00:21:50,"and some food, then it didn't recover,"
00:21:50,00:21:53,"took it to hospital, and it turned out it was the bubble"
00:21:53,00:21:56,"on the top of a hat that people wear,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,those beanie bubbles.
00:21:58,00:22:00,- And apparently this happens a lot.
00:22:00,00:22:02,"Zoologists and also vets are saying,"
00:22:02,00:22:04,"""We gotta start understanding what animals look like again,"
00:22:04,00:22:07,"""because we're losing a lot of time"
00:22:07,00:22:10,"""when you're calling us out to help a drowning swan,"
00:22:10,00:22:14,"""and it's a chair leg upside down, we can't do that."""
00:22:14,00:22:17,Someone brought vets to their house to help them revive
00:22:17,00:22:19,"what they thought was a hedgehog,"
00:22:19,00:22:21,but turned out to be a fruit loaf.
00:22:21,00:22:24,"Now, a fruit loaf doesn't look like a hedgehog,"
00:22:24,00:22:26,but apparently it had been pecked at by a lot of birds
00:22:26,00:22:28,so that it looked very spiky.
00:22:28,00:22:30,"And even then they were like, ""Oh my God, it's dying!"""
00:22:30,00:22:32,And they pulled out people to come.
00:22:32,00:22:34,So this is a big thing at the moment.
00:22:34,00:22:35,- That is amazing.
00:22:35,00:22:38,- Sounds like cheap tamagochis in a way.
00:22:38,00:22:39,- Yeah.
00:22:39,00:22:40,- Just take cotton balls home and care for them.
00:22:40,00:22:42,"- Or like chia pets, remember those?"
00:22:42,00:22:43,- No.
00:22:43,00:22:44,- Chia pet.
00:22:44,00:22:46,- The pottery that grows.
00:22:46,00:22:46,- No one?
00:22:46,00:22:47,(laughing)
00:22:47,00:22:49,- No one's seen Wayne's World?
00:22:49,00:22:51,- Imagine the size of a room like this
00:22:51,00:22:52,and you're the only one who gets that reference.
00:22:52,00:22:54,"- Yeah, that was a pretty special moment."
00:22:54,00:22:56,- That's like me playing a move to AI.
00:22:56,00:22:59,"And then it's like, ""What was that?"""
00:22:59,00:23:00,- Do you want to know the record
00:23:00,00:23:04,for the largest ball of hair ever created?
00:23:04,00:23:07,"- Okay, so this is not an accidental in your stomach thing."
00:23:07,00:23:09,- This is not an animal product.
00:23:09,00:23:11,- This is someone with a weird fetish.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"- I would not, I would not disagree."
00:23:14,00:23:16,(laughing)
00:23:16,00:23:18,- But for legal reasons.
00:23:18,00:23:21,"- It's, well, it was created by a hairstylist"
00:23:21,00:23:23,from the USA called Steve.
00:23:23,00:23:27,"And he said, ""I got more spiritual as I've aged"
00:23:27,00:23:31,"""and I wanted to leave some kind of legacy when I'm gone."
00:23:31,00:23:35,"""And it hit me, I'm going to build a giant hairball."""
00:23:35,00:23:38,And he made a hole in the wall in his hair salon
00:23:38,00:23:40,"like a, and he put a slide down"
00:23:40,00:23:42,to the basement of the building.
00:23:42,00:23:43,- Oh my God.
00:23:43,00:23:43,"- And every time he had hair,"
00:23:43,00:23:45,he'd just shove it down the slide.
00:23:45,00:23:47,And then he glued it all together.
00:23:47,00:23:49,So how big was it?
00:23:49,00:23:52,"- Oh, so it's the biggest ever, so it must be quite big."
00:23:52,00:23:53,- It's quite big.
00:23:53,00:23:54,- Shall I go by the size of an animal?
00:23:54,00:23:55,"- Yes, please."
00:23:55,00:23:57,"- Okay, large horse."
00:23:57,00:24:00,"- Oh, not far off, actually."
00:24:00,00:24:01,- A bison.
00:24:01,00:24:03,- Smaller than a bison.
00:24:03,00:24:04,"- Wow, what is that difference?"
00:24:04,00:24:08,"I can't even, what's an in-between animal to that?"
00:24:08,00:24:10,"- Look, I don't know what animals are, it turns out."
00:24:10,00:24:12,I don't know what animals are or look like.
00:24:12,00:24:14,- I actually saw this and I thought it looked
00:24:14,00:24:16,"like a really, really big hedgehog."
00:24:16,00:24:17,"- Yeah, it was that, it was a bit, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:17,00:24:18,- It was actually a fruitcake.
00:24:18,00:24:20,(laughing)
00:24:20,00:24:23,"- It weighed 102 kilos, 225 pounds."
00:24:23,00:24:28,"It is disgusting, it is so, is horrible."
00:24:28,00:24:29,"- How big is that, Andy?"
00:24:29,00:24:31,I can't actually picture that.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"Genuinely, can't."
00:24:32,00:24:34,"- It was, I mean, it was on a wagon when I saw it, so."
00:24:34,00:24:37,- Like a large-ish man would be about 100 kilos.
00:24:37,00:24:37,- Okay.
00:24:37,00:24:40,"- Yeah, and it's maybe eight feet high,"
00:24:40,00:24:42,"'cause it's made of hair, it's not very dense,"
00:24:42,00:24:43,and it's half-glued.
00:24:43,00:24:45,"Anyway, you can go and visit it now"
00:24:45,00:24:50,"and add your own hair, if you too have got more spiritual"
00:24:50,00:24:52,"and you want to leave a legacy behind, yeah."
00:24:52,00:24:56,"- All right, do you know a cat coughing up hairballs"
00:24:56,00:24:59,is responsible for one of the great voices
00:24:59,00:25:01,of nerd culture?
00:25:01,00:25:02,(dog barking)
00:25:02,00:25:03,- That one.
00:25:03,00:25:05,- That's a duck.
00:25:05,00:25:06,- Yep.
00:25:06,00:25:07,(dog barking)
00:25:07,00:25:09,"- Duffy duck, yeah, Jen does a better duck duck."
00:25:09,00:25:11,"- Still a duck, yeah."
00:25:11,00:25:12,- But that's a nerdy--
00:25:12,00:25:13,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:13,00:25:16,- Is it like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park?
00:25:16,00:25:20,"- No, so it inspired the voice of something"
00:25:20,00:25:22,that's very big in the dork-nerd world.
00:25:22,00:25:25,- So what does it sound like a good cat coughing up hair?
00:25:25,00:25:27,- Oh.
00:25:27,00:25:28,- Gollum.
00:25:28,00:25:29,- Gollum.
00:25:29,00:25:29,- Really?
00:25:29,00:25:31,"- Andy Serkis, when he was going to the audition"
00:25:31,00:25:32,"of Lord of the Rings, was going,"
00:25:32,00:25:35,"""How am I going to portray Gollum in my audition?"""
00:25:35,00:25:37,"And his cat was next, so I'm going,"
00:25:37,00:25:39,(dog barking)
00:25:39,00:25:42,- What a disgusting hairball Gollum would produce.
00:25:42,00:25:43,That would be awful.
00:25:43,00:25:44,"- That's the whole time, that's all it is."
00:25:44,00:25:46,It's just got that in its throat.
00:25:46,00:25:47,"Interestingly though, cats,"
00:25:47,00:25:50,"when we think of them coughing up a hairball,"
00:25:50,00:25:51,"according to vets, they get pissed off"
00:25:51,00:25:53,when you say coughed up a hairball.
00:25:53,00:25:55,They don't cough up a hairball.
00:25:55,00:25:56,They vomit up a hairball.
00:25:56,00:25:57,- Oh.
00:25:57,00:25:59,"- Or they're really kind of just trying to thrust it out,"
00:25:59,00:26:00,but they're not coughing.
00:26:00,00:26:01,It's not a--
00:26:01,00:26:02,"- It doesn't matter, whatever it is,"
00:26:02,00:26:05,Steve will take it and he will glue it onto his big ball.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Do you know we've just missed
00:26:06,00:26:08,National Hairball Awareness Day?
00:26:08,00:26:09,"- Oh, God."
00:26:09,00:26:10,- Yeah.
00:26:10,00:26:11,- By how long?
00:26:11,00:26:12,- Anyone else observe it?
00:26:12,00:26:13,- That's terrible.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"It is bad when you're the only one, yeah."
00:26:15,00:26:17,(audience laughing)
00:26:17,00:26:19,"- How long Andy, since it was--"
00:26:19,00:26:20,"- It was, it's the last Friday in April."
00:26:20,00:26:22,So it's an annual thing.
00:26:22,00:26:23,"- Do you know the date, the specific date?"
00:26:23,00:26:24,"- Well, it's the last Friday in April."
00:26:24,00:26:26,"So like Easter, it moves."
00:26:26,00:26:28,- I don't know.
00:26:28,00:26:29,"- Which is convenient,"
00:26:29,00:26:30,'cause what if it's at the weekend
00:26:30,00:26:33,and not enough people come and celebrate?
00:26:33,00:26:34,"- Yeah, good."
00:26:34,00:26:36,And what did you do to celebrate?
00:26:36,00:26:38,"- Well, you know, just pop 'em visit Steve"
00:26:38,00:26:40,at this great big ball.
00:26:40,00:26:41,(audience laughing)
00:26:41,00:26:42,"- You know, it was founded by a vet"
00:26:42,00:26:45,who wanted to raise awareness of--
00:26:45,00:26:45,- And what's--
00:26:45,00:26:46,- Of hairballs.
00:26:46,00:26:47,"- Oh, okay."
00:26:47,00:26:50,"- I mean, I guess they can be bad for a cat's health, maybe?"
00:26:50,00:26:51,"- Yeah, yeah, it makes them sick."
00:26:51,00:26:53,"If your cat is coughing up a hairball,"
00:26:53,00:26:56,"it is a sign of bigger issues,"
00:26:56,00:26:57,"gutturally, that is going on."
00:26:57,00:26:58,"- Really, really?"
00:26:58,00:27:00,'Cause theoretically it should be able to process
00:27:00,00:27:02,the bit of hair that it eats.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"- Yeah, so that's been building up inside of them in ways."
00:27:05,00:27:06,"We're gonna have to move on,"
00:27:06,00:27:07,so I can do this.
00:27:07,00:27:08,"- Oh, should we do a bit on crocodiles or not?"
00:27:08,00:27:09,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:27:09,00:27:10,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:27:10,00:27:12,- If you give someone a crocodile to hold
00:27:12,00:27:15,"when they're in the casino, they'll make bigger bets."
00:27:15,00:27:17,(audience laughing)
00:27:17,00:27:19,- What size of crocodile?
00:27:19,00:27:21,"I mean, like, as big as a chinchilla"
00:27:21,00:27:24,or as big as a melon?
00:27:24,00:27:26,"- I think it's the bigger the crocodile,"
00:27:26,00:27:27,the bigger the bets.
00:27:27,00:27:30,"So it's like, apparently, it's a sense of height"
00:27:30,00:27:32,and the rousal makes you want to gamble more.
00:27:32,00:27:33,- Oh.
00:27:33,00:27:35,"And if you think the crocodile might eat you,"
00:27:35,00:27:37,that puts you in that state.
00:27:37,00:27:39,"- You're aroused, but not in the way you're thinking."
00:27:39,00:27:39,"- No, no, no."
00:27:39,00:27:41,I'm not thinking anything at all.
00:27:41,00:27:44,"I'm just thinking, how do I get rid of this crocodile?"
00:27:44,00:27:45,"If I win another $50,000,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,maybe I'll get someone to hold the crocodile
00:27:47,00:27:48,and take it away from me.
00:27:48,00:27:49,"Yeah, that's my plan."
00:27:49,00:27:52,"- Do you know that sometimes in the States,"
00:27:52,00:27:56,you have frozen lakes with crocodile snouts
00:27:56,00:27:57,peeping out of the ice.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"- Oh, really?"
00:27:58,00:27:59,- It's when crocodiles hibernate
00:27:59,00:28:02,and there's an ice layer on the lake.
00:28:02,00:28:04,They just pop out their nose.
00:28:04,00:28:08,So it looks like little green pebbles on the ice.
00:28:08,00:28:11,"And it's actually, when you pull the pebble,"
00:28:11,00:28:13,it's attached to a crocodile.
00:28:13,00:28:14,And they're completely hibernating.
00:28:14,00:28:17,So they're in standby mode as they don't react
00:28:17,00:28:19,if you wiggle with the snout.
00:28:19,00:28:20,"- That's a good prank, though."
00:28:20,00:28:21,- Yeah.
00:28:21,00:28:23,- So let's see who can pick up that pebble first.
00:28:23,00:28:24,(all laughing)
00:28:24,00:28:27,"- Actually, the word crocodile means pebble worm."
00:28:27,00:28:28,- Really?
00:28:28,00:28:30,"- Yeah, the croco is the pebble"
00:28:30,00:28:32,and dailos is the worm.
00:28:32,00:28:36,"But in Greek, delios also means circumcised man."
00:28:36,00:28:36,- Right.
00:28:36,00:28:40,- It could be that crocodile means pebble circumcised man.
00:28:40,00:28:41,- Okay.
00:28:41,00:28:42,- Not sure.
00:28:42,00:28:44,"- Either way, how misleading if someone says,"
00:28:44,00:28:47,can you go and collect the pebble circumcised man
00:28:47,00:28:49,over there and you come to a crocodile?
00:28:49,00:28:53,"That is, yeah, that's bad naming, I would say."
00:28:53,00:28:55,(upbeat music)
00:28:55,00:29:01,"All right, it is time for fact number three."
00:29:01,00:29:03,And that is James.
00:29:03,00:29:06,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in the 14th century,"
00:29:06,00:29:09,there was a rumour among Europeans
00:29:09,00:29:12,that all Englishmen had tails.
00:29:12,00:29:13,(audience laughing)
00:29:13,00:29:15,- Now is the time to prove otherwise.
00:29:15,00:29:18,(all laughing)
00:29:18,00:29:21,- And I've basically come here to see if it's still a rumour.
00:29:21,00:29:23,"- Oh, yeah."
00:29:23,00:29:25,- Is this still a thing that people in Belgium think
00:29:25,00:29:26,that English people have tails?
00:29:26,00:29:28,(audience laughing)
00:29:28,00:29:29,Wow.
00:29:29,00:29:30,"- Oh, there we go."
00:29:30,00:29:35,- So this idea basically comes from the idea
00:29:35,00:29:39,that St. Augustine had visited the people of Kent
00:29:39,00:29:41,and he was mocked by the locals
00:29:41,00:29:44,and they pinned tails of fish to his robes
00:29:44,00:29:47,to kind of kick him out of the town.
00:29:47,00:29:50,And he turned round and he cursed them with their own tails.
00:29:50,00:29:53,And this became a thing in Europe.
00:29:53,00:29:58,So it's the extent that when there was a siege in 1436
00:29:58,00:30:00,"in Paris and the English were kicked out,"
00:30:00,00:30:02,"they were taunted by the locals saying,"
00:30:02,00:30:04,"were your tails, were your tails?"
00:30:04,00:30:07,"And the Scottish, before a battle in 1332,"
00:30:07,00:30:10,said they would make ropes from the tails of the English
00:30:10,00:30:11,to tie them with.
00:30:11,00:30:12,- Oh.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"- They thought we were basically more close to Beast Hut,"
00:30:15,00:30:16,more close to the devil.
00:30:16,00:30:18,It was said the English were.
00:30:18,00:30:22,"And there is a thing in French where the word for tail,"
00:30:22,00:30:25,"which is coupé, and the word for hatch,"
00:30:25,00:30:27,"which is coupé apparently, I don't speak French,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,"but they're so close together,"
00:30:29,00:30:32,they had a theory that English people sat on eggs
00:30:32,00:30:33,to hatch them.
00:30:33,00:30:34,- Oh.
00:30:34,00:30:36,"- So yeah, that was how we got our eggs."
00:30:36,00:30:36,We all sat on them.
00:30:36,00:30:37,- I think we're getting off quite lightly now
00:30:37,00:30:40,with just you've all got bad teeth as a reputation.
00:30:40,00:30:41,"That is quite, you know, that's better."
00:30:41,00:30:45,"And by the way, we don't all have bad teeth, just to say,"
00:30:45,00:30:46,almost all of us have some teeth.
00:30:46,00:30:49,So I just want to say.
00:30:49,00:30:54,"- We have the best teeth ever, ever seen."
00:30:54,00:30:56,"- So do you, do you have in Belgium then,"
00:30:56,00:30:58,are there any things that if you were talking
00:30:58,00:31:00,"about an English person, you would say a certain thing?"
00:31:00,00:31:04,"Like I was just suddenly remembered that Michael Palin,"
00:31:04,00:31:05,"when he went out to the Amazon,"
00:31:05,00:31:07,they were describing to him how many trees
00:31:07,00:31:09,are chopped down per day.
00:31:09,00:31:13,"They would say a Belgium, and it was the size of Belgium."
00:31:13,00:31:15,So that would be a unit of measurement out in the Amazon
00:31:15,00:31:17,for saying how much was chopped down.
00:31:17,00:31:20,- One Belgium of trees was chopped down again.
00:31:20,00:31:21,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:31:21,00:31:22,- Yeah.
00:31:22,00:31:23,"- Do you have anything here where it's like,"
00:31:23,00:31:24,"oh, you English people."
00:31:24,00:31:26,- We chopped down one England of trees.
00:31:26,00:31:27,"- No, no, no, no, no."
00:31:27,00:31:29,"- Just like we smell or we suck or you know,"
00:31:29,00:31:30,that kind of thing.
00:31:30,00:31:31,"- No, no, no, not really."
00:31:31,00:31:33,"- By the way, Dan's just saying this"
00:31:33,00:31:34,'cause he's not English.
00:31:34,00:31:35,(laughing)
00:31:35,00:31:38,- Dan is Australian and he wants to get in on this bullying.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"- Well, you know, when you're a child,"
00:31:41,00:31:45,you read comic books and like Asterix going to England
00:31:45,00:31:48,"and then you have all these, oh really, oh dear."
00:31:48,00:31:49,"And they're all very, ooh, polite."
00:31:49,00:31:50,"- What, polite?"
00:31:50,00:31:52,"- Cutting the grass, really upperclass."
00:31:52,00:31:55,"- You're describing Andy, you're just, yeah."
00:31:55,00:32:00,- But you get this upperclass image of what England is.
00:32:00,00:32:03,And then you go there as a tourist.
00:32:03,00:32:04,(laughing)
00:32:04,00:32:08,And you spend a Saturday evening.
00:32:08,00:32:11,- Okay.
00:32:11,00:32:13,- You spend a Saturday evening in a city centre
00:32:13,00:32:16,"and you go, oh my God, I had no idea."
00:32:16,00:32:18,"- Can I just, yeah."
00:32:18,00:32:23,"- Well, okay, there is research on this,"
00:32:23,00:32:25,which is people around the world were asked
00:32:25,00:32:29,what the worst habit of the British is.
00:32:29,00:32:32,"So people in Brazil, China, Germany, India,"
00:32:32,00:32:33,"and the USA, they were asked what's the worst habit"
00:32:33,00:32:37,"of the British, 27% of young adults said"
00:32:37,00:32:39,is that they drink so much.
00:32:39,00:32:41,But not all of those people--
00:32:41,00:32:43,"- We would never say that in Belgium, we wouldn't know."
00:32:43,00:32:46,"- Not all of those people had visited the UK, actually."
00:32:46,00:32:48,So this was a preconception.
00:32:48,00:32:50,"And of the people who had visited the UK,"
00:32:50,00:32:52,34% of them said--
00:32:52,00:32:54,(laughing)
00:32:54,00:32:56,"- Well, it's amazing."
00:32:56,00:32:59,I was looking at some other stereotypes of the English
00:32:59,00:33:02,"from the 14th century, and sure enough,"
00:33:02,00:33:04,drinking was one of the things that Britain
00:33:04,00:33:06,was most famous for all the way back then.
00:33:06,00:33:09,There was also the stereotype that British people
00:33:09,00:33:12,took excessive faith in the dreams of old women.
00:33:12,00:33:16,- That is so me.
00:33:16,00:33:17,(laughing)
00:33:17,00:33:19,- I was thinking it was maybe Theresa May and Brexit.
00:33:19,00:33:22,(laughing)
00:33:22,00:33:26,And also the Italians and Germans thought
00:33:26,00:33:29,that the British were great lovers of themselves.
00:33:29,00:33:32,(laughing)
00:33:32,00:33:34,- Very nice.
00:33:34,00:33:38,"- Leven, do you think British people are emotionless?"
00:33:38,00:33:41,"Like, reserved, calm?"
00:33:41,00:33:42,- That's what the cliche--
00:33:42,00:33:43,- How dare you!
00:33:43,00:33:45,(laughing)
00:33:45,00:33:47,"- Well, apparently British people"
00:33:47,00:33:49,are not the most emotionless in the world.
00:33:49,00:33:52,"So again, that people have been asked around the world,"
00:33:52,00:33:54,how many emotions did you experience today?
00:33:54,00:33:58,Or did you feel anything today at all?
00:33:58,00:34:00,And Britain was sort of in the middle of nations.
00:34:00,00:34:02,It was not especially interesting.
00:34:02,00:34:04,"So the most emotionless country in the world,"
00:34:04,00:34:05,"according to this survey from Gallup,"
00:34:05,00:34:07,"which is asking people from these countries,"
00:34:07,00:34:09,"is Singapore, right?"
00:34:09,00:34:12,The number of people who reported on any given day
00:34:12,00:34:17,feeling any positive or negative emotions was 36%.
00:34:17,00:34:18,"- Oh, they were literally neutral."
00:34:18,00:34:19,"- And the rest of people said,"
00:34:19,00:34:24,"""No, nothing occurred today in my mood."""
00:34:24,00:34:26,I didn't have any feelings today.
00:34:26,00:34:29,"It sounds rather Swiss to be so neutral, doesn't it?"
00:34:29,00:34:29,"- Yeah, it sounds very Swiss."
00:34:29,00:34:33,- Could that be that their sort of normal level of emotion
00:34:33,00:34:35,"could be, they could be always really happy,"
00:34:35,00:34:37,but they're not getting the highs and the lows?
00:34:37,00:34:38,"- Yeah, possibly."
00:34:38,00:34:39,"Yeah, yeah, that might be it."
00:34:39,00:34:41,"I mean, it's a really strange finding."
00:34:41,00:34:42,- That's amazing.
00:34:42,00:34:43,- Yeah.
00:34:43,00:34:47,- Are we close to where the Flemish live around here?
00:34:47,00:34:49,"- We are in Flanders, yes."
00:34:49,00:34:51,"- Sounds like you're pretty close, James."
00:34:51,00:34:52,"- Yes, yes."
00:34:52,00:34:53,- Not a preconception.
00:34:53,00:34:56,British people know where everything in Europe is.
00:34:56,00:34:59,- Here's a question for you with that in mind.
00:34:59,00:35:03,16th century French scholar Jean Baptiste Le Bleur-Champier
00:35:03,00:35:05,"wrote that whenever you go to see the Flemish,"
00:35:05,00:35:07,you should always carry a knife.
00:35:07,00:35:10,"- Yes, it's to join us for dinner."
00:35:10,00:35:13,That's why you will always be welcomed.
00:35:13,00:35:15,"- Any thoughts, Dan or Andy?"
00:35:15,00:35:17,"Like, you might need, now you've been here for a day."
00:35:17,00:35:19,- Why you might need a knife?
00:35:19,00:35:20,"- Yeah, among the Flemish."
00:35:21,00:35:25,They only have the plastic disposable ones.
00:35:25,00:35:27,And it's very actually hard to cut through your food.
00:35:27,00:35:29,"- In the 16th century, you're right, yeah."
00:35:29,00:35:31,"- Well, 'cause we're staying at Leaven's house"
00:35:31,00:35:33,and his kitchen table.
00:35:33,00:35:35,There were like 16 different peanut butters on it.
00:35:35,00:35:38,And I feel like you need multiple knives.
00:35:38,00:35:40,"- You're pretty much there, Dan, actually."
00:35:40,00:35:43,They had a reputation of consuming the most butter
00:35:43,00:35:45,"in Europe. - Oh, oh."
00:35:45,00:35:47,- And so you should always carry a knife with you
00:35:47,00:35:49,so you can spread the butter wherever you want.
00:35:49,00:35:52,"- That's not a knife, this is a knife,"
00:35:52,00:35:54,"but it is a butter knife, so."
00:35:54,00:35:58,- This guy said that a day not a meal has gone by
00:35:58,00:36:00,without me eating butter.
00:36:00,00:36:03,I'm surprised they have not yet put it in their drink.
00:36:03,00:36:05,- Working on it.
00:36:05,00:36:09,But we also use kind of a knife-shaped thing
00:36:09,00:36:12,to clear the head of a beer.
00:36:12,00:36:15,"So we always have, we always want a bit of foam"
00:36:15,00:36:16,on our beer.
00:36:16,00:36:19,And so the foam is a bit over the glass.
00:36:19,00:36:22,And then we have this knife-like thing to scrape it off.
00:36:22,00:36:23,"For us, it's very normal."
00:36:23,00:36:26,The first time I went to a bar with an Australian
00:36:26,00:36:27,"in Belgium, we went to order a beer"
00:36:27,00:36:30,"and then there's no way, preparations are going,"
00:36:30,00:36:31,and this guy pulls out the knife.
00:36:31,00:36:33,"He was really startled, I tell you what."
00:36:33,00:36:34,- What's it called?
00:36:34,00:36:37,"- I don't know, does it have a name?"
00:36:37,00:36:38,"- No, nobody knows the name."
00:36:38,00:36:40,"- We don't bother with names, we want the beer."
00:36:40,00:36:42,"- Interesting fact, that is actually"
00:36:42,00:36:44,how the French Revolution started.
00:36:44,00:36:47,"It was a simple misunderstanding in a bar,"
00:36:47,00:36:48,which then just escalated.
00:36:48,00:36:50,Just please remove the head from this one.
00:36:50,00:36:52,(laughing)
00:36:52,00:36:55,- Wow.
00:36:55,00:36:58,"- The kitchen knife was, I think,"
00:36:58,00:37:01,invented or put in as a law that you had to use it.
00:37:01,00:37:04,I think it was by Richelieu.
00:37:04,00:37:08,And the number of deaths at the dinner table
00:37:08,00:37:10,dropped down to one-tenth.
00:37:10,00:37:13,Because people use daggers.
00:37:13,00:37:15,You would eat with a dagger and cut your meat with it
00:37:15,00:37:16,and everything.
00:37:16,00:37:17,"And of course, it's a dinner table,"
00:37:17,00:37:20,it's where you have discussions and there's drinking.
00:37:20,00:37:23,"And so, quite often there was a knife fight at the dinner table."
00:37:23,00:37:26,"And so, by simply inventing this kitchen knife,"
00:37:26,00:37:29,"this simple knife that is not sharp,"
00:37:29,00:37:32,he cut down the lethal fights over dinners.
00:37:32,00:37:33,- That's incredible.
00:37:33,00:37:34,"- He did ten or something, yeah."
00:37:34,00:37:37,"- 200,000 people forked to death."
00:37:37,00:37:39,(laughing)
00:37:39,00:37:43,(upbeat music)
00:37:46,00:37:49,"- Okay, I'm gonna move us on to our final fact of the show."
00:37:49,00:37:51,It is time for the final fact.
00:37:51,00:37:52,And that is my fact.
00:37:52,00:37:56,My fact this week is that toilet paper testers
00:37:56,00:37:59,have to train for six months before they are allowed
00:37:59,00:38:02,to apply for the actual job.
00:38:02,00:38:03,(laughing)
00:38:03,00:38:04,"- That is, wow."
00:38:04,00:38:06,"- This is not, 'cause obviously there's multiple"
00:38:06,00:38:08,different companies that hire people
00:38:08,00:38:10,to test out toilet paper for them.
00:38:10,00:38:12,This is very specifically an article I read to do
00:38:12,00:38:15,"with Proctor and Gamble, who do make toilet paper."
00:38:15,00:38:19,"And basically the idea is that you need,"
00:38:19,00:38:20,in order to understand what a perfect bit
00:38:20,00:38:22,"of toilet paper is, as a tester,"
00:38:22,00:38:24,"you need to do, you need all your senses."
00:38:24,00:38:27,"And the article that says outside of literally tasting it,"
00:38:27,00:38:29,you need to know how does it feel in the hand?
00:38:29,00:38:31,"What is it like to wipe, you know,"
00:38:31,00:38:33,"if you've had, you know, a couple of Belgian beers"
00:38:33,00:38:36,"the night before, or what is it like"
00:38:36,00:38:38,if you've had a lot of peanut butter at Leven's house?
00:38:38,00:38:41,"Like, it's gonna be different viscosity of poos each day."
00:38:41,00:38:42,"- Yeah, okay."
00:38:42,00:38:45,"So basically you spend six months doing that,"
00:38:45,00:38:47,"and then when you get to the moment where they're saying,"
00:38:47,00:38:49,"okay, now let's give you the actual test"
00:38:49,00:38:51,"to see if you can get the job, you can fail it."
00:38:51,00:38:53,You can fail it if you haven't prepared for those.
00:38:53,00:38:54,- But how do you fail it?
00:38:54,00:38:55,"Do they, do they, I'm imagining they give you-"
00:38:55,00:38:57,- I'm imagining that your finger goes through.
00:38:57,00:38:58,- No.
00:38:58,00:38:59,- Yeah.
00:38:59,00:39:01,- But I'm imagining that they give you a single sheet
00:39:01,00:39:03,"of toilet paper, and you have to,"
00:39:03,00:39:04,you have to know where it's from.
00:39:04,00:39:06,This is a single origin.
00:39:06,00:39:07,- How many ply?
00:39:07,00:39:07,- Yeah.
00:39:07,00:39:09,- It might be a combination of that stuff.
00:39:09,00:39:11,They're quite secretive in the toilet testing world.
00:39:11,00:39:15,So it's a bit hard to get into the clandestine world
00:39:15,00:39:16,of what's going on in those factories.
00:39:16,00:39:20,But they do say that in that particular moment
00:39:20,00:39:23,"after six months, only half of the people"
00:39:23,00:39:26,will make it through to the job itself.
00:39:26,00:39:29,Can you become a toilet paper sommelier?
00:39:29,00:39:31,(laughing)
00:39:31,00:39:35,"Like you're like, sorry, last night I had steak and red wine."
00:39:35,00:39:37,"Oh, then I recommend this one for you."
00:39:37,00:39:38,"- Oh, yes."
00:39:38,00:39:40,"Yeah, there has to be, right?"
00:39:40,00:39:41,- There must be.
00:39:41,00:39:42,- That doesn't have to be done.
00:39:42,00:39:44,(laughing)
00:39:44,00:39:46,This is just a little bit of whimsy.
00:39:46,00:39:49,"- It feels very, I think if you spent six months"
00:39:49,00:39:51,"of your life and then you fail the audition,"
00:39:51,00:39:52,the least you can do is have at least
00:39:52,00:39:54,three different toilet papers in your house.
00:39:54,00:39:55,"- No, I don't like it."
00:39:55,00:39:56,You hear the boots approaching your stall
00:39:56,00:39:59,and someone's standing outside with the silver dough.
00:39:59,00:40:00,"No, it's not."
00:40:00,00:40:04,- I hear the sound of soft ply going in there.
00:40:04,00:40:05,- They do have a lot of robots as well.
00:40:05,00:40:08,"I mean, I don't know if this is an AI thing too."
00:40:08,00:40:10,"Or maybe it will be soon, but they have a lot of robots"
00:40:10,00:40:12,because they need to test the qualities of the paper.
00:40:12,00:40:14,"They need to test how easily it tears,"
00:40:14,00:40:17,"the angle that it hangs at if it's on a roll, you know?"
00:40:17,00:40:22,"Or, and they have a range of finger probe robots"
00:40:22,00:40:24,to test how sheets break.
00:40:24,00:40:24,- Really?
00:40:24,00:40:28,"- If they're mishandled or they're sort of tore or, yeah."
00:40:28,00:40:30,"- Well, then AI robots have eight fingers."
00:40:30,00:40:31,So that's easy.
00:40:31,00:40:32,(laughing)
00:40:32,00:40:34,"- Actually, do you know if you are in one"
00:40:34,00:40:37,of these facilities how you test a toilet paper
00:40:37,00:40:40,"against a butt, a bottom?"
00:40:40,00:40:43,- So do they have like an AI bum as well?
00:40:43,00:40:44,"- No, it's to do with you."
00:40:44,00:40:46,You're the person who's doing it.
00:40:46,00:40:47,- Me? - Yeah.
00:40:47,00:40:48,So you're in there.
00:40:48,00:40:50,You're given a fake bit of poo
00:40:50,00:40:52,that they have created with NASA.
00:40:52,00:40:56,"So it's 'cause they, today's poo."
00:40:56,00:40:57,Because they don't want to have to.
00:40:57,00:40:59,- Why haven't we been back to the moon?
00:40:59,00:41:00,Wow.
00:41:00,00:41:01,- To boldly go.
00:41:01,00:41:04,- So here's the thing.
00:41:04,00:41:06,If you're working in a factory that's testing toilets
00:41:06,00:41:07,"and testing toilet paper,"
00:41:07,00:41:09,you don't want to have real feces in there
00:41:09,00:41:11,because it can cause lots of disease and so on.
00:41:11,00:41:14,"So they, for years, it used to be dog food"
00:41:14,00:41:16,that they would use to flush down toilets.
00:41:16,00:41:18,Then they created like bean curd and a lot.
00:41:18,00:41:19,"And then there was like a,"
00:41:19,00:41:22,like how KFC and Coke have a secret ingredient.
00:41:22,00:41:24,There was a secret ingredient poo that they would use
00:41:24,00:41:26,that they didn't tell anyone about.
00:41:26,00:41:28,And then they created this thing with NASA.
00:41:28,00:41:32,And so what you would do is you would put your arm tight
00:41:32,00:41:35,so that your elbow would have a little bum bum
00:41:35,00:41:36,basically in the corner.
00:41:36,00:41:38,And you would put the poo in there
00:41:38,00:41:40,and you'd squeeze it out.
00:41:40,00:41:42,And then you would wipe your bum elbow.
00:41:42,00:41:43,- That is very terrible.
00:41:43,00:41:46,- That is the most disgusting thing I've heard all year.
00:41:46,00:41:47,I don't know why.
00:41:47,00:41:50,- I think it was like he said bum bum.
00:41:50,00:41:51,- That was it.
00:41:51,00:41:51,It was bum bum.
00:41:51,00:41:52,I know it's fake poo.
00:41:52,00:41:53,I know it's your elbow.
00:41:53,00:41:54,There's no actual poo involved here.
00:41:54,00:41:55,I'm still revolting.
00:41:55,00:41:57,I feel worse about this than I do about
00:41:57,00:41:59,Steve and his big old balls there.
00:41:59,00:42:05,- How many listeners are going to try this at home?
00:42:05,00:42:06,- Oh no.
00:42:06,00:42:08,- Send your photos to Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:42:08,00:42:09,- Maybe not.
00:42:09,00:42:11,- Podcast@QI.com
00:42:11,00:42:12,- No.
00:42:12,00:42:15,"- Not to give you any ideas,"
00:42:15,00:42:18,but I have 12 kinds of peanut butter at my house.
00:42:18,00:42:21,(all laughing)
00:42:21,00:42:25,"- You know, like it's very trendy to get bamboo toilet paper"
00:42:25,00:42:27,"these days, very environmentally friendly."
00:42:27,00:42:29,"Well, they did a lot of tests recently"
00:42:29,00:42:31,and they found that some products
00:42:31,00:42:34,contain as little as 3% bamboo.
00:42:34,00:42:36,So you think on the packet it says
00:42:36,00:42:38,"this is bamboo toilet paper,"
00:42:38,00:42:41,but actually it's mostly just old paper
00:42:41,00:42:42,and they just put a tiny bit of bamboo in.
00:42:42,00:42:46,This has been a big deal in the toilet paper world recently.
00:42:46,00:42:47,- Yeah.
00:42:47,00:42:50,- I worked out that if you were a panda
00:42:50,00:42:53,"and you wanted to live entirely on these toilet rolls,"
00:42:53,00:42:58,"you would have to eat 7,200 toilet rolls every day"
00:42:58,00:43:01,to get enough bamboo
00:43:01,00:43:03,and that's how many I would use in 50 years.
00:43:03,00:43:05,That's almost a Belgium.
00:43:05,00:43:09,(all laughing)
00:43:09,00:43:10,"During lockdown,"
00:43:10,00:43:13,somebody figured out how to make moonshine alcohol
00:43:13,00:43:14,from toilet paper.
00:43:14,00:43:15,- No. - Why?
00:43:15,00:43:17,"- Yeah, because there's cellulose in it"
00:43:17,00:43:19,and of course we cannot digest cellulose
00:43:19,00:43:24,and I think the yeasts that make the alcohol need sugars.
00:43:24,00:43:26,- That does feel like you're solving one problem
00:43:26,00:43:28,but creating another one.
00:43:28,00:43:29,"- Probably, yeah."
00:43:29,00:43:32,But you can use certain enzymes
00:43:32,00:43:35,that can dissolve the cellulose into sugars
00:43:35,00:43:36,and so he actually did it.
00:43:36,00:43:37,It's on YouTube.
00:43:37,00:43:39,He documented how he did it.
00:43:39,00:43:41,So this might be the reason
00:43:41,00:43:42,why everybody was hurting toilet paper.
00:43:42,00:43:44,(all laughing)
00:43:44,00:43:46,- Don't take my booze away.
00:43:46,00:43:47,- That's so funny.
00:43:47,00:43:50,- We actually looked into the kind of lockdown hoarding
00:43:50,00:43:51,and we thought that actually a lot of it
00:43:51,00:43:54,did kind of make logical sense that you would hoard it
00:43:54,00:43:57,and that's because everyone was suddenly at home
00:43:57,00:43:59,and you weren't in the office anymore
00:43:59,00:44:02,and the factories that make office toilet paper
00:44:02,00:44:05,are different from the ones that make home toilet paper
00:44:05,00:44:07,because the office ones are often
00:44:07,00:44:08,those really big sort of rolls.
00:44:08,00:44:11,So there was actually gonna be a massive shortage
00:44:11,00:44:14,of home toilet paper because no one was in the office anymore
00:44:14,00:44:16,and everyone was going to the toilet at home.
00:44:16,00:44:17,Obviously there were crazy people
00:44:17,00:44:18,just buying loads of them as well.
00:44:18,00:44:21,"- Yeah, yeah, that makes sense."
00:44:21,00:44:24,"Do you know if you go into a toilet paper factory,"
00:44:24,00:44:27,where do we get individual rolls of toilet paper from?
00:44:27,00:44:29,- From the packet?
00:44:29,00:44:30,"- No, before then."
00:44:30,00:44:31,- Is it a long one?
00:44:31,00:44:32,- It's a long one that is cut.
00:44:32,00:44:33,- No.
00:44:33,00:44:34,- From the mother reel.
00:44:34,00:44:35,- Oh.
00:44:35,00:44:37,- It's called the mother reel.
00:44:37,00:44:40,It is a ginormous toilet roll.
00:44:40,00:44:42,- That's amazing.
00:44:42,00:44:43,"- Wait, is it long?"
00:44:43,00:44:44,- Yeah.
00:44:44,00:44:45,- Or is it?
00:44:45,00:44:47,"'Cause you're gesturing, you're saying it's tall."
00:44:47,00:44:48,"- I know, I sort of thought,"
00:44:48,00:44:49,"'cause this is audio for the listener at home,"
00:44:49,00:44:51,it didn't matter what I did with my hand.
00:44:51,00:44:52,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:52,00:44:54,(audience laughing)
00:44:54,00:44:56,"- I'll tell you what, you've had a bad day"
00:44:56,00:44:58,"if the sommelier comes with that, haven't you?"
00:44:58,00:44:59,(audience laughing)
00:44:59,00:45:02,"- So each mother reel, as they call it,"
00:45:02,00:45:05,"contains, when chopped up into individual rolls,"
00:45:05,00:45:07,"25,000 individual rolls."
00:45:07,00:45:08,- What?
00:45:08,00:45:09,"- Right, yeah."
00:45:09,00:45:10,So there's a guy called Greg Wallace.
00:45:10,00:45:12,We've mentioned him on the show before.
00:45:12,00:45:13,He makes a show where he goes around
00:45:13,00:45:16,looking at how they make things in the UK.
00:45:16,00:45:17,It's a documentary series.
00:45:17,00:45:20,"Each show, different factory to show you how it's done."
00:45:20,00:45:22,So he was in a big warehouse
00:45:22,00:45:25,"where they had 2,000 mother rolls in there."
00:45:25,00:45:30,"And they worked out that if you were an average family,"
00:45:30,00:45:33,you would have four toilet rolls a week
00:45:33,00:45:33,in an average family.
00:45:33,00:45:35,"That's how much is used, right?"
00:45:35,00:45:38,So the amount of toilet rolls in that room
00:45:38,00:45:41,would mean that your family could be wiping your bum
00:45:41,00:45:43,"for 96,000 years."
00:45:43,00:45:48,"Just from that collection of 2,000 mother rolls"
00:45:48,00:45:49,that they had sitting in the warehouse.
00:45:49,00:45:53,- Do you know these toilets that squirt water on your bum?
00:45:53,00:45:54,- B-day. - A B-day?
00:45:54,00:45:56,"- No, the toilets as in inside the toilet."
00:45:56,00:45:58,- The Japanese.
00:45:58,00:45:59,"- Well, I was going to ask you."
00:45:59,00:46:00,Do you know where they were invented?
00:46:00,00:46:01,- Japan.
00:46:01,00:46:02,"- No, they weren't."
00:46:02,00:46:05,"- No, no, no."
00:46:05,00:46:06,- They were invented in America.
00:46:06,00:46:07,"- Really? - Yeah, yeah."
00:46:07,00:46:09,They were invented in America
00:46:09,00:46:12,and they were supposed to be for like care homes and stuff.
00:46:12,00:46:13,- Okay.
00:46:13,00:46:15,- And then they sent a few over to Japan
00:46:15,00:46:17,"and this company who got them thought,"
00:46:17,00:46:19,everyone's going to want these.
00:46:19,00:46:21,Let's start making them for everyone.
00:46:21,00:46:22,And so they did.
00:46:22,00:46:24,But the problem was that the ones in America
00:46:24,00:46:25,were kind of prototypy
00:46:25,00:46:29,and they were very good at measuring the temperature
00:46:29,00:46:32,and they were very good at measuring the angle of squirt.
00:46:32,00:46:34,And so they quite often fired boiling water
00:46:34,00:46:36,straight into people's anuses.
00:46:36,00:46:39,- And there was a market for that too.
00:46:39,00:46:40,- Yeah.
00:46:40,00:46:42,- So we were talking about...
00:46:42,00:46:45,- Are you too busy to drink tea the normal way?
00:46:45,00:46:45,Well...
00:46:45,00:46:51,"- That's a couple of English stereotypes together, isn't it?"
00:46:52,00:46:55,"But then, yeah, so then this company called Toto"
00:46:55,00:46:57,decided to start making these.
00:46:57,00:47:00,But we were talking about testing toilet paper and stuff.
00:47:00,00:47:02,They needed to get the angle right.
00:47:02,00:47:05,And so they asked all of their staff members
00:47:05,00:47:06,to test these toilets.
00:47:06,00:47:07,- Okay.
00:47:07,00:47:09,"- And to be honest, it took quite a lot"
00:47:09,00:47:12,"to get people to cooperate, but eventually they did."
00:47:12,00:47:13,- Okay.
00:47:13,00:47:14,- And all the members of staff would take it in turns
00:47:14,00:47:16,to sit on these toilets
00:47:16,00:47:18,and have water fired up at different angles.
00:47:18,00:47:23,And they found that the golden angle is 43 degrees.
00:47:23,00:47:24,- Right.
00:47:24,00:47:25,- So it just cleans you the right amount.
00:47:25,00:47:28,"And for women at the front, it's 53 degrees."
00:47:28,00:47:31,So that's a bit of information you never wanted to know.
00:47:31,00:47:32,"- Yeah, wow."
00:47:32,00:47:36,I've read about the founder of Toto.
00:47:36,00:47:37,"I didn't read any of that,"
00:47:37,00:47:41,but he was an amazing guy called Kazuchika Okura.
00:47:41,00:47:43,"And he sort of had been to the West, I guess."
00:47:43,00:47:48,And he also helped introduce the car to Japan.
00:47:48,00:47:49,- This guy was a big deal.
00:47:49,00:47:50,- Right.
00:47:50,00:47:53,"- And he also created his own new musical instrument,"
00:47:53,00:47:57,"the Okuro Ulo, a kind of vertical flute."
00:47:57,00:47:58,- What?
00:47:58,00:47:59,- A vertical flute.
00:47:59,00:48:00,- A vertical flute.
00:48:00,00:48:01,- A recorder.
00:48:01,00:48:02,- He invented the recorder.
00:48:02,00:48:06,"And he was president of, linking it back to AI,"
00:48:06,00:48:08,the Japanese Go Association.
00:48:08,00:48:09,- Wow.
00:48:09,00:48:10,- Yes.
00:48:10,00:48:11,- That's very cool.
00:48:11,00:48:13,- This guy was a big deal.
00:48:13,00:48:15,"- Well, while we're on inventions,"
00:48:15,00:48:17,"there's a British word, I don't know if you know it here,"
00:48:17,00:48:20,but we often call the toilet the throne.
00:48:20,00:48:24,"So the throne, the toilet,"
00:48:24,00:48:25,it's attributed as an invention
00:48:25,00:48:28,to a guy called Sir John Harrington.
00:48:28,00:48:29,And he built it.
00:48:29,00:48:32,He was the godson of Queen Elizabeth III.
00:48:32,00:48:32,And supposedly--
00:48:32,00:48:34,"- Okay, we've only had two Queen Elizabeths,"
00:48:34,00:48:36,so I'm gonna stop you right there.
00:48:36,00:48:36,- What did I say?
00:48:36,00:48:37,- Queen Elizabeth III.
00:48:37,00:48:41,"- Yeah, so John Harrington invented it in the year 3000."
00:48:41,00:48:43,(laughing)
00:48:43,00:48:44,"No, so sorry."
00:48:44,00:48:46,"Queen Elizabeth I, yeah."
00:48:46,00:48:49,So he invented it for her.
00:48:49,00:48:50,"And it basically, what I'm talking about"
00:48:50,00:48:52,"is a toilet whereby it had valves,"
00:48:52,00:48:55,"it had a flush, and she tried it,"
00:48:55,00:48:57,"and she was like, this is fantastic, I'll take one."
00:48:57,00:48:59,So it was a big deal.
00:48:59,00:49:01,"So he invented the throne,"
00:49:01,00:49:06,"and a descendant of his is Kit Harrington,"
00:49:06,00:49:10,"John Snow, from A Game of Thrones."
