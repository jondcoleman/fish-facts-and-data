00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.880
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.240
 of "No Sex Things as a Fish,"

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.240
 which was recorded at the Nerdland Festival in Belgium.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.640
 This is the thing we do every year

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.320
 we have done for the last few years.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.520
 It's a brilliant festival.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.280
 It's definitely worth checking out for future years.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.280
 It's basically, imagine Disneyland had nerds instead of mice.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.960
 It is, that's what it is really.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.320
 It's loads of talks, it's loads of exhibitions,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.440
 it's science, it's nerd culture,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.360
 it's everything you can want if that is your bag.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.500
 And we always have an amazing time there

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.920
 with a great audience.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.920
 And as usual, we were joined by Leven Skela.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.280
 Anna did not make the journey this time,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.400
 so it is the boys and Leven who did this show.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.640
 And Leven, you will know if you are a regular listener

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.720
 to fish, he may well have the record

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.840
 as most appearances of a non-elf on fish.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.760
 I'd have to look that up,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.880
 but he's been on quite a few times.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.640
 He is an expert on all things nerdy, all things science,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.160
 but at the moment he's really into AI as many nerds are.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.080
 And why that's important is because he has a book

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.640
 about AI, the title is AI.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.000
 It can be found on Amazon and I'm sure in other places.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 But if you search for his name, L-I-E-V-E-N-S-C-H-E-I-R-E,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.520
 Leven Skela, then you will be able

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.440
 to find his book on AI.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.920
 And actually, if you go to levenskela.com,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 then you can see all of his recent AI talks,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.160
 which are very informative and very funny.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.680
 If you struggle with Leven Skela's name,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 then you can also go to www.levingshire.com,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.000
 as in what hobbits do I presume,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.800
 which apparently also works.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.200
 So go to either of those places

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.200
 and you can find out more about Leven and his works on AI.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.480
 Anyway, enjoy the show.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.680
 Like I say, it was really fun, like always.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.600
 And of course, we are doing lots of live shows,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.160
 which will include Anna towards the end of the year.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.040
 So go to www.nosesthingsoffice.com/live

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.280
 to find out more about what remaining tickets there are

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.760
 and there are not many, so get in there fast.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.120
 On with the podcast.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.720
 (upbeat music)

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.240
 (upbeat music)

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.700
 (upbeat music)

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:34.320
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.240
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish,"

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.080
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.160
 from Nerdland in Belgium.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
 (audience cheering)

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.720
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.600
 I am sitting here with James Harkin,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.560
 Andrew Hunter Murray and Leven Skyra.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.160
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.080
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.080
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Leven.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.920
 - My fact is that in 2017,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.480
 the AI computer AlphaZero was given the rules of chess.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.240
 And four hours later,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.480
 it was better than the human world champion in chess.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.200
 - Wow.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.400
 - So it was given just the rules, no strategies,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.840
 no examples of chess games ever played between humans,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.200
 and it started practicing against itself.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.020
 - Did it try any really weird things?

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.440
 - It plays chess in a different way than humans.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.960
 One chess player said, "I've always wondered

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.720
 "if the same game was invented on Mars

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.920
 "and without any interaction between the cultures,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.920
 "we would have developed our own strategies

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.560
 "because everybody learns from the people before them."

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.480
 And he says, "Now I know."

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.000
 Because it takes more risks, for example.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.360
 It will offer its queen sometimes,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.200
 without anyone knowing why, and then it wins in the end.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.680
 So, really. - Wow, yeah.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.720
 Can I just say, Leven, I think part of,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.720
 if one of the main parts of playing chess

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.320
 is being able to pick up the pieces

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.120
 and move them from one place to the other,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.200
 and until it can do that, I think I can beat it.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.040
 - Yeah, well, then you need robotics,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.280
 and some people are afraid of robots,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.040
 and I always tell them, "If at this phase of technology,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.240
 "you're afraid of robots,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.480
 "the only thing you need to carry with you at all times

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.320
 "is a bucket of water, and you're safe."

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.600
 - Well, actually, we were in the green room just now,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.400
 and there was a robotic dog in there.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.160
 - Spot robot from Boston Dynamics, yeah.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.320
 - Yeah, and also, yeah, there was, and also a real dog.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.760
 And I can tell you that real dogs

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.480
 do not like robotic dogs either.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.400
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.360
 - I'm just wondering.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.120
 James, I know you like chess, Leven.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.800
 I'm sure you like chess. - A bit.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.240
 - And I know you know a lot about AI.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.120
 Have you ever played against a man called Martin?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.400
 (laughing)

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.680
 - Probably. - Okay.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.520
 - Who is he?

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.560
 - Martin is a middle-aged Bulgarian man

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.360
 who wears a turtleneck jumper,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.360
 and he is the worst possible opponent on chess.com, right?

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.200
 So he's an AI, he's a computer chess player,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.840
 but he has been programmed to be deliberately,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.800
 unbelievably bad. - That's amazing.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.120
 - He plays 10 million games every week,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.680
 and still he sucks at chess.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.520
 - Really?

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.960
 Does he like call the pawns prongs?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.600
 - Yeah, it does. (laughing)

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.680
 His catchphrase is, "My four-year-old son just beat me.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.720
 "Ouch." (laughing)

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.760
 And he's really, really bad at chess.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.760
 He's done experiments with him to test how bad he is,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.000
 'cause he's programmed to be a weak chess player.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.920
 He has been given 31 queens on one board,

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.000
 and the opponent only has pawns,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.960
 and he has still managed to lose that game.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.120
 - Really? - Wonderful.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.960
 - See, that feels more in check with where I thought

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.280
 we were at.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.000
 The creator of QI, John Lloyd, he always has this line

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.120
 where he says, "Not only have we not invented

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.200
 "artificial intelligence yet, but we haven't even invented

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.040
 "artificial stupidity."

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.360
 Like, that's how far away we are from taking over.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.200
 - I know we have Martin.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.800
 - So that's Martin. - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.720
 - So this robot that we're talking about

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.240
 that beat the record in chess,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.160
 the way that they trained it was they gave it

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.560
 a bunch of games to play, and it had to learn strategy

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.480
 from that, and whoever was the best at learning a game

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.920
 would advance to the next level

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.640
 and train the next AIs together.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.280
 So it didn't just beat chess,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.480
 but it beat multiple Atari games.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.960
 So as part of this program, the AI set a score on Pong.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.960
 The highest score a human has ever set is 56,851.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.800
 It scored 407,864 as part of this programming.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.080
 - Important thing there is that the only input it gets

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.240
 is what is on the screen.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.280
 So of course it's easy to program and use the software

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.600
 of all the positions to have an optimal software running it.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.080
 But this was only fed what a human can see on the screen,

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.000
 and then adapted its own neural network

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.440
 until it could play very well.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.600
 They thought it all the Atari games.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.600
 It was at DeepMind, Google DeepMind in London,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.800
 that's how they did it, all the Atari games,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.800
 and then go the Chinese-Japanese game, Shoki, and chess.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.440
 And so in fact now they can just give it rules of any game,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.680
 and then it will practice against itself

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.200
 and improve until it can beat it.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.600
 - Is there anything that we can win at?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.840
 - Well, especially when it comes to boxing.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.880
 There's one game that we still win,

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.720
 but I don't know how long it will take us.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.240
 It's the game diplomacy.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.080
 - Oh, okay.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.640
 - It's a bit like risk.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.080
 So you have to move around the world and capture areas.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.640
 But there's more tactics.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.680
 You have different kinds of troops.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.120
 But between every round, there's a round of diplomacy

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.920
 where the players can go one-on-one

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.600
 and talk strategies with each other.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.560
 Like if you move like this, then we can attack Italy there.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.720
 Kissinger loved it, apparently.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.240
 Kennedy played the game.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.480
 And so now they have taught an AI to play it.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.960
 It's a bit scary.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.560
 You can see these large language models

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.760
 talking to other players.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.760
 Like if you do that move there,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.320
 then I will come from that way.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.760
 So it figured all of this out.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.120
 It can't win from the world top yet,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.120
 but it ends in top 10 at this moment

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.640
 in the game of diplomacy.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.880
 - I have a feeling that I would be able to beat any AI

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.960
 because I'm so dumb,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.040
 it wouldn't be able to guess the strategy that I was playing.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.000
 It would be like, why has he done that?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.320
 That's probably where it learned to give the Queen away first.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.760
 I'd be like, yep, you can have that.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.840
 Like, I feel like stupidity of human error

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.960
 would be what confuses AI in a game.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.800
 - Cup two, the year 2030.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.520
 The war against the machines has gone terribly badly wrong.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.760
 Step up, Dan.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.800
 - But one man survived it and repopulated the Earth.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.840
 - The one AI that's been built this year,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.680
 this is very exciting, this is a new development this year,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.240
 researchers have built an AI sarcasm detector.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.760
 - Oh yeah, sure they have.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:54.000
 - It was in Holland, it was in Groningen.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.360
 - Yeah, it was in Holland, and they trained it

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.800
 with pieces from the Big Bang Theory and Friends.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.960
 - Oh, really?

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.040
 - Yeah, so it's sitcom sarcasm.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.880
 - Oh, okay.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.280
 - It's if they be any more predictable.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.680
 (laughing)

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.440
 - But I read about it, and there was, you know.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.280
 - What does it do?

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.960
 - Mostly, it can just detect sarcasm.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.440
 It can detect if you're being sarcastic, which is useful.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.080
 But there is a risk that it might start using sarcasm

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.200
 for its own--

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.040
 - Against us?

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.600
 - Evil purposes, yes.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.440
 (laughing)

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.280
 - Yeah.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.120
 - That's amazing.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.320
 Do you think even there's anything that AI won't be able

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.440
 to do in the future?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.120
 - Well, that's a difficult question.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.400
 Basically, you could say AI is a new kind of software

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.080
 that is good at pattern recognition

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.480
 and recognizing patterns and generating patterns,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.920
 like generating images and language.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.040
 But it does it so amazingly well at this point.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.840
 The fact that it can win a game of diplomacy,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.280
 it kind of makes you think with these large language models,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.720
 it's not unthinkable that I ask an AI

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.600
 to buy a new car for me.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.960
 It can do the negotiations much better.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.760
 It's not unthinkable that an AI will sell your house

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.960
 at a better price because it knows what language to use.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.080
 It could be coming.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.200
 And especially when they start combining it with robotics,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.480
 which is what they're doing now,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.160
 then you give the system sensors and a sense of the world.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.560
 And that's what probably the next revolution will be.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.680
 - How interesting.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.720
 In February, 2023, so just over a year ago,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.400
 we asked ChatGBT to give us an episode of Fish.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.240
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.880
 - Let's see if they could do our job.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.720
 And they were pretty terrible, let's be honest.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.760
 Anyway, I asked them to do it again this week

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.120
 with one more year of ability with the ChatBots.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.920
 And they did a pretty good job.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.880
 So it begins with Dan Schreiber says,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.320
 "Hello and welcome to another episode

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.880
 of No Such Things as a Fish, blah, blah, blah,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.720
 weekly podcast, all that stuff."

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.400
 And then in no particular order, here we go.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.080
 James, what have you got for us?

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.800
 And then James Harkins says,

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.080
 "My fact this week is that AlphaGo,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.960
 the AI developed by DeepMind,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.560
 learned to play the game Go at a super human level

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.920
 by playing against itself millions of times."

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.960
 - Oh my God, you're doing the AI's fact,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.200
 is it your main fact here?

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.520
 - No, but Leven's doing it.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.800
 - So Leven didn't know about it.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.040
 It predicted what our fact was going to be.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.320
 - Are you kidding?

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.720
 - Honestly, and literally all I put in was,

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.480
 "Give me a transcript of No Such Things as a Fish."

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.200
 - It's over, let's just go home.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.360
 We just, okay, but some fields, like creative ones,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.880
 surely they're immune.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.800
 - Yeah, surely Andy.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.640
 - Surely.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.720
 - Well, hang on, I'm sorry.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.160
 Are we just gonna let that fly by?

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.400
 Are the exact same fact was predicted by the machine?

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.480
 We're all cool with that?

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.000
 - Dan, I guess, I'm sorry.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.840
 - No.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.680
 - That's the end of the world shit.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.520
 - Dan, it gets worse.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.360
 - It gets worse.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.720
 - There's a new podcast, it's out this year.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.640
 It's hosted by a guy called Jake,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.160
 and it's created by a man called Jacob Redstrom,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.680
 but Jake is AI.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.520
 It's a podcast hosted by an AI.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.360
 - Okay, right?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.200
 - Yeah.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.600
 - Surely Andy, I mean, things like beauty,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.400
 that will never go to AI, will it?

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.240
 - Beauty?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.240
 - Yeah, yeah, that'll always be a human trait.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.080
 - Yeah, of course.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.900
 - Well.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.740
 - Oh no.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.000
 - There has been this year a Miss AI competition.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.840
 - Oh, cool.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.840
 - Where a lot of chat bots/attractive creations online

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.480
 went up against each other to see who was the most attractive.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.840
 And not only did that happen,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.960
 two of the judging panel were also AI-generated models.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.000
 - Wow.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.280
 So the worrying moment will be in that competition

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.160
 when they say, what do you hope for?

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.880
 And they say, I would love world peace

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.160
 if the judge goes sarcasm detective.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.740
 (all laughing)

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.580
 - That's when we're dead.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.580
 - Have you ever asked GPT-4 to write a sonnet?

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.420
 - No.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.340
 - This is, okay, write a sonnet.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.900
 I'm gonna do it live now.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.380
 An animal, what's your favorite animal?

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.460
 - A chinchilla.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.300
 - Yeah, chinchilla.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.300
 - A chinchilla, okay, write a sonnet about a chinchilla,

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.380
 okay, a chinchilla who really wants to fly like an eagle.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.220
 Okay, there we go.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.500
 So a chinchilla is kind of rodent, cute.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.740
 - I'm not totally clear what it is.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.660
 I just said it 'cause James said it, but.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.040
 - Yeah, kind of, I'm gonna press start now.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.520
 So I asked it to write a sonnet about a chinchilla

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.360
 who really wants to fly like an eagle.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.620
 This is just, this is coming out as we speak.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.560
 It's finished now, there we go.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.920
 In twilight's hush, a chinchilla dreams bright.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.220
 With fur as soft as whispers of the breeze.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.460
 He gazes high where eagles take their flight

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.940
 and longs to soar above the tallest trees.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.500
 His heart so bold defies the earthly bind,

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.700
 for in his tiny chest a spirit burns.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.980
 With wings of faith, though not by nature's kind,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.340
 he yearns for heights for skies his soul discerns.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.660
 He climbs the peaks where shadows kiss the light

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.080
 and calls to eagles with a hopeful plea.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.440
 Their feathers brush the heavens free in flight

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.760
 while he on ground remains but longs to be.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.640
 Yet in his quest, a truth begins to rise.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.440
 The flight resides in dreams, not just in skies.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.640
 - That's very good, that's right.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.400
 - I thought it was, it was quite long, was it?

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.240
 But that's sonnets.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.440
 - That's sonnets, the 14 lines.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.820
 - Can we ask for a limerick next time?

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.300
 - A limerick, I'll try.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.380
 - I'm looking for high coups if we do any more.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.340
 Here's the thing, AI has been very big in the news

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.740
 in the movie industry, I would say.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.460
 Well, you know, a lot of the strike that happened in America

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.580
 was off the back of how artists were having to be asked

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.220
 to sign their voices over as well as the writing to AI.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.780
 And a lot of things are coming into place

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.940
 where they're trying to protect the artist's integrity

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.640
 and livelihood and in Tennessee, a law has been passed

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.640
 where they are protecting musicians from AI.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.360
 So the act is called the ensuring likeness voice

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.640
 and imagery security act or the Elvis act

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.600
 because Elvis is from Tennessee

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.920
 and that's happening in places now where they're gonna say

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.400
 you can't use the likeness of the voice anymore

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.080
 'cause it is happening.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.040
 - It happened with the new GPT system that talks

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.060
 and Sam Altman who runs Open AI really wanted

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.540
 the voice of Scarlett Johansson

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.620
 because she was in the movie "Her"

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.180
 and he contacted her a few times and asked for it.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.900
 She thought about it and she said, no, I cannot do it.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.820
 I don't want to relate myself with AI

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.540
 because there's so much criticism of it.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.700
 And then the voice came out

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.700
 and it was almost exactly like Scarlett Johansson.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.060
 They had probably, they say they had found a voice actor

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.940
 who sounded really like her and adjusted it a bit.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.540
 But well, she filed a lawsuit and it's all taken down now.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.780
 But so they're trying to copy the voices of...

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.100
 - Well, James Earl Jones has given over the voice

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.900
 of Darth Vader now to AI based on his voice,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.860
 which is so interesting 'cause that kind of is like

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.280
 the final step in Darth Vader's journey anyway

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.300
 from going human to Android, isn't it?

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.140
 - Yes.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.340
 - Like a real world.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.460
 - He's more machine now, isn't he?

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.740
 - Exactly.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.820
 We need to move on guys.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.000
 - Well, what's Belgium best at, Leven?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.340
 - What is Belgium best at?

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.140
 - It's one of the most proud things that Belgium produces.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.460
 - What I just learned at the theme park science show

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.460
 that we just had, we are world-class

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.580
 in the wheels of roller coasters.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.420
 I didn't know.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.260
 - Okay, that's very cool.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.860
 - And beer and fries.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.660
 - No, no, no, let's hear you roll the coaster fact, Andy.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.500
 - Okay.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.980
 No, an AI has just beaten humans at beer.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.940
 - Drinking or making?

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:26.980
 - Belgian beer.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:27.820
 - Not drinking.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.660
 - Making.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.420
 Coming up with new recipes of Belgian beer.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.380
 They had 250 Belgian beers,

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.580
 a panel of the best beer experts on the planet,

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.500
 rated them on all sorts of metrics,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.100
 rated them on 50 different kinds of flavor

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.180
 and lab analysis,

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.300
 and then an AI algorithm suggested,

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.420
 why didn't you add a bit of this and a bit of that?

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.620
 And it came out tasting better according to the experts.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.460
 - Wow.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.420
 - So this is trouble.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.900
 Today beer, tomorrow.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.020
 - I didn't speak up because I wasn't beer.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.020
 - Tomorrow the roller coaster wheels will be a new shape.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.020
 (audience laughing)

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.600
 (upbeat music)

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.500
 - It is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.660
 - My fact is that crocodiles can cough up hairballs.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.500
 - Ah.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.580
 - This was sent in by Colin Croakshank, thank you Colin.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.660
 This is about, basically, I didn't know this.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.620
 I knew cats produce hairballs and owls and things,

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.060
 but crocodiles, they have the most amazing jaws,

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.360
 they have the most amazing stomachs,

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.860
 they produce amazing acid to digest things.

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.420
 They cannot deal with hair.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.580
 And normally it's not a problem,

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.020
 they don't eat a lot of hair,

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.660
 but occasionally they'll eat a pig,

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.140
 and they end up with a hairball

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.060
 'cause they cannot deal with the pig's hair,

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.400
 or the hooves,

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.900
 and they will just see a crocodile

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.100
 on the banks of the river going (hissing)

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.140
 (audience laughing)

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.140
 - Where are these hairy pigs coming from?

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.140
 (audience laughing)

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.980
 They're bristly, I guess.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.900
 - They're bristly sort of wild ones.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.740
 - Well, that's amazing.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.140
 - I know, they're big.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.540
 They're collectors in Queensland.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.180
 The biggest one is the size of a football.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.740
 Well, that's what's amazing about it as well,

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.780
 'cause it's not like it's just they've had a meal

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.060
 and they want to cough it back up.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.140
 They can store that hairball for like 40 years,

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.540
 so when they cough it up,

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.620
 it can give you an idea of the diet over decades

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.060
 of while they have eaten,

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.700
 so it'll be like hairy pigs, you know,

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.540
 all the other things.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.360
 - That's so cool.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.060
 - Human in some cases, an Australian.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.860
 - Yeah, it is the best option

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.900
 if you see a crocodile coming towards you

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.900
 with its jaws open, that it coughs up a hairball, isn't it?

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.700
 Like, that's what you're hoping for most of the time.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.140
 (laughing)

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.540
 - That's amazing, hairballs.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.940
 - Hairballs, hairballs are good.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.940
 - They used to be thought that they cured poison hairballs.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:33.780
 - Really?

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.180
 - Yeah, these are bazoas, which are, you know,

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.860
 hairballs that would come from animals mostly,

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.660
 but there was a guy called Amboise Pare,

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.780
 friend of the podcast actually,

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.180
 you've mentioned him a few times,

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.380
 and he decided to see if this was true,

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.380
 so he took a cook at the King's Court

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:54.140
 who had been caught stealing fine cutlery,

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.460
 so he'd been sentenced to death for stealing these spoons,

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.620
 and he said, well, what I'm gonna do

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.060
 is I'm gonna let you off,

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.820
 but I'm gonna give you some poison,

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.060
 and then I'll give you this hairball,

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.900
 which we all know this works, so it'll be fine,

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.740
 and then we'll see what happens,

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.140
 and it turned out it didn't work at all,

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.180
 and he died anyway.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.020
 - Oh, wow.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.420
 - But that was the first evidence we had

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.060
 that these hairballs don't cure poisoning.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.860
 - They do, they sound so weird and cool.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.700
 - They're incredible.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.380
 - Like the bazoas, or bazoas, or whatever,

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.220
 don't know how you say them,

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.740
 but they were for the rich, you know,

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.500
 'cause real bees are really rare,

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.740
 and if you couldn't afford one,

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.700
 you could maybe buy a sliver of one,

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.140
 or you could rent one for the day.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:33.980
 If--

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:34.820
 - I don't know what--

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:35.660
 - What for?

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.980
 - I think they were also thought to be useful

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.860
 in times of plague, so maybe if you were visiting--

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.260
 - Magic spells as well.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.460
 - Magic spells. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.340
 - And if you were very wealthy,

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.340
 you might have one for yourself,

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.500
 but one for your friends,

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.860
 you know, if any friends are visiting,

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:47.940
 so that's nice.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.780
 - Have a hairball.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.580
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.020
 No, they're very cool.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.540
 - Lions can get hairballs?

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.380
 - Oh, really?

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.220
 - Yeah, there was one found in an African lion

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.180
 at the Colorado State Zoo,

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.740
 and it was, how big do you think a lion's hairball would be?

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.060
 - The size of a cricket ball.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:06.940
 - Bigger.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.740
 - Okay, two cricket balls.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.660
 (laughing)

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.380
 - Let's go in sizes of animals rather than balls.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.220
 - Melon.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.460
 - Sizes of animals.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.740
 (audience laughing)

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.620
 - The famous animal, the melon.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.180
 - The melon, well, there's a kiwi, so who knows?

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.580
 (laughing)

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.700
 - Lee and Will have come here with the latest research,

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.020
 proving that melons are actually technically.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.060
 - I think it was like, I didn't know what a chila was,

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.220
 and now I'm not sure I know what a melon is.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.340
 (laughing)

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.900
 It was about the same size as a chihuahua dog.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.740
 - Oh, wow.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.180
 - So I like the size of a small dog, yeah.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.020
 - Wow.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:46.220
 - Do you know why chihuahuas were bred in Central America?

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.060
 - Mexico, right?

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.980
 - Yeah.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.580
 They were religious animals,

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.580
 and they were sacrificed to the gods.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.420
 - No.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.260
 - No.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.100
 - It's not much of a sacrifice.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.620
 I've got to say, if I was one of the gods,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.900
 looking down, and they're bringing me this tiny--

00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.780
 - And you were hungry?

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.620
 - I'm hungry.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:01.460
 They're bringing me this tiny--

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.420
 - You wouldn't want a dain.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.260
 - Yeah, I would.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.100
 - A big dog.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.920
 - Yeah.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.760
 - What was the sacrifice like?

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.660
 'Cause if it's burned at the stake, very easy to light.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.500
 That's a--

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.580
 - What?

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.260
 - Well, they're gonna just go right up, aren't they?

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.100
 That's a--

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.660
 - Yeah, that's when they say, "Woof."

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.900
 (laughing)

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.420
 (audience applauding)

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.540
 - So they were sacrificed to the gods,

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.660
 and I love it when I walk in the street,

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.660
 and I see people with a shiwawa to go in,

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.940
 "Oh, sweet dog, what are you gonna ask

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.980
 "from the gods if you sacrifice it?"

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.700
 (laughing)

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.980
 - Well, do you know, this is a tangential story,

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.020
 but there was a thing in the UK,

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.180
 I don't know if you guys in Belgium heard about it here,

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.620
 but there was a, what looked like a giant hairball,

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.260
 was found by a lady.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.980
 But she went, "Oh, it's a hedgehog."

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.900
 And so she brought it home, and she put it into a box,

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.380
 and she gave it a hot water bottle,

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.500
 and some food, then it didn't recover,

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.660
 took it to hospital, and it turned out it was the bubble

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.100
 on the top of a hat that people wear,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.260
 those beanie bubbles.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.140
 - And apparently this happens a lot.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.500
 Zoologists and also vets are saying,

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.660
 "We gotta start understanding what animals look like again,

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.060
 "because we're losing a lot of time

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.300
 "when you're calling us out to help a drowning swan,

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.140
 "and it's a chair leg upside down, we can't do that."

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.740
 Someone brought vets to their house to help them revive

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.100
 what they thought was a hedgehog,

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.300
 but turned out to be a fruit loaf.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.180
 Now, a fruit loaf doesn't look like a hedgehog,

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.660
 but apparently it had been pecked at by a lot of birds

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.540
 so that it looked very spiky.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.980
 And even then they were like, "Oh my God, it's dying!"

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.820
 And they pulled out people to come.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.980
 So this is a big thing at the moment.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:35.900
 - That is amazing.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.220
 - Sounds like cheap tamagochis in a way.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.060
 - Yeah.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.980
 - Just take cotton balls home and care for them.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.740
 - Or like chia pets, remember those?

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.580
 - No.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.420
 - Chia pet.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.100
 - The pottery that grows.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:46.940
 - No one?

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.780
 (laughing)

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.340
 - No one's seen Wayne's World?

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.060
 - Imagine the size of a room like this

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.300
 and you're the only one who gets that reference.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.100
 - Yeah, that was a pretty special moment.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.260
 - That's like me playing a move to AI.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.940
 And then it's like, "What was that?"

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.860
 - Do you want to know the record

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.340
 for the largest ball of hair ever created?

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.220
 - Okay, so this is not an accidental in your stomach thing.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.300
 - This is not an animal product.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.300
 - This is someone with a weird fetish.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.660
 - I would not, I would not disagree.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.620
 (laughing)

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.760
 - But for legal reasons.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.460
 - It's, well, it was created by a hairstylist

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.500
 from the USA called Steve.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.760
 And he said, "I got more spiritual as I've aged

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.260
 "and I wanted to leave some kind of legacy when I'm gone.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.740
 "And it hit me, I'm going to build a giant hairball."

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.780
 And he made a hole in the wall in his hair salon

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.620
 like a, and he put a slide down

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.180
 to the basement of the building.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.020
 - Oh my God.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.860
 - And every time he had hair,

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.700
 he'd just shove it down the slide.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.540
 And then he glued it all together.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.680
 So how big was it?

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.740
 - Oh, so it's the biggest ever, so it must be quite big.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.580
 - It's quite big.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.980
 - Shall I go by the size of an animal?

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:55.820
 - Yes, please.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.380
 - Okay, large horse.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.540
 - Oh, not far off, actually.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.940
 - A bison.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.260
 - Smaller than a bison.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.860
 - Wow, what is that difference?

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.700
 I can't even, what's an in-between animal to that?

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.860
 - Look, I don't know what animals are, it turns out.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.380
 I don't know what animals are or look like.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.020
 - I actually saw this and I thought it looked

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.060
 like a really, really big hedgehog.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.860
 - Yeah, it was that, it was a bit, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.980
 - It was actually a fruitcake.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.300
 (laughing)

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.940
 - It weighed 102 kilos, 225 pounds.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:28.740
 It is disgusting, it is so, is horrible.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:29.580
 - How big is that, Andy?

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.580
 I can't actually picture that.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.420
 Genuinely, can't.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.580
 - It was, I mean, it was on a wagon when I saw it, so.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.020
 - Like a large-ish man would be about 100 kilos.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:37.860
 - Okay.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.860
 - Yeah, and it's maybe eight feet high,

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.420
 'cause it's made of hair, it's not very dense,

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.660
 and it's half-glued.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.420
 Anyway, you can go and visit it now

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.420
 and add your own hair, if you too have got more spiritual

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.660
 and you want to leave a legacy behind, yeah.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.780
 - All right, do you know a cat coughing up hairballs

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.460
 is responsible for one of the great voices

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.220
 of nerd culture?

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.980
 (dog barking)

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.900
 - That one.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.340
 - That's a duck.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.180
 - Yep.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.220
 (dog barking)

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.300
 - Duffy duck, yeah, Jen does a better duck duck.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.020
 - Still a duck, yeah.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.700
 - But that's a nerdy--

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.300
 - Is it like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park?

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:20.180
 - No, so it inspired the voice of something

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.020
 that's very big in the dork-nerd world.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.540
 - So what does it sound like a good cat coughing up hair?

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.380
 - Oh.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.220
 - Gollum.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.060
 - Gollum.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:29.900
 - Really?

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.900
 - Andy Serkis, when he was going to the audition

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.980
 of Lord of the Rings, was going,

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.700
 "How am I going to portray Gollum in my audition?"

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.300
 And his cat was next, so I'm going,

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.220
 (dog barking)

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.180
 - What a disgusting hairball Gollum would produce.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.260
 That would be awful.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.700
 - That's the whole time, that's all it is.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.340
 It's just got that in its throat.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.780
 Interestingly though, cats,

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.180
 when we think of them coughing up a hairball,

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.900
 according to vets, they get pissed off

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.260
 when you say coughed up a hairball.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.180
 They don't cough up a hairball.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.780
 They vomit up a hairball.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.620
 - Oh.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.900
 - Or they're really kind of just trying to thrust it out,

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:00.740
 but they're not coughing.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.580
 It's not a--

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.400
 - It doesn't matter, whatever it is,

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.740
 Steve will take it and he will glue it onto his big ball.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.580
 Do you know we've just missed

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.620
 National Hairball Awareness Day?

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.460
 - Oh, God.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.280
 - Yeah.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.120
 - By how long?

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.900
 - Anyone else observe it?

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:13.740
 - That's terrible.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.460
 It is bad when you're the only one, yeah.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.260
 (audience laughing)

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.140
 - How long Andy, since it was--

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.860
 - It was, it's the last Friday in April.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.300
 So it's an annual thing.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.700
 - Do you know the date, the specific date?

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.940
 - Well, it's the last Friday in April.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.940
 So like Easter, it moves.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.220
 - I don't know.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.100
 - Which is convenient,

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.220
 'cause what if it's at the weekend

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.660
 and not enough people come and celebrate?

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.500
 - Yeah, good.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.580
 And what did you do to celebrate?

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.940
 - Well, you know, just pop 'em visit Steve

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.120
 at this great big ball.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.260
 (audience laughing)

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.540
 - You know, it was founded by a vet

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.140
 who wanted to raise awareness of--

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:45.980
 - And what's--

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:46.820
 - Of hairballs.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.640
 - Oh, okay.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.300
 - I mean, I guess they can be bad for a cat's health, maybe?

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.940
 - Yeah, yeah, it makes them sick.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.900
 If your cat is coughing up a hairball,

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.500
 it is a sign of bigger issues,

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.980
 gutturally, that is going on.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:58.820
 - Really, really?

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.700
 'Cause theoretically it should be able to process

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.100
 the bit of hair that it eats.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.340
 - Yeah, so that's been building up inside of them in ways.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.180
 We're gonna have to move on,

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.020
 so I can do this.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.460
 - Oh, should we do a bit on crocodiles or not?

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.300
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.140
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.580
 - If you give someone a crocodile to hold

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.180
 when they're in the casino, they'll make bigger bets.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.140
 (audience laughing)

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.620
 - What size of crocodile?

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.980
 I mean, like, as big as a chinchilla

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.180
 or as big as a melon?

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.260
 - I think it's the bigger the crocodile,

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.940
 the bigger the bets.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.620
 So it's like, apparently, it's a sense of height

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.620
 and the rousal makes you want to gamble more.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:33.620
 - Oh.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.940
 And if you think the crocodile might eat you,

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.140
 that puts you in that state.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.020
 - You're aroused, but not in the way you're thinking.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:39.860
 - No, no, no.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.140
 I'm not thinking anything at all.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.220
 I'm just thinking, how do I get rid of this crocodile?

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.900
 If I win another $50,000,

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.460
 maybe I'll get someone to hold the crocodile

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.700
 and take it away from me.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.860
 Yeah, that's my plan.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.660
 - Do you know that sometimes in the States,

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.260
 you have frozen lakes with crocodile snouts

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.180
 peeping out of the ice.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.140
 - Oh, really?

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.660
 - It's when crocodiles hibernate

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.140
 and there's an ice layer on the lake.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.580
 They just pop out their nose.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.340
 So it looks like little green pebbles on the ice.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.380
 And it's actually, when you pull the pebble,

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.300
 it's attached to a crocodile.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.860
 And they're completely hibernating.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.340
 So they're in standby mode as they don't react

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.180
 if you wiggle with the snout.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.380
 - That's a good prank, though.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.220
 - Yeah.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.220
 - So let's see who can pick up that pebble first.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.940
 (all laughing)

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.940
 - Actually, the word crocodile means pebble worm.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.780
 - Really?

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.420
 - Yeah, the croco is the pebble

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.580
 and dailos is the worm.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.100
 But in Greek, delios also means circumcised man.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.940
 - Right.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:40.420
 - It could be that crocodile means pebble circumcised man.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.380
 - Okay.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.220
 - Not sure.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.340
 - Either way, how misleading if someone says,

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.260
 can you go and collect the pebble circumcised man

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.620
 over there and you come to a crocodile?

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.300
 That is, yeah, that's bad naming, I would say.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.880
 (upbeat music)

00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:01.980
 All right, it is time for fact number three.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.540
 And that is James.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.900
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in the 14th century,

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.460
 there was a rumour among Europeans

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.180
 that all Englishmen had tails.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.500
 (audience laughing)

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.460
 - Now is the time to prove otherwise.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.340
 (all laughing)

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.820
 - And I've basically come here to see if it's still a rumour.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.140
 - Oh, yeah.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.340
 - Is this still a thing that people in Belgium think

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.940
 that English people have tails?

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.660
 (audience laughing)

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.500
 Wow.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.940
 - Oh, there we go.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.700
 - So this idea basically comes from the idea

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.620
 that St. Augustine had visited the people of Kent

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.740
 and he was mocked by the locals

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.860
 and they pinned tails of fish to his robes

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.020
 to kind of kick him out of the town.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.900
 And he turned round and he cursed them with their own tails.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.460
 And this became a thing in Europe.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:58.100
 So it's the extent that when there was a siege in 1436

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.460
 in Paris and the English were kicked out,

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.300
 they were taunted by the locals saying,

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.860
 were your tails, were your tails?

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.700
 And the Scottish, before a battle in 1332,

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.380
 said they would make ropes from the tails of the English

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.980
 to tie them with.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.820
 - Oh.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.220
 - They thought we were basically more close to Beast Hut,

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.780
 more close to the devil.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.580
 It was said the English were.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.140
 And there is a thing in French where the word for tail,

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.260
 which is coupé, and the word for hatch,

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.900
 which is coupé apparently, I don't speak French,

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.380
 but they're so close together,

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.220
 they had a theory that English people sat on eggs

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.420
 to hatch them.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.500
 - Oh.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.060
 - So yeah, that was how we got our eggs.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:36.900
 We all sat on them.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:37.740
 - I think we're getting off quite lightly now

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.460
 with just you've all got bad teeth as a reputation.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.900
 That is quite, you know, that's better.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.220
 And by the way, we don't all have bad teeth, just to say,

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.940
 almost all of us have some teeth.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.460
 So I just want to say.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:54.340
 - We have the best teeth ever, ever seen.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.220
 - So do you, do you have in Belgium then,

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.060
 are there any things that if you were talking

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.660
 about an English person, you would say a certain thing?

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.020
 Like I was just suddenly remembered that Michael Palin,

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.620
 when he went out to the Amazon,

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.740
 they were describing to him how many trees

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.300
 are chopped down per day.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:13.300
 They would say a Belgium, and it was the size of Belgium.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.900
 So that would be a unit of measurement out in the Amazon

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.620
 for saying how much was chopped down.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.100
 - One Belgium of trees was chopped down again.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.260
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.100
 - Yeah.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.260
 - Do you have anything here where it's like,

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.780
 oh, you English people.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.780
 - We chopped down one England of trees.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.900
 - No, no, no, no, no.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.660
 - Just like we smell or we suck or you know,

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.500
 that kind of thing.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.820
 - No, no, no, not really.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.140
 - By the way, Dan's just saying this

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.460
 'cause he's not English.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.300
 (laughing)

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.740
 - Dan is Australian and he wants to get in on this bullying.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.220
 - Well, you know, when you're a child,

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:45.420
 you read comic books and like Asterix going to England

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.220
 and then you have all these, oh really, oh dear.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.940
 And they're all very, ooh, polite.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.780
 - What, polite?

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.980
 - Cutting the grass, really upperclass.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.620
 - You're describing Andy, you're just, yeah.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:00.340
 - But you get this upperclass image of what England is.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.140
 And then you go there as a tourist.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.900
 (laughing)

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.720
 And you spend a Saturday evening.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.060
 - Okay.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.460
 - You spend a Saturday evening in a city centre

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.780
 and you go, oh my God, I had no idea.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.380
 - Can I just, yeah.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:23.380
 - Well, okay, there is research on this,

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.820
 which is people around the world were asked

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.700
 what the worst habit of the British is.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.100
 So people in Brazil, China, Germany, India,

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.820
 and the USA, they were asked what's the worst habit

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:37.100
 of the British, 27% of young adults said

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.820
 is that they drink so much.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.340
 But not all of those people--

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.420
 - We would never say that in Belgium, we wouldn't know.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.740
 - Not all of those people had visited the UK, actually.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.060
 So this was a preconception.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.700
 And of the people who had visited the UK,

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.220
 34% of them said--

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.460
 (laughing)

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.260
 - Well, it's amazing.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.500
 I was looking at some other stereotypes of the English

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.020
 from the 14th century, and sure enough,

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.300
 drinking was one of the things that Britain

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.380
 was most famous for all the way back then.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.540
 There was also the stereotype that British people

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.660
 took excessive faith in the dreams of old women.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:16.260
 - That is so me.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.460
 (laughing)

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.900
 - I was thinking it was maybe Theresa May and Brexit.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.660
 (laughing)

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:26.020
 And also the Italians and Germans thought

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.900
 that the British were great lovers of themselves.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.140
 (laughing)

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.540
 - Very nice.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.340
 - Leven, do you think British people are emotionless?

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.100
 Like, reserved, calm?

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.740
 - That's what the cliche--

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.740
 - How dare you!

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.500
 (laughing)

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.260
 - Well, apparently British people

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.100
 are not the most emotionless in the world.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.140
 So again, that people have been asked around the world,

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.580
 how many emotions did you experience today?

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.500
 Or did you feel anything today at all?

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.620
 And Britain was sort of in the middle of nations.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.540
 It was not especially interesting.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.300
 So the most emotionless country in the world,

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.660
 according to this survey from Gallup,

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.580
 which is asking people from these countries,

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.620
 is Singapore, right?

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.100
 The number of people who reported on any given day

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:17.100
 feeling any positive or negative emotions was 36%.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.900
 - Oh, they were literally neutral.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.740
 - And the rest of people said,

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:24.100
 "No, nothing occurred today in my mood."

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.540
 I didn't have any feelings today.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.060
 It sounds rather Swiss to be so neutral, doesn't it?

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:29.900
 - Yeah, it sounds very Swiss.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.660
 - Could that be that their sort of normal level of emotion

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.540
 could be, they could be always really happy,

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.820
 but they're not getting the highs and the lows?

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.860
 - Yeah, possibly.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:39.980
 Yeah, yeah, that might be it.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.620
 I mean, it's a really strange finding.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.460
 - That's amazing.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.420
 - Yeah.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:47.340
 - Are we close to where the Flemish live around here?

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.460
 - We are in Flanders, yes.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.060
 - Sounds like you're pretty close, James.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.460
 - Yes, yes.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.300
 - Not a preconception.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.500
 British people know where everything in Europe is.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.060
 - Here's a question for you with that in mind.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:03.540
 16th century French scholar Jean Baptiste Le Bleur-Champier

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.700
 wrote that whenever you go to see the Flemish,

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.340
 you should always carry a knife.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.740
 - Yes, it's to join us for dinner.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.820
 That's why you will always be welcomed.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.620
 - Any thoughts, Dan or Andy?

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.900
 Like, you might need, now you've been here for a day.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.340
 - Why you might need a knife?

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.980
 - Yeah, among the Flemish.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.740
 They only have the plastic disposable ones.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.740
 And it's very actually hard to cut through your food.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.700
 - In the 16th century, you're right, yeah.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.580
 - Well, 'cause we're staying at Leaven's house

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.460
 and his kitchen table.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.980
 There were like 16 different peanut butters on it.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.660
 And I feel like you need multiple knives.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.820
 - You're pretty much there, Dan, actually.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.740
 They had a reputation of consuming the most butter

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.460
 in Europe. - Oh, oh.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.580
 - And so you should always carry a knife with you

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.540
 so you can spread the butter wherever you want.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.180
 - That's not a knife, this is a knife,

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.220
 but it is a butter knife, so.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:58.300
 - This guy said that a day not a meal has gone by

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.220
 without me eating butter.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.100
 I'm surprised they have not yet put it in their drink.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.380
 - Working on it.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.740
 But we also use kind of a knife-shaped thing

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.420
 to clear the head of a beer.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.740
 So we always have, we always want a bit of foam

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.980
 on our beer.

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.420
 And so the foam is a bit over the glass.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.300
 And then we have this knife-like thing to scrape it off.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.620
 For us, it's very normal.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.140
 The first time I went to a bar with an Australian

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.700
 in Belgium, we went to order a beer

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.180
 and then there's no way, preparations are going,

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.420
 and this guy pulls out the knife.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.340
 He was really startled, I tell you what.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.460
 - What's it called?

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.100
 - I don't know, does it have a name?

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.620
 - No, nobody knows the name.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.900
 - We don't bother with names, we want the beer.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.780
 - Interesting fact, that is actually

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.580
 how the French Revolution started.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.300
 It was a simple misunderstanding in a bar,

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.540
 which then just escalated.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.500
 Just please remove the head from this one.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.740
 (laughing)

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.580
 - Wow.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.180
 - The kitchen knife was, I think,

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.780
 invented or put in as a law that you had to use it.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.020
 I think it was by Richelieu.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:08.180
 And the number of deaths at the dinner table

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.500
 dropped down to one-tenth.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.020
 Because people use daggers.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.660
 You would eat with a dagger and cut your meat with it

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.500
 and everything.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.660
 And of course, it's a dinner table,

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.340
 it's where you have discussions and there's drinking.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.780
 And so, quite often there was a knife fight at the dinner table.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.940
 And so, by simply inventing this kitchen knife,

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.300
 this simple knife that is not sharp,

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.820
 he cut down the lethal fights over dinners.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.660
 - That's incredible.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.980
 - He did ten or something, yeah.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.620
 - 200,000 people forked to death.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.860
 (laughing)

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.440
 (upbeat music)

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.140
 - Okay, I'm gonna move us on to our final fact of the show.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.060
 It is time for the final fact.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.560
 And that is my fact.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.300
 My fact this week is that toilet paper testers

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.820
 have to train for six months before they are allowed

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.380
 to apply for the actual job.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.380
 (laughing)

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.820
 - That is, wow.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.780
 - This is not, 'cause obviously there's multiple

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.740
 different companies that hire people

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.660
 to test out toilet paper for them.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.660
 This is very specifically an article I read to do

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.540
 with Proctor and Gamble, who do make toilet paper.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.180
 And basically the idea is that you need,

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.980
 in order to understand what a perfect bit

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.980
 of toilet paper is, as a tester,

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.860
 you need to do, you need all your senses.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.060
 And the article that says outside of literally tasting it,

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.620
 you need to know how does it feel in the hand?

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.340
 What is it like to wipe, you know,

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.740
 if you've had, you know, a couple of Belgian beers

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.020
 the night before, or what is it like

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.300
 if you've had a lot of peanut butter at Leven's house?

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.580
 Like, it's gonna be different viscosity of poos each day.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.420
 - Yeah, okay.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.620
 So basically you spend six months doing that,

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.540
 and then when you get to the moment where they're saying,

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.460
 okay, now let's give you the actual test

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.540
 to see if you can get the job, you can fail it.

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.500
 You can fail it if you haven't prepared for those.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.460
 - But how do you fail it?

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.860
 Do they, do they, I'm imagining they give you-

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.860
 - I'm imagining that your finger goes through.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.700
 - No.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.540
 - Yeah.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.140
 - But I'm imagining that they give you a single sheet

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.100
 of toilet paper, and you have to,

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.740
 you have to know where it's from.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.260
 This is a single origin.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.100
 - How many ply?

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:07.940
 - Yeah.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.620
 - It might be a combination of that stuff.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.940
 They're quite secretive in the toilet testing world.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.300
 So it's a bit hard to get into the clandestine world

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.740
 of what's going on in those factories.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:20.540
 But they do say that in that particular moment

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.380
 after six months, only half of the people

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.620
 will make it through to the job itself.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.860
 Can you become a toilet paper sommelier?

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.180
 (laughing)

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.020
 Like you're like, sorry, last night I had steak and red wine.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.340
 Oh, then I recommend this one for you.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.580
 - Oh, yes.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.260
 Yeah, there has to be, right?

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.100
 - There must be.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.660
 - That doesn't have to be done.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.260
 (laughing)

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.260
 This is just a little bit of whimsy.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.260
 - It feels very, I think if you spent six months

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.260
 of your life and then you fail the audition,

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.860
 the least you can do is have at least

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.500
 three different toilet papers in your house.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.340
 - No, I don't like it.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.740
 You hear the boots approaching your stall

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.460
 and someone's standing outside with the silver dough.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.780
 No, it's not.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:04.380
 - I hear the sound of soft ply going in there.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.940
 - They do have a lot of robots as well.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.300
 I mean, I don't know if this is an AI thing too.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.020
 Or maybe it will be soon, but they have a lot of robots

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.620
 because they need to test the qualities of the paper.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.460
 They need to test how easily it tears,

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.700
 the angle that it hangs at if it's on a roll, you know?

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:22.340
 Or, and they have a range of finger probe robots

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.060
 to test how sheets break.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:24.900
 - Really?

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:28.700
 - If they're mishandled or they're sort of tore or, yeah.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.620
 - Well, then AI robots have eight fingers.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.460
 So that's easy.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.900
 (laughing)

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.300
 - Actually, do you know if you are in one

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.300
 of these facilities how you test a toilet paper

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.540
 against a butt, a bottom?

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.140
 - So do they have like an AI bum as well?

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.620
 - No, it's to do with you.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.220
 You're the person who's doing it.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.260
 - Me? - Yeah.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.380
 So you're in there.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.540
 You're given a fake bit of poo

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.860
 that they have created with NASA.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.100
 So it's 'cause they, today's poo.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.700
 Because they don't want to have to.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.860
 - Why haven't we been back to the moon?

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.700
 Wow.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.780
 - To boldly go.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.380
 - So here's the thing.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.660
 If you're working in a factory that's testing toilets

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.700
 and testing toilet paper,

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.260
 you don't want to have real feces in there

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.620
 because it can cause lots of disease and so on.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.540
 So they, for years, it used to be dog food

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.380
 that they would use to flush down toilets.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.740
 Then they created like bean curd and a lot.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.780
 And then there was like a,

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.060
 like how KFC and Coke have a secret ingredient.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.540
 There was a secret ingredient poo that they would use

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.020
 that they didn't tell anyone about.

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.700
 And then they created this thing with NASA.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:32.980
 And so what you would do is you would put your arm tight

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.580
 so that your elbow would have a little bum bum

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.820
 basically in the corner.

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.140
 And you would put the poo in there

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.300
 and you'd squeeze it out.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.340
 And then you would wipe your bum elbow.

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.680
 - That is very terrible.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.820
 - That is the most disgusting thing I've heard all year.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:47.860
 I don't know why.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.220
 - I think it was like he said bum bum.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.060
 - That was it.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:51.900
 It was bum bum.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.720
 I know it's fake poo.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.560
 I know it's your elbow.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.660
 There's no actual poo involved here.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.860
 I'm still revolting.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.380
 I feel worse about this than I do about

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.100
 Steve and his big old balls there.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:05.100
 - How many listeners are going to try this at home?

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.460
 - Oh no.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.780
 - Send your photos to Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:09.620
 - Maybe not.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.460
 - Podcast@QI.com

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.300
 - No.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.860
 - Not to give you any ideas,

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.720
 but I have 12 kinds of peanut butter at my house.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.780
 (all laughing)

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:25.020
 - You know, like it's very trendy to get bamboo toilet paper

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.420
 these days, very environmentally friendly.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.860
 Well, they did a lot of tests recently

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.740
 and they found that some products

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.500
 contain as little as 3% bamboo.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.900
 So you think on the packet it says

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.180
 this is bamboo toilet paper,

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.020
 but actually it's mostly just old paper

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.980
 and they just put a tiny bit of bamboo in.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.300
 This has been a big deal in the toilet paper world recently.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.780
 - Yeah.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.300
 - I worked out that if you were a panda

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.620
 and you wanted to live entirely on these toilet rolls,

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:58.500
 you would have to eat 7,200 toilet rolls every day

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.020
 to get enough bamboo

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.700
 and that's how many I would use in 50 years.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.660
 That's almost a Belgium.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:09.060
 (all laughing)

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.180
 During lockdown,

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.420
 somebody figured out how to make moonshine alcohol

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.420
 from toilet paper.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.740
 - No. - Why?

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.780
 - Yeah, because there's cellulose in it

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.820
 and of course we cannot digest cellulose

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.300
 and I think the yeasts that make the alcohol need sugars.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.260
 - That does feel like you're solving one problem

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.060
 but creating another one.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.260
 - Probably, yeah.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.580
 But you can use certain enzymes

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:35.500
 that can dissolve the cellulose into sugars

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:36.780
 and so he actually did it.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.620
 It's on YouTube.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.700
 He documented how he did it.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.100
 So this might be the reason

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.980
 why everybody was hurting toilet paper.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.060
 (all laughing)

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.220
 - Don't take my booze away.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.220
 - That's so funny.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.420
 - We actually looked into the kind of lockdown hoarding

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.900
 and we thought that actually a lot of it

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.700
 did kind of make logical sense that you would hoard it

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.260
 and that's because everyone was suddenly at home

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.340
 and you weren't in the office anymore

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.380
 and the factories that make office toilet paper

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.660
 are different from the ones that make home toilet paper

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:07.020
 because the office ones are often

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.860
 those really big sort of rolls.

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.540
 So there was actually gonna be a massive shortage

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.140
 of home toilet paper because no one was in the office anymore

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.100
 and everyone was going to the toilet at home.

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.540
 Obviously there were crazy people

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:18.820
 just buying loads of them as well.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.180
 - Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.260
 Do you know if you go into a toilet paper factory,

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.860
 where do we get individual rolls of toilet paper from?

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.140
 - From the packet?

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.260
 - No, before then.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.580
 - Is it a long one?

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.980
 - It's a long one that is cut.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:33.820
 - No.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.980
 - From the mother reel.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.820
 - Oh.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.340
 - It's called the mother reel.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.940
 It is a ginormous toilet roll.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.180
 - That's amazing.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.780
 - Wait, is it long?

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:44.620
 - Yeah.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.460
 - Or is it?

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.460
 'Cause you're gesturing, you're saying it's tall.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.460
 - I know, I sort of thought,

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.940
 'cause this is audio for the listener at home,

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.100
 it didn't matter what I did with my hand.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.420
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:54.820
 (audience laughing)

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.300
 - I'll tell you what, you've had a bad day

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.380
 if the sommelier comes with that, haven't you?

00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.580
 (audience laughing)

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.780
 - So each mother reel, as they call it,

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.580
 contains, when chopped up into individual rolls,

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.940
 25,000 individual rolls.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:08.780
 - What?

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:09.620
 - Right, yeah.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:10.700
 So there's a guy called Greg Wallace.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.020
 We've mentioned him on the show before.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.940
 He makes a show where he goes around

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:16.020
 looking at how they make things in the UK.

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.620
 It's a documentary series.

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.220
 Each show, different factory to show you how it's done.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.740
 So he was in a big warehouse

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.820
 where they had 2,000 mother rolls in there.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:30.260
 And they worked out that if you were an average family,

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.020
 you would have four toilet rolls a week

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:33.980
 in an average family.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.460
 That's how much is used, right?

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.700
 So the amount of toilet rolls in that room

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.700
 would mean that your family could be wiping your bum

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.740
 for 96,000 years.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:48.020
 Just from that collection of 2,000 mother rolls

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.780
 that they had sitting in the warehouse.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.380
 - Do you know these toilets that squirt water on your bum?

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.860
 - B-day. - A B-day?

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.900
 - No, the toilets as in inside the toilet.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.100
 - The Japanese.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.260
 - Well, I was going to ask you.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.620
 Do you know where they were invented?

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:01.460
 - Japan.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:02.300
 - No, they weren't.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.300
 - No, no, no.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.820
 - They were invented in America.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:07.780
 - Really? - Yeah, yeah.

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.100
 They were invented in America

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.220
 and they were supposed to be for like care homes and stuff.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.060
 - Okay.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.100
 - And then they sent a few over to Japan

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.260
 and this company who got them thought,

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.060
 everyone's going to want these.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.060
 Let's start making them for everyone.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.220
 And so they did.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.060
 But the problem was that the ones in America

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.860
 were kind of prototypy

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.500
 and they were very good at measuring the temperature

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.540
 and they were very good at measuring the angle of squirt.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.900
 And so they quite often fired boiling water

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.540
 straight into people's anuses.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.740
 - And there was a market for that too.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:40.580
 - Yeah.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.660
 - So we were talking about...

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.060
 - Are you too busy to drink tea the normal way?

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:45.900
 Well...

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:51.580
 - That's a couple of English stereotypes together, isn't it?

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.820
 But then, yeah, so then this company called Toto

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.940
 decided to start making these.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.900
 But we were talking about testing toilet paper and stuff.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.780
 They needed to get the angle right.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:05.300
 And so they asked all of their staff members

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:06.860
 to test these toilets.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:07.700
 - Okay.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.580
 - And to be honest, it took quite a lot

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.340
 to get people to cooperate, but eventually they did.

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.180
 - Okay.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.740
 - And all the members of staff would take it in turns

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.020
 to sit on these toilets

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.940
 and have water fired up at different angles.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:23.180
 And they found that the golden angle is 43 degrees.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.020
 - Right.

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:25.340
 - So it just cleans you the right amount.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:28.460
 And for women at the front, it's 53 degrees.

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.980
 So that's a bit of information you never wanted to know.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:32.820
 - Yeah, wow.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:36.380
 I've read about the founder of Toto.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.740
 I didn't read any of that,

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:41.060
 but he was an amazing guy called Kazuchika Okura.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.900
 And he sort of had been to the West, I guess.

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:48.260
 And he also helped introduce the car to Japan.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.580
 - This guy was a big deal.

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.420
 - Right.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:53.780
 - And he also created his own new musical instrument,

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:57.820
 the Okuro Ulo, a kind of vertical flute.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:58.660
 - What?

00:47:58.660 --> 00:47:59.820
 - A vertical flute.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:00.660
 - A vertical flute.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:01.580
 - A recorder.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.740
 - He invented the recorder.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.780
 And he was president of, linking it back to AI,

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.860
 the Japanese Go Association.

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:09.700
 - Wow.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.540
 - Yes.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.380
 - That's very cool.

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.020
 - This guy was a big deal.

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.020
 - Well, while we're on inventions,

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.780
 there's a British word, I don't know if you know it here,

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.860
 but we often call the toilet the throne.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:24.020
 So the throne, the toilet,

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.900
 it's attributed as an invention

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.260
 to a guy called Sir John Harrington.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:29.500
 And he built it.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.020
 He was the godson of Queen Elizabeth III.

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:32.860
 And supposedly--

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.260
 - Okay, we've only had two Queen Elizabeths,

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.020
 so I'm gonna stop you right there.

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:36.860
 - What did I say?

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:37.980
 - Queen Elizabeth III.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:41.460
 - Yeah, so John Harrington invented it in the year 3000.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.500
 (laughing)

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.340
 No, so sorry.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.860
 Queen Elizabeth I, yeah.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.140
 So he invented it for her.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.740
 And it basically, what I'm talking about

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.940
 is a toilet whereby it had valves,

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.980
 it had a flush, and she tried it,

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:57.820
 and she was like, this is fantastic, I'll take one.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.620
 So it was a big deal.

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:01.700
 So he invented the throne,

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:06.500
 and a descendant of his is Kit Harrington,

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:10.580
 John Snow, from A Game of Thrones.

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.420
 - Wow.

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:13.460
 - So this is a series about everyone wanting

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:14.620
 to get on the loo.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:15.940
 (laughing)

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.660
 - Yeah, one more thing on poo.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:22.460
 There's a famous biologist in the Netherlands,

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.740
 who's called Midas Dekkers,

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.940
 who writes great books about science.

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.460
 And one of his latest books is The Story of Shit.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.700
 So he's a biologist, and he just explains

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:34.140
 the entire god system, how it's produced,

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.540
 what is happening there biologically.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.100
 And they asked him in a talk show,

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.100
 they asked him like, why did you want to write

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.180
 a book about poo?

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.220
 And he said, well, I was walking around

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.460
 in these bookstores.

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.180
 You see all these cookbooks.

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.900
 Nobody ever tells you how it ends.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.140
 (laughing)

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:55.700
 (upbeat music)

00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:00.140
 - Luke, we need to wrap this up.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.900
