00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,880
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,240
 of "No Sex Things as a Fish,"

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,240
 which was recorded at the Nerdland Festival in Belgium.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,640
 This is the thing we do every year

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,320
 we have done for the last few years.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,520
 It's a brilliant festival.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,280
 It's definitely worth checking out for future years.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,280
 It's basically, imagine Disneyland had nerds instead of mice.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,960
 It is, that's what it is really.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,320
 It's loads of talks, it's loads of exhibitions,

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,440
 it's science, it's nerd culture,

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,360
 it's everything you can want if that is your bag.

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,500
 And we always have an amazing time there

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,920
 with a great audience.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,920
 And as usual, we were joined by Leven Skela.

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,280
 Anna did not make the journey this time,

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,400
 so it is the boys and Leven who did this show.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,640
 And Leven, you will know if you are a regular listener

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,720
 to fish, he may well have the record

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,840
 as most appearances of a non-elf on fish.

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,760
 I'd have to look that up,

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,880
 but he's been on quite a few times.

24
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,640
 He is an expert on all things nerdy, all things science,

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,160
 but at the moment he's really into AI as many nerds are.

26
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,080
 And why that's important is because he has a book

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,640
 about AI, the title is AI.

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,000
 It can be found on Amazon and I'm sure in other places.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 But if you search for his name, L-I-E-V-E-N-S-C-H-E-I-R-E,

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,520
 Leven Skela, then you will be able

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,440
 to find his book on AI.

32
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,920
 And actually, if you go to levenskela.com,

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,600
 then you can see all of his recent AI talks,

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,160
 which are very informative and very funny.

35
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,680
 If you struggle with Leven Skela's name,

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,680
 then you can also go to www.levingshire.com,

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,000
 as in what hobbits do I presume,

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,800
 which apparently also works.

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,200
 So go to either of those places

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
 and you can find out more about Leven and his works on AI.

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
 Anyway, enjoy the show.

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,680
 Like I say, it was really fun, like always.

43
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,600
 And of course, we are doing lots of live shows,

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,160
 which will include Anna towards the end of the year.

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,040
 So go to www.nosesthingsoffice.com/live

46
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,280
 to find out more about what remaining tickets there are

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,760
 and there are not many, so get in there fast.

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,120
 On with the podcast.

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,720
 (upbeat music)

50
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,240
 (upbeat music)

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,700
 (upbeat music)

52
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:34,320
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,240
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish,"

54
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,080
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

55
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,160
 from Nerdland in Belgium.

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,160
 (audience cheering)

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,720
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,600
 I am sitting here with James Harkin,

59
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,560
 Andrew Hunter Murray and Leven Skyra.

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,160
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

61
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,080
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

62
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

63
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,080
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Leven.

64
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,920
 - My fact is that in 2017,

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,480
 the AI computer AlphaZero was given the rules of chess.

66
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,240
 And four hours later,

67
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,480
 it was better than the human world champion in chess.

68
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,200
 - Wow.

69
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,400
 - So it was given just the rules, no strategies,

70
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,840
 no examples of chess games ever played between humans,

71
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,200
 and it started practicing against itself.

72
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,020
 - Did it try any really weird things?

73
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,440
 - It plays chess in a different way than humans.

74
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,960
 One chess player said, "I've always wondered

75
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,720
 "if the same game was invented on Mars

76
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,920
 "and without any interaction between the cultures,

77
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
 "we would have developed our own strategies

78
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,560
 "because everybody learns from the people before them."

79
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,480
 And he says, "Now I know."

80
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,000
 Because it takes more risks, for example.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,360
 It will offer its queen sometimes,

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,200
 without anyone knowing why, and then it wins in the end.

83
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,680
 So, really. - Wow, yeah.

84
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,720
 Can I just say, Leven, I think part of,

85
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
 if one of the main parts of playing chess

86
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,320
 is being able to pick up the pieces

87
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,120
 and move them from one place to the other,

88
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,200
 and until it can do that, I think I can beat it.

89
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,040
 - Yeah, well, then you need robotics,

90
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,280
 and some people are afraid of robots,

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,040
 and I always tell them, "If at this phase of technology,

92
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,240
 "you're afraid of robots,

93
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,480
 "the only thing you need to carry with you at all times

94
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,320
 "is a bucket of water, and you're safe."

95
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,600
 - Well, actually, we were in the green room just now,

96
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
 and there was a robotic dog in there.

97
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
 - Spot robot from Boston Dynamics, yeah.

98
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,320
 - Yeah, and also, yeah, there was, and also a real dog.

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,760
 And I can tell you that real dogs

100
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,480
 do not like robotic dogs either.

101
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,400
 - Really? - Yeah.

102
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,360
 - I'm just wondering.

103
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,120
 James, I know you like chess, Leven.

104
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,800
 I'm sure you like chess. - A bit.

105
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,240
 - And I know you know a lot about AI.

106
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,120
 Have you ever played against a man called Martin?

107
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,400
 (laughing)

108
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,680
 - Probably. - Okay.

109
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,520
 - Who is he?

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,560
 - Martin is a middle-aged Bulgarian man

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,360
 who wears a turtleneck jumper,

112
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,360
 and he is the worst possible opponent on chess.com, right?

113
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,200
 So he's an AI, he's a computer chess player,

114
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,840
 but he has been programmed to be deliberately,

115
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,800
 unbelievably bad. - That's amazing.

116
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,120
 - He plays 10 million games every week,

117
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,680
 and still he sucks at chess.

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,520
 - Really?

119
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,960
 Does he like call the pawns prongs?

120
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,600
 - Yeah, it does. (laughing)

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,680
 His catchphrase is, "My four-year-old son just beat me.

122
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,720
 "Ouch." (laughing)

123
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,760
 And he's really, really bad at chess.

124
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,760
 He's done experiments with him to test how bad he is,

125
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,000
 'cause he's programmed to be a weak chess player.

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,920
 He has been given 31 queens on one board,

127
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,000
 and the opponent only has pawns,

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,960
 and he has still managed to lose that game.

129
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,120
 - Really? - Wonderful.

130
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,960
 - See, that feels more in check with where I thought

131
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,280
 we were at.

132
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,000
 The creator of QI, John Lloyd, he always has this line

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,120
 where he says, "Not only have we not invented

134
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,200
 "artificial intelligence yet, but we haven't even invented

135
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,040
 "artificial stupidity."

136
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,360
 Like, that's how far away we are from taking over.

137
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,200
 - I know we have Martin.

138
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,800
 - So that's Martin. - Yeah, yeah.

139
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,720
 - So this robot that we're talking about

140
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,240
 that beat the record in chess,

141
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,160
 the way that they trained it was they gave it

142
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,560
 a bunch of games to play, and it had to learn strategy

143
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,480
 from that, and whoever was the best at learning a game

144
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,920
 would advance to the next level

145
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,640
 and train the next AIs together.

146
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,280
 So it didn't just beat chess,

147
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,480
 but it beat multiple Atari games.

148
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,960
 So as part of this program, the AI set a score on Pong.

149
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,960
 The highest score a human has ever set is 56,851.

150
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,800
 It scored 407,864 as part of this programming.

151
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,080
 - Important thing there is that the only input it gets

152
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
 is what is on the screen.

153
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
 So of course it's easy to program and use the software

154
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,600
 of all the positions to have an optimal software running it.

155
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,080
 But this was only fed what a human can see on the screen,

156
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,000
 and then adapted its own neural network

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,440
 until it could play very well.

158
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,600
 They thought it all the Atari games.

159
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
 It was at DeepMind, Google DeepMind in London,

160
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,800
 that's how they did it, all the Atari games,

161
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,800
 and then go the Chinese-Japanese game, Shoki, and chess.

162
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,440
 And so in fact now they can just give it rules of any game,

163
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,680
 and then it will practice against itself

164
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,200
 and improve until it can beat it.

165
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,600
 - Is there anything that we can win at?

166
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,840
 - Well, especially when it comes to boxing.

167
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,880
 There's one game that we still win,

168
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
 but I don't know how long it will take us.

169
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
 It's the game diplomacy.

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,080
 - Oh, okay.

171
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,640
 - It's a bit like risk.

172
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,080
 So you have to move around the world and capture areas.

173
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,640
 But there's more tactics.

174
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,680
 You have different kinds of troops.

175
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,120
 But between every round, there's a round of diplomacy

176
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,920
 where the players can go one-on-one

177
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,600
 and talk strategies with each other.

178
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,560
 Like if you move like this, then we can attack Italy there.

179
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,720
 Kissinger loved it, apparently.

180
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,240
 Kennedy played the game.

181
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,480
 And so now they have taught an AI to play it.

182
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,960
 It's a bit scary.

183
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,560
 You can see these large language models

184
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,760
 talking to other players.

185
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
 Like if you do that move there,

186
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,320
 then I will come from that way.

187
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,760
 So it figured all of this out.

188
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,120
 It can't win from the world top yet,

189
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
 but it ends in top 10 at this moment

190
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,640
 in the game of diplomacy.

191
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,880
 - I have a feeling that I would be able to beat any AI

192
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,960
 because I'm so dumb,

193
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,040
 it wouldn't be able to guess the strategy that I was playing.

194
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,000
 It would be like, why has he done that?

195
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,320
 That's probably where it learned to give the Queen away first.

196
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,760
 I'd be like, yep, you can have that.

197
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,840
 Like, I feel like stupidity of human error

198
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,960
 would be what confuses AI in a game.

199
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,800
 - Cup two, the year 2030.

200
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,520
 The war against the machines has gone terribly badly wrong.

201
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,760
 Step up, Dan.

202
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,800
 - But one man survived it and repopulated the Earth.

203
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,840
 - The one AI that's been built this year,

204
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,680
 this is very exciting, this is a new development this year,

205
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,240
 researchers have built an AI sarcasm detector.

206
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,760
 - Oh yeah, sure they have.

207
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,000
 - It was in Holland, it was in Groningen.

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,360
 - Yeah, it was in Holland, and they trained it

209
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,800
 with pieces from the Big Bang Theory and Friends.

210
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,960
 - Oh, really?

211
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,040
 - Yeah, so it's sitcom sarcasm.

212
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,880
 - Oh, okay.

213
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,280
 - It's if they be any more predictable.

214
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,680
 (laughing)

215
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,440
 - But I read about it, and there was, you know.

216
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,280
 - What does it do?

217
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,960
 - Mostly, it can just detect sarcasm.

218
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,440
 It can detect if you're being sarcastic, which is useful.

219
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,080
 But there is a risk that it might start using sarcasm

220
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,200
 for its own--

221
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,040
 - Against us?

222
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,600
 - Evil purposes, yes.

223
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
 (laughing)

224
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,280
 - Yeah.

225
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,120
 - That's amazing.

226
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,320
 Do you think even there's anything that AI won't be able

227
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,440
 to do in the future?

228
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,120
 - Well, that's a difficult question.

229
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,400
 Basically, you could say AI is a new kind of software

230
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,080
 that is good at pattern recognition

231
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,480
 and recognizing patterns and generating patterns,

232
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,920
 like generating images and language.

233
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,040
 But it does it so amazingly well at this point.

234
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,840
 The fact that it can win a game of diplomacy,

235
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,280
 it kind of makes you think with these large language models,

236
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,720
 it's not unthinkable that I ask an AI

237
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,600
 to buy a new car for me.

238
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,960
 It can do the negotiations much better.

239
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,760
 It's not unthinkable that an AI will sell your house

240
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,960
 at a better price because it knows what language to use.

241
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,080
 It could be coming.

242
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,200
 And especially when they start combining it with robotics,

243
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
 which is what they're doing now,

244
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,160
 then you give the system sensors and a sense of the world.

245
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,560
 And that's what probably the next revolution will be.

246
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,680
 - How interesting.

247
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,720
 In February, 2023, so just over a year ago,

248
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,400
 we asked ChatGBT to give us an episode of Fish.

249
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,240
 - Oh yeah, yeah.

250
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,880
 - Let's see if they could do our job.

251
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,720
 And they were pretty terrible, let's be honest.

252
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,760
 Anyway, I asked them to do it again this week

253
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,120
 with one more year of ability with the ChatBots.

254
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,920
 And they did a pretty good job.

255
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,880
 So it begins with Dan Schreiber says,

256
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,320
 "Hello and welcome to another episode

257
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,880
 of No Such Things as a Fish, blah, blah, blah,

258
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,720
 weekly podcast, all that stuff."

259
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,400
 And then in no particular order, here we go.

260
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,080
 James, what have you got for us?

261
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,800
 And then James Harkins says,

262
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,080
 "My fact this week is that AlphaGo,

263
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,960
 the AI developed by DeepMind,

264
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,560
 learned to play the game Go at a super human level

265
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,920
 by playing against itself millions of times."

266
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,960
 - Oh my God, you're doing the AI's fact,

267
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,200
 is it your main fact here?

268
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,520
 - No, but Leven's doing it.

269
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,800
 - So Leven didn't know about it.

270
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
 It predicted what our fact was going to be.

271
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
 - Are you kidding?

272
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,720
 - Honestly, and literally all I put in was,

273
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,480
 "Give me a transcript of No Such Things as a Fish."

274
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,200
 - It's over, let's just go home.

275
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,360
 We just, okay, but some fields, like creative ones,

276
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,880
 surely they're immune.

277
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,800
 - Yeah, surely Andy.

278
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,640
 - Surely.

279
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,720
 - Well, hang on, I'm sorry.

280
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,160
 Are we just gonna let that fly by?

281
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,400
 Are the exact same fact was predicted by the machine?

282
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,480
 We're all cool with that?

283
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,000
 - Dan, I guess, I'm sorry.

284
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,840
 - No.

285
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,680
 - That's the end of the world shit.

286
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,520
 - Dan, it gets worse.

287
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,360
 - It gets worse.

288
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,720
 - There's a new podcast, it's out this year.

289
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,640
 It's hosted by a guy called Jake,

290
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,160
 and it's created by a man called Jacob Redstrom,

291
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,680
 but Jake is AI.

292
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,520
 It's a podcast hosted by an AI.

293
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,360
 - Okay, right?

294
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
 - Yeah.

295
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,600
 - Surely Andy, I mean, things like beauty,

296
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
 that will never go to AI, will it?

297
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,240
 - Beauty?

298
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,240
 - Yeah, yeah, that'll always be a human trait.

299
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,080
 - Yeah, of course.

300
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,900
 - Well.

301
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,740
 - Oh no.

302
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,000
 - There has been this year a Miss AI competition.

303
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,840
 - Oh, cool.

304
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,840
 - Where a lot of chat bots/attractive creations online

305
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,480
 went up against each other to see who was the most attractive.

306
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,840
 And not only did that happen,

307
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,960
 two of the judging panel were also AI-generated models.

308
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,000
 - Wow.

309
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,280
 So the worrying moment will be in that competition

310
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,160
 when they say, what do you hope for?

311
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,880
 And they say, I would love world peace

312
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,160
 if the judge goes sarcasm detective.

313
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,740
 (all laughing)

314
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,580
 - That's when we're dead.

315
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,580
 - Have you ever asked GPT-4 to write a sonnet?

316
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,420
 - No.

317
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,340
 - This is, okay, write a sonnet.

318
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,900
 I'm gonna do it live now.

319
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,380
 An animal, what's your favorite animal?

320
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,460
 - A chinchilla.

321
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,300
 - Yeah, chinchilla.

322
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,300
 - A chinchilla, okay, write a sonnet about a chinchilla,

323
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,380
 okay, a chinchilla who really wants to fly like an eagle.

324
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,220
 Okay, there we go.

325
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,500
 So a chinchilla is kind of rodent, cute.

326
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,740
 - I'm not totally clear what it is.

327
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,660
 I just said it 'cause James said it, but.

328
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,040
 - Yeah, kind of, I'm gonna press start now.

329
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,520
 So I asked it to write a sonnet about a chinchilla

330
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,360
 who really wants to fly like an eagle.

331
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,620
 This is just, this is coming out as we speak.

332
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,560
 It's finished now, there we go.

333
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,920
 In twilight's hush, a chinchilla dreams bright.

334
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,220
 With fur as soft as whispers of the breeze.

335
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,460
 He gazes high where eagles take their flight

336
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,940
 and longs to soar above the tallest trees.

337
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,500
 His heart so bold defies the earthly bind,

338
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,700
 for in his tiny chest a spirit burns.

339
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,980
 With wings of faith, though not by nature's kind,

340
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,340
 he yearns for heights for skies his soul discerns.

341
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,660
 He climbs the peaks where shadows kiss the light

342
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,080
 and calls to eagles with a hopeful plea.

343
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,440
 Their feathers brush the heavens free in flight

344
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,760
 while he on ground remains but longs to be.

345
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,640
 Yet in his quest, a truth begins to rise.

346
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,440
 The flight resides in dreams, not just in skies.

347
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,640
 - That's very good, that's right.

348
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,400
 - I thought it was, it was quite long, was it?

349
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,240
 But that's sonnets.

350
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,440
 - That's sonnets, the 14 lines.

351
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,820
 - Can we ask for a limerick next time?

352
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,300
 - A limerick, I'll try.

353
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,380
 - I'm looking for high coups if we do any more.

354
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,340
 Here's the thing, AI has been very big in the news

355
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,740
 in the movie industry, I would say.

356
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,460
 Well, you know, a lot of the strike that happened in America

357
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,580
 was off the back of how artists were having to be asked

358
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,220
 to sign their voices over as well as the writing to AI.

359
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,780
 And a lot of things are coming into place

360
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,940
 where they're trying to protect the artist's integrity

361
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,640
 and livelihood and in Tennessee, a law has been passed

362
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,640
 where they are protecting musicians from AI.

363
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,360
 So the act is called the ensuring likeness voice

364
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,640
 and imagery security act or the Elvis act

365
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,600
 because Elvis is from Tennessee

366
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,920
 and that's happening in places now where they're gonna say

367
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,400
 you can't use the likeness of the voice anymore

368
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,080
 'cause it is happening.

369
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,040
 - It happened with the new GPT system that talks

370
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,060
 and Sam Altman who runs Open AI really wanted

371
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,540
 the voice of Scarlett Johansson

372
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,620
 because she was in the movie "Her"

373
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,180
 and he contacted her a few times and asked for it.

374
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,900
 She thought about it and she said, no, I cannot do it.

375
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,820
 I don't want to relate myself with AI

376
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,540
 because there's so much criticism of it.

377
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,700
 And then the voice came out

378
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,700
 and it was almost exactly like Scarlett Johansson.

379
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,060
 They had probably, they say they had found a voice actor

380
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,940
 who sounded really like her and adjusted it a bit.

381
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,540
 But well, she filed a lawsuit and it's all taken down now.

382
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,780
 But so they're trying to copy the voices of...

383
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,100
 - Well, James Earl Jones has given over the voice

384
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,900
 of Darth Vader now to AI based on his voice,

385
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,860
 which is so interesting 'cause that kind of is like

386
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,280
 the final step in Darth Vader's journey anyway

387
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,300
 from going human to Android, isn't it?

388
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,140
 - Yes.

389
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,340
 - Like a real world.

390
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,460
 - He's more machine now, isn't he?

391
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,740
 - Exactly.

392
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,820
 We need to move on guys.

393
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,000
 - Well, what's Belgium best at, Leven?

394
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,340
 - What is Belgium best at?

395
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,140
 - It's one of the most proud things that Belgium produces.

396
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,460
 - What I just learned at the theme park science show

397
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,460
 that we just had, we are world-class

398
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,580
 in the wheels of roller coasters.

399
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,420
 I didn't know.

400
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,260
 - Okay, that's very cool.

401
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,860
 - And beer and fries.

402
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,660
 - No, no, no, let's hear you roll the coaster fact, Andy.

403
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,500
 - Okay.

404
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,980
 No, an AI has just beaten humans at beer.

405
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,940
 - Drinking or making?

406
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,980
 - Belgian beer.

407
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,820
 - Not drinking.

408
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,660
 - Making.

409
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,420
 Coming up with new recipes of Belgian beer.

410
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,380
 They had 250 Belgian beers,

411
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,580
 a panel of the best beer experts on the planet,

412
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,500
 rated them on all sorts of metrics,

413
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,100
 rated them on 50 different kinds of flavor

414
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,180
 and lab analysis,

415
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,300
 and then an AI algorithm suggested,

416
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,420
 why didn't you add a bit of this and a bit of that?

417
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,620
 And it came out tasting better according to the experts.

418
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,460
 - Wow.

419
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,420
 - So this is trouble.

420
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,900
 Today beer, tomorrow.

421
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,020
 - I didn't speak up because I wasn't beer.

422
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,020
 - Tomorrow the roller coaster wheels will be a new shape.

423
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
 (audience laughing)

424
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,600
 (upbeat music)

425
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,500
 - It is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

426
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,660
 - My fact is that crocodiles can cough up hairballs.

427
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,500
 - Ah.

428
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,580
 - This was sent in by Colin Croakshank, thank you Colin.

429
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,660
 This is about, basically, I didn't know this.

430
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,620
 I knew cats produce hairballs and owls and things,

431
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,060
 but crocodiles, they have the most amazing jaws,

432
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,360
 they have the most amazing stomachs,

433
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,860
 they produce amazing acid to digest things.

434
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,420
 They cannot deal with hair.

435
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,580
 And normally it's not a problem,

436
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,020
 they don't eat a lot of hair,

437
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,660
 but occasionally they'll eat a pig,

438
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,140
 and they end up with a hairball

439
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,060
 'cause they cannot deal with the pig's hair,

440
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,400
 or the hooves,

441
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,900
 and they will just see a crocodile

442
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,100
 on the banks of the river going (hissing)

443
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,140
 (audience laughing)

444
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,140
 - Where are these hairy pigs coming from?

445
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,140
 (audience laughing)

446
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,980
 They're bristly, I guess.

447
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,900
 - They're bristly sort of wild ones.

448
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,740
 - Well, that's amazing.

449
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,140
 - I know, they're big.

450
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,540
 They're collectors in Queensland.

451
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,180
 The biggest one is the size of a football.

452
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,740
 Well, that's what's amazing about it as well,

453
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,780
 'cause it's not like it's just they've had a meal

454
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,060
 and they want to cough it back up.

455
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,140
 They can store that hairball for like 40 years,

456
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,540
 so when they cough it up,

457
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,620
 it can give you an idea of the diet over decades

458
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,060
 of while they have eaten,

459
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,700
 so it'll be like hairy pigs, you know,

460
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,540
 all the other things.

461
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,360
 - That's so cool.

462
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,060
 - Human in some cases, an Australian.

463
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,860
 - Yeah, it is the best option

464
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,900
 if you see a crocodile coming towards you

465
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,900
 with its jaws open, that it coughs up a hairball, isn't it?

466
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,700
 Like, that's what you're hoping for most of the time.

467
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,140
 (laughing)

468
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,540
 - That's amazing, hairballs.

469
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,940
 - Hairballs, hairballs are good.

470
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,940
 - They used to be thought that they cured poison hairballs.

471
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,780
 - Really?

472
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,180
 - Yeah, these are bazoas, which are, you know,

473
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,860
 hairballs that would come from animals mostly,

474
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,660
 but there was a guy called Amboise Pare,

475
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,780
 friend of the podcast actually,

476
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,180
 you've mentioned him a few times,

477
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,380
 and he decided to see if this was true,

478
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,380
 so he took a cook at the King's Court

479
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,140
 who had been caught stealing fine cutlery,

480
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,460
 so he'd been sentenced to death for stealing these spoons,

481
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,620
 and he said, well, what I'm gonna do

482
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,060
 is I'm gonna let you off,

483
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,820
 but I'm gonna give you some poison,

484
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,060
 and then I'll give you this hairball,

485
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,900
 which we all know this works, so it'll be fine,

486
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,740
 and then we'll see what happens,

487
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,140
 and it turned out it didn't work at all,

488
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,180
 and he died anyway.

489
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,020
 - Oh, wow.

490
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,420
 - But that was the first evidence we had

491
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,060
 that these hairballs don't cure poisoning.

492
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,860
 - They do, they sound so weird and cool.

493
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,700
 - They're incredible.

494
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,380
 - Like the bazoas, or bazoas, or whatever,

495
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,220
 don't know how you say them,

496
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,740
 but they were for the rich, you know,

497
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,500
 'cause real bees are really rare,

498
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,740
 and if you couldn't afford one,

499
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,700
 you could maybe buy a sliver of one,

500
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,140
 or you could rent one for the day.

501
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,980
 If--

502
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,820
 - I don't know what--

503
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,660
 - What for?

504
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,980
 - I think they were also thought to be useful

505
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,860
 in times of plague, so maybe if you were visiting--

506
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,260
 - Magic spells as well.

507
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,460
 - Magic spells. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

508
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,340
 - And if you were very wealthy,

509
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,340
 you might have one for yourself,

510
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,500
 but one for your friends,

511
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,860
 you know, if any friends are visiting,

512
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,940
 so that's nice.

513
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,780
 - Have a hairball.

514
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,580
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

515
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,020
 No, they're very cool.

516
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,540
 - Lions can get hairballs?

517
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,380
 - Oh, really?

518
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,220
 - Yeah, there was one found in an African lion

519
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,180
 at the Colorado State Zoo,

520
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,740
 and it was, how big do you think a lion's hairball would be?

521
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,060
 - The size of a cricket ball.

522
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,940
 - Bigger.

523
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,740
 - Okay, two cricket balls.

524
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,660
 (laughing)

525
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,380
 - Let's go in sizes of animals rather than balls.

526
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,220
 - Melon.

527
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,460
 - Sizes of animals.

528
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,740
 (audience laughing)

529
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,620
 - The famous animal, the melon.

530
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,180
 - The melon, well, there's a kiwi, so who knows?

531
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,580
 (laughing)

532
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,700
 - Lee and Will have come here with the latest research,

533
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,020
 proving that melons are actually technically.

534
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,060
 - I think it was like, I didn't know what a chila was,

535
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,220
 and now I'm not sure I know what a melon is.

536
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,340
 (laughing)

537
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,900
 It was about the same size as a chihuahua dog.

538
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,740
 - Oh, wow.

539
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,180
 - So I like the size of a small dog, yeah.

540
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,020
 - Wow.

541
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,220
 - Do you know why chihuahuas were bred in Central America?

542
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,060
 - Mexico, right?

543
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,980
 - Yeah.

544
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,580
 They were religious animals,

545
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,580
 and they were sacrificed to the gods.

546
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,420
 - No.

547
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,260
 - No.

548
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,100
 - It's not much of a sacrifice.

549
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,620
 I've got to say, if I was one of the gods,

550
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,900
 looking down, and they're bringing me this tiny--

551
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,780
 - And you were hungry?

552
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,620
 - I'm hungry.

553
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,460
 They're bringing me this tiny--

554
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,420
 - You wouldn't want a dain.

555
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,260
 - Yeah, I would.

556
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,100
 - A big dog.

557
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,920
 - Yeah.

558
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,760
 - What was the sacrifice like?

559
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,660
 'Cause if it's burned at the stake, very easy to light.

560
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,500
 That's a--

561
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,580
 - What?

562
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,260
 - Well, they're gonna just go right up, aren't they?

563
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,100
 That's a--

564
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,660
 - Yeah, that's when they say, "Woof."

565
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,900
 (laughing)

566
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,420
 (audience applauding)

567
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,540
 - So they were sacrificed to the gods,

568
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,660
 and I love it when I walk in the street,

569
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
 and I see people with a shiwawa to go in,

570
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,940
 "Oh, sweet dog, what are you gonna ask

571
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,980
 "from the gods if you sacrifice it?"

572
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,700
 (laughing)

573
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,980
 - Well, do you know, this is a tangential story,

574
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,020
 but there was a thing in the UK,

575
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,180
 I don't know if you guys in Belgium heard about it here,

576
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,620
 but there was a, what looked like a giant hairball,

577
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,260
 was found by a lady.

578
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,980
 But she went, "Oh, it's a hedgehog."

579
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,900
 And so she brought it home, and she put it into a box,

580
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,380
 and she gave it a hot water bottle,

581
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,500
 and some food, then it didn't recover,

582
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,660
 took it to hospital, and it turned out it was the bubble

583
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,100
 on the top of a hat that people wear,

584
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,260
 those beanie bubbles.

585
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,140
 - And apparently this happens a lot.

586
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,500
 Zoologists and also vets are saying,

587
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,660
 "We gotta start understanding what animals look like again,

588
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,060
 "because we're losing a lot of time

589
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,300
 "when you're calling us out to help a drowning swan,

590
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,140
 "and it's a chair leg upside down, we can't do that."

591
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,740
 Someone brought vets to their house to help them revive

592
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,100
 what they thought was a hedgehog,

593
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,300
 but turned out to be a fruit loaf.

594
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,180
 Now, a fruit loaf doesn't look like a hedgehog,

595
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,660
 but apparently it had been pecked at by a lot of birds

596
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,540
 so that it looked very spiky.

597
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,980
 And even then they were like, "Oh my God, it's dying!"

598
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,820
 And they pulled out people to come.

599
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,980
 So this is a big thing at the moment.

600
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,900
 - That is amazing.

601
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,220
 - Sounds like cheap tamagochis in a way.

602
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,060
 - Yeah.

603
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,980
 - Just take cotton balls home and care for them.

604
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,740
 - Or like chia pets, remember those?

605
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,580
 - No.

606
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,420
 - Chia pet.

607
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,100
 - The pottery that grows.

608
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,940
 - No one?

609
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,780
 (laughing)

610
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,340
 - No one's seen Wayne's World?

611
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,060
 - Imagine the size of a room like this

612
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,300
 and you're the only one who gets that reference.

613
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,100
 - Yeah, that was a pretty special moment.

614
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,260
 - That's like me playing a move to AI.

615
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,940
 And then it's like, "What was that?"

616
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,860
 - Do you want to know the record

617
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,340
 for the largest ball of hair ever created?

618
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,220
 - Okay, so this is not an accidental in your stomach thing.

619
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,300
 - This is not an animal product.

620
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
 - This is someone with a weird fetish.

621
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,660
 - I would not, I would not disagree.

622
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,620
 (laughing)

623
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,760
 - But for legal reasons.

624
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,460
 - It's, well, it was created by a hairstylist

625
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,500
 from the USA called Steve.

626
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,760
 And he said, "I got more spiritual as I've aged

627
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,260
 "and I wanted to leave some kind of legacy when I'm gone.

628
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,740
 "And it hit me, I'm going to build a giant hairball."

629
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,780
 And he made a hole in the wall in his hair salon

630
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,620
 like a, and he put a slide down

631
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,180
 to the basement of the building.

632
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,020
 - Oh my God.

633
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,860
 - And every time he had hair,

634
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,700
 he'd just shove it down the slide.

635
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,540
 And then he glued it all together.

636
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,680
 So how big was it?

637
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,740
 - Oh, so it's the biggest ever, so it must be quite big.

638
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,580
 - It's quite big.

639
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,980
 - Shall I go by the size of an animal?

640
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,820
 - Yes, please.

641
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,380
 - Okay, large horse.

642
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,540
 - Oh, not far off, actually.

643
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,940
 - A bison.

644
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,260
 - Smaller than a bison.

645
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,860
 - Wow, what is that difference?

646
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,700
 I can't even, what's an in-between animal to that?

647
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,860
 - Look, I don't know what animals are, it turns out.

648
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,380
 I don't know what animals are or look like.

649
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,020
 - I actually saw this and I thought it looked

650
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,060
 like a really, really big hedgehog.

651
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,860
 - Yeah, it was that, it was a bit, yeah, yeah, yeah.

652
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,980
 - It was actually a fruitcake.

653
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,300
 (laughing)

654
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,940
 - It weighed 102 kilos, 225 pounds.

655
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,740
 It is disgusting, it is so, is horrible.

656
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,580
 - How big is that, Andy?

657
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,580
 I can't actually picture that.

658
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,420
 Genuinely, can't.

659
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,580
 - It was, I mean, it was on a wagon when I saw it, so.

660
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,020
 - Like a large-ish man would be about 100 kilos.

661
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,860
 - Okay.

662
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,860
 - Yeah, and it's maybe eight feet high,

663
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,420
 'cause it's made of hair, it's not very dense,

664
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,660
 and it's half-glued.

665
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,420
 Anyway, you can go and visit it now

666
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,420
 and add your own hair, if you too have got more spiritual

667
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,660
 and you want to leave a legacy behind, yeah.

668
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,780
 - All right, do you know a cat coughing up hairballs

669
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,460
 is responsible for one of the great voices

670
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,220
 of nerd culture?

671
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,980
 (dog barking)

672
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,900
 - That one.

673
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,340
 - That's a duck.

674
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,180
 - Yep.

675
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,220
 (dog barking)

676
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,300
 - Duffy duck, yeah, Jen does a better duck duck.

677
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,020
 - Still a duck, yeah.

678
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,700
 - But that's a nerdy--

679
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

680
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,300
 - Is it like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park?

681
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,180
 - No, so it inspired the voice of something

682
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,020
 that's very big in the dork-nerd world.

683
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,540
 - So what does it sound like a good cat coughing up hair?

684
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,380
 - Oh.

685
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,220
 - Gollum.

686
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,060
 - Gollum.

687
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,900
 - Really?

688
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,900
 - Andy Serkis, when he was going to the audition

689
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,980
 of Lord of the Rings, was going,

690
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,700
 "How am I going to portray Gollum in my audition?"

691
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,300
 And his cat was next, so I'm going,

692
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,220
 (dog barking)

693
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,180
 - What a disgusting hairball Gollum would produce.

694
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,260
 That would be awful.

695
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,700
 - That's the whole time, that's all it is.

696
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,340
 It's just got that in its throat.

697
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,780
 Interestingly though, cats,

698
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,180
 when we think of them coughing up a hairball,

699
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,900
 according to vets, they get pissed off

700
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,260
 when you say coughed up a hairball.

701
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,180
 They don't cough up a hairball.

702
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,780
 They vomit up a hairball.

703
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,620
 - Oh.

704
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,900
 - Or they're really kind of just trying to thrust it out,

705
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,740
 but they're not coughing.

706
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,580
 It's not a--

707
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,400
 - It doesn't matter, whatever it is,

708
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,740
 Steve will take it and he will glue it onto his big ball.

709
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,580
 Do you know we've just missed

710
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,620
 National Hairball Awareness Day?

711
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,460
 - Oh, God.

712
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,280
 - Yeah.

713
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,120
 - By how long?

714
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,900
 - Anyone else observe it?

715
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,740
 - That's terrible.

716
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,460
 It is bad when you're the only one, yeah.

717
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,260
 (audience laughing)

718
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,140
 - How long Andy, since it was--

719
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,860
 - It was, it's the last Friday in April.

720
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,300
 So it's an annual thing.

721
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,700
 - Do you know the date, the specific date?

722
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,940
 - Well, it's the last Friday in April.

723
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,940
 So like Easter, it moves.

724
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,220
 - I don't know.

725
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,100
 - Which is convenient,

726
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,220
 'cause what if it's at the weekend

727
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,660
 and not enough people come and celebrate?

728
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,500
 - Yeah, good.

729
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,580
 And what did you do to celebrate?

730
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,940
 - Well, you know, just pop 'em visit Steve

731
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,120
 at this great big ball.

732
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,260
 (audience laughing)

733
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,540
 - You know, it was founded by a vet

734
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,140
 who wanted to raise awareness of--

735
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,980
 - And what's--

736
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,820
 - Of hairballs.

737
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,640
 - Oh, okay.

738
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,300
 - I mean, I guess they can be bad for a cat's health, maybe?

739
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,940
 - Yeah, yeah, it makes them sick.

740
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,900
 If your cat is coughing up a hairball,

741
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,500
 it is a sign of bigger issues,

742
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,980
 gutturally, that is going on.

743
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,820
 - Really, really?

744
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,700
 'Cause theoretically it should be able to process

745
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,100
 the bit of hair that it eats.

746
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,340
 - Yeah, so that's been building up inside of them in ways.

747
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,180
 We're gonna have to move on,

748
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,020
 so I can do this.

749
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,460
 - Oh, should we do a bit on crocodiles or not?

750
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,300
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

751
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,140
 - Yeah, yeah.

752
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,580
 - If you give someone a crocodile to hold

753
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,180
 when they're in the casino, they'll make bigger bets.

754
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,140
 (audience laughing)

755
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,620
 - What size of crocodile?

756
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,980
 I mean, like, as big as a chinchilla

757
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,180
 or as big as a melon?

758
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,260
 - I think it's the bigger the crocodile,

759
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,940
 the bigger the bets.

760
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,620
 So it's like, apparently, it's a sense of height

761
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,620
 and the rousal makes you want to gamble more.

762
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,620
 - Oh.

763
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,940
 And if you think the crocodile might eat you,

764
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,140
 that puts you in that state.

765
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,020
 - You're aroused, but not in the way you're thinking.

766
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,860
 - No, no, no.

767
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,140
 I'm not thinking anything at all.

768
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,220
 I'm just thinking, how do I get rid of this crocodile?

769
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,900
 If I win another $50,000,

770
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,460
 maybe I'll get someone to hold the crocodile

771
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,700
 and take it away from me.

772
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,860
 Yeah, that's my plan.

773
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,660
 - Do you know that sometimes in the States,

774
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,260
 you have frozen lakes with crocodile snouts

775
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,180
 peeping out of the ice.

776
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,140
 - Oh, really?

777
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,660
 - It's when crocodiles hibernate

778
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,140
 and there's an ice layer on the lake.

779
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,580
 They just pop out their nose.

780
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,340
 So it looks like little green pebbles on the ice.

781
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,380
 And it's actually, when you pull the pebble,

782
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,300
 it's attached to a crocodile.

783
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,860
 And they're completely hibernating.

784
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,340
 So they're in standby mode as they don't react

785
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,180
 if you wiggle with the snout.

786
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,380
 - That's a good prank, though.

787
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,220
 - Yeah.

788
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,220
 - So let's see who can pick up that pebble first.

789
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,940
 (all laughing)

790
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,940
 - Actually, the word crocodile means pebble worm.

791
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,780
 - Really?

792
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,420
 - Yeah, the croco is the pebble

793
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,580
 and dailos is the worm.

794
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,100
 But in Greek, delios also means circumcised man.

795
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,940
 - Right.

796
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,420
 - It could be that crocodile means pebble circumcised man.

797
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,380
 - Okay.

798
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,220
 - Not sure.

799
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,340
 - Either way, how misleading if someone says,

800
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,260
 can you go and collect the pebble circumcised man

801
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,620
 over there and you come to a crocodile?

802
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,300
 That is, yeah, that's bad naming, I would say.

803
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,880
 (upbeat music)

804
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,980
 All right, it is time for fact number three.

805
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,540
 And that is James.

806
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,900
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in the 14th century,

807
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,460
 there was a rumour among Europeans

808
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,180
 that all Englishmen had tails.

809
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,500
 (audience laughing)

810
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,460
 - Now is the time to prove otherwise.

811
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,340
 (all laughing)

812
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,820
 - And I've basically come here to see if it's still a rumour.

813
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,140
 - Oh, yeah.

814
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,340
 - Is this still a thing that people in Belgium think

815
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,940
 that English people have tails?

816
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,660
 (audience laughing)

817
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,500
 Wow.

818
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,940
 - Oh, there we go.

819
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,700
 - So this idea basically comes from the idea

820
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,620
 that St. Augustine had visited the people of Kent

821
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,740
 and he was mocked by the locals

822
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,860
 and they pinned tails of fish to his robes

823
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,020
 to kind of kick him out of the town.

824
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,900
 And he turned round and he cursed them with their own tails.

825
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,460
 And this became a thing in Europe.

826
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,100
 So it's the extent that when there was a siege in 1436

827
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,460
 in Paris and the English were kicked out,

828
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,300
 they were taunted by the locals saying,

829
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,860
 were your tails, were your tails?

830
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,700
 And the Scottish, before a battle in 1332,

831
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,380
 said they would make ropes from the tails of the English

832
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,980
 to tie them with.

833
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,820
 - Oh.

834
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,220
 - They thought we were basically more close to Beast Hut,

835
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,780
 more close to the devil.

836
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,580
 It was said the English were.

837
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,140
 And there is a thing in French where the word for tail,

838
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,260
 which is coupé, and the word for hatch,

839
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,900
 which is coupé apparently, I don't speak French,

840
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,380
 but they're so close together,

841
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,220
 they had a theory that English people sat on eggs

842
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,420
 to hatch them.

843
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,500
 - Oh.

844
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,060
 - So yeah, that was how we got our eggs.

845
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,900
 We all sat on them.

846
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,740
 - I think we're getting off quite lightly now

847
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,460
 with just you've all got bad teeth as a reputation.

848
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,900
 That is quite, you know, that's better.

849
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,220
 And by the way, we don't all have bad teeth, just to say,

850
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,940
 almost all of us have some teeth.

851
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,460
 So I just want to say.

852
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,340
 - We have the best teeth ever, ever seen.

853
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,220
 - So do you, do you have in Belgium then,

854
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,060
 are there any things that if you were talking

855
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,660
 about an English person, you would say a certain thing?

856
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,020
 Like I was just suddenly remembered that Michael Palin,

857
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,620
 when he went out to the Amazon,

858
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,740
 they were describing to him how many trees

859
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,300
 are chopped down per day.

860
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,300
 They would say a Belgium, and it was the size of Belgium.

861
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,900
 So that would be a unit of measurement out in the Amazon

862
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,620
 for saying how much was chopped down.

863
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,100
 - One Belgium of trees was chopped down again.

864
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,260
 - Yeah, exactly.

865
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,100
 - Yeah.

866
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,260
 - Do you have anything here where it's like,

867
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,780
 oh, you English people.

868
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,780
 - We chopped down one England of trees.

869
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,900
 - No, no, no, no, no.

870
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,660
 - Just like we smell or we suck or you know,

871
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,500
 that kind of thing.

872
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,820
 - No, no, no, not really.

873
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,140
 - By the way, Dan's just saying this

874
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,460
 'cause he's not English.

875
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,300
 (laughing)

876
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,740
 - Dan is Australian and he wants to get in on this bullying.

877
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,220
 - Well, you know, when you're a child,

878
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,420
 you read comic books and like Asterix going to England

879
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,220
 and then you have all these, oh really, oh dear.

880
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,940
 And they're all very, ooh, polite.

881
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,780
 - What, polite?

882
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,980
 - Cutting the grass, really upperclass.

883
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,620
 - You're describing Andy, you're just, yeah.

884
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,340
 - But you get this upperclass image of what England is.

885
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,140
 And then you go there as a tourist.

886
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,900
 (laughing)

887
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,720
 And you spend a Saturday evening.

888
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,060
 - Okay.

889
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,460
 - You spend a Saturday evening in a city centre

890
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,780
 and you go, oh my God, I had no idea.

891
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,380
 - Can I just, yeah.

892
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:23,380
 - Well, okay, there is research on this,

893
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,820
 which is people around the world were asked

894
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,700
 what the worst habit of the British is.

895
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,100
 So people in Brazil, China, Germany, India,

896
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,820
 and the USA, they were asked what's the worst habit

897
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,100
 of the British, 27% of young adults said

898
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,820
 is that they drink so much.

899
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,340
 But not all of those people--

900
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,420
 - We would never say that in Belgium, we wouldn't know.

901
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,740
 - Not all of those people had visited the UK, actually.

902
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,060
 So this was a preconception.

903
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,700
 And of the people who had visited the UK,

904
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,220
 34% of them said--

905
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,460
 (laughing)

906
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,260
 - Well, it's amazing.

907
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,500
 I was looking at some other stereotypes of the English

908
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,020
 from the 14th century, and sure enough,

909
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,300
 drinking was one of the things that Britain

910
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,380
 was most famous for all the way back then.

911
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,540
 There was also the stereotype that British people

912
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,660
 took excessive faith in the dreams of old women.

913
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:16,260
 - That is so me.

914
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,460
 (laughing)

915
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,900
 - I was thinking it was maybe Theresa May and Brexit.

916
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,660
 (laughing)

917
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,020
 And also the Italians and Germans thought

918
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,900
 that the British were great lovers of themselves.

919
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,140
 (laughing)

920
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,540
 - Very nice.

921
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,340
 - Leven, do you think British people are emotionless?

922
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,100
 Like, reserved, calm?

923
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,740
 - That's what the cliche--

924
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,740
 - How dare you!

925
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,500
 (laughing)

926
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,260
 - Well, apparently British people

927
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,100
 are not the most emotionless in the world.

928
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,140
 So again, that people have been asked around the world,

929
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,580
 how many emotions did you experience today?

930
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,500
 Or did you feel anything today at all?

931
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,620
 And Britain was sort of in the middle of nations.

932
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,540
 It was not especially interesting.

933
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,300
 So the most emotionless country in the world,

934
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,660
 according to this survey from Gallup,

935
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,580
 which is asking people from these countries,

936
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,620
 is Singapore, right?

937
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,100
 The number of people who reported on any given day

938
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:17,100
 feeling any positive or negative emotions was 36%.

939
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,900
 - Oh, they were literally neutral.

940
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,740
 - And the rest of people said,

941
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,100
 "No, nothing occurred today in my mood."

942
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,540
 I didn't have any feelings today.

943
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,060
 It sounds rather Swiss to be so neutral, doesn't it?

944
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,900
 - Yeah, it sounds very Swiss.

945
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,660
 - Could that be that their sort of normal level of emotion

946
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,540
 could be, they could be always really happy,

947
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,820
 but they're not getting the highs and the lows?

948
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,860
 - Yeah, possibly.

949
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,980
 Yeah, yeah, that might be it.

950
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,620
 I mean, it's a really strange finding.

951
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,460
 - That's amazing.

952
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,420
 - Yeah.

953
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,340
 - Are we close to where the Flemish live around here?

954
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,460
 - We are in Flanders, yes.

955
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,060
 - Sounds like you're pretty close, James.

956
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,460
 - Yes, yes.

957
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,300
 - Not a preconception.

958
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,500
 British people know where everything in Europe is.

959
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,060
 - Here's a question for you with that in mind.

960
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,540
 16th century French scholar Jean Baptiste Le Bleur-Champier

961
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,700
 wrote that whenever you go to see the Flemish,

962
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,340
 you should always carry a knife.

963
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,740
 - Yes, it's to join us for dinner.

964
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,820
 That's why you will always be welcomed.

965
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,620
 - Any thoughts, Dan or Andy?

966
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,900
 Like, you might need, now you've been here for a day.

967
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,340
 - Why you might need a knife?

968
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,980
 - Yeah, among the Flemish.

969
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,740
 They only have the plastic disposable ones.

970
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,740
 And it's very actually hard to cut through your food.

971
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,700
 - In the 16th century, you're right, yeah.

972
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,580
 - Well, 'cause we're staying at Leaven's house

973
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,460
 and his kitchen table.

974
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,980
 There were like 16 different peanut butters on it.

975
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,660
 And I feel like you need multiple knives.

976
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,820
 - You're pretty much there, Dan, actually.

977
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,740
 They had a reputation of consuming the most butter

978
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,460
 in Europe. - Oh, oh.

979
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,580
 - And so you should always carry a knife with you

980
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,540
 so you can spread the butter wherever you want.

981
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,180
 - That's not a knife, this is a knife,

982
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,220
 but it is a butter knife, so.

983
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,300
 - This guy said that a day not a meal has gone by

984
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,220
 without me eating butter.

985
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,100
 I'm surprised they have not yet put it in their drink.

986
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,380
 - Working on it.

987
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,740
 But we also use kind of a knife-shaped thing

988
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,420
 to clear the head of a beer.

989
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,740
 So we always have, we always want a bit of foam

990
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,980
 on our beer.

991
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,420
 And so the foam is a bit over the glass.

992
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,300
 And then we have this knife-like thing to scrape it off.

993
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,620
 For us, it's very normal.

994
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,140
 The first time I went to a bar with an Australian

995
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,700
 in Belgium, we went to order a beer

996
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,180
 and then there's no way, preparations are going,

997
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,420
 and this guy pulls out the knife.

998
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,340
 He was really startled, I tell you what.

999
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,460
 - What's it called?

1000
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,100
 - I don't know, does it have a name?

1001
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,620
 - No, nobody knows the name.

1002
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,900
 - We don't bother with names, we want the beer.

1003
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,780
 - Interesting fact, that is actually

1004
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,580
 how the French Revolution started.

1005
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,300
 It was a simple misunderstanding in a bar,

1006
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,540
 which then just escalated.

1007
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,500
 Just please remove the head from this one.

1008
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,740
 (laughing)

1009
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,580
 - Wow.

1010
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,180
 - The kitchen knife was, I think,

1011
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,780
 invented or put in as a law that you had to use it.

1012
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,020
 I think it was by Richelieu.

1013
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,180
 And the number of deaths at the dinner table

1014
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,500
 dropped down to one-tenth.

1015
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,020
 Because people use daggers.

1016
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,660
 You would eat with a dagger and cut your meat with it

1017
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,500
 and everything.

1018
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,660
 And of course, it's a dinner table,

1019
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,340
 it's where you have discussions and there's drinking.

1020
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,780
 And so, quite often there was a knife fight at the dinner table.

1021
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,940
 And so, by simply inventing this kitchen knife,

1022
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,300
 this simple knife that is not sharp,

1023
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,820
 he cut down the lethal fights over dinners.

1024
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,660
 - That's incredible.

1025
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,980
 - He did ten or something, yeah.

1026
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,620
 - 200,000 people forked to death.

1027
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,860
 (laughing)

1028
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,440
 (upbeat music)

1029
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,140
 - Okay, I'm gonna move us on to our final fact of the show.

1030
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,060
 It is time for the final fact.

1031
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,560
 And that is my fact.

1032
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,300
 My fact this week is that toilet paper testers

1033
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,820
 have to train for six months before they are allowed

1034
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,380
 to apply for the actual job.

1035
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,380
 (laughing)

1036
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,820
 - That is, wow.

1037
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,780
 - This is not, 'cause obviously there's multiple

1038
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,740
 different companies that hire people

1039
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,660
 to test out toilet paper for them.

1040
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,660
 This is very specifically an article I read to do

1041
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,540
 with Proctor and Gamble, who do make toilet paper.

1042
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,180
 And basically the idea is that you need,

1043
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,980
 in order to understand what a perfect bit

1044
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,980
 of toilet paper is, as a tester,

1045
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,860
 you need to do, you need all your senses.

1046
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,060
 And the article that says outside of literally tasting it,

1047
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,620
 you need to know how does it feel in the hand?

1048
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,340
 What is it like to wipe, you know,

1049
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,740
 if you've had, you know, a couple of Belgian beers

1050
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,020
 the night before, or what is it like

1051
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,300
 if you've had a lot of peanut butter at Leven's house?

1052
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,580
 Like, it's gonna be different viscosity of poos each day.

1053
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,420
 - Yeah, okay.

1054
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,620
 So basically you spend six months doing that,

1055
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,540
 and then when you get to the moment where they're saying,

1056
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,460
 okay, now let's give you the actual test

1057
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,540
 to see if you can get the job, you can fail it.

1058
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,500
 You can fail it if you haven't prepared for those.

1059
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,460
 - But how do you fail it?

1060
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,860
 Do they, do they, I'm imagining they give you-

1061
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,860
 - I'm imagining that your finger goes through.

1062
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,700
 - No.

1063
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,540
 - Yeah.

1064
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,140
 - But I'm imagining that they give you a single sheet

1065
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,100
 of toilet paper, and you have to,

1066
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,740
 you have to know where it's from.

1067
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,260
 This is a single origin.

1068
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,100
 - How many ply?

1069
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,940
 - Yeah.

1070
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,620
 - It might be a combination of that stuff.

1071
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,940
 They're quite secretive in the toilet testing world.

1072
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,300
 So it's a bit hard to get into the clandestine world

1073
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,740
 of what's going on in those factories.

1074
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,540
 But they do say that in that particular moment

1075
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,380
 after six months, only half of the people

1076
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,620
 will make it through to the job itself.

1077
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,860
 Can you become a toilet paper sommelier?

1078
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,180
 (laughing)

1079
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,020
 Like you're like, sorry, last night I had steak and red wine.

1080
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,340
 Oh, then I recommend this one for you.

1081
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,580
 - Oh, yes.

1082
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,260
 Yeah, there has to be, right?

1083
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,100
 - There must be.

1084
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,660
 - That doesn't have to be done.

1085
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,260
 (laughing)

1086
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,260
 This is just a little bit of whimsy.

1087
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,260
 - It feels very, I think if you spent six months

1088
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,260
 of your life and then you fail the audition,

1089
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,860
 the least you can do is have at least

1090
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,500
 three different toilet papers in your house.

1091
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,340
 - No, I don't like it.

1092
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,740
 You hear the boots approaching your stall

1093
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,460
 and someone's standing outside with the silver dough.

1094
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,780
 No, it's not.

1095
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,380
 - I hear the sound of soft ply going in there.

1096
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,940
 - They do have a lot of robots as well.

1097
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,300
 I mean, I don't know if this is an AI thing too.

1098
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,020
 Or maybe it will be soon, but they have a lot of robots

1099
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,620
 because they need to test the qualities of the paper.

1100
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,460
 They need to test how easily it tears,

1101
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,700
 the angle that it hangs at if it's on a roll, you know?

1102
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,340
 Or, and they have a range of finger probe robots

1103
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,060
 to test how sheets break.

1104
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,900
 - Really?

1105
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,700
 - If they're mishandled or they're sort of tore or, yeah.

1106
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,620
 - Well, then AI robots have eight fingers.

1107
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,460
 So that's easy.

1108
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,900
 (laughing)

1109
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,300
 - Actually, do you know if you are in one

1110
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,300
 of these facilities how you test a toilet paper

1111
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,540
 against a butt, a bottom?

1112
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,140
 - So do they have like an AI bum as well?

1113
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,620
 - No, it's to do with you.

1114
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,220
 You're the person who's doing it.

1115
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,260
 - Me? - Yeah.

1116
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,380
 So you're in there.

1117
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,540
 You're given a fake bit of poo

1118
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,860
 that they have created with NASA.

1119
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,100
 So it's 'cause they, today's poo.

1120
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,700
 Because they don't want to have to.

1121
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,860
 - Why haven't we been back to the moon?

1122
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,700
 Wow.

1123
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,780
 - To boldly go.

1124
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,380
 - So here's the thing.

1125
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,660
 If you're working in a factory that's testing toilets

1126
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,700
 and testing toilet paper,

1127
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,260
 you don't want to have real feces in there

1128
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,620
 because it can cause lots of disease and so on.

1129
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,540
 So they, for years, it used to be dog food

1130
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,380
 that they would use to flush down toilets.

1131
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,740
 Then they created like bean curd and a lot.

1132
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,780
 And then there was like a,

1133
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,060
 like how KFC and Coke have a secret ingredient.

1134
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,540
 There was a secret ingredient poo that they would use

1135
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,020
 that they didn't tell anyone about.

1136
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,700
 And then they created this thing with NASA.

1137
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,980
 And so what you would do is you would put your arm tight

1138
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,580
 so that your elbow would have a little bum bum

1139
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,820
 basically in the corner.

1140
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,140
 And you would put the poo in there

1141
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,300
 and you'd squeeze it out.

1142
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,340
 And then you would wipe your bum elbow.

1143
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,680
 - That is very terrible.

1144
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,820
 - That is the most disgusting thing I've heard all year.

1145
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,860
 I don't know why.

1146
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,220
 - I think it was like he said bum bum.

1147
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,060
 - That was it.

1148
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,900
 It was bum bum.

1149
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,720
 I know it's fake poo.

1150
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,560
 I know it's your elbow.

1151
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,660
 There's no actual poo involved here.

1152
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,860
 I'm still revolting.

1153
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,380
 I feel worse about this than I do about

1154
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,100
 Steve and his big old balls there.

1155
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:05,100
 - How many listeners are going to try this at home?

1156
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,460
 - Oh no.

1157
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,780
 - Send your photos to Andrew Hunter Murray.

1158
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,620
 - Maybe not.

1159
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,460
 - Podcast@QI.com

1160
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,300
 - No.

1161
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,860
 - Not to give you any ideas,

1162
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,720
 but I have 12 kinds of peanut butter at my house.

1163
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,780
 (all laughing)

1164
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,020
 - You know, like it's very trendy to get bamboo toilet paper

1165
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,420
 these days, very environmentally friendly.

1166
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,860
 Well, they did a lot of tests recently

1167
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,740
 and they found that some products

1168
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,500
 contain as little as 3% bamboo.

1169
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,900
 So you think on the packet it says

1170
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,180
 this is bamboo toilet paper,

1171
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,020
 but actually it's mostly just old paper

1172
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,980
 and they just put a tiny bit of bamboo in.

1173
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,300
 This has been a big deal in the toilet paper world recently.

1174
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,780
 - Yeah.

1175
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,300
 - I worked out that if you were a panda

1176
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,620
 and you wanted to live entirely on these toilet rolls,

1177
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,500
 you would have to eat 7,200 toilet rolls every day

1178
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,020
 to get enough bamboo

1179
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,700
 and that's how many I would use in 50 years.

1180
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,660
 That's almost a Belgium.

1181
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,060
 (all laughing)

1182
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,180
 During lockdown,

1183
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,420
 somebody figured out how to make moonshine alcohol

1184
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,420
 from toilet paper.

1185
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,740
 - No. - Why?

1186
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,780
 - Yeah, because there's cellulose in it

1187
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,820
 and of course we cannot digest cellulose

1188
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,300
 and I think the yeasts that make the alcohol need sugars.

1189
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,260
 - That does feel like you're solving one problem

1190
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,060
 but creating another one.

1191
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,260
 - Probably, yeah.

1192
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,580
 But you can use certain enzymes

1193
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,500
 that can dissolve the cellulose into sugars

1194
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,780
 and so he actually did it.

1195
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,620
 It's on YouTube.

1196
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,700
 He documented how he did it.

1197
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,100
 So this might be the reason

1198
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,980
 why everybody was hurting toilet paper.

1199
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,060
 (all laughing)

1200
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,220
 - Don't take my booze away.

1201
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,220
 - That's so funny.

1202
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,420
 - We actually looked into the kind of lockdown hoarding

1203
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,900
 and we thought that actually a lot of it

1204
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,700
 did kind of make logical sense that you would hoard it

1205
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,260
 and that's because everyone was suddenly at home

1206
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,340
 and you weren't in the office anymore

1207
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,380
 and the factories that make office toilet paper

1208
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,660
 are different from the ones that make home toilet paper

1209
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,020
 because the office ones are often

1210
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,860
 those really big sort of rolls.

1211
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,540
 So there was actually gonna be a massive shortage

1212
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,140
 of home toilet paper because no one was in the office anymore

1213
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,100
 and everyone was going to the toilet at home.

1214
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,540
 Obviously there were crazy people

1215
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,820
 just buying loads of them as well.

1216
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,180
 - Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

1217
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,260
 Do you know if you go into a toilet paper factory,

1218
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,860
 where do we get individual rolls of toilet paper from?

1219
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,140
 - From the packet?

1220
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,260
 - No, before then.

1221
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,580
 - Is it a long one?

1222
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,980
 - It's a long one that is cut.

1223
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,820
 - No.

1224
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,980
 - From the mother reel.

1225
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,820
 - Oh.

1226
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,340
 - It's called the mother reel.

1227
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:40,940
 It is a ginormous toilet roll.

1228
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,180
 - That's amazing.

1229
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,780
 - Wait, is it long?

1230
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,620
 - Yeah.

1231
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,460
 - Or is it?

1232
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,460
 'Cause you're gesturing, you're saying it's tall.

1233
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,460
 - I know, I sort of thought,

1234
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,940
 'cause this is audio for the listener at home,

1235
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,100
 it didn't matter what I did with my hand.

1236
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,420
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1237
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,820
 (audience laughing)

1238
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,300
 - I'll tell you what, you've had a bad day

1239
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,380
 if the sommelier comes with that, haven't you?

1240
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,580
 (audience laughing)

1241
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,780
 - So each mother reel, as they call it,

1242
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,580
 contains, when chopped up into individual rolls,

1243
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,940
 25,000 individual rolls.

1244
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,780
 - What?

1245
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,620
 - Right, yeah.

1246
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,700
 So there's a guy called Greg Wallace.

1247
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,020
 We've mentioned him on the show before.

1248
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,940
 He makes a show where he goes around

1249
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,020
 looking at how they make things in the UK.

1250
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,620
 It's a documentary series.

1251
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,220
 Each show, different factory to show you how it's done.

1252
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,740
 So he was in a big warehouse

1253
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,820
 where they had 2,000 mother rolls in there.

1254
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:30,260
 And they worked out that if you were an average family,

1255
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,020
 you would have four toilet rolls a week

1256
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,980
 in an average family.

1257
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,460
 That's how much is used, right?

1258
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,700
 So the amount of toilet rolls in that room

1259
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,700
 would mean that your family could be wiping your bum

1260
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,740
 for 96,000 years.

1261
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:48,020
 Just from that collection of 2,000 mother rolls

1262
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,780
 that they had sitting in the warehouse.

1263
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,380
 - Do you know these toilets that squirt water on your bum?

1264
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,860
 - B-day. - A B-day?

1265
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,900
 - No, the toilets as in inside the toilet.

1266
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,100
 - The Japanese.

1267
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,260
 - Well, I was going to ask you.

1268
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,620
 Do you know where they were invented?

1269
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,460
 - Japan.

1270
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,300
 - No, they weren't.

1271
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,300
 - No, no, no.

1272
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,820
 - They were invented in America.

1273
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,780
 - Really? - Yeah, yeah.

1274
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,100
 They were invented in America

1275
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,220
 and they were supposed to be for like care homes and stuff.

1276
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,060
 - Okay.

1277
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,100
 - And then they sent a few over to Japan

1278
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,260
 and this company who got them thought,

1279
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,060
 everyone's going to want these.

1280
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,060
 Let's start making them for everyone.

1281
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,220
 And so they did.

1282
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,060
 But the problem was that the ones in America

1283
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,860
 were kind of prototypy

1284
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,500
 and they were very good at measuring the temperature

1285
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,540
 and they were very good at measuring the angle of squirt.

1286
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,900
 And so they quite often fired boiling water

1287
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,540
 straight into people's anuses.

1288
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,740
 - And there was a market for that too.

1289
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,580
 - Yeah.

1290
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,660
 - So we were talking about...

1291
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,060
 - Are you too busy to drink tea the normal way?

1292
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,900
 Well...

1293
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:51,580
 - That's a couple of English stereotypes together, isn't it?

1294
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,820
 But then, yeah, so then this company called Toto

1295
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,940
 decided to start making these.

1296
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,900
 But we were talking about testing toilet paper and stuff.

1297
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,780
 They needed to get the angle right.

1298
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,300
 And so they asked all of their staff members

1299
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,860
 to test these toilets.

1300
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:07,700
 - Okay.

1301
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,580
 - And to be honest, it took quite a lot

1302
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,340
 to get people to cooperate, but eventually they did.

1303
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,180
 - Okay.

1304
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,740
 - And all the members of staff would take it in turns

1305
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,020
 to sit on these toilets

1306
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,940
 and have water fired up at different angles.

1307
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,180
 And they found that the golden angle is 43 degrees.

1308
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,020
 - Right.

1309
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,340
 - So it just cleans you the right amount.

1310
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,460
 And for women at the front, it's 53 degrees.

1311
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,980
 So that's a bit of information you never wanted to know.

1312
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,820
 - Yeah, wow.

1313
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,380
 I've read about the founder of Toto.

1314
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,740
 I didn't read any of that,

1315
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,060
 but he was an amazing guy called Kazuchika Okura.

1316
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,900
 And he sort of had been to the West, I guess.

1317
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:48,260
 And he also helped introduce the car to Japan.

1318
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,580
 - This guy was a big deal.

1319
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,420
 - Right.

1320
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,780
 - And he also created his own new musical instrument,

1321
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,820
 the Okuro Ulo, a kind of vertical flute.

1322
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,660
 - What?

1323
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,820
 - A vertical flute.

1324
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,660
 - A vertical flute.

1325
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,580
 - A recorder.

1326
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,740
 - He invented the recorder.

1327
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,780
 And he was president of, linking it back to AI,

1328
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,860
 the Japanese Go Association.

1329
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,700
 - Wow.

1330
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,540
 - Yes.

1331
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,380
 - That's very cool.

1332
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,020
 - This guy was a big deal.

1333
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,020
 - Well, while we're on inventions,

1334
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,780
 there's a British word, I don't know if you know it here,

1335
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,860
 but we often call the toilet the throne.

1336
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,020
 So the throne, the toilet,

1337
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,900
 it's attributed as an invention

1338
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,260
 to a guy called Sir John Harrington.

1339
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,500
 And he built it.

1340
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,020
 He was the godson of Queen Elizabeth III.

1341
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,860
 And supposedly--

1342
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,260
 - Okay, we've only had two Queen Elizabeths,

1343
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,020
 so I'm gonna stop you right there.

1344
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:36,860
 - What did I say?

1345
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,980
 - Queen Elizabeth III.

1346
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,460
 - Yeah, so John Harrington invented it in the year 3000.

1347
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,500
 (laughing)

1348
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,340
 No, so sorry.

1349
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,860
 Queen Elizabeth I, yeah.

1350
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,140
 So he invented it for her.

1351
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,740
 And it basically, what I'm talking about

1352
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,940
 is a toilet whereby it had valves,

1353
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,980
 it had a flush, and she tried it,

1354
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,820
 and she was like, this is fantastic, I'll take one.

1355
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,620
 So it was a big deal.

1356
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,700
 So he invented the throne,

1357
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:06,500
 and a descendant of his is Kit Harrington,

1358
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,580
 John Snow, from A Game of Thrones.

1359
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,420
 - Wow.

1360
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,460
 - So this is a series about everyone wanting

1361
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,620
 to get on the loo.

1362
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,940
 (laughing)

1363
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,660
 - Yeah, one more thing on poo.

1364
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:22,460
 There's a famous biologist in the Netherlands,

1365
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,740
 who's called Midas Dekkers,

1366
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,940
 who writes great books about science.

1367
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,460
 And one of his latest books is The Story of Shit.

1368
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,700
 So he's a biologist, and he just explains

1369
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,140
 the entire god system, how it's produced,

1370
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,540
 what is happening there biologically.

1371
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,100
 And they asked him in a talk show,

1372
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,100
 they asked him like, why did you want to write

1373
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,180
 a book about poo?

1374
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,220
 And he said, well, I was walking around

1375
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,460
 in these bookstores.

1376
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,180
 You see all these cookbooks.

1377
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,900
 Nobody ever tells you how it ends.

1378
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,140
 (laughing)

1379
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:55,700
 (upbeat music)

1380
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:00,140
 - Luke, we need to wrap this up.

1381
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,900
