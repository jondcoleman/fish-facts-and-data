00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,160
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anna Chuzinski, James Harkin and Andrew

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,680
 Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,480
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
 Starting with you, James.

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,940
 Okay, my pet this week is that elephants can tell how much of something is in a closed

8
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,440
 bucket by smell alone.

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,880
 It's so cool.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,440
 It's so amazing.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,680
 So let's say, let me take one of you for instance Dan.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,680
 Yes.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,680
 As I'm looking at you.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
 Hello.

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
 Yeah.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,240
 And one of them has got three steaks on and the other one's got one steak.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,640
 You'd know which one had the most steaks on them right.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,000
 But if you had two boxes of conflicts that were both closed you wouldn't be able to tell

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,640
 which one was full of conflicts and which one isn't full of conflicts and elephants can

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
 do this.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,640
 So that's insane.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,000
 Am I allowed to shake the cornflake boxes and are they allowed to shake the buckets with

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 their users?

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 You're allowed to do whatever you want.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Uh huh.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,760
 No one's going to stop you unless you do it too much in Sainsbury's.

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,360
 But the elephants know they didn't do any touch at all, it was all completely by smell.

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,440
 And it was in their particular case it was two buckets containing 11 different ratios

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,240
 of some flour seeds and they managed to choose the bucket with the most some flour seeds

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,440
 59% to 82% of the time which is more than you would expect by chance.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,840
 And actually even dogs, they've tried this on dogs and dogs can't do it.

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,360
 So basically if you've got say, um, two kilograms of cocaine up your bum or four kilograms

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,040
 of cocaine up your bum, the dogs wouldn't know which one it was.

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
 Right.

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,520
 I think you had four kilograms of cocaine on your bum.

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,160
 It wouldn't take us never dogs to identify you.

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,320
 Do you think there would be a long difference do you between the four and the two?

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
 I think in your gate.

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
 Yes.

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
 You think the gate would be different?

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
 No.

42
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
 No.

43
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
 No, mate.

44
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
 It's like a big pocket up there.

45
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
 Four kilos.

46
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
 Two kilos.

47
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,680
 Two kilos are still uncomfortable and it's not like you're swaggering along comfortably.

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,720
 You have to be one big bag as well.

49
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,240
 You could do it's ten small bags.

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
 Oh great.

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
 That's going to make a big difference.

52
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,040
 Boy, on the entry point I think it would.

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
 I don't know how you close a bucket.

54
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,000
 I'm glad you said bucket at the end of the sentence.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
 It's buckets with a lid on the buckets.

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,480
 I wish my buckets came with a lid.

57
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,480
 How much bucket do you have?

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
 I've loads.

59
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
 Yeah.

60
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,320
 Like a bucket you would put up make a fire and you would need a lid for wouldn't you?

61
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
 Why are you making fires in buckets?

62
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,280
 Well, I'm trying to get rid of all this cocaine I've got out of my bum.

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
 It's really interesting, right?

64
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,360
 It's not even like these amounts are huge differences.

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,520
 I think I read in the study that let's say, well, were we saying seeds of sunflower seeds?

66
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
 Some sunflower seeds.

67
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,120
 It would be the difference between say 150 sunflower seeds and 130.

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,520
 They not all of them could get it.

69
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,320
 It's obviously easier for them with bigger differences, but even at that point they could

70
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
 still do it.

71
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,720
 So the other cool thing was they double-blinded it because the experiment is thought we

72
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,940
 might accidentally give away if we because we know which buckets have the most sunflower

73
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,940
 seeds in.

74
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,420
 We might get really excited when they're going to also be gone.

75
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,660
 So they definitely made kept made sure that the elephants didn't know and the researchers

76
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,800
 didn't know where the but sunflower seeds were.

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
 Yeah, okay.

78
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
 Yeah.

79
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
 That's useful.

80
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,920
 So if you're getting raisins in a supermarket, for instance, and you need to choose the

81
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,640
 packet that's got the most in them, you could bring an elephant and then you've got your

82
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
 mind's worth, right?

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,180
 Because they frequently put, they frequently label on the packet how many raisins are in

84
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,180
 the bag.

85
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:53,060
 Well, they put the weight on, they don't say this contains 4,000 raisins.

86
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,380
 I'm having a good day with your allowance today.

87
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,380
 I buy in bulk.

88
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,380
 All right.

89
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,380
 That must be how many are in a big packet of raisins.

90
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,900
 I just put a little sun-made boxes, the size of the candy.

91
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,100
 No, you can't put more than 30 raisins in there.

92
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,180
 Imagine that you've got 10 raisins in your hand, that's a nice handful slash mouthful.

93
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,180
 Right.

94
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,260
 Your 4,400 handfuls of raisins on each box.

95
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,260
 Look, it took a lot of work smuggling these into the country, that's hurt itself and that.

96
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,060
 Then you were walking funny.

97
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,540
 Just on testing elephants, so there was another test of elephant smell by the University of

98
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,740
 Quazulu, Natal, and they did something really cool.

99
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,780
 They built an elephant-sized lab mouse maze, so you know the stereotype of science is putting

100
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,780
 mice in a maze.

101
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,900
 It's almost always just a Y-shaped maze, so they put the mice in at the tail of the

102
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,980
 wise at where they see which of the two branches it goes into and they build an elephant-sized

103
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,980
 one of that.

104
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,700
 They put a bucket of food, they liked it at one branch of the Y, they put a bucket of food,

105
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,780
 they didn't like it at the other branch of the Y, and they could identify it.

106
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,660
 They knew instantly which branch to go for food.

107
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,660
 Just through smell.

108
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,660
 Just through smell again, yeah.

109
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,660
 That's cool.

110
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,580
 So do they have the best smell of any mammal that we know of?

111
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,580
 They do, didn't they?

112
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,580
 Yeah.

113
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,580
 It's extraordinary.

114
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,620
 They've got the highest number of old factory receptors, definitely, haven't they?

115
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,300
 I feel like other animals can claim in a different sense, but yeah, they're ability

116
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,180
 to distinguish between amounts, seems to be unique.

117
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,500
 And it's so sensitive that, for instance, there was another experiment where they show

118
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,100
 that they can distinguish between different people, so in Kenya, there are different tribes

119
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,180
 and some of them kill elephants and some of them don't.

120
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,620
 So the mass-eye kill elephant as a ritual thing, whereas the Canberra people don't.

121
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,860
 And if you hold up a mass-eye tribe's persons clothes, then the elephant freaks out and starts

122
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,860
 bashing its track at the right hand.

123
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,860
 It's amazing, isn't it?

124
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,860
 Yeah.

125
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,860
 Absolutely incredible.

126
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,060
 They can do it by sight, which you've just described, and also by smell.

127
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,340
 Yes, they can do it by slight and smell, yeah.

128
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,580
 So they identify the color of the clothes, but also if they've blinded in their face.

129
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,580
 Yeah.

130
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,580
 They can still smell it in their face.

131
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,580
 Blindfolded.

132
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,580
 We should say, blindfolded in the face.

133
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,580
 Blindfolded, yes.

134
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,580
 Yeah.

135
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,580
 Yeah.

136
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,580
 I mean, either of those works.

137
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,580
 Yeah.

138
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,580
 Blinded?

139
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,580
 Well, it just sounds a lot more cruel than being--

140
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,580
 For my experiment.

141
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,580
 I mean, they're right.

142
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,580
 It's a blind, 100 elephants.

143
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,580
 You're not going to get approval.

144
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,740
 Isn't it great to know that it does have the best sense of smell given how big it's

145
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,620
 noses. Like, you just-- you would hope that that big nose had some sort of rate advantage.

146
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,620
 Yeah.

147
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,620
 And it does.

148
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,620
 Do you know one other thing they can smell?

149
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,300
 TNT.

150
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
 And they're very good at it.

151
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,380
 And then fact, in one sense, at least, they're better than dogs at it.

152
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,380
 Mm-hmm.

153
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,380
 What's that sense?

154
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,380
 It's a smell.

155
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,380
 That's it.

156
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,580
 I think it's the sort of-- the proportion they can identify it, or the sensitivity score.

157
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,540
 They score 99.7% and dogs get about 94%.

158
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,140
 So there was not a lot about this saying, so does this mean that elephants should take over

159
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,980
 TNT sniffing dog's duties?

160
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
 No.

161
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,980
 Absolutely not.

162
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,460
 Their sheer size and weight makes them completely unsuited to being infield TNT detectors.

163
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,460
 Which I think is fair.

164
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,460
 At airports.

165
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
 Yeah.

166
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,460
 You would-- you'd have to go past the sniff at elephants.

167
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,100
 Well, then you're not-- you're not sniffing with TNT and airports.

168
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
 Yeah.

169
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,860
 This isn't the minefields of Angola, isn't it?

170
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,500
 It's not like they're expecting people to smuggle huge sukies with TNT.

171
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 Oh, well.

172
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
 Okay.

173
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
 It's curiously.

174
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 Oh, well.

175
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,780
 So they're incredibly-- elephants are incredibly smart.

176
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,140
 And they've only really started properly experimenting on their intelligence over the last

177
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
 20 years or so.

178
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,540
 But we used to think they were idiots because, for instance, there was this experiment where

179
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,340
 scientists dangled really, really nice smelling fruit and food and stuff, the various heights

180
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,140
 that were too difficult for them to reach.

181
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,860
 And then they left sticks all over the floor and thinking the elephants will pick up the

182
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,860
 stick, hopefully.

183
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,860
 And then they'll prod the fruit.

184
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,860
 Like a beauty hunter.

185
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,860
 Like a beauty hunter.

186
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
 Exactly.

187
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,860
 And they didn't.

188
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,660
 So it's dying to say, "Well, they can't be that smart. They can't figure it out."

189
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,860
 They should have hung an actual donkey, because that's what an elephant really, they wouldn't use one of the basic rubbish pinnars.

190
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,860
 Is that what they, they'd hold out an actual donkey in the sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet food?

191
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,860
 I don't know if they have pinnars in their culture though.

192
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,860
 Elephants.

193
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,860
 Also, you've been to some traumatic children's parties. They've hollowed out a donkey.

194
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,860
 That's tough to get through. You need a really big stick for a long time.

195
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,860
 Mine and James's parties, I'm blinding elephants in one corner.

196
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,860
 James is scooping the inn and is having a donkey in the other.

197
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,860
 Anyway, the point was that they weren't being stupid, not being able to get it with a stick.

198
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,860
 They'd pick up the sticks, and then they wouldn't prod at the fruit, because people didn't understand the elephant's scent of smell is so good.

199
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,860
 So as soon as they pick up a stick, they can't smell anymore, because they wrapped their trunk around it,

200
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,860
 and so they couldn't smell where the fruit was.

201
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,860
 And the scientist, because we're so human, we just think, "Oh, you just see the fruit, because we assume that a sight is the most important thing."

202
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,860
 But then they had to smell where it was.

203
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,860
 They put in a clothespeg on your nose, but they wrapped their nose around the stick.

204
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,860
 Exactly, yeah, yeah, exactly.

205
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,860
 I read a thing saying, it's basically like having a nose on the palm of your hand every time you touch something, you're smelling it.

206
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,860
 Much more than you are touching it.

207
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,860
 Butterflies can smell through the feet, can't they?

208
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
 Yes!

209
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,860
 They have all that stuff on their feet.

210
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
 It's so cool.

211
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,860
 So imagine if you had feet like a butterfly and happens like a...

212
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,860
 This is the worst part of the week.

213
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,860
 I found just on the subject of amazing senses of smell.

214
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
 Yeah.

215
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,860
 There is a woman who can smell Parkinson's disease.

216
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,860
 Oh, this is really weird.

217
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,860
 So there are people with incredible senses of smell of the super smell as they get called.

218
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,860
 And this lady was a retired nurse, called Joy Melm.

219
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,860
 And obviously she'd worked with a lot of patients with Parkinson's.

220
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,860
 And she'd been to a talk about it by a doctor.

221
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,860
 And at the end of it, there was any questions at call.

222
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,860
 And she put up a hand and said, "Why aren't you doing something about the fact that people with Parkinson's smell?"

223
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,860
 And they didn't really...

224
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,860
 They thought, "Oh, that's a slightly weird question to ask."

225
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,860
 And she... And eventually they worked out that she meant, "No, I literally can smell it."

226
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
 And they tested it on her.

227
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,860
 And she can tell before physical symptoms appear.

228
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,860
 So they presented it with a load of t-shirts that have been worn either by patients with Parkinson's

229
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
 or people who did not have Parkinson's.

230
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,860
 And she got them all right apart from one false positive

231
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,860
 where she flagged someone up as having Parkinson's who didn't.

232
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,860
 And then later on that person got in touch to say, "Oh, by the way, I've just been diagnosed with Parkinson's."

233
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,860
 So she had identified it before.

234
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,860
 It's like someone wearing you.

235
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
 It's amazing.

236
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,860
 That is amazing.

237
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,860
 We need to move on in a sec.

238
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,860
 One more thing about elephant smell.

239
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,860
 They smell each other's urine and get a lot of information about the pack, about the herd from that.

240
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,860
 And if they're walking in a line, let's say, do the condor or whatever.

241
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,860
 And then the one at the front smells some urine from the one at the back

242
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,860
 because some scientists have taken it and then run to the front of the queue

243
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,860
 and then put some urine there. They get really confused because they know who's urine is who's.

244
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,860
 And if it's in a place where they're not expecting it,

245
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,860
 they get really confused and looking around and they can't work out what's going on.

246
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
 Wow.

247
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,860
 Let's say you came into the bathroom next week when I'm on holiday in Japan

248
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,860
 and you smelled the urine and you went, "For the hell, that's James's urine."

249
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,860
 I thought he was in Japan.

250
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,860
 Yeah.

251
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,860
 It's like that.

252
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,860
 Cool.

253
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
 And remembering, because that's the other thing,

254
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,860
 the two things we assume are elephants are good at, smelling the trunks and remembering,

255
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,860
 because in the jungle, but they say an elephant never forgets.

256
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
 Yeah.

257
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
 And they don't.

258
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,860
 So they remember all the smells of urine, of all the different mates they have.

259
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,860
 And also there's this amazing moment in 1999 at an elephant sanctuary

260
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,860
 where there was this elephant called Jenny.

261
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,860
 There's still going on about this.

262
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,860
 There's this Asian elephant called Jenny.

263
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,860
 And she was suddenly introduced to a new elephant into the sanctuary

264
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,860
 and they had this amazing reaction to each other.

265
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,860
 They got really freaked out and agitated and then ran up to each other

266
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,860
 and it seemed like this exhibition of euphoria for both the elephants

267
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,860
 and the care of Jenny was like, "What on earth is going on?

268
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,860
 This is so weird."

269
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,860
 So she looked back into their history and for a few months, 23 years earlier,

270
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,860
 they'd worked in the circus together.

271
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,860
 Wow.

272
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,860
 Just remember each other.

273
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,860
 23 years.

274
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,860
 Yeah.

275
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,860
 That's incredible.

276
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
 Like Jenny, there's you.

277
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,860
 I don't remember anyone about this 23 years ago.

278
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,860
 You look at us blankly every morning.

279
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,860
 I was nearly in a Konga the other day.

280
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
 Yeah.

281
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
 It was at a wedding.

282
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,860
 It was very long Konga and everyone was going pie in the Konga

283
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,860
 and they kept saying, "Hey, join the Konga."

284
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,860
 And I kept saying, "Oh, I'm going to join on the end."

285
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,860
 I got about five people saying, "Hey, get in here.

286
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,860
 Mate, rub for me."

287
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,860
 I said, "No, I'll just join on the end."

288
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,860
 Did you join on the end?

289
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,860
 I tricked them all.

290
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
 No.

291
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,860
 No one's going to know.

292
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
 No one knows.

293
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,860
 No one looks behind in the Konga exactly.

294
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,860
 But I had already urinated at the very end of their route.

295
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,860
 So I was there to freak them out.

296
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,860
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

297
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
 And that is Chuzinski.

298
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,860
 My fact this week is that Thomas Jefferson cut his Bible to pieces

299
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,860
 and glued it back together in the order he thought it should be written.

300
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,860
 Wow.

301
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,860
 Yeah.

302
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,860
 Great.

303
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,860
 He had a better idea for the Bible.

304
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,860
 It was in the wrong order.

305
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
 And he was right.

306
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,860
 So this was the New Testament specifically.

307
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,860
 And he was a Christian, obviously Jefferson.

308
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,860
 And he had a Bible.

309
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,860
 And he wanted to put it all kind of in chronological order.

310
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,860
 So he got all the gospels.

311
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,860
 He ripped them apart.

312
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,860
 He actually had six different volumes.

313
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,860
 So he could do lots of experimenting.

314
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,860
 And he had a Greek one, a Latin one, English and French ones.

315
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,860
 And he cut up all the gospels.

316
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
 Paged my page.

317
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,860
 Rearranged all the pages in chronological order.

318
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,860
 So, you know, if John said Jesus had a sandwich when he was 17,

319
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,860
 then Matthew said.

320
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,860
 And then he went on a slide when he was 20.

321
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,860
 He'd sort of put the Matthew after the John bit.

322
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,860
 Even though in the actual Bible Matthew had come before the John.

323
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,860
 Yeah, yeah.

324
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,860
 That's a really good idea.

325
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
 Yeah.

326
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,860
 Because Matthew, Matthew and John, they're all telling the same story.

327
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
 They're telling the same story, different bits of it.

328
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,860
 Is there any good bits that he left out?

329
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
 Do we know?

330
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,860
 I actually don't know what the examples are that he left out.

331
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,860
 But I know he left out some of the dodgy miracles.

332
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,860
 So he was a bit skeptical that some of the stuff might not have happened.

333
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,860
 A miracle of the sandwich in the slide.

334
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,860
 Exactly.

335
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:41,860
 It was tuner at the top and there was builte at the bottom.

336
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,860
 Oh.

337
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,860
 She had stepped down, I would say.

338
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,860
 And he glued it back together and he liked it so much.

339
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,860
 His new upgraded version that he glued all the pages together

340
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,860
 and he sent them to be bound properly.

341
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,860
 And in fact, I believe it still exists somewhere in America.

342
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,860
 It's the Smithsonian.

343
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,860
 Is it the Smithsonian?

344
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,860
 Yeah.

345
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,860
 Of course it is.

346
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,860
 They've got a lot of Jefferson stuff.

347
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,860
 They've got his Bible.

348
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,860
 So you can visit it.

349
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,860
 I'm not sure you can flick through it, but I believe you can see it.

350
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,860
 You definitely won't be able to flick through it.

351
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,860
 Yeah, but it's very unusual.

352
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,860
 There are six volumes that might be opened at the Smithsonian pages.

353
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,860
 His desk that he wrote the Declaration of Independence on.

354
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,860
 They have that.

355
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,860
 And a polygraph, which I've always thought to be a lie detector.

356
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,860
 But it's...

357
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,860
 I would have thought that too.

358
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,860
 Well, it is, right?

359
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,860
 But originally what it was was a way of whenever he wrote letters,

360
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860
 because he wrote thousands and thousands of letters.

361
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,860
 And he always wanted a copy of each letter.

362
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,860
 Because if they made it into the papers, he could show the original.

363
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,860
 So it was a machine that was designed that would have a double pencil

364
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,860
 with a double ink.

365
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,860
 Well, and it would mimic his writing.

366
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,860
 So he wrote two letters at a time, but the same letter.

367
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
 Yeah, amazing.

368
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
 And makes actually more sense.

369
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,860
 Because polygraph, it means lots of writing.

370
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,860
 So it's actually a better term for that machine.

371
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,860
 Yeah.

372
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,860
 His Bible, he didn't mean it to be published.

373
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,860
 Because it was just a private sort of passion project of his.

374
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,860
 He showed it to a few friends. But then after he died, it became very popular.

375
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,860
 And lots of copies were made of it, it was printed.

376
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,860
 And it was called "The Life of Morals of Jesus of Nazareth".

377
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
 That was his title for it.

378
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
 That was his name.

379
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
 Yeah, he retited it as well.

380
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,860
 Because the Bible wasn't good enough.

381
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
 Yeah.

382
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,860
 He was a kind of a Jesus fan, as opposed to a religion fan in some ways.

383
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,860
 And then 9,000 copies were printed.

384
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,860
 And until the 1950s, when they ran out,

385
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,860
 each newly elected senator got a version of it.

386
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
 When they were elected.

387
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,860
 Oh, good day.

388
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,860
 Yeah.

389
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,860
 Do you know how it ends the book?

390
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,860
 Uh, his book, I don't know, damn.

391
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,860
 It ends, I believe.

392
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,860
 Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden.

393
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,860
 And in the garden, a new sepulchre.

394
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,860
 Wherein was never manned yet laid.

395
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,860
 There they laid Jesus and rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed.

396
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
 That's it.

397
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
 No resurrection.

398
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,860
 No resurrection.

399
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
 Oh.

400
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,860
 He just dies.

401
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,860
 Poor Jesus.

402
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
 Isn't that amazing?

403
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,860
 And that's like the main bit of, that's when I was told it's good.

404
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
 Yeah.

405
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,860
 That's like the main bit.

406
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,860
 Yeah.

407
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,860
 That's like the somber art house reinterpretation, realism bullshit.

408
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,860
 Yeah.

409
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,860
 He was an amazing guy though, Jefferson.

410
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,860
 He's quite a confusing person, isn't he?

411
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,860
 Because he has this bizarre legacy where he came up with the idea that all man is created equal

412
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,460
 and then he had 600 slaves and everything.

413
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,860
 And actually, even the Monticello, which is the place that he built his home.

414
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,860
 Even the Monticello website now acknowledges that Sally Hawkins mothered about six of his children at least.

415
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,860
 Who was an enslaved person?

416
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,860
 Wow.

417
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,860
 Yeah.

418
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,860
 Who bizarrely was the daughter of a woman who mothered children of his father-in-law.

419
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,860
 So they kept it in the family.

420
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,860
 So his wife's dad had lots of affairs with Sally Hawkins mum.

421
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,860
 Wow.

422
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,860
 Sorry.

423
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
 It's not Sally Hawkins.

424
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,860
 That's a famous actress.

425
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,860
 Did I say Sally Hemings?

426
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,860
 Sally Hawkins is of course in Paddington, the shape of water.

427
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
 She was great.

428
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,860
 She was also in the mother of a lot of Jefferson's children.

429
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
 Wow.

430
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,860
 God, she's versatile.

431
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
 I know.

432
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,860
 So he was a third president, right?

433
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,860
 After Washington and then, he was at John Adams.

434
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,860
 Yep.

435
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,860
 And he, you know, he did a lot of, he had a lot of remarkable achievements in office.

436
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,860
 As we said, after the Declaration of Independence, he's also responsible for a phrase

437
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,860
 that was a massive hit in the 19th century in America.

438
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
 Oh, I tell you this.

439
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
 Yeah.

440
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
 So he bumped into a man near his home.

441
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,860
 This is the story.

442
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,860
 No one knows if it's true or not.

443
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,860
 But this guy started complaining.

444
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,860
 They were riding the horses next to each other, some neighbor of his.

445
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,860
 And the guy was complaining about everything in Washington and all these ideas they had running things.

446
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,860
 So he talked for a couple of hours.

447
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,860
 He talked Jefferson's ear off about all this.

448
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,860
 And then eventually, they got to Jefferson's house and Jefferson said, "Well, this is me."

449
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,860
 Is that the phrase?

450
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,860
 No.

451
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,860
 That would have been a great phrase.

452
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,860
 This is me.

453
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,860
 So the guy eventually asked pretty much the first question he'd asked this whole time.

454
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,860
 And he said, "What's your name, by the way?"

455
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,860
 And the guy said, "Well, my name is Thomas Jefferson."

456
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,860
 A massive social clang of this guy's made.

457
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,860
 He was deeply embarrassed.

458
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,860
 And so he couldn't think of everything to say.

459
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,860
 And he just said, "My name is Haynes."

460
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,860
 And then he galloped away on his horse.

461
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,860
 So this became a phrase, "My name is Haynes," which is whenever you had to leave suddenly,

462
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,860
 or whenever you were massively embarrassed about something.

463
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,860
 Well, it was basically the 19th century.

464
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,860
 Boy was my face red.

465
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,860
 That's great.

466
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,860
 I'll get my coats, kind of think.

467
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,860
 Yes, it is like that.

468
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,860
 Wow.

469
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,860
 And what was it?

470
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,860
 My name is Haynes.

471
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,860
 My name is Haynes.

472
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,860
 My name is Haynes.

473
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,860
 Let's start doing it.

474
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,860
 And just very quickly on typos in the Bible, there are some absolute doosies.

475
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,860
 So there's one in the 1682.

476
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,860
 There's a 1682 edition, which gets called the Cannibal's Bible.

477
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,860
 Because there's a typo, it should be, if the latter husband hates her,

478
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,860
 and they mistyped it, so it's if the latter husband ate her.

479
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,860
 I'm talking about his wife.

480
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,860
 And there's a great one, the 1944 King James, which has a line, which should be,

481
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,860
 "Submit yourselves to your own husbands."

482
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,860
 It's advice for wives, basically.

483
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,860
 But accidentally reads, "Submit yourselves to your owl husbands."

484
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,860
 Yeah.

485
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,860
 It's good advice.

486
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:03,860
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

487
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,860
 My fact is that in 19th century America, caviar was a free bar snack.

488
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,860
 Yeah.

489
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,860
 Actually, I hate caviar.

490
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,860
 Do you?

491
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,860
 Oh, well.

492
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,860
 I don't like things that are savory that have the kind of texture that I think sweet things should have.

493
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,860
 That's understandable.

494
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,860
 Well, I know where and when you should not go on holiday.

495
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,860
 In 19th century America, because you couldn't move for it, it was so readily available.

496
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,860
 Because there was huge sturgeon fish, the fish that caviar comes from, or classic caviar anyway.

497
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,860
 And they were just so thick in the rivers that people put it in bars, basically like peanuts, to make people thirsty.

498
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
 Oh, yeah.

499
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,860
 That's the way of getting people, because it was very salty stuff, so there was a way of getting people thirsty.

500
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,860
 Well, yeah, because it used to be used like salt as well, didn't it?

501
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,860
 You'd sprinkle it on a meal just to add a little bit of salty flavour.

502
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,860
 Yeah.

503
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,860
 How did they use to eat it?

504
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,860
 Because from what I've read, the best place, and the sort of most encouraged place to eat it from,

505
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,860
 is the little bit of skin between your index finger and your thumb, so you place it on there.

506
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,860
 Oh, that's the, what's that called, the Snuff Box?

507
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,860
 Snuff Box, yeah.

508
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,860
 It's called the Natural Snuff Box or something.

509
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,860
 They say it's because they don't taint the taste by doing that.

510
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:17,860
 So if you use a metal spoon, for example, that has a metal-y taste that can affect the caviar.

511
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:24,860
 That sounds just like the kind of thing that high society makes up the weird way to eat the high society food, isn't it?

512
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,860
 But I think it was a bar snack that surely should be on a cocktail stick.

513
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,860
 And you could get one little egg at first.

514
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,860
 I would think it would just be in a bowl like peanuts with like 12 different types of urine.

515
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,860
 I think it's like that.

516
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,860
 Exactly.

517
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,860
 People don't wash their hands from the back of the toilet.

518
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
 It's very spiritual to get on your fingers.

519
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,860
 Yeah.

520
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,860
 You can just do it straight with the fingers.

521
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,860
 Yeah, probably not.

522
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,860
 I mean, you need to have a finger bowl next to it.

523
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,860
 Yeah.

524
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,860
 Let's say in Russia you have it on Blini, so maybe they had little bits of bread.

525
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,860
 That's perfect.

526
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,860
 That's like a little micro plate for each bit of caviar.

527
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
 That's a very nice way of eating, I think.

528
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,860
 But this is the thing.

529
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,860
 So US caviar was so common, but Russian caviar was thought to be a lot better.

530
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,860
 So quite often, US caviar was exported to Europe and then it was repackaged and relabelled as Russian caviar.

531
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,860
 And it was exported back to the States and sold as Russian caviar as better stuff, even like what?

532
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
 Exactly the same.

533
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
 Am I using it?

534
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
 Yeah.

535
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,860
 And basically what happened was the caviar in America was extremely numerous, like you say,

536
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,860
 because of Sturgeon were numerous, but then they overfished them.

537
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,860
 And then that meant there was no caviar left in America anymore, which meant you had to get it from Russia,

538
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,860
 which made it much more expensive.

539
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,860
 Exactly.

540
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,860
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

541
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,860
 Yeah.

542
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,860
 Because in Russia before then, before the Western demand increased in Russia, it was sort of peasant food as well.

543
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,860
 It wasn't there.

544
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,860
 It was considered much more peasant foodie than sauerkraut, for instance, which is more of a delicacy.

545
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,860
 And they used it just as a flavouring.

546
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:51,860
 And it was only when there's currently a Greek guy called Johannes Varvakis, who discovered Russian caviar on his travels.

547
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,860
 So this is delicious.

548
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,860
 I'm going to introduce it to High Society in Europe.

549
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,860
 And then that was what shot its prices up.

550
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:03,860
 He made it fashionable, kind of just shows that food, how much you value it, is just about how fashionable someone says it is.

551
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,860
 Yeah.

552
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,860
 Apparently, if you were to take, let's say, a 45 kilogram barrel of caviar.

553
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,860
 I'm not putting us up my Boston days.

554
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,860
 No, not after last time.

555
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,860
 But if you would take this massive barrel of caviar, which is kind of how they transport it,

556
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,860
 it would take a farm labourer two weeks to earn it back in the olden days in Russia.

557
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,860
 And now it would take a decade for them to earn it.

558
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
 Wow.

559
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,860
 Jesus.

560
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,860
 That is amazing.

561
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,860
 Big difference.

562
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,860
 I guess so much of it is because it's sturgeon.

563
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,860
 I mean, you get salmon caviar and you get lump-fish caviar.

564
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,860
 And there are all sorts of other much, much cheaper meals, which are just fish eggs, basically, of different kinds.

565
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,860
 But sturgeon has this kind of, you know, supposed hallmark of quality about it.

566
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,860
 It's pretty similar.

567
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
 So, okay, here's a question.

568
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,860
 Is caviar vegetarian?

569
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,860
 Because it is eggs.

570
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,860
 Not vegan.

571
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,860
 For sure.

572
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,860
 Not vegan.

573
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,860
 I'd say no, because you have to kill the sturgeon in order to get it.

574
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
 Fair play.

575
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,860
 However, there is some, I think, vegetarian caviar out there, where they don't kill the sturgeon.

576
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
 Oh, yeah.

577
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,860
 They make a tiny incision, and then they massage the sturgeon to get it out of them.

578
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,860
 Oh, that's nice.

579
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,860
 That's quite a rough massage.

580
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
 I'm a rich, good builder.

581
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,860
 This is a company in Leeds.

582
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,860
 And then you just squeeze the sturgeon like a toothpaste, too, basically, and all the caviar comes out of it.

583
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,860
 But...

584
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,860
 And then you put it back in the water?

585
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,860
 Yeah, it survives.

586
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,860
 You keep them.

587
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,860
 Yeah, I was reading about this, actually.

588
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,860
 Yeah.

589
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
 You can repeat the process every 15 months.

590
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,860
 Yeah.

591
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,860
 Yeah.

592
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,860
 I read that there was a scientist called Angela Coller.

593
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,860
 She spent nine years trying to work out how you didn't...

594
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,860
 You wouldn't have to kill the sturgeon in order to extract the eggs.

595
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,860
 And I believe it was her who pioneered it.

596
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,860
 It could be wrong.

597
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,860
 Maybe multiple people around the world had the same idea.

598
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,860
 But the process isn't just doing what you said with the incision.

599
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,860
 They give the sturgeons an ultrasound to see if they're ready.

600
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,860
 And then they have a protein administered, which you're talking about, which releases the eggs.

601
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,860
 And then they massage them out like a toothpaste tuna.

602
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,860
 Yeah.

603
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,860
 That's really funny.

604
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
 An ultrasound for a fish.

605
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,860
 Yeah.

606
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,860
 You're going to have 100,000 babies.

607
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,860
 Congratulations.

608
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:03,860
 I think they have to give them ultrasound anyway, because there's no way of telling if they're male or female.

609
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,860
 So you need to make sure that you've got a female fish.

610
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,860
 I think so from the outside.

611
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,860
 So you have to check their innards anyway.

612
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,860
 Check your own hands.

613
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,860
 That's incredible.

614
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:21,860
 One way that you might get some eggs without killing the sturgeon is sometimes producers will take some of the eggs out to check if they're ready or not.

615
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,860
 Because you don't want to kill your sturgeon, get all the eggs out, and it's not at the right stage.

616
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:33,860
 And so some fisheries will take a female sturgeon, put a incision in her, put a straw in her,

617
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,860
 and then suck out some of the eggs to taste them to see if they taste right.

618
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,860
 And then if they're right, then they'll kill the sturgeon and get the eggs.

619
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,860
 And if they're wrong, then they'll just let her go for a while.

620
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,860
 That must be something someone's doing in a posh ration restaurant.

621
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,860
 It's just serving up live sturgeon.

622
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,860
 Jamming its straw.

623
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,860
 I'll just screw it.

624
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,860
 Yes, but we only have paper straws in our food.

625
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
 So it's good for the environment.

626
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,860
 And then if it's not ready yet, do you just sew it back up?

627
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,860
 Yeah, yeah.

628
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,860
 And then that is insane.

629
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
 Isn't it true?

630
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,860
 They have a bit of a rough old ride sturgeon, because it's not just caviar.

631
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,860
 We also use them for beer.

632
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,860
 Don't we? Traditionally, they were the original icing glass providers.

633
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,860
 So that's the swim bladder.

634
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,860
 And that's what they used to kind of purify beer.

635
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,860
 It was used in things like Guinness until a couple of years ago.

636
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,860
 I think they got rid of it.

637
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,860
 It's to clarify alcoholic drinks.

638
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,860
 Sorry, I don't fully understand it.

639
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,860
 You get the swim bladder, and it's just used in the wine making or the beer making process

640
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,860
 to get rid of a lot of the sediment.

641
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,860
 I think it's kind of used like a sieve.

642
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,860
 And so that's why a lot of beers aren't vegetarian or vegetarian.

643
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,860
 A lot of vegans kind of have wine come, though, because of that reason.

644
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,860
 Sturgeon are amazing, amazing, amazing fish.

645
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,860
 They can weigh up to 1,500 kilos.

646
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,860
 Okay, like that's a lot.

647
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,860
 I work in stone.

648
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,860
 There's a lot of stone.

649
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
 It is.

650
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,860
 No, they are massive.

651
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,860
 They are up to 28 feet long, which I find.

652
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,860
 Sorry.

653
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,860
 I mean, that's, yeah, 28 feet long.

654
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
 Right.

655
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
 The surgeon.

656
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,860
 Thank you.

657
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,860
 Those are the very, very biggest ever found with that.

658
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
 Yeah.

659
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
 They've been around that.

660
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
 Okay.

661
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
 That's the biggest surgeon.

662
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,860
 So it's, I think the beluga surgeon is the second biggest kind of bony fish.

663
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,860
 And yeah, it's just length of four men.

664
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,860
 That is extraordinary.

665
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,860
 Yeah.

666
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,860
 I see.

667
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,860
 And they take a long time to, this is one of the reasons why caviar is so valuable

668
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,860
 is that they take so long to reach maturity, right?

669
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,860
 The biggest one sometimes there is not until about 20 that they're producing enough caviar.

670
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,860
 Wow.

671
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,860
 You have to wait forever.

672
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,860
 So as well as eating fish eggs, you can eat fish sperm.

673
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,860
 There's something called Shirako.

674
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,860
 That's probably not how you pronounce it in Japan.

675
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,860
 It translates as white children.

676
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,860
 And it's the raw or cooked sperm of the codfish.

677
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,860
 And in Russia, they eat the sperm of herrings, because they like herrings in Russia.

678
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,860
 They don't, they preserve it, but not only do they eat it on their own sometimes,

679
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,860
 they will eat it with the row of herrings as well.

680
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,860
 So they eat the eggs of the herring and the sperm of the herring in the same meal.

681
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,860
 It's the same meal.

682
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,860
 I think that's a little unkind, isn't it?

683
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
 Why?

684
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,860
 To whom?

685
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,860
 To the sperm and the eggs, because they belong together.

686
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,860
 They should be...

687
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,860
 Well, you're marrying them.

688
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,860
 Then you eat one of each and then a herring grows in your stomach.

689
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,860
 It's not like if you eat an apple seed, then an apple tree will grow out of your mouth.

690
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,860
 Oh man, we've got a lot of stuff to fill you up.

691
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,860
 I do feel like if I eat the sperm on the eggs of a herring,

692
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,860
 I would genuinely worry about that.

693
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,860
 Right, yeah.

694
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
 You'd worry.

695
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,860
 A little bit.

696
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,860
 The sperm is called Malokka, which I thought was Russian for milk.

697
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,860
 And you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong.

698
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,860
 And you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong.

699
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,860
 And you came back with a pint the other day.

700
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,860
 I hope you enjoyed your tea.

701
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,860
 You get ant caviar too.

702
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,860
 That's a thing.

703
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860
 What's that?

704
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,860
 It's not pupae and larvae, you know, so it's not eggs really,

705
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
 but it's from a particular Mexican ant,

706
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,860
 which is known locally as La Hormiga Pedora.

707
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,860
 You say that as if there's only one ant.

708
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,860
 Incredibly.

709
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,860
 It's incredibly expensive stuff.

710
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,860
 I can't shop.

711
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,860
 He cooks it as well as producing it.

712
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,860
 So it's a real treat if you're in town.

713
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,860
 No La Hormiga Pedora is the farty ant,

714
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
 because they're next to smell like farts.

715
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,860
 But the eggs are a delicacy or the larvae, you know.

716
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,860
 You do get snail caviar, don't you?

717
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,860
 Which is quite like fish caviar,

718
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,860
 apart from it tastes a bit more like snails.

719
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
 Have you tried it?

720
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,860
 Yeah.

721
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,860
 Wow.

722
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,860
 You got cowboy caviar?

723
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,860
 Is that made of the eggs of cowboys?

724
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
 No, it's slang.

725
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,860
 It's bulls' testicles that are fried.

726
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,860
 So they're also known as rocky mountain oysters.

727
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,860
 Have you?

728
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,860
 But they also, they would have those as bar snacks,

729
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,860
 wouldn't they?

730
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,860
 In the olden days,

731
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,860
 you would have testicles as bar snacks.

732
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,860
 What?

733
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,860
 They eat them a lot somewhere.

734
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,860
 I think it might be in Mexico.

735
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,860
 It's still a commonity.

736
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,860
 It's a thing somewhere in South America.

737
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,860
 It was a Montana testicle festival that I read about them in.

738
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,860
 So maybe Montana as well.

739
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,860
 It makes sense.

740
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,860
 You're going to eat them anywhere.

741
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,860
 It's going to be there.

742
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,860
 Confusingly, it's also from what I can tell online,

743
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,860
 cowboy caviar is a salad,

744
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,860
 which is just a lot of salad bits thrown together.

745
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
 So there's no sense to it.

746
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,860
 Wow.

747
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,860
 So be careful when ordering.

748
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,860
 If you're a vegetarian in Montana.

749
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,860
 Yeah.

750
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,860
 What else happens at a testicle festival?

751
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,860
 I think it's a lot of eating of testicles competitively.

752
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,860
 Testicle festival is a very nice phrase to say.

753
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,860
 It is.

754
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,860
 It is.

755
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,860
 It's very nice.

756
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,860
 Shave waxing of testicles probably.

757
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,860
 Yeah.

758
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,860
 I'd have there waxing competitions.

759
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,860
 There's the big bowl contest that I've got here,

760
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,860
 which is men in wet underwear.

761
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
 So I guess.

762
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,860
 No.

763
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,860
 That's what it says here.

764
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,860
 I wonder if you could call it the festival.

765
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,860
 Yes, you could.

766
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,860
 All the testicle.

767
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,860
 No, neither of this good is as good as testicle festival.

768
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
 No.

769
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,860
 Anyway, they branded it right.

770
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
 They branded it right.

771
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
 Well done, guys.

772
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,860
 There's another caviar.

773
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,860
 There's a caviar sort of replacement you can have,

774
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,860
 which is very much like the real Russian thing.

775
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,860
 And this is a replacement for a Russian Sevruga caviar.

776
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,860
 And this is a kind of caviar that you can get from paddlefish.

777
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,860
 And basically, where most paddlefish are,

778
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,860
 is a place called Warsaw in Missouri.

779
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,860
 And so apparently it's so good this stuff.

780
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,860
 And all the Russians in Missouri think that this is just like

781
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,860
 their Sevruga caviar back home.

782
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,860
 And so there's this huge black market caviar fishing problem there.

783
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,860
 And it was really good.

784
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,860
 It was this was on Longweed.com, I think.

785
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,860
 A really good Longweed about it.

786
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,860
 And it was about police descending on this place.

787
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,860
 And it's population doubles in the paddlefish fishing season,

788
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,860
 which is just a couple of weeks long,

789
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,860
 because people flock there to try and get these fish

790
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,860
 and get the caviar out of it.

791
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,860
 And they thought we know there are all these Russian people

792
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,860
 who are coming and they're illegally poaching these fish

793
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,860
 and then they're going, obviously, selling them.

794
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,860
 They're getting so many.

795
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,860
 And gradually, as you're reading this our school,

796
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,860
 you realize the police have this massive problem,

797
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,860
 because even though they know these fish are disappearing,

798
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,860
 they know they're illegally taking them.

799
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
 They can't track down any kind of black market.

800
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,860
 They can't trace any money.

801
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,860
 And it turns out when actually they start arresting people

802
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,860
 and when they go undercover, then no one's selling it at all.

803
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
 It's just all these Russians are picking it.

804
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,860
 They're just eating it.

805
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,860
 They've just got these big Russian families.

806
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,860
 So they'll get tens of thousands of pounds worth of caviar

807
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,860
 or some of them will have about 1,000 pounds worth

808
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
 of just the fish themselves.

809
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
 And they're like, no, why would I sell this?

810
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,860
 We're going to sell this.

811
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860
 They just take it back to their big families

812
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,860
 and they eat it all.

813
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
 And so there's nothing really that they can do.

814
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,860
 They just get taken to the police station and told,

815
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
 please don't take that fish again.

816
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,860
 And then send home.

817
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,860
 Yeah, they're just liking it.

818
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,860
 They like it in Russia.

819
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
 I can say that much.

820
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,860
 I think it's delicious.

821
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
 I was reading about a sniffer cat called Russick.

822
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,860
 Sniffer cat.

823
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,860
 Sniffer cat.

824
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,860
 Are they just praces?

825
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
 This entire long read.

826
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,860
 It looks like a good district in America.

827
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,860
 Look at Sniffer cat.

828
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,860
 Which looks like a bit of research.

829
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
 I've never seen an elephant research

830
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
 from an hour ago.

831
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,860
 This is in Russia.

832
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,860
 There was a lot of smuggling

833
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,860
 or was a lot of smuggling in the Caspian Sea.

834
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,860
 So they would come to a checkpoint

835
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,860
 and people would try and get it through on their cars.

836
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,860
 And they found that that was a big problem.

837
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,860
 But they had this cat that they had adopted

838
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,860
 that was, I believe, a stray who loved eating chunks of sturgeon

839
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,860
 and caviar and so on.

840
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,860
 That was being confiscated from the criminals.

841
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,860
 As a result, developed in a really strong nose

842
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,860
 for Sniffer now, whenever there was sturgeon in the area.

843
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,860
 So what they stopped, what they started doing was

844
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,860
 every time a car came up, the cat would be sent to go

845
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,860
 and, you know, maybe they walked on the leash.

846
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,860
 I didn't actually get that detail.

847
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,860
 And Russik would have a smell and smell out all of these bits

848
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,860
 of sturgeon and caviar.

849
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,860
 And so good was he at doing it

850
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,860
 that they actually retired the Sniffer dog that they had.

851
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,860
 Oh, that has got to hurt.

852
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,860
 Yeah, Sniffer dog and you lose your job to a cat.

853
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,860
 Yeah, first I lost my job to the elephant in that airport

854
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,860
 and now the rest.

855
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,860
 But yeah, so, unfortunately, he died in 2013

856
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
 when a vehicle that he was searching

857
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
 suddenly jerked forward.

858
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
 Convenience.

859
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,860
 I can't believe they didn't do that sooner.

860
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,860
 I can't believe no smuggler thought

861
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,860
 of doing that straight away.

862
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,860
 So, they've got the cat smelling the cars.

863
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,860
 Are they stationing it on the pavement

864
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,860
 and cars whizz pass?

865
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,860
 And the cat said like, "Rewr."

866
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,860
 And then you know, just stop at that.

867
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
 It's not like a speed gun.

868
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,860
 This is surely at a checkpoint.

869
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,860
 It's a checkpoint.

870
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
 You have to stop at checkpoint.

871
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,860
 Hold the gun to the cat and pointing at cars as they go past.

872
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,860
 You pull its tail when you want it to snow something.

873
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,860
 For sure they want you to stop to car

874
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,860
 and you've opened the doors.

875
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,860
 Isn't it as easy for you?

876
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,860
 We've just covered our big sturgeoner.

877
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,860
 I would say I could find sturgeon as easily

878
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,860
 and quickly over a cat.

879
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,860
 You're right, they're massive.

880
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,860
 They're really big.

881
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,860
 They were sat in the sort of passenger seat

882
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,860
 with a hat and a fake mask.

883
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,860
 Who's my friend Bob?

884
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,860
 What do you say, Kitty?

885
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,860
 That's a sturgeon.

886
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,860
 Thank God for Rosset or whatever he's called.

887
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,860
 Otherwise I would have believed in Bob.

888
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,860
 And it stinks.

889
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
 I mean, if there's a car full of fish,

890
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,860
 I'm going to smell it.

891
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,860
 I need a magic cat.

892
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,860
 But maybe his gift was in telling people about it.

893
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
 Oh yeah.

894
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,860
 Like most cats, if they smell, they're not going to tell you.

895
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
 They're not going to throw someone up.

896
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,860
 I've not ridden down the most interesting bit of the story.

897
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,860
 It was a talking cat.

898
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,860
 I'm so sorry.

899
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,860
 I missed out the best detail.

900
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:21,860
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

901
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,860
 And that is my fact.

902
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,860
 My fact this week is that wrestling star Andre the Giant

903
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,860
 was so massive that once when he drunkenly passed out

904
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,860
 in a hotel lobby, staff couldn't move him

905
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,860
 and had to corner him off with velvet ropes

906
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,860
 until he woke up.

907
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,860
 So amazing.

908
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,860
 This is, yeah, this is from an anecdote

909
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,860
 that comes from a book called "As You Wish"

910
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,860
 "Inconceivable Tales from the Making of the Princess Bride"

911
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,860
 by Carrie Elwes, who was the lead actor in it.

912
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,860
 He was also in Robin Hood men and types.

913
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,860
 And the whole book is just anecdotes about the time

914
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,860
 that they were making the movie.

915
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,860
 And that's what came out.

916
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,860
 The fact that he used to have all these drunken exescapades,

917
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,860
 one of which meant he passed down.

918
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
 And Andre the Giant was in that movie as well, right?

919
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
 He played "Fesick, the Giant."

920
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,860
 Yeah.

921
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,860
 You're a really typecast, wasn't he?

922
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,860
 Yeah.

923
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,860
 He wasn't going to play "Fesick, the Giant."

924
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,860
 And he was a wrestler, Andre the Giant.

925
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,860
 He was a wrestler before he was a film star, really.

926
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,860
 Absolutely.

927
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
 I mean, that's his big career thing, really.

928
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,860
 Well, before that, he was a rugby player

929
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,860
 and before that, he was in a furniture removal business.

930
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,860
 And before that, he was a child.

931
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,860
 Before that, he was a tiny egg.

932
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,860
 A professional egg.

933
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,860
 But to the WWF, now the WWE, he is one of the great wrestling stars

934
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,860
 of all time.

935
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
 He was in the period of Hulk Hogan and Macho Man

936
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,860
 and ultimately Warrior, that sort of very classic era

937
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,860
 when they started.

938
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,860
 I just don't get wrestling.

939
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,860
 What?

940
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,860
 It doesn't make any sense to me.

941
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,860
 We've covered it before on this podcast

942
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,860
 and I find it impossible to research.

943
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,860
 Because everything you read about it, you were like,

944
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,860
 is this real?

945
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,860
 Did this really happen?

946
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:58,860
 The confusion of real sport and fake acting is bewildering.

947
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,860
 Like there's this fight between him and Hulk Hogan,

948
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,860
 which was this really famous fight.

949
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,860
 And apparently it was super controversial.

950
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:12,860
 It was in 1988 and there was a famous referee called Dave Hebner

951
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,860
 who was refereed wrestling matches.

952
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
 And he happened to have an identical twin.

953
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
 Oh, yes.

954
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,860
 Who they tracked down for this match.

955
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,860
 And yeah, the referee had an identical twin.

956
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,860
 He didn't really, I think.

957
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,860
 No, he did really.

958
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,860
 I've seen the actual pictures.

959
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,860
 Either he did, or there's some amazing Photoshop in going on.

960
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,860
 But he had this identical twin.

961
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:36,860
 And so, right, Andre the Giant's agent got Dave,

962
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,860
 who was supposed to referee the match, locked him in a cupboard,

963
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,860
 and then bribed Earl, his identical twin,

964
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,860
 to referee the game instead.

965
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,860
 And he did.

966
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,860
 And then he made Andre the Giant one.

967
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,860
 And then Dave broke out of his closet.

968
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,860
 And then him and his identical twin brother had a big fight afterwards

969
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,860
 in front of the coach.

970
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,860
 This is the weirdest conversation.

971
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,860
 I really want to hear Adam do the Coventry of WWF.

972
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,860
 I don't understand any of this.

973
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,860
 Is that real?

974
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,860
 Oh my god.

975
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,860
 But the story lies.

976
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,860
 The story lies.

977
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,860
 You go to the theatre all the time.

978
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,860
 Are you standing up?

979
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,860
 What the fuck is going on here?

980
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,860
 No, no, no.

981
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,860
 Because in the right-ups of the theatre,

982
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,860
 it doesn't say,

983
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,860
 and there was an incredibly controversial moment

984
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,860
 when Hamlet's mother remarried Hamlet's uncle

985
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,860
 and the audience, you're like,

986
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,860
 "Okay, this is a story.

987
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,860
 There was in the Wikipedia page that this is not here."

988
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,860
 Was it controversial?

989
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,860
 Was it all made up?

990
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,860
 It's all made up.

991
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,860
 It's all made up.

992
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,860
 It's all made up.

993
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,860
 Then why is it controversial?

994
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,860
 It's controversial in the world of wrestling.

995
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,860
 Which is a fake world.

996
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,860
 Yeah.

997
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,860
 Yeah.

998
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,860
 Okay.

999
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,860
 Now you're getting it.

1000
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,860
 No, it is weird how it's presented as true.

1001
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,860
 Normally, if it plays, there is a synopsis.

1002
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,860
 Normally when you go out of the play,

1003
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,860
 the thing doesn't keep happening else.

1004
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,860
 No, but...

1005
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,860
 I just think it's amazing that we found

1006
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,860
 the edge of Anna's comfort zone.

1007
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,860
 Yeah.

1008
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,860
 I never thought we'd get there.

1009
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,860
 Who would know as pro wrestling is fake?

1010
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:05,860
 It just makes me have a panic attack when I read about it.

1011
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
 But it's a drama, like he's standards.

1012
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,860
 It goes on and on.

1013
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,860
 Of course it's happening.

1014
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,860
 Don't smash out into the news at 10.

1015
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,860
 And suddenly, they're rolling in.

1016
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,860
 What about the guy from Holyoke's was fighting the guy

1017
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,860
 from Emma Dale last week?

1018
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,860
 What?

1019
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,860
 I missed that.

1020
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,860
 Yeah, one of them got fired in real life, I think.

1021
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,860
 Yeah.

1022
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,860
 Although this is all making me wonder about everything.

1023
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,860
 Anyway, hang on.

1024
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,860
 So there was a real life fight between a character.

1025
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,860
 Someone in...

1026
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,860
 Someone in Emadale and someone in Holyoke's.

1027
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,860
 Was it Holyoke's?

1028
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,860
 Yes, it was Holyoke's.

1029
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,860
 Yes.

1030
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,860
 They got in a big fight.

1031
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,860
 Oh, physical fight.

1032
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,860
 Yeah.

1033
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,860
 I thought you meant that someone from Holyoke's turned up in Emadale.

1034
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,860
 Like a character sort of made his way through the membrane

1035
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,860
 and he ended up...

1036
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,860
 Because I definitely watched that as well.

1037
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,860
 Like a weird portal opens between the world.

1038
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,860
 It's like the treatment show or something.

1039
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
 Yeah.

1040
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,860
 One of them pint glasses from the old fix.

1041
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,860
 Snashes through into coronation street.

1042
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,860
 Look, we get back to Andre the giant.

1043
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,860
 Sorry, I'll take the giant.

1044
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,860
 Oh, what's here, giant?

1045
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,860
 So no.

1046
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,860
 It was actually three children in a massive overcome.

1047
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,860
 So when he was drinking according to Carrie Ellers,

1048
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:12,860
 when he was drinking in New York once, the NYPD had to send an undercover cop

1049
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,860
 to follow him around the bars because if he got too drunk,

1050
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,860
 there was once time where he fell over and crushed a human underneath

1051
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,860
 and they didn't want that to happen again.

1052
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
 Yeah.

1053
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,860
 Not to death.

1054
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,860
 No, no, no, no.

1055
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,860
 I think he was stuck.

1056
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,860
 You know, that's seven foot two of massive body on him.

1057
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,860
 He got so tall because he had acromegaly.

1058
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,860
 That was the cause of his giant size.

1059
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,860
 His parents did not recognise him.

1060
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,860
 So he left home at 14.

1061
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,860
 He came back at 19 and they said, "Who are you?"

1062
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,860
 And they'd even seen him wrestling on TV without recognising who he was.

1063
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,860
 But yeah, they didn't realise him took quite late, right?

1064
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,860
 So he wasn't sort of amazingly huge.

1065
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,860
 It was normal until he was 15.

1066
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,860
 Normal size until he was 15, yeah.

1067
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,860
 And we keep saying he gets drunk.

1068
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,860
 But to give him credit, I don't think he really did get drunk very often.

1069
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,860
 He basically held his drink incredibly well

1070
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,860
 and he drank extraordinary amounts.

1071
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,860
 He'd drink over 100 beers in a night and be fine.

1072
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,860
 Or I think someone was once asked how much can he drink before he's drunk

1073
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:14,860
 and someone said he starts to feel it after the first bottle of vodka or something.

1074
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:20,860
 He used to order a drink, which was a concoction that consisted of 40 ounces of just random liquids,

1075
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,860
 which he called the American.

1076
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,860
 He just had it poured into a pitcher.

1077
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,860
 And I'm glad he didn't have a cocktail bar because that is the most disgusting sounding drink.

1078
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,860
 To the random liquids on the menu.

1079
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,860
 Well, that's Kerry Elves, again, this is from him.

1080
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,860
 And he says it, "I've never tasted aeroplane fuel, but imagine it's very garlic."

1081
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,860
 It's like a top shelf you would have.

1082
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,860
 Like, let's say it was your 21st birthday and your friends,

1083
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,860
 what did you get drunk?

1084
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,860
 They'd buy you a top shelf,

1085
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,860
 which is basically one of every shot in a glass.

1086
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,860
 Oh.

1087
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,860
 Your friends would have done the same thing, I'm sure.

1088
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,860
 Well, yeah, we would have done, but we didn't finish our croquet in time,

1089
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,860
 so we all had to go home.

1090
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,860
 When Andre the Giant was in Paris one day,

1091
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,860
 he realized that the cars there were quite small

1092
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,860
 and he could just move them around if he wanted to because he was so strong.

1093
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:04,860
 And so he would get his friends, because in America, they're much bigger, right?

1094
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:09,860
 So he would get his friends cars and then move them into tiny little spaces where they couldn't go.

1095
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,860
 Got to make parking easier.

1096
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,860
 If you could just get out of the car and lift it into the space.

1097
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,860
 That's such a good idea.

1098
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,860
 You could hardly get into cars.

1099
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,860
 He was so huge.

1100
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,860
 There's photos of him getting in and out of a car.

1101
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,860
 And he basically had to go in on all fours

1102
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,860
 and be the entire backseat was him.

1103
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,860
 You know?

1104
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,860
 Yeah, he once got into a taxi and they couldn't close the door.

1105
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,860
 Wow.

1106
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,860
 I think we've done it on the podcast before,

1107
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,860
 but when he was a kid, because he couldn't get the bus, the normal bus,

1108
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,860
 he used to be driven to school by Samuel Beckett.

1109
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,860
 Samuel Beckett.

1110
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,860
 But that's not true.

1111
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,860
 Is that not true?

1112
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,860
 That was actually another thing that Elle was claimed.

1113
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,860
 But it wasn't quite true.

1114
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:50,860
 So he grew up in the same French town weirdly as Samuel Beckett moved to in Malia.

1115
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,860
 And apparently Beckett was kind of a friendly guy and used to drive the kids to school.

1116
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,860
 Okay.

1117
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,860
 And in a way, there was okay back then.

1118
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,860
 And he sometimes he would hit to ride with them, but he could fit on the bus.

1119
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,860
 Because how small would a bus have to be if, you know?

1120
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,860
 No, he had a pickup truck.

1121
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,860
 And the kids would sit on the back of the truck.

1122
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,860
 So it was true that he used to be a lift.

1123
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,860
 Yes, he did.

1124
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,860
 It just wasn't because he couldn't fit on the bus.

1125
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,860
 Right.

1126
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,860
 Yeah, got it.

1127
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,860
 He was a really nice guy, though, wasn't he?

1128
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,860
 Everyone said, he was very much a gentle giant, everyone called him.

1129
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:22,860
 And someone said he didn't like cursing people, which now I understand that resting isn't really

1130
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,860
 about really hurting people does make sense.

1131
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,860
 But he was friends with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Arnold Schwarzenegger in this PBS documentary

1132
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,860
 that you should watch if you're really interested in Andre the Giant.

1133
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:35,860
 But Arnold Schwarzenegger said that he was a restaurant within once.

1134
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:40,860
 And Andre used to always insist on paying for anyone's dinner or anyone's drinks when he went out with them.

1135
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,860
 And so Arnold knew this and he tried to sort of sneakily pay.

1136
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,860
 And Andre lifted him up off his chair and put him on top of a cupboard.

1137
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,860
 That's brilliant.

1138
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,860
 Oh, it's bizarrely.

1139
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,860
 And it's weird saying Arnold Schwarzenegger say this word.

1140
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,860
 It's an arm-war.

1141
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,860
 So he says, "And Andre just lifted me up and he put me onto the arm-war."

1142
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,860
 Wow.

1143
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,860
 I thought I'd see Arnold Schwarzenegger use the word arm-war.

1144
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,860
 He was meant to play physics.

1145
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,860
 He was meant to play the role in Princess Royce.

1146
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,860
 Yeah.

1147
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,860
 He was the original casting choice.

1148
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,860
 A lot of different films.

1149
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,860
 Yeah.

1150
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,860
 And he didn't because it took so long to make, didn't it?

1151
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,860
 It took about a decade to make.

1152
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,860
 And by then, Arnold Schwarzenegger was too famous.

1153
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,860
 It took a decade to get into production, I think.

1154
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,860
 And by then, Arnold Schwarzenegger had a real career.

1155
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,860
 Gosh.

1156
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,860
 Wow.

1157
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,860
 I've got some facts about alcohol tolerance.

1158
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,860
 But I don't know if you got more on Andre the Giant.

1159
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,860
 I just said he kept a small farm and he would walk around and play with the animals

1160
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,860
 because they didn't stare at him for his size.

1161
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,860
 I think that's bullshit as well, but worth saying.

1162
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,860
 No, I think he definitely likes not being stared at.

1163
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:41,860
 It's kind of a tragic life he had because he was obviously lovely

1164
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,860
 and knew his career depended on being huge.

1165
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,860
 But at the same time, he said the Princess Bride was the happiest he'd ever been

1166
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,860
 filming that because for the first time ever, people didn't stare at him

1167
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,860
 because I guess he was just an actor on set and then you were to expect.

1168
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,860
 He loved it.

1169
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:58,860
 And in fact, there's a really nice interview with one of his friends called Lanny

1170
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:03,860
 who said that after he'd filmed the Princess Bride, Andre invited him out to his house

1171
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,860
 and gave him a bunch of alcohol and said, "Hey, Jonah, come into my drawing room.

1172
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,860
 I'll show you something."

1173
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,860
 And made him watch the film.

1174
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,860
 And then he kept inviting him around and kept making him watch.

1175
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,860
 And he did it with all his friends because he loved.

1176
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,860
 He was so proud of it.

1177
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,860
 And he said, "You know, did you think I was good in it?

1178
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,860
 Do you think I was right in the Princess Bride?"

1179
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,860
 And they'd all be like, "Yeah, you were really great in that, don't worry."

1180
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:21,860
 Have you guys all seen this movie?

1181
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,860
 Yeah.

1182
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,860
 Because I actually don't even know what it's about.

1183
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,860
 Oh, okay.

1184
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,860
 Is it a, is it a...

1185
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,860
 It's a fan to see, yeah.

1186
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,860
 But a very funny one.

1187
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,860
 Yeah.

1188
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,860
 It is an amazing film, if anyone listening hasn't.

1189
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,860
 Yeah, it's a classic.

1190
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,860
 Yeah.

1191
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,860
 Yeah, it's very good.

1192
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,860
 I also did a bit of reading about just other people who drank a lot.

1193
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,860
 Okay.

1194
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,860
 So all of a read.

1195
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,860
 Oh, yeah.

1196
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,860
 The great hellraisers of the 20th Century.

1197
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,860
 I didn't know this.

1198
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:47,860
 He would frequently expose his penis when drunk, standard practice, I guess.

1199
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,860
 But he got a tattoo of an eagle's claw on his penis.

1200
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,860
 Oh.

1201
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,860
 I know.

1202
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,860
 Well, it was just a tattoo of one.

1203
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,860
 It wasn't an actual claw.

1204
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,860
 Yeah, but do you think people got confused and thought, "An eagle had landed on his jaw?"

1205
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:04,860
 Well, he then lays, we've got an eagle's head tattooed on his shoulder.

1206
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,860
 And he would show fellow drinkers his shoulder tattoo.

1207
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,860
 And then he'd say, "Would you like to see where it's perched and make it this cock out?"

1208
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,860
 Wow.

1209
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,860
 I know.

1210
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,860
 That's quite a labour-intensive practical joke.

1211
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,860
 Yeah, really?

1212
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,860
 So he died on the set of Gladiator.

1213
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,860
 You know, they had to sort of reconstitute his role for the final film.

1214
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,860
 But when he died, he'd had 12 double rums, lots of whiskey and an arm wrestle.

1215
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,860
 Which of those killed him?

1216
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,860
 I think it was the previous 60-odd years that killed him.

1217
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,860
 Yeah, yeah.

1218
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,860
 Well, yeah.

1219
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,860
 Just another film giant is Richard Kiel.

1220
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,860
 And he's the guy who played Jaws in...

1221
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,860
 Oh, Jaws.

1222
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,860
 In Jaws.

1223
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,860
 He was amazing.

1224
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,860
 I really believe it.

1225
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,860
 He's actually a sturgeon.

1226
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,860
 So famous fish, Richard Kiel.

1227
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,860
 No, he played Jaws in the Bond films.

1228
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,860
 But he had lots of jobs before he became an actor.

1229
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,860
 So he was...

1230
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,860
 First of all, he was a cemetery plot salesman.

1231
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,860
 I just like the...

1232
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,860
 So he was seven foot two, whatever, seven foot three.

1233
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,860
 Imagine someone selling you a cemetery plot who's a giant.

1234
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,860
 And then he was a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman.

1235
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,860
 Wow.

1236
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,860
 You know how, if you're...

1237
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,860
 If you bury someone, they're six feet under.

1238
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,860
 Hmm.

1239
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:16,860
 He could stand at the bottom of that plot and still talk to you.

1240
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,860
 He could be able to see his face.

1241
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,860
 Wow.

1242
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,860
 A miles to see a vacuum cleaner salesman.

1243
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:23,860
 A vacuum cleaner salesman.

1244
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,860
 And then he married a woman called Diane, who was five foot one.

1245
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,860
 And she did an interview and they said...

1246
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,860
 Yeah, also, sorry.

1247
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,860
 He's got lovely needs.

1248
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,860
 Interestingly, the opposite.

1249
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,860
 They said, "Why did you marry him?"

1250
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,860
 And she said, "We just see eye to eye on most things."

1251
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,860
 Oh, sweet.

1252
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:39,860
 Sorry, sweet.

1253
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,860
 Any more for any more?

1254
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,860
 I'm done.

1255
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,860
 I'm out.

1256
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,860
 I mean, I'll just tell you.

1257
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,860
 Go on, tell us.

1258
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,860
 Well, it's just another hell-raise effect.

1259
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,860
 It's not really relevant.

1260
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:48,860
 But a Petro tool?

1261
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:49,860
 Yeah.

1262
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,860
 A big old drinker.

1263
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,860
 When he was filming Lawrence of Arabia, he found and bought a precious pair of Greek earrings,

1264
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,860
 but he had to get them through customs.

1265
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,860
 So he smuggled them through in his foreskin.

1266
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,860
 Oh, wow.

1267
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,860
 No.

1268
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,860
 What did he expect that?

1269
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,860
 I told you it wasn't relevant.

1270
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,860
 They're going...

1271
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,860
 Are you sure, jumbo?

1272
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,860
 Are you sure it's that?

1273
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,860
 We better get the cat as well.

1274
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,860
 A second of it, you know.

1275
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,860
 She's an elephant.

1276
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,860
 He's a cat.

1277
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,860
 Together, they might cry.

1278
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,860
 Okay, that is it.

1279
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,860
 That is all of our facts.

1280
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,860

 Yeah, or you can go to our group account at no such thing, or you can go to our website.

1290
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,860
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1291
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:51,860
 We have everything up there from upcoming tour dates to links to all of our previous episodes.

1292

 We even have a behind-the-scenes documentary called Behind the Gills.

1293
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,860
 Check that out as well.

1294
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,860
 It's us on tour.

1295
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,860
 It's really fun.

1296
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:58,860
 Okay, that is it.

1297
00:47:58,860 --> 00:47:59,860
 That is all of our facts.

1298
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,860
 We'll see you again next week.

1299
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,860
 Goodbye.
