00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.160
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anna Chuzinski, James Harkin and Andrew

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.680
 Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.480
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.480
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.940
 Okay, my pet this week is that elephants can tell how much of something is in a closed

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.440
 bucket by smell alone.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.880
 It's so cool.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.440
 It's so amazing.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.680
 So let's say, let me take one of you for instance Dan.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.680
 Yes.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.680
 As I'm looking at you.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 Hello.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.680
 Yeah.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.240
 And one of them has got three steaks on and the other one's got one steak.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.640
 You'd know which one had the most steaks on them right.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.000
 But if you had two boxes of conflicts that were both closed you wouldn't be able to tell

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.640
 which one was full of conflicts and which one isn't full of conflicts and elephants can

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.640
 do this.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640
 So that's insane.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.000
 Am I allowed to shake the cornflake boxes and are they allowed to shake the buckets with

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 their users?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 You're allowed to do whatever you want.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Uh huh.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.760
 No one's going to stop you unless you do it too much in Sainsbury's.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.360
 But the elephants know they didn't do any touch at all, it was all completely by smell.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.440
 And it was in their particular case it was two buckets containing 11 different ratios

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.240
 of some flour seeds and they managed to choose the bucket with the most some flour seeds

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.440
 59% to 82% of the time which is more than you would expect by chance.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.840
 And actually even dogs, they've tried this on dogs and dogs can't do it.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.360
 So basically if you've got say, um, two kilograms of cocaine up your bum or four kilograms

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.040
 of cocaine up your bum, the dogs wouldn't know which one it was.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.040
 Right.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.520
 I think you had four kilograms of cocaine on your bum.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.160
 It wouldn't take us never dogs to identify you.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.320
 Do you think there would be a long difference do you between the four and the two?

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.320
 I think in your gate.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.320
 Yes.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320
 You think the gate would be different?

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.320
 No.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.320
 No.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.320
 No, mate.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.320
 It's like a big pocket up there.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.320
 Four kilos.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.320
 Two kilos.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.680
 Two kilos are still uncomfortable and it's not like you're swaggering along comfortably.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.720
 You have to be one big bag as well.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.240
 You could do it's ten small bags.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240
 Oh great.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.240
 That's going to make a big difference.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.040
 Boy, on the entry point I think it would.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.840
 I don't know how you close a bucket.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.000
 I'm glad you said bucket at the end of the sentence.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.800
 It's buckets with a lid on the buckets.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.480
 I wish my buckets came with a lid.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.480
 How much bucket do you have?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.480
 I've loads.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.480
 Yeah.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.320
 Like a bucket you would put up make a fire and you would need a lid for wouldn't you?

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.320
 Why are you making fires in buckets?

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.280
 Well, I'm trying to get rid of all this cocaine I've got out of my bum.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.280
 It's really interesting, right?

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.360
 It's not even like these amounts are huge differences.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.520
 I think I read in the study that let's say, well, were we saying seeds of sunflower seeds?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520
 Some sunflower seeds.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.120
 It would be the difference between say 150 sunflower seeds and 130.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.520
 They not all of them could get it.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.320
 It's obviously easier for them with bigger differences, but even at that point they could

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.320
 still do it.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.720
 So the other cool thing was they double-blinded it because the experiment is thought we

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.940
 might accidentally give away if we because we know which buckets have the most sunflower

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.940
 seeds in.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.420
 We might get really excited when they're going to also be gone.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.660
 So they definitely made kept made sure that the elephants didn't know and the researchers

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.800
 didn't know where the but sunflower seeds were.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.800
 Yeah, okay.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.800
 Yeah.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800
 That's useful.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.920
 So if you're getting raisins in a supermarket, for instance, and you need to choose the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.640
 packet that's got the most in them, you could bring an elephant and then you've got your

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.640
 mind's worth, right?

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.180
 Because they frequently put, they frequently label on the packet how many raisins are in

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.180
 the bag.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:53.060
 Well, they put the weight on, they don't say this contains 4,000 raisins.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.380
 I'm having a good day with your allowance today.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.380
 I buy in bulk.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.380
 All right.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.380
 That must be how many are in a big packet of raisins.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.900
 I just put a little sun-made boxes, the size of the candy.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.100
 No, you can't put more than 30 raisins in there.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.180
 Imagine that you've got 10 raisins in your hand, that's a nice handful slash mouthful.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.180
 Right.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.260
 Your 4,400 handfuls of raisins on each box.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.260
 Look, it took a lot of work smuggling these into the country, that's hurt itself and that.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.060
 Then you were walking funny.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.540
 Just on testing elephants, so there was another test of elephant smell by the University of

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.740
 Quazulu, Natal, and they did something really cool.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.780
 They built an elephant-sized lab mouse maze, so you know the stereotype of science is putting

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.780
 mice in a maze.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.900
 It's almost always just a Y-shaped maze, so they put the mice in at the tail of the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.980
 wise at where they see which of the two branches it goes into and they build an elephant-sized

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.980
 one of that.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.700
 They put a bucket of food, they liked it at one branch of the Y, they put a bucket of food,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.780
 they didn't like it at the other branch of the Y, and they could identify it.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.660
 They knew instantly which branch to go for food.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.660
 Just through smell.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.660
 Just through smell again, yeah.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.660
 That's cool.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.580
 So do they have the best smell of any mammal that we know of?

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.580
 They do, didn't they?

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.580
 Yeah.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.580
 It's extraordinary.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.620
 They've got the highest number of old factory receptors, definitely, haven't they?

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.300
 I feel like other animals can claim in a different sense, but yeah, they're ability

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.180
 to distinguish between amounts, seems to be unique.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.500
 And it's so sensitive that, for instance, there was another experiment where they show

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.100
 that they can distinguish between different people, so in Kenya, there are different tribes

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.180
 and some of them kill elephants and some of them don't.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.620
 So the mass-eye kill elephant as a ritual thing, whereas the Canberra people don't.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.860
 And if you hold up a mass-eye tribe's persons clothes, then the elephant freaks out and starts

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.860
 bashing its track at the right hand.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.860
 It's amazing, isn't it?

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.860
 Yeah.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.860
 Absolutely incredible.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.060
 They can do it by sight, which you've just described, and also by smell.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.340
 Yes, they can do it by slight and smell, yeah.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.580
 So they identify the color of the clothes, but also if they've blinded in their face.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.580
 Yeah.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.580
 They can still smell it in their face.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.580
 Blindfolded.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.580
 We should say, blindfolded in the face.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.580
 Blindfolded, yes.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.580
 Yeah.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.580
 Yeah.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.580
 I mean, either of those works.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.580
 Yeah.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.580
 Blinded?

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.580
 Well, it just sounds a lot more cruel than being--

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.580
 For my experiment.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.580
 I mean, they're right.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.580
 It's a blind, 100 elephants.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.580
 You're not going to get approval.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.740
 Isn't it great to know that it does have the best sense of smell given how big it's

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.620
 noses. Like, you just-- you would hope that that big nose had some sort of rate advantage.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.620
 Yeah.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.620
 And it does.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.620
 Do you know one other thing they can smell?

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.300
 TNT.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.300
 And they're very good at it.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.380
 And then fact, in one sense, at least, they're better than dogs at it.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.380
 Mm-hmm.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.380
 What's that sense?

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.380
 It's a smell.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.380
 That's it.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.580
 I think it's the sort of-- the proportion they can identify it, or the sensitivity score.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.540
 They score 99.7% and dogs get about 94%.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.140
 So there was not a lot about this saying, so does this mean that elephants should take over

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.980
 TNT sniffing dog's duties?

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.980
 No.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.980
 Absolutely not.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.460
 Their sheer size and weight makes them completely unsuited to being infield TNT detectors.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.460
 Which I think is fair.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.460
 At airports.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.460
 Yeah.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.460
 You would-- you'd have to go past the sniff at elephants.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.100
 Well, then you're not-- you're not sniffing with TNT and airports.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.100
 Yeah.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.860
 This isn't the minefields of Angola, isn't it?

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.500
 It's not like they're expecting people to smuggle huge sukies with TNT.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.500
 Oh, well.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.500
 Okay.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.500
 It's curiously.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.500
 Oh, well.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.780
 So they're incredibly-- elephants are incredibly smart.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.140
 And they've only really started properly experimenting on their intelligence over the last

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.140
 20 years or so.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.540
 But we used to think they were idiots because, for instance, there was this experiment where

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.340
 scientists dangled really, really nice smelling fruit and food and stuff, the various heights

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.140
 that were too difficult for them to reach.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.860
 And then they left sticks all over the floor and thinking the elephants will pick up the

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.860
 stick, hopefully.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.860
 And then they'll prod the fruit.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.860
 Like a beauty hunter.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.860
 Like a beauty hunter.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.860
 Exactly.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.860
 And they didn't.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.660
 So it's dying to say, "Well, they can't be that smart. They can't figure it out."

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:41.860
 They should have hung an actual donkey, because that's what an elephant really, they wouldn't use one of the basic rubbish pinnars.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.860
 Is that what they, they'd hold out an actual donkey in the sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet food?

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.860
 I don't know if they have pinnars in their culture though.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.860
 Elephants.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.860
 Also, you've been to some traumatic children's parties. They've hollowed out a donkey.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.860
 That's tough to get through. You need a really big stick for a long time.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.860
 Mine and James's parties, I'm blinding elephants in one corner.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.860
 James is scooping the inn and is having a donkey in the other.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:09.860
 Anyway, the point was that they weren't being stupid, not being able to get it with a stick.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.860
 They'd pick up the sticks, and then they wouldn't prod at the fruit, because people didn't understand the elephant's scent of smell is so good.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.860
 So as soon as they pick up a stick, they can't smell anymore, because they wrapped their trunk around it,

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.860
 and so they couldn't smell where the fruit was.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.860
 And the scientist, because we're so human, we just think, "Oh, you just see the fruit, because we assume that a sight is the most important thing."

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.860
 But then they had to smell where it was.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.860
 They put in a clothespeg on your nose, but they wrapped their nose around the stick.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.860
 Exactly, yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.860
 I read a thing saying, it's basically like having a nose on the palm of your hand every time you touch something, you're smelling it.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.860
 Much more than you are touching it.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.860
 Butterflies can smell through the feet, can't they?

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.860
 Yes!

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.860
 They have all that stuff on their feet.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.860
 It's so cool.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.860
 So imagine if you had feet like a butterfly and happens like a...

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.860
 This is the worst part of the week.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.860
 I found just on the subject of amazing senses of smell.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.860
 Yeah.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.860
 There is a woman who can smell Parkinson's disease.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.860
 Oh, this is really weird.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.860
 So there are people with incredible senses of smell of the super smell as they get called.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.860
 And this lady was a retired nurse, called Joy Melm.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.860
 And obviously she'd worked with a lot of patients with Parkinson's.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.860
 And she'd been to a talk about it by a doctor.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.860
 And at the end of it, there was any questions at call.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.860
 And she put up a hand and said, "Why aren't you doing something about the fact that people with Parkinson's smell?"

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.860
 And they didn't really...

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.860
 They thought, "Oh, that's a slightly weird question to ask."

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.860
 And she... And eventually they worked out that she meant, "No, I literally can smell it."

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.860
 And they tested it on her.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.860
 And she can tell before physical symptoms appear.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.860
 So they presented it with a load of t-shirts that have been worn either by patients with Parkinson's

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.860
 or people who did not have Parkinson's.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.860
 And she got them all right apart from one false positive

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.860
 where she flagged someone up as having Parkinson's who didn't.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.860
 And then later on that person got in touch to say, "Oh, by the way, I've just been diagnosed with Parkinson's."

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.860
 So she had identified it before.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.860
 It's like someone wearing you.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.860
 It's amazing.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:58.860
 That is amazing.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.860
 We need to move on in a sec.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.860
 One more thing about elephant smell.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:07.860
 They smell each other's urine and get a lot of information about the pack, about the herd from that.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.860
 And if they're walking in a line, let's say, do the condor or whatever.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.860
 And then the one at the front smells some urine from the one at the back

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.860
 because some scientists have taken it and then run to the front of the queue

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.860
 and then put some urine there. They get really confused because they know who's urine is who's.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.860
 And if it's in a place where they're not expecting it,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.860
 they get really confused and looking around and they can't work out what's going on.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.860
 Wow.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.860
 Let's say you came into the bathroom next week when I'm on holiday in Japan

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.860
 and you smelled the urine and you went, "For the hell, that's James's urine."

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:41.860
 I thought he was in Japan.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.860
 Yeah.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.860
 It's like that.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.860
 Cool.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.860
 And remembering, because that's the other thing,

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.860
 the two things we assume are elephants are good at, smelling the trunks and remembering,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.860
 because in the jungle, but they say an elephant never forgets.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:52.860
 Yeah.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.860
 And they don't.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.860
 So they remember all the smells of urine, of all the different mates they have.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.860
 And also there's this amazing moment in 1999 at an elephant sanctuary

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.860
 where there was this elephant called Jenny.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.860
 There's still going on about this.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.860
 There's this Asian elephant called Jenny.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.860
 And she was suddenly introduced to a new elephant into the sanctuary

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.860
 and they had this amazing reaction to each other.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.860
 They got really freaked out and agitated and then ran up to each other

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.860
 and it seemed like this exhibition of euphoria for both the elephants

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.860
 and the care of Jenny was like, "What on earth is going on?

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.860
 This is so weird."

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.860
 So she looked back into their history and for a few months, 23 years earlier,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.860
 they'd worked in the circus together.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.860
 Wow.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.860
 Just remember each other.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.860
 23 years.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:37.860
 Yeah.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.860
 That's incredible.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.860
 Like Jenny, there's you.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.860
 I don't remember anyone about this 23 years ago.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.860
 You look at us blankly every morning.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.860
 I was nearly in a Konga the other day.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.860
 Yeah.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.860
 It was at a wedding.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.860
 It was very long Konga and everyone was going pie in the Konga

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.860
 and they kept saying, "Hey, join the Konga."

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.860
 And I kept saying, "Oh, I'm going to join on the end."

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.860
 I got about five people saying, "Hey, get in here.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.860
 Mate, rub for me."

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.860
 I said, "No, I'll just join on the end."

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.860
 Did you join on the end?

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:04.860
 I tricked them all.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.860
 No.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.860
 No one's going to know.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.860
 No one knows.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.860
 No one looks behind in the Konga exactly.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.860
 But I had already urinated at the very end of their route.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.860
 So I was there to freak them out.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.860
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.860
 And that is Chuzinski.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.860
 My fact this week is that Thomas Jefferson cut his Bible to pieces

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.860
 and glued it back together in the order he thought it should be written.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.860
 Wow.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.860
 Yeah.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.860
 Great.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.860
 He had a better idea for the Bible.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.860
 It was in the wrong order.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:36.860
 And he was right.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.860
 So this was the New Testament specifically.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.860
 And he was a Christian, obviously Jefferson.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.860
 And he had a Bible.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.860
 And he wanted to put it all kind of in chronological order.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.860
 So he got all the gospels.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.860
 He ripped them apart.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.860
 He actually had six different volumes.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.860
 So he could do lots of experimenting.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.860
 And he had a Greek one, a Latin one, English and French ones.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.860
 And he cut up all the gospels.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.860
 Paged my page.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.860
 Rearranged all the pages in chronological order.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.860
 So, you know, if John said Jesus had a sandwich when he was 17,

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.860
 then Matthew said.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.860
 And then he went on a slide when he was 20.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.860
 He'd sort of put the Matthew after the John bit.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.860
 Even though in the actual Bible Matthew had come before the John.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.860
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.860
 That's a really good idea.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.860
 Yeah.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.860
 Because Matthew, Matthew and John, they're all telling the same story.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:20.860
 They're telling the same story, different bits of it.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.860
 Is there any good bits that he left out?

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.860
 Do we know?

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.860
 I actually don't know what the examples are that he left out.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.860
 But I know he left out some of the dodgy miracles.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.860
 So he was a bit skeptical that some of the stuff might not have happened.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.860
 A miracle of the sandwich in the slide.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.860
 Exactly.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:41.860
 It was tuner at the top and there was builte at the bottom.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.860
 Oh.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.860
 She had stepped down, I would say.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.860
 And he glued it back together and he liked it so much.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.860
 His new upgraded version that he glued all the pages together

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.860
 and he sent them to be bound properly.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.860
 And in fact, I believe it still exists somewhere in America.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.860
 It's the Smithsonian.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.860
 Is it the Smithsonian?

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.860
 Yeah.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.860
 Of course it is.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.860
 They've got a lot of Jefferson stuff.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:03.860
 They've got his Bible.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.860
 So you can visit it.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.860
 I'm not sure you can flick through it, but I believe you can see it.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.860
 You definitely won't be able to flick through it.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:09.860
 Yeah, but it's very unusual.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.860
 There are six volumes that might be opened at the Smithsonian pages.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.860
 His desk that he wrote the Declaration of Independence on.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.860
 They have that.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.860
 And a polygraph, which I've always thought to be a lie detector.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.860
 But it's...

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.860
 I would have thought that too.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.860
 Well, it is, right?

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.860
 But originally what it was was a way of whenever he wrote letters,

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.860
 because he wrote thousands and thousands of letters.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.860
 And he always wanted a copy of each letter.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.860
 Because if they made it into the papers, he could show the original.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.860
 So it was a machine that was designed that would have a double pencil

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.860
 with a double ink.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.860
 Well, and it would mimic his writing.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.860
 So he wrote two letters at a time, but the same letter.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.860
 Yeah, amazing.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.860
 And makes actually more sense.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.860
 Because polygraph, it means lots of writing.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.860
 So it's actually a better term for that machine.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.860
 Yeah.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.860
 His Bible, he didn't mean it to be published.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.860
 Because it was just a private sort of passion project of his.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.860
 He showed it to a few friends. But then after he died, it became very popular.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.860
 And lots of copies were made of it, it was printed.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.860
 And it was called "The Life of Morals of Jesus of Nazareth".

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.860
 That was his title for it.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.860
 That was his name.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:09.860
 Yeah, he retited it as well.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:10.860
 Because the Bible wasn't good enough.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.860
 Yeah.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.860
 He was a kind of a Jesus fan, as opposed to a religion fan in some ways.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.860
 And then 9,000 copies were printed.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.860
 And until the 1950s, when they ran out,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.860
 each newly elected senator got a version of it.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.860
 When they were elected.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.860
 Oh, good day.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:25.860
 Yeah.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.860
 Do you know how it ends the book?

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.860
 Uh, his book, I don't know, damn.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.860
 It ends, I believe.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.860
 Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.860
 And in the garden, a new sepulchre.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.860
 Wherein was never manned yet laid.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.860
 There they laid Jesus and rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.860
 That's it.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.860
 No resurrection.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.860
 No resurrection.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.860
 Oh.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.860
 He just dies.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.860
 Poor Jesus.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.860
 Isn't that amazing?

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.860
 And that's like the main bit of, that's when I was told it's good.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:55.860
 Yeah.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:56.860
 That's like the main bit.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:57.860
 Yeah.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.860
 That's like the somber art house reinterpretation, realism bullshit.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.860
 Yeah.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.860
 He was an amazing guy though, Jefferson.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.860
 He's quite a confusing person, isn't he?

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:12.860
 Because he has this bizarre legacy where he came up with the idea that all man is created equal

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.460
 and then he had 600 slaves and everything.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.860
 And actually, even the Monticello, which is the place that he built his home.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:26.860
 Even the Monticello website now acknowledges that Sally Hawkins mothered about six of his children at least.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.860
 Who was an enslaved person?

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.860
 Wow.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:31.860
 Yeah.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.860
 Who bizarrely was the daughter of a woman who mothered children of his father-in-law.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.860
 So they kept it in the family.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.860
 So his wife's dad had lots of affairs with Sally Hawkins mum.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.860
 Wow.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.860
 Sorry.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.860
 It's not Sally Hawkins.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:47.860
 That's a famous actress.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.860
 Did I say Sally Hemings?

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.860
 Sally Hawkins is of course in Paddington, the shape of water.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:54.860
 She was great.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.860
 She was also in the mother of a lot of Jefferson's children.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:57.860
 Wow.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.860
 God, she's versatile.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.860
 I know.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.860
 So he was a third president, right?

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.860
 After Washington and then, he was at John Adams.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.860
 Yep.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.860
 And he, you know, he did a lot of, he had a lot of remarkable achievements in office.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.860
 As we said, after the Declaration of Independence, he's also responsible for a phrase

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.860
 that was a massive hit in the 19th century in America.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.860
 Oh, I tell you this.

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:17.860
 Yeah.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:18.860
 So he bumped into a man near his home.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.860
 This is the story.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.860
 No one knows if it's true or not.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:22.860
 But this guy started complaining.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.860
 They were riding the horses next to each other, some neighbor of his.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.860
 And the guy was complaining about everything in Washington and all these ideas they had running things.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.860
 So he talked for a couple of hours.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.860
 He talked Jefferson's ear off about all this.

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.860
 And then eventually, they got to Jefferson's house and Jefferson said, "Well, this is me."

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.860
 Is that the phrase?

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.860
 No.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.860
 That would have been a great phrase.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.860
 This is me.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.860
 So the guy eventually asked pretty much the first question he'd asked this whole time.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.860
 And he said, "What's your name, by the way?"

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.860
 And the guy said, "Well, my name is Thomas Jefferson."

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.860
 A massive social clang of this guy's made.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:56.860
 He was deeply embarrassed.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.860
 And so he couldn't think of everything to say.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.860
 And he just said, "My name is Haynes."

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.860
 And then he galloped away on his horse.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.860
 So this became a phrase, "My name is Haynes," which is whenever you had to leave suddenly,

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.860
 or whenever you were massively embarrassed about something.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.860
 Well, it was basically the 19th century.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:12.860
 Boy was my face red.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.860
 That's great.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.860
 I'll get my coats, kind of think.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.860
 Yes, it is like that.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.860
 Wow.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.860
 And what was it?

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:18.860
 My name is Haynes.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.860
 My name is Haynes.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.860
 My name is Haynes.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.860
 Let's start doing it.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.860
 And just very quickly on typos in the Bible, there are some absolute doosies.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.860
 So there's one in the 1682.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.860
 There's a 1682 edition, which gets called the Cannibal's Bible.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.860
 Because there's a typo, it should be, if the latter husband hates her,

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.860
 and they mistyped it, so it's if the latter husband ate her.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.860
 I'm talking about his wife.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.860
 And there's a great one, the 1944 King James, which has a line, which should be,

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.860
 "Submit yourselves to your own husbands."

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.860
 It's advice for wives, basically.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.860
 But accidentally reads, "Submit yourselves to your owl husbands."

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.860
 Yeah.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.860
 It's good advice.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:03.860
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.860
 My fact is that in 19th century America, caviar was a free bar snack.

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.860
 Yeah.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.860
 Actually, I hate caviar.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:12.860
 Do you?

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.860
 Oh, well.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:19.860
 I don't like things that are savory that have the kind of texture that I think sweet things should have.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.860
 That's understandable.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.860
 Well, I know where and when you should not go on holiday.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:29.860
 In 19th century America, because you couldn't move for it, it was so readily available.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:35.860
 Because there was huge sturgeon fish, the fish that caviar comes from, or classic caviar anyway.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.860
 And they were just so thick in the rivers that people put it in bars, basically like peanuts, to make people thirsty.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.860
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.860
 That's the way of getting people, because it was very salty stuff, so there was a way of getting people thirsty.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.860
 Well, yeah, because it used to be used like salt as well, didn't it?

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.860
 You'd sprinkle it on a meal just to add a little bit of salty flavour.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.860
 Yeah.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.860
 How did they use to eat it?

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.860
 Because from what I've read, the best place, and the sort of most encouraged place to eat it from,

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:02.860
 is the little bit of skin between your index finger and your thumb, so you place it on there.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.860
 Oh, that's the, what's that called, the Snuff Box?

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.860
 Snuff Box, yeah.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.860
 It's called the Natural Snuff Box or something.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.860
 They say it's because they don't taint the taste by doing that.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:17.860
 So if you use a metal spoon, for example, that has a metal-y taste that can affect the caviar.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:24.860
 That sounds just like the kind of thing that high society makes up the weird way to eat the high society food, isn't it?

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.860
 But I think it was a bar snack that surely should be on a cocktail stick.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.860
 And you could get one little egg at first.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.860
 I would think it would just be in a bowl like peanuts with like 12 different types of urine.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.860
 I think it's like that.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.860
 Exactly.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.860
 People don't wash their hands from the back of the toilet.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.860
 It's very spiritual to get on your fingers.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.860
 Yeah.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.860
 You can just do it straight with the fingers.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.860
 Yeah, probably not.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.860
 I mean, you need to have a finger bowl next to it.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.860
 Yeah.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.860
 Let's say in Russia you have it on Blini, so maybe they had little bits of bread.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.860
 That's perfect.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.860
 That's like a little micro plate for each bit of caviar.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:56.860
 That's a very nice way of eating, I think.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.860
 But this is the thing.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.860
 So US caviar was so common, but Russian caviar was thought to be a lot better.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:07.860
 So quite often, US caviar was exported to Europe and then it was repackaged and relabelled as Russian caviar.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.860
 And it was exported back to the States and sold as Russian caviar as better stuff, even like what?

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.860
 Exactly the same.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.860
 Am I using it?

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.860
 Yeah.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.860
 And basically what happened was the caviar in America was extremely numerous, like you say,

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.860
 because of Sturgeon were numerous, but then they overfished them.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.860
 And then that meant there was no caviar left in America anymore, which meant you had to get it from Russia,

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.860
 which made it much more expensive.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.860
 Exactly.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.860
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:31.860
 Yeah.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.860
 Because in Russia before then, before the Western demand increased in Russia, it was sort of peasant food as well.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:37.860
 It wasn't there.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.860
 It was considered much more peasant foodie than sauerkraut, for instance, which is more of a delicacy.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.860
 And they used it just as a flavouring.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:51.860
 And it was only when there's currently a Greek guy called Johannes Varvakis, who discovered Russian caviar on his travels.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.860
 So this is delicious.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.860
 I'm going to introduce it to High Society in Europe.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.860
 And then that was what shot its prices up.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.860
 He made it fashionable, kind of just shows that food, how much you value it, is just about how fashionable someone says it is.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:04.860
 Yeah.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.860
 Apparently, if you were to take, let's say, a 45 kilogram barrel of caviar.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.860
 I'm not putting us up my Boston days.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.860
 No, not after last time.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.860
 But if you would take this massive barrel of caviar, which is kind of how they transport it,

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:21.860
 it would take a farm labourer two weeks to earn it back in the olden days in Russia.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.860
 And now it would take a decade for them to earn it.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.860
 Wow.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.860
 Jesus.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:27.860
 That is amazing.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:28.860
 Big difference.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.860
 I guess so much of it is because it's sturgeon.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.860
 I mean, you get salmon caviar and you get lump-fish caviar.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:37.860
 And there are all sorts of other much, much cheaper meals, which are just fish eggs, basically, of different kinds.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.860
 But sturgeon has this kind of, you know, supposed hallmark of quality about it.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.860
 It's pretty similar.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:43.860
 So, okay, here's a question.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.860
 Is caviar vegetarian?

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.860
 Because it is eggs.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:46.860
 Not vegan.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.860
 For sure.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:48.860
 Not vegan.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.860
 I'd say no, because you have to kill the sturgeon in order to get it.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.860
 Fair play.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.860
 However, there is some, I think, vegetarian caviar out there, where they don't kill the sturgeon.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.860
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.860
 They make a tiny incision, and then they massage the sturgeon to get it out of them.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.860
 Oh, that's nice.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.860
 That's quite a rough massage.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:07.860
 I'm a rich, good builder.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.860
 This is a company in Leeds.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.860
 And then you just squeeze the sturgeon like a toothpaste, too, basically, and all the caviar comes out of it.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.860
 But...

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.860
 And then you put it back in the water?

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.860
 Yeah, it survives.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.860
 You keep them.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.860
 Yeah, I was reading about this, actually.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:20.860
 Yeah.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.860
 You can repeat the process every 15 months.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:23.860
 Yeah.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.860
 Yeah.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.860
 I read that there was a scientist called Angela Coller.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.860
 She spent nine years trying to work out how you didn't...

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.860
 You wouldn't have to kill the sturgeon in order to extract the eggs.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.860
 And I believe it was her who pioneered it.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.860
 It could be wrong.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.860
 Maybe multiple people around the world had the same idea.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.860
 But the process isn't just doing what you said with the incision.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.860
 They give the sturgeons an ultrasound to see if they're ready.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.860
 And then they have a protein administered, which you're talking about, which releases the eggs.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.860
 And then they massage them out like a toothpaste tuna.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.860
 Yeah.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.860
 That's really funny.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:54.860
 An ultrasound for a fish.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.860
 Yeah.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:56.860
 You're going to have 100,000 babies.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:57.860
 Congratulations.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:03.860
 I think they have to give them ultrasound anyway, because there's no way of telling if they're male or female.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.860
 So you need to make sure that you've got a female fish.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.860
 I think so from the outside.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.860
 So you have to check their innards anyway.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.860
 Check your own hands.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.860
 That's incredible.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:21.860
 One way that you might get some eggs without killing the sturgeon is sometimes producers will take some of the eggs out to check if they're ready or not.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.860
 Because you don't want to kill your sturgeon, get all the eggs out, and it's not at the right stage.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:33.860
 And so some fisheries will take a female sturgeon, put a incision in her, put a straw in her,

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.860
 and then suck out some of the eggs to taste them to see if they taste right.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.860
 And then if they're right, then they'll kill the sturgeon and get the eggs.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.860
 And if they're wrong, then they'll just let her go for a while.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.860
 That must be something someone's doing in a posh ration restaurant.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.860
 It's just serving up live sturgeon.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.860
 Jamming its straw.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.860
 I'll just screw it.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.860
 Yes, but we only have paper straws in our food.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.860
 So it's good for the environment.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.860
 And then if it's not ready yet, do you just sew it back up?

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.860
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.860
 And then that is insane.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.860
 Isn't it true?

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.860
 They have a bit of a rough old ride sturgeon, because it's not just caviar.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.860
 We also use them for beer.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.860
 Don't we? Traditionally, they were the original icing glass providers.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.860
 So that's the swim bladder.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.860
 And that's what they used to kind of purify beer.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.860
 It was used in things like Guinness until a couple of years ago.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.860
 I think they got rid of it.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.860
 It's to clarify alcoholic drinks.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.860
 Sorry, I don't fully understand it.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.860
 You get the swim bladder, and it's just used in the wine making or the beer making process

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.860
 to get rid of a lot of the sediment.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.860
 I think it's kind of used like a sieve.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.860
 And so that's why a lot of beers aren't vegetarian or vegetarian.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.860
 A lot of vegans kind of have wine come, though, because of that reason.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.860
 Sturgeon are amazing, amazing, amazing fish.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.860
 They can weigh up to 1,500 kilos.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.860
 Okay, like that's a lot.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.860
 I work in stone.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.860
 There's a lot of stone.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.860
 It is.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:51.860
 No, they are massive.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.860
 They are up to 28 feet long, which I find.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.860
 Sorry.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.860
 I mean, that's, yeah, 28 feet long.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:57.860
 Right.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:58.860
 The surgeon.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:59.860
 Thank you.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:00.860
 Those are the very, very biggest ever found with that.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.860
 Yeah.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.860
 They've been around that.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:03.860
 Okay.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.860
 That's the biggest surgeon.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:09.860
 So it's, I think the beluga surgeon is the second biggest kind of bony fish.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.860
 And yeah, it's just length of four men.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:12.860
 That is extraordinary.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:13.860
 Yeah.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.860
 I see.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.860
 And they take a long time to, this is one of the reasons why caviar is so valuable

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.860
 is that they take so long to reach maturity, right?

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.860
 The biggest one sometimes there is not until about 20 that they're producing enough caviar.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.860
 Wow.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.860
 You have to wait forever.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.860
 So as well as eating fish eggs, you can eat fish sperm.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.860
 There's something called Shirako.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.860
 That's probably not how you pronounce it in Japan.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.860
 It translates as white children.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:43.860
 And it's the raw or cooked sperm of the codfish.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.860
 And in Russia, they eat the sperm of herrings, because they like herrings in Russia.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.860
 They don't, they preserve it, but not only do they eat it on their own sometimes,

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.860
 they will eat it with the row of herrings as well.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.860
 So they eat the eggs of the herring and the sperm of the herring in the same meal.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:01.860
 It's the same meal.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.860
 I think that's a little unkind, isn't it?

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:04.860
 Why?

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:05.860
 To whom?

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.860
 To the sperm and the eggs, because they belong together.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.860
 They should be...

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:09.860
 Well, you're marrying them.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.860
 Then you eat one of each and then a herring grows in your stomach.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.860
 It's not like if you eat an apple seed, then an apple tree will grow out of your mouth.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.860
 Oh man, we've got a lot of stuff to fill you up.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.860
 I do feel like if I eat the sperm on the eggs of a herring,

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.860
 I would genuinely worry about that.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.860
 Right, yeah.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:26.860
 You'd worry.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.860
 A little bit.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.860
 The sperm is called Malokka, which I thought was Russian for milk.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.860
 And you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.860
 And you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.860
 And you came back with a pint the other day.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.860
 I hope you enjoyed your tea.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.860
 You get ant caviar too.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:44.860
 That's a thing.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:45.860
 What's that?

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.860
 It's not pupae and larvae, you know, so it's not eggs really,

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.860
 but it's from a particular Mexican ant,

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.860
 which is known locally as La Hormiga Pedora.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.860
 You say that as if there's only one ant.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.860
 Incredibly.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.860
 It's incredibly expensive stuff.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.860
 I can't shop.

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.860
 He cooks it as well as producing it.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.860
 So it's a real treat if you're in town.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.860
 No La Hormiga Pedora is the farty ant,

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.860
 because they're next to smell like farts.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.860
 But the eggs are a delicacy or the larvae, you know.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.860
 You do get snail caviar, don't you?

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.860
 Which is quite like fish caviar,

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.860
 apart from it tastes a bit more like snails.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.860
 Have you tried it?

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:24.860
 Yeah.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.860
 Wow.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.860
 You got cowboy caviar?

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.860
 Is that made of the eggs of cowboys?

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:31.860
 No, it's slang.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.860
 It's bulls' testicles that are fried.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.860
 So they're also known as rocky mountain oysters.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:37.860
 Have you?

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.860
 But they also, they would have those as bar snacks,

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:40.860
 wouldn't they?

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.860
 In the olden days,

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.860
 you would have testicles as bar snacks.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.860
 What?

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:45.860
 They eat them a lot somewhere.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.860
 I think it might be in Mexico.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.860
 It's still a commonity.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.860
 It's a thing somewhere in South America.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.860
 It was a Montana testicle festival that I read about them in.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:54.860
 So maybe Montana as well.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:55.860
 It makes sense.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.860
 You're going to eat them anywhere.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:57.860
 It's going to be there.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.860
 Confusingly, it's also from what I can tell online,

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.860
 cowboy caviar is a salad,

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.860
 which is just a lot of salad bits thrown together.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.860
 So there's no sense to it.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.860
 Wow.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.860
 So be careful when ordering.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.860
 If you're a vegetarian in Montana.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:11.860
 Yeah.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.860
 What else happens at a testicle festival?

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.860
 I think it's a lot of eating of testicles competitively.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.860
 Testicle festival is a very nice phrase to say.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.860
 It is.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.860
 It is.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.860
 It's very nice.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:24.860
 Shave waxing of testicles probably.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:25.860
 Yeah.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.860
 I'd have there waxing competitions.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.860
 There's the big bowl contest that I've got here,

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.860
 which is men in wet underwear.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:31.860
 So I guess.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:32.860
 No.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.860
 That's what it says here.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.860
 I wonder if you could call it the festival.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:36.860
 Yes, you could.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:37.860
 All the testicle.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.860
 No, neither of this good is as good as testicle festival.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.860
 No.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.860
 Anyway, they branded it right.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.860
 They branded it right.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.860
 Well done, guys.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:45.860
 There's another caviar.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.860
 There's a caviar sort of replacement you can have,

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.860
 which is very much like the real Russian thing.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.860
 And this is a replacement for a Russian Sevruga caviar.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.860
 And this is a kind of caviar that you can get from paddlefish.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.860
 And basically, where most paddlefish are,

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.860
 is a place called Warsaw in Missouri.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.860
 And so apparently it's so good this stuff.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.860
 And all the Russians in Missouri think that this is just like

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.860
 their Sevruga caviar back home.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:14.860
 And so there's this huge black market caviar fishing problem there.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.860
 And it was really good.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.860
 It was this was on Longweed.com, I think.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.860
 A really good Longweed about it.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.860
 And it was about police descending on this place.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.860
 And it's population doubles in the paddlefish fishing season,

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.860
 which is just a couple of weeks long,

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.860
 because people flock there to try and get these fish

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.860
 and get the caviar out of it.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.860
 And they thought we know there are all these Russian people

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.860
 who are coming and they're illegally poaching these fish

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.860
 and then they're going, obviously, selling them.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.860
 They're getting so many.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.860
 And gradually, as you're reading this our school,

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.860
 you realize the police have this massive problem,

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.860
 because even though they know these fish are disappearing,

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.860
 they know they're illegally taking them.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.860
 They can't track down any kind of black market.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.860
 They can't trace any money.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.860
 And it turns out when actually they start arresting people

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.860
 and when they go undercover, then no one's selling it at all.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.860
 It's just all these Russians are picking it.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:30:59.860
 They're just eating it.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.860
 They've just got these big Russian families.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.860
 So they'll get tens of thousands of pounds worth of caviar

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.860
 or some of them will have about 1,000 pounds worth

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.860
 of just the fish themselves.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.860
 And they're like, no, why would I sell this?

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:12.860
 We're going to sell this.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.860
 They just take it back to their big families

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.860
 and they eat it all.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.860
 And so there's nothing really that they can do.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.860
 They just get taken to the police station and told,

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:20.860
 please don't take that fish again.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.860
 And then send home.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.860
 Yeah, they're just liking it.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.860
 They like it in Russia.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:27.860
 I can say that much.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:28.860
 I think it's delicious.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.860
 I was reading about a sniffer cat called Russick.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.860
 Sniffer cat.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:34.860
 Sniffer cat.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.860
 Are they just praces?

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.860
 This entire long read.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.860
 It looks like a good district in America.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.860
 Look at Sniffer cat.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.860
 Which looks like a bit of research.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.860
 I've never seen an elephant research

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:46.860
 from an hour ago.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.860
 This is in Russia.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.860
 There was a lot of smuggling

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.860
 or was a lot of smuggling in the Caspian Sea.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.860
 So they would come to a checkpoint

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.860
 and people would try and get it through on their cars.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.860
 And they found that that was a big problem.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.860
 But they had this cat that they had adopted

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.860
 that was, I believe, a stray who loved eating chunks of sturgeon

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.860
 and caviar and so on.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.860
 That was being confiscated from the criminals.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.860
 As a result, developed in a really strong nose

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.860
 for Sniffer now, whenever there was sturgeon in the area.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.860
 So what they stopped, what they started doing was

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.860
 every time a car came up, the cat would be sent to go

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.860
 and, you know, maybe they walked on the leash.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:24.860
 I didn't actually get that detail.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.860
 And Russik would have a smell and smell out all of these bits

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:29.860
 of sturgeon and caviar.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.860
 And so good was he at doing it

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.860
 that they actually retired the Sniffer dog that they had.

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.860
 Oh, that has got to hurt.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.860
 Yeah, Sniffer dog and you lose your job to a cat.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.860
 Yeah, first I lost my job to the elephant in that airport

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:44.860
 and now the rest.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.860
 But yeah, so, unfortunately, he died in 2013

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.860
 when a vehicle that he was searching

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.860
 suddenly jerked forward.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.860
 Convenience.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.860
 I can't believe they didn't do that sooner.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.860
 I can't believe no smuggler thought

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.860
 of doing that straight away.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.860
 So, they've got the cat smelling the cars.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.860
 Are they stationing it on the pavement

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.860
 and cars whizz pass?

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.860
 And the cat said like, "Rewr."

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.860
 And then you know, just stop at that.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.860
 It's not like a speed gun.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.860
 This is surely at a checkpoint.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:12.860
 It's a checkpoint.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.860
 You have to stop at checkpoint.

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:17.860
 Hold the gun to the cat and pointing at cars as they go past.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.860
 You pull its tail when you want it to snow something.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:24.860
 For sure they want you to stop to car

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.860
 and you've opened the doors.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.860
 Isn't it as easy for you?

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.860
 We've just covered our big sturgeoner.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.860
 I would say I could find sturgeon as easily

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.860
 and quickly over a cat.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.860
 You're right, they're massive.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:36.860
 They're really big.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.860
 They were sat in the sort of passenger seat

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.860
 with a hat and a fake mask.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.860
 Who's my friend Bob?

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.860
 What do you say, Kitty?

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.860
 That's a sturgeon.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.860
 Thank God for Rosset or whatever he's called.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.860
 Otherwise I would have believed in Bob.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.860
 And it stinks.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.860
 I mean, if there's a car full of fish,

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.860
 I'm going to smell it.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.860
 I need a magic cat.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.860
 But maybe his gift was in telling people about it.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:03.860
 Oh yeah.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.860
 Like most cats, if they smell, they're not going to tell you.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.860
 They're not going to throw someone up.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:09.860
 I've not ridden down the most interesting bit of the story.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.860
 It was a talking cat.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.860
 I'm so sorry.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.860
 I missed out the best detail.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:21.860
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.860
 And that is my fact.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.860
 My fact this week is that wrestling star Andre the Giant

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.860
 was so massive that once when he drunkenly passed out

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.860
 in a hotel lobby, staff couldn't move him

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.860
 and had to corner him off with velvet ropes

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.860
 until he woke up.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:37.860
 So amazing.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.860
 This is, yeah, this is from an anecdote

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.860
 that comes from a book called "As You Wish"

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.860
 "Inconceivable Tales from the Making of the Princess Bride"

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.860
 by Carrie Elwes, who was the lead actor in it.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.860
 He was also in Robin Hood men and types.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.860
 And the whole book is just anecdotes about the time

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.860
 that they were making the movie.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.860
 And that's what came out.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.860
 The fact that he used to have all these drunken exescapades,

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.860
 one of which meant he passed down.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.860
 And Andre the Giant was in that movie as well, right?

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.860
 He played "Fesick, the Giant."

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:07.860
 Yeah.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:08.860
 You're a really typecast, wasn't he?

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:09.860
 Yeah.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.860
 He wasn't going to play "Fesick, the Giant."

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.860
 And he was a wrestler, Andre the Giant.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.860
 He was a wrestler before he was a film star, really.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.860
 Absolutely.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:18.860
 I mean, that's his big career thing, really.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.860
 Well, before that, he was a rugby player

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.860
 and before that, he was in a furniture removal business.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.860
 And before that, he was a child.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:27.860
 Before that, he was a tiny egg.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.860
 A professional egg.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.860
 But to the WWF, now the WWE, he is one of the great wrestling stars

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:34.860
 of all time.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.860
 He was in the period of Hulk Hogan and Macho Man

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.860
 and ultimately Warrior, that sort of very classic era

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.860
 when they started.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.860
 I just don't get wrestling.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.860
 What?

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.860
 It doesn't make any sense to me.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.860
 We've covered it before on this podcast

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.860
 and I find it impossible to research.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.860
 Because everything you read about it, you were like,

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.860
 is this real?

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.860
 Did this really happen?

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:58.860
 The confusion of real sport and fake acting is bewildering.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.860
 Like there's this fight between him and Hulk Hogan,

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.860
 which was this really famous fight.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.860
 And apparently it was super controversial.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:12.860
 It was in 1988 and there was a famous referee called Dave Hebner

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.860
 who was refereed wrestling matches.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.860
 And he happened to have an identical twin.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.860
 Oh, yes.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.860
 Who they tracked down for this match.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.860
 And yeah, the referee had an identical twin.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.860
 He didn't really, I think.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.860
 No, he did really.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.860
 I've seen the actual pictures.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.860
 Either he did, or there's some amazing Photoshop in going on.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.860
 But he had this identical twin.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:36.860
 And so, right, Andre the Giant's agent got Dave,

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.860
 who was supposed to referee the match, locked him in a cupboard,

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.860
 and then bribed Earl, his identical twin,

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.860
 to referee the game instead.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.860
 And he did.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.860
 And then he made Andre the Giant one.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.860
 And then Dave broke out of his closet.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.860
 And then him and his identical twin brother had a big fight afterwards

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:53.860
 in front of the coach.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:55.860
 This is the weirdest conversation.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.860
 I really want to hear Adam do the Coventry of WWF.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.860
 I don't understand any of this.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.860
 Is that real?

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.860
 Oh my god.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.860
 But the story lies.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.860
 The story lies.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.860
 You go to the theatre all the time.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.860
 Are you standing up?

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.860
 What the fuck is going on here?

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.860
 No, no, no.

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.860
 Because in the right-ups of the theatre,

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.860
 it doesn't say,

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.860
 and there was an incredibly controversial moment

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:19.860
 when Hamlet's mother remarried Hamlet's uncle

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.860
 and the audience, you're like,

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.860
 "Okay, this is a story.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.860
 There was in the Wikipedia page that this is not here."

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.860
 Was it controversial?

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.860
 Was it all made up?

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.860
 It's all made up.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.860
 It's all made up.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:31.860
 It's all made up.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.860
 Then why is it controversial?

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.860
 It's controversial in the world of wrestling.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:36.860
 Which is a fake world.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.860
 Yeah.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.860
 Yeah.

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.860
 Okay.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:40.860
 Now you're getting it.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.860
 No, it is weird how it's presented as true.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.860
 Normally, if it plays, there is a synopsis.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.860
 Normally when you go out of the play,

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.860
 the thing doesn't keep happening else.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:51.860
 No, but...

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.860
 I just think it's amazing that we found

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.860
 the edge of Anna's comfort zone.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.860
 Yeah.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:57.860
 I never thought we'd get there.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.860
 Who would know as pro wrestling is fake?

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:05.860
 It just makes me have a panic attack when I read about it.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.860
 But it's a drama, like he's standards.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:08.860
 It goes on and on.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.860
 Of course it's happening.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.860
 Don't smash out into the news at 10.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.860
 And suddenly, they're rolling in.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.860
 What about the guy from Holyoke's was fighting the guy

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:17.860
 from Emma Dale last week?

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.860
 What?

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.860
 I missed that.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.860
 Yeah, one of them got fired in real life, I think.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.860
 Yeah.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:23.860
 Although this is all making me wonder about everything.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.860
 Anyway, hang on.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.860
 So there was a real life fight between a character.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:27.860
 Someone in...

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.860
 Someone in Emadale and someone in Holyoke's.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.860
 Was it Holyoke's?

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.860
 Yes, it was Holyoke's.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.860
 Yes.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:33.860
 They got in a big fight.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.860
 Oh, physical fight.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.860
 Yeah.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.860
 I thought you meant that someone from Holyoke's turned up in Emadale.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.860
 Like a character sort of made his way through the membrane

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.860
 and he ended up...

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.860
 Because I definitely watched that as well.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.860
 Like a weird portal opens between the world.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.860
 It's like the treatment show or something.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.860
 Yeah.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.860
 One of them pint glasses from the old fix.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.860
 Snashes through into coronation street.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.860
 Look, we get back to Andre the giant.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.860
 Sorry, I'll take the giant.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.860
 Oh, what's here, giant?

00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.860
 So no.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.860
 It was actually three children in a massive overcome.

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:07.860
 So when he was drinking according to Carrie Ellers,

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:12.860
 when he was drinking in New York once, the NYPD had to send an undercover cop

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.860
 to follow him around the bars because if he got too drunk,

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.860
 there was once time where he fell over and crushed a human underneath

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.860
 and they didn't want that to happen again.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:22.860
 Yeah.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.860
 Not to death.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.860
 No, no, no, no.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.860
 I think he was stuck.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.860
 You know, that's seven foot two of massive body on him.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.860
 He got so tall because he had acromegaly.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.860
 That was the cause of his giant size.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.860
 His parents did not recognise him.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.860
 So he left home at 14.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.860
 He came back at 19 and they said, "Who are you?"

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.860
 And they'd even seen him wrestling on TV without recognising who he was.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.860
 But yeah, they didn't realise him took quite late, right?

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.860
 So he wasn't sort of amazingly huge.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.860
 It was normal until he was 15.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.860
 Normal size until he was 15, yeah.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.860
 And we keep saying he gets drunk.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.860
 But to give him credit, I don't think he really did get drunk very often.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.860
 He basically held his drink incredibly well

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.860
 and he drank extraordinary amounts.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.860
 He'd drink over 100 beers in a night and be fine.

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.860
 Or I think someone was once asked how much can he drink before he's drunk

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:14.860
 and someone said he starts to feel it after the first bottle of vodka or something.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:20.860
 He used to order a drink, which was a concoction that consisted of 40 ounces of just random liquids,

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.860
 which he called the American.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.860
 He just had it poured into a pitcher.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.860
 And I'm glad he didn't have a cocktail bar because that is the most disgusting sounding drink.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.860
 To the random liquids on the menu.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.860
 Well, that's Kerry Elves, again, this is from him.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.860
 And he says it, "I've never tasted aeroplane fuel, but imagine it's very garlic."

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.860
 It's like a top shelf you would have.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.860
 Like, let's say it was your 21st birthday and your friends,

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.860
 what did you get drunk?

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:42.860
 They'd buy you a top shelf,

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.860
 which is basically one of every shot in a glass.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:45.860
 Oh.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.860
 Your friends would have done the same thing, I'm sure.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.860
 Well, yeah, we would have done, but we didn't finish our croquet in time,

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.860
 so we all had to go home.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.860
 When Andre the Giant was in Paris one day,

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.860
 he realized that the cars there were quite small

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.860
 and he could just move them around if he wanted to because he was so strong.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.860
 And so he would get his friends, because in America, they're much bigger, right?

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:09.860
 So he would get his friends cars and then move them into tiny little spaces where they couldn't go.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.860
 Got to make parking easier.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.860
 If you could just get out of the car and lift it into the space.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.860
 That's such a good idea.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.860
 You could hardly get into cars.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:18.860
 He was so huge.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:22.860
 There's photos of him getting in and out of a car.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.860
 And he basically had to go in on all fours

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.860
 and be the entire backseat was him.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.860
 You know?

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.860
 Yeah, he once got into a taxi and they couldn't close the door.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.860
 Wow.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.860
 I think we've done it on the podcast before,

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.860
 but when he was a kid, because he couldn't get the bus, the normal bus,

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.860
 he used to be driven to school by Samuel Beckett.

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.860
 Samuel Beckett.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:40.860
 But that's not true.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:41.860
 Is that not true?

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.860
 That was actually another thing that Elle was claimed.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.860
 But it wasn't quite true.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:50.860
 So he grew up in the same French town weirdly as Samuel Beckett moved to in Malia.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.860
 And apparently Beckett was kind of a friendly guy and used to drive the kids to school.

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.860
 Okay.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.860
 And in a way, there was okay back then.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.860
 And he sometimes he would hit to ride with them, but he could fit on the bus.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.860
 Because how small would a bus have to be if, you know?

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.860
 No, he had a pickup truck.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.860
 And the kids would sit on the back of the truck.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.860
 So it was true that he used to be a lift.

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.860
 Yes, he did.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.860
 It just wasn't because he couldn't fit on the bus.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:11.860
 Right.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:12.860
 Yeah, got it.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:13.860
 He was a really nice guy, though, wasn't he?

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.860
 Everyone said, he was very much a gentle giant, everyone called him.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:22.860
 And someone said he didn't like cursing people, which now I understand that resting isn't really

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.860
 about really hurting people does make sense.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:29.860
 But he was friends with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Arnold Schwarzenegger in this PBS documentary

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.860
 that you should watch if you're really interested in Andre the Giant.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.860
 But Arnold Schwarzenegger said that he was a restaurant within once.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:40.860
 And Andre used to always insist on paying for anyone's dinner or anyone's drinks when he went out with them.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.860
 And so Arnold knew this and he tried to sort of sneakily pay.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.860
 And Andre lifted him up off his chair and put him on top of a cupboard.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.860
 That's brilliant.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.860
 Oh, it's bizarrely.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.860
 And it's weird saying Arnold Schwarzenegger say this word.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.860
 It's an arm-war.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.860
 So he says, "And Andre just lifted me up and he put me onto the arm-war."

00:42:58.860 --> 00:42:59.860
 Wow.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:03.860
 I thought I'd see Arnold Schwarzenegger use the word arm-war.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.860
 He was meant to play physics.

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.860
 He was meant to play the role in Princess Royce.

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:08.860
 Yeah.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:09.860
 He was the original casting choice.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.860
 A lot of different films.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.860
 Yeah.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.860
 And he didn't because it took so long to make, didn't it?

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:15.860
 It took about a decade to make.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:18.860
 And by then, Arnold Schwarzenegger was too famous.

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.860
 It took a decade to get into production, I think.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.860
 And by then, Arnold Schwarzenegger had a real career.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:23.860
 Gosh.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:24.860
 Wow.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:25.860
 I've got some facts about alcohol tolerance.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.860
 But I don't know if you got more on Andre the Giant.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.860
 I just said he kept a small farm and he would walk around and play with the animals

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.860
 because they didn't stare at him for his size.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.860
 I think that's bullshit as well, but worth saying.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.860
 No, I think he definitely likes not being stared at.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:41.860
 It's kind of a tragic life he had because he was obviously lovely

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.860
 and knew his career depended on being huge.

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.860
 But at the same time, he said the Princess Bride was the happiest he'd ever been

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.860
 filming that because for the first time ever, people didn't stare at him

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.860
 because I guess he was just an actor on set and then you were to expect.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:53.860
 He loved it.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:58.860
 And in fact, there's a really nice interview with one of his friends called Lanny

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:03.860
 who said that after he'd filmed the Princess Bride, Andre invited him out to his house

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.860
 and gave him a bunch of alcohol and said, "Hey, Jonah, come into my drawing room.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.860
 I'll show you something."

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.860
 And made him watch the film.

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.860
 And then he kept inviting him around and kept making him watch.

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.860
 And he did it with all his friends because he loved.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.860
 He was so proud of it.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.860
 And he said, "You know, did you think I was good in it?

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:17.860
 Do you think I was right in the Princess Bride?"

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.860
 And they'd all be like, "Yeah, you were really great in that, don't worry."

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:21.860
 Have you guys all seen this movie?

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.860
 Yeah.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.860
 Because I actually don't even know what it's about.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:24.860
 Oh, okay.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:25.860
 Is it a, is it a...

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.860
 It's a fan to see, yeah.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:29.860
 But a very funny one.

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.860
 Yeah.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.860
 It is an amazing film, if anyone listening hasn't.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:33.860
 Yeah, it's a classic.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:34.860
 Yeah.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:35.860
 Yeah, it's very good.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.860
 I also did a bit of reading about just other people who drank a lot.

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:39.860
 Okay.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:40.860
 So all of a read.

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:41.860
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:42.860
 The great hellraisers of the 20th Century.

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:43.860
 I didn't know this.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:47.860
 He would frequently expose his penis when drunk, standard practice, I guess.

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.860
 But he got a tattoo of an eagle's claw on his penis.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:52.860
 Oh.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:53.860
 I know.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:54.860
 Well, it was just a tattoo of one.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:55.860
 It wasn't an actual claw.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.860
 Yeah, but do you think people got confused and thought, "An eagle had landed on his jaw?"

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:04.860
 Well, he then lays, we've got an eagle's head tattooed on his shoulder.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.860
 And he would show fellow drinkers his shoulder tattoo.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:10.860
 And then he'd say, "Would you like to see where it's perched and make it this cock out?"

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:11.860
 Wow.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:12.860
 I know.

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:16.860
 That's quite a labour-intensive practical joke.

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:17.860
 Yeah, really?

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.860
 So he died on the set of Gladiator.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.860
 You know, they had to sort of reconstitute his role for the final film.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.860
 But when he died, he'd had 12 double rums, lots of whiskey and an arm wrestle.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:30.860
 Which of those killed him?

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.860
 I think it was the previous 60-odd years that killed him.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:34.860
 Yeah, yeah.

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.860
 Well, yeah.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.860
 Just another film giant is Richard Kiel.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.860
 And he's the guy who played Jaws in...

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:41.860
 Oh, Jaws.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.860
 In Jaws.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.860
 He was amazing.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:46.860
 I really believe it.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:47.860
 He's actually a sturgeon.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:52.860
 So famous fish, Richard Kiel.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.860
 No, he played Jaws in the Bond films.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.860
 But he had lots of jobs before he became an actor.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:58.860
 So he was...

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.860
 First of all, he was a cemetery plot salesman.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:01.860
 I just like the...

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.860
 So he was seven foot two, whatever, seven foot three.

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.860
 Imagine someone selling you a cemetery plot who's a giant.

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.860
 And then he was a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:09.860
 Wow.

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:10.860
 You know how, if you're...

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.860
 If you bury someone, they're six feet under.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:13.860
 Hmm.

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.860
 He could stand at the bottom of that plot and still talk to you.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.860
 He could be able to see his face.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:20.860
 Wow.

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.860
 A miles to see a vacuum cleaner salesman.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:23.860
 A vacuum cleaner salesman.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.860
 And then he married a woman called Diane, who was five foot one.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.860
 And she did an interview and they said...

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:29.860
 Yeah, also, sorry.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.860
 He's got lovely needs.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.860
 Interestingly, the opposite.

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.860
 They said, "Why did you marry him?"

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.860
 And she said, "We just see eye to eye on most things."

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:38.860
 Oh, sweet.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:39.860
 Sorry, sweet.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:40.860
 Any more for any more?

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.860
 I'm done.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:42.860
 I'm out.

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:43.860
 I mean, I'll just tell you.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:44.860
 Go on, tell us.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.860
 Well, it's just another hell-raise effect.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:47.860
 It's not really relevant.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:48.860
 But a Petro tool?

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:49.860
 Yeah.

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.860
 A big old drinker.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.860
 When he was filming Lawrence of Arabia, he found and bought a precious pair of Greek earrings,

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.860
 but he had to get them through customs.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:58.860
 So he smuggled them through in his foreskin.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:46:59.860
 Oh, wow.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:00.860
 No.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:01.860
 What did he expect that?

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.860
 I told you it wasn't relevant.

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:05.860
 They're going...

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.860
 Are you sure, jumbo?

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.860
 Are you sure it's that?

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.860
 We better get the cat as well.

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.860
 A second of it, you know.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.860
 She's an elephant.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:18.860
 He's a cat.

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:21.860
 Together, they might cry.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.860
 Okay, that is it.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.860
 That is all of our facts.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.860
