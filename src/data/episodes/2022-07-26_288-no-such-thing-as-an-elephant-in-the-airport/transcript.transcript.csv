00:00:00,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:23,to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anna Chuzinski, James Harkin and Andrew"
00:00:27,00:00:31,Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:31,00:00:36,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:36,00:00:38,"Starting with you, James."
00:00:38,00:00:43,"Okay, my pet this week is that elephants can tell how much of something is in a closed"
00:00:43,00:00:46,bucket by smell alone.
00:00:46,00:00:48,It's so cool.
00:00:48,00:00:50,It's so amazing.
00:00:50,00:00:53,"So let's say, let me take one of you for instance Dan."
00:00:53,00:00:54,Yes.
00:00:54,00:00:55,As I'm looking at you.
00:00:55,00:00:56,Hello.
00:00:56,00:00:57,Yeah.
00:00:57,00:01:00,And one of them has got three steaks on and the other one's got one steak.
00:01:00,00:01:02,You'd know which one had the most steaks on them right.
00:01:02,00:01:07,But if you had two boxes of conflicts that were both closed you wouldn't be able to tell
00:01:07,00:01:10,which one was full of conflicts and which one isn't full of conflicts and elephants can
00:01:10,00:01:11,do this.
00:01:11,00:01:13,So that's insane.
00:01:13,00:01:18,Am I allowed to shake the cornflake boxes and are they allowed to shake the buckets with
00:01:18,00:01:19,their users?
00:01:19,00:01:20,You're allowed to do whatever you want.
00:01:20,00:01:21,Uh huh.
00:01:21,00:01:23,No one's going to stop you unless you do it too much in Sainsbury's.
00:01:23,00:01:28,"But the elephants know they didn't do any touch at all, it was all completely by smell."
00:01:28,00:01:33,And it was in their particular case it was two buckets containing 11 different ratios
00:01:33,00:01:38,of some flour seeds and they managed to choose the bucket with the most some flour seeds
00:01:38,00:01:43,59% to 82% of the time which is more than you would expect by chance.
00:01:43,00:01:46,"And actually even dogs, they've tried this on dogs and dogs can't do it."
00:01:46,00:01:53,"So basically if you've got say, um, two kilograms of cocaine up your bum or four kilograms"
00:01:53,00:01:56,"of cocaine up your bum, the dogs wouldn't know which one it was."
00:01:56,00:01:57,Right.
00:01:57,00:02:00,I think you had four kilograms of cocaine on your bum.
00:02:00,00:02:04,It wouldn't take us never dogs to identify you.
00:02:04,00:02:08,Do you think there would be a long difference do you between the four and the two?
00:02:08,00:02:09,I think in your gate.
00:02:09,00:02:10,Yes.
00:02:10,00:02:11,You think the gate would be different?
00:02:11,00:02:12,No.
00:02:12,00:02:13,No.
00:02:13,00:02:14,"No, mate."
00:02:14,00:02:15,It's like a big pocket up there.
00:02:15,00:02:16,Four kilos.
00:02:16,00:02:17,Two kilos.
00:02:17,00:02:21,Two kilos are still uncomfortable and it's not like you're swaggering along comfortably.
00:02:21,00:02:23,You have to be one big bag as well.
00:02:23,00:02:25,You could do it's ten small bags.
00:02:25,00:02:26,Oh great.
00:02:26,00:02:27,That's going to make a big difference.
00:02:27,00:02:29,"Boy, on the entry point I think it would."
00:02:29,00:02:31,I don't know how you close a bucket.
00:02:31,00:02:36,I'm glad you said bucket at the end of the sentence.
00:02:36,00:02:38,It's buckets with a lid on the buckets.
00:02:38,00:02:40,I wish my buckets came with a lid.
00:02:40,00:02:42,How much bucket do you have?
00:02:42,00:02:43,I've loads.
00:02:43,00:02:44,Yeah.
00:02:44,00:02:48,Like a bucket you would put up make a fire and you would need a lid for wouldn't you?
00:02:48,00:02:49,Why are you making fires in buckets?
00:02:49,00:02:53,"Well, I'm trying to get rid of all this cocaine I've got out of my bum."
00:02:53,00:02:54,"It's really interesting, right?"
00:02:54,00:02:57,It's not even like these amounts are huge differences.
00:02:57,00:03:01,"I think I read in the study that let's say, well, were we saying seeds of sunflower seeds?"
00:03:01,00:03:02,Some sunflower seeds.
00:03:02,00:03:07,It would be the difference between say 150 sunflower seeds and 130.
00:03:07,00:03:08,They not all of them could get it.
00:03:08,00:03:12,"It's obviously easier for them with bigger differences, but even at that point they could"
00:03:12,00:03:13,still do it.
00:03:13,00:03:16,So the other cool thing was they double-blinded it because the experiment is thought we
00:03:16,00:03:20,might accidentally give away if we because we know which buckets have the most sunflower
00:03:20,00:03:21,seeds in.
00:03:21,00:03:23,We might get really excited when they're going to also be gone.
00:03:23,00:03:27,So they definitely made kept made sure that the elephants didn't know and the researchers
00:03:27,00:03:29,didn't know where the but sunflower seeds were.
00:03:29,00:03:30,"Yeah, okay."
00:03:30,00:03:31,Yeah.
00:03:31,00:03:32,That's useful.
00:03:32,00:03:35,"So if you're getting raisins in a supermarket, for instance, and you need to choose the"
00:03:35,00:03:39,"packet that's got the most in them, you could bring an elephant and then you've got your"
00:03:39,00:03:40,"mind's worth, right?"
00:03:40,00:03:44,"Because they frequently put, they frequently label on the packet how many raisins are in"
00:03:44,00:03:45,the bag.
00:03:45,00:03:53,"Well, they put the weight on, they don't say this contains 4,000 raisins."
00:03:53,00:03:55,I'm having a good day with your allowance today.
00:03:55,00:03:56,I buy in bulk.
00:03:56,00:03:57,All right.
00:03:57,00:03:59,That must be how many are in a big packet of raisins.
00:03:59,00:04:02,"I just put a little sun-made boxes, the size of the candy."
00:04:02,00:04:05,"No, you can't put more than 30 raisins in there."
00:04:05,00:04:09,"Imagine that you've got 10 raisins in your hand, that's a nice handful slash mouthful."
00:04:09,00:04:10,Right.
00:04:10,00:04:14,"Your 4,400 handfuls of raisins on each box."
00:04:14,00:04:19,"Look, it took a lot of work smuggling these into the country, that's hurt itself and that."
00:04:19,00:04:22,Then you were walking funny.
00:04:22,00:04:27,"Just on testing elephants, so there was another test of elephant smell by the University of"
00:04:27,00:04:30,"Quazulu, Natal, and they did something really cool."
00:04:30,00:04:36,"They built an elephant-sized lab mouse maze, so you know the stereotype of science is putting"
00:04:36,00:04:37,mice in a maze.
00:04:37,00:04:40,"It's almost always just a Y-shaped maze, so they put the mice in at the tail of the"
00:04:40,00:04:44,wise at where they see which of the two branches it goes into and they build an elephant-sized
00:04:44,00:04:45,one of that.
00:04:45,00:04:49,"They put a bucket of food, they liked it at one branch of the Y, they put a bucket of food,"
00:04:49,00:04:52,"they didn't like it at the other branch of the Y, and they could identify it."
00:04:52,00:04:54,They knew instantly which branch to go for food.
00:04:54,00:04:55,Just through smell.
00:04:55,00:04:56,"Just through smell again, yeah."
00:04:56,00:04:57,That's cool.
00:04:57,00:05:00,So do they have the best smell of any mammal that we know of?
00:05:00,00:05:01,"They do, didn't they?"
00:05:01,00:05:02,Yeah.
00:05:02,00:05:03,It's extraordinary.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"They've got the highest number of old factory receptors, definitely, haven't they?"
00:05:06,00:05:10,"I feel like other animals can claim in a different sense, but yeah, they're ability"
00:05:10,00:05:13,"to distinguish between amounts, seems to be unique."
00:05:13,00:05:17,"And it's so sensitive that, for instance, there was another experiment where they show"
00:05:17,00:05:22,"that they can distinguish between different people, so in Kenya, there are different tribes"
00:05:22,00:05:24,and some of them kill elephants and some of them don't.
00:05:24,00:05:30,"So the mass-eye kill elephant as a ritual thing, whereas the Canberra people don't."
00:05:30,00:05:35,"And if you hold up a mass-eye tribe's persons clothes, then the elephant freaks out and starts"
00:05:35,00:05:36,bashing its track at the right hand.
00:05:36,00:05:37,"It's amazing, isn't it?"
00:05:37,00:05:38,Yeah.
00:05:38,00:05:39,Absolutely incredible.
00:05:39,00:05:43,"They can do it by sight, which you've just described, and also by smell."
00:05:43,00:05:45,"Yes, they can do it by slight and smell, yeah."
00:05:45,00:05:48,"So they identify the color of the clothes, but also if they've blinded in their face."
00:05:48,00:05:49,Yeah.
00:05:49,00:05:50,They can still smell it in their face.
00:05:50,00:05:51,Blindfolded.
00:05:51,00:05:52,"We should say, blindfolded in the face."
00:05:52,00:05:53,"Blindfolded, yes."
00:05:53,00:05:54,Yeah.
00:05:54,00:05:55,Yeah.
00:05:55,00:05:56,"I mean, either of those works."
00:05:56,00:05:57,Yeah.
00:05:57,00:05:58,Blinded?
00:05:58,00:05:59,"Well, it just sounds a lot more cruel than being--"
00:05:59,00:06:00,For my experiment.
00:06:00,00:06:01,"I mean, they're right."
00:06:01,00:06:02,"It's a blind, 100 elephants."
00:06:02,00:06:03,You're not going to get approval.
00:06:03,00:06:05,Isn't it great to know that it does have the best sense of smell given how big it's
00:06:05,00:06:11,"noses. Like, you just-- you would hope that that big nose had some sort of rate advantage."
00:06:11,00:06:12,Yeah.
00:06:12,00:06:13,And it does.
00:06:13,00:06:14,Do you know one other thing they can smell?
00:06:14,00:06:16,TNT.
00:06:16,00:06:17,And they're very good at it.
00:06:17,00:06:21,"And then fact, in one sense, at least, they're better than dogs at it."
00:06:21,00:06:22,Mm-hmm.
00:06:22,00:06:23,What's that sense?
00:06:23,00:06:24,It's a smell.
00:06:24,00:06:25,That's it.
00:06:25,00:06:30,"I think it's the sort of-- the proportion they can identify it, or the sensitivity score."
00:06:30,00:06:34,They score 99.7% and dogs get about 94%.
00:06:34,00:06:38,"So there was not a lot about this saying, so does this mean that elephants should take over"
00:06:38,00:06:39,TNT sniffing dog's duties?
00:06:39,00:06:40,No.
00:06:40,00:06:41,Absolutely not.
00:06:41,00:06:45,Their sheer size and weight makes them completely unsuited to being infield TNT detectors.
00:06:45,00:06:46,Which I think is fair.
00:06:46,00:06:47,At airports.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Yeah.
00:06:48,00:06:50,You would-- you'd have to go past the sniff at elephants.
00:06:50,00:06:54,"Well, then you're not-- you're not sniffing with TNT and airports."
00:06:54,00:06:55,Yeah.
00:06:55,00:06:56,"This isn't the minefields of Angola, isn't it?"
00:06:56,00:07:00,It's not like they're expecting people to smuggle huge sukies with TNT.
00:07:00,00:07:01,"Oh, well."
00:07:01,00:07:02,Okay.
00:07:02,00:07:03,It's curiously.
00:07:03,00:07:04,"Oh, well."
00:07:04,00:07:08,So they're incredibly-- elephants are incredibly smart.
00:07:08,00:07:12,And they've only really started properly experimenting on their intelligence over the last
00:07:12,00:07:13,20 years or so.
00:07:13,00:07:17,"But we used to think they were idiots because, for instance, there was this experiment where"
00:07:17,00:07:21,"scientists dangled really, really nice smelling fruit and food and stuff, the various heights"
00:07:21,00:07:23,that were too difficult for them to reach.
00:07:23,00:07:26,And then they left sticks all over the floor and thinking the elephants will pick up the
00:07:26,00:07:27,"stick, hopefully."
00:07:27,00:07:28,And then they'll prod the fruit.
00:07:28,00:07:29,Like a beauty hunter.
00:07:29,00:07:30,Like a beauty hunter.
00:07:30,00:07:31,Exactly.
00:07:31,00:07:32,And they didn't.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"So it's dying to say, ""Well, they can't be that smart. They can't figure it out."""
00:07:35,00:07:41,"They should have hung an actual donkey, because that's what an elephant really, they wouldn't use one of the basic rubbish pinnars."
00:07:41,00:07:45,"Is that what they, they'd hold out an actual donkey in the sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet food?"
00:07:45,00:07:48,I don't know if they have pinnars in their culture though.
00:07:48,00:07:49,Elephants.
00:07:49,00:07:52,"Also, you've been to some traumatic children's parties. They've hollowed out a donkey."
00:07:52,00:07:56,That's tough to get through. You need a really big stick for a long time.
00:07:56,00:08:00,"Mine and James's parties, I'm blinding elephants in one corner."
00:08:00,00:08:03,James is scooping the inn and is having a donkey in the other.
00:08:03,00:08:09,"Anyway, the point was that they weren't being stupid, not being able to get it with a stick."
00:08:09,00:08:14,"They'd pick up the sticks, and then they wouldn't prod at the fruit, because people didn't understand the elephant's scent of smell is so good."
00:08:14,00:08:19,"So as soon as they pick up a stick, they can't smell anymore, because they wrapped their trunk around it,"
00:08:19,00:08:21,and so they couldn't smell where the fruit was.
00:08:21,00:08:26,"And the scientist, because we're so human, we just think, ""Oh, you just see the fruit, because we assume that a sight is the most important thing."""
00:08:26,00:08:28,But then they had to smell where it was.
00:08:28,00:08:32,"They put in a clothespeg on your nose, but they wrapped their nose around the stick."
00:08:32,00:08:34,"Exactly, yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:08:34,00:08:39,"I read a thing saying, it's basically like having a nose on the palm of your hand every time you touch something, you're smelling it."
00:08:39,00:08:40,Much more than you are touching it.
00:08:40,00:08:42,"Butterflies can smell through the feet, can't they?"
00:08:42,00:08:43,Yes!
00:08:43,00:08:45,They have all that stuff on their feet.
00:08:45,00:08:46,It's so cool.
00:08:46,00:08:48,So imagine if you had feet like a butterfly and happens like a...
00:08:48,00:08:50,This is the worst part of the week.
00:08:50,00:08:55,I found just on the subject of amazing senses of smell.
00:08:55,00:08:56,Yeah.
00:08:56,00:08:59,There is a woman who can smell Parkinson's disease.
00:08:59,00:09:01,"Oh, this is really weird."
00:09:01,00:09:05,So there are people with incredible senses of smell of the super smell as they get called.
00:09:05,00:09:07,"And this lady was a retired nurse, called Joy Melm."
00:09:07,00:09:09,And obviously she'd worked with a lot of patients with Parkinson's.
00:09:09,00:09:12,And she'd been to a talk about it by a doctor.
00:09:12,00:09:15,"And at the end of it, there was any questions at call."
00:09:15,00:09:19,"And she put up a hand and said, ""Why aren't you doing something about the fact that people with Parkinson's smell?"""
00:09:19,00:09:20,And they didn't really...
00:09:20,00:09:23,"They thought, ""Oh, that's a slightly weird question to ask."""
00:09:23,00:09:28,"And she... And eventually they worked out that she meant, ""No, I literally can smell it."""
00:09:28,00:09:30,And they tested it on her.
00:09:30,00:09:33,And she can tell before physical symptoms appear.
00:09:33,00:09:38,So they presented it with a load of t-shirts that have been worn either by patients with Parkinson's
00:09:38,00:09:40,or people who did not have Parkinson's.
00:09:40,00:09:43,And she got them all right apart from one false positive
00:09:43,00:09:47,where she flagged someone up as having Parkinson's who didn't.
00:09:47,00:09:51,"And then later on that person got in touch to say, ""Oh, by the way, I've just been diagnosed with Parkinson's."""
00:09:51,00:09:54,So she had identified it before.
00:09:54,00:09:56,It's like someone wearing you.
00:09:56,00:09:57,It's amazing.
00:09:57,00:09:58,That is amazing.
00:09:58,00:09:59,We need to move on in a sec.
00:09:59,00:10:01,One more thing about elephant smell.
00:10:01,00:10:07,"They smell each other's urine and get a lot of information about the pack, about the herd from that."
00:10:07,00:10:12,"And if they're walking in a line, let's say, do the condor or whatever."
00:10:12,00:10:16,And then the one at the front smells some urine from the one at the back
00:10:16,00:10:19,because some scientists have taken it and then run to the front of the queue
00:10:19,00:10:24,and then put some urine there. They get really confused because they know who's urine is who's.
00:10:24,00:10:27,"And if it's in a place where they're not expecting it,"
00:10:27,00:10:31,they get really confused and looking around and they can't work out what's going on.
00:10:31,00:10:32,Wow.
00:10:32,00:10:37,Let's say you came into the bathroom next week when I'm on holiday in Japan
00:10:37,00:10:40,"and you smelled the urine and you went, ""For the hell, that's James's urine."""
00:10:40,00:10:41,I thought he was in Japan.
00:10:41,00:10:42,Yeah.
00:10:42,00:10:43,It's like that.
00:10:43,00:10:44,Cool.
00:10:44,00:10:45,"And remembering, because that's the other thing,"
00:10:45,00:10:49,"the two things we assume are elephants are good at, smelling the trunks and remembering,"
00:10:49,00:10:51,"because in the jungle, but they say an elephant never forgets."
00:10:51,00:10:52,Yeah.
00:10:52,00:10:53,And they don't.
00:10:53,00:10:56,"So they remember all the smells of urine, of all the different mates they have."
00:10:56,00:11:00,And also there's this amazing moment in 1999 at an elephant sanctuary
00:11:00,00:11:02,where there was this elephant called Jenny.
00:11:02,00:11:04,There's still going on about this.
00:11:04,00:11:08,There's this Asian elephant called Jenny.
00:11:08,00:11:12,And she was suddenly introduced to a new elephant into the sanctuary
00:11:12,00:11:15,and they had this amazing reaction to each other.
00:11:15,00:11:18,They got really freaked out and agitated and then ran up to each other
00:11:18,00:11:22,and it seemed like this exhibition of euphoria for both the elephants
00:11:22,00:11:25,"and the care of Jenny was like, ""What on earth is going on?"
00:11:25,00:11:26,"This is so weird."""
00:11:26,00:11:30,"So she looked back into their history and for a few months, 23 years earlier,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,they'd worked in the circus together.
00:11:32,00:11:33,Wow.
00:11:33,00:11:35,Just remember each other.
00:11:35,00:11:36,23 years.
00:11:36,00:11:37,Yeah.
00:11:37,00:11:38,That's incredible.
00:11:38,00:11:39,"Like Jenny, there's you."
00:11:39,00:11:42,I don't remember anyone about this 23 years ago.
00:11:42,00:11:45,You look at us blankly every morning.
00:11:45,00:11:47,I was nearly in a Konga the other day.
00:11:47,00:11:48,Yeah.
00:11:48,00:11:49,It was at a wedding.
00:11:49,00:11:51,It was very long Konga and everyone was going pie in the Konga
00:11:51,00:11:53,"and they kept saying, ""Hey, join the Konga."""
00:11:53,00:11:56,"And I kept saying, ""Oh, I'm going to join on the end."""
00:11:56,00:11:59,"I got about five people saying, ""Hey, get in here."
00:11:59,00:12:00,"Mate, rub for me."""
00:12:00,00:12:02,"I said, ""No, I'll just join on the end."""
00:12:02,00:12:03,Did you join on the end?
00:12:03,00:12:04,I tricked them all.
00:12:04,00:12:05,No.
00:12:05,00:12:06,No one's going to know.
00:12:06,00:12:07,No one knows.
00:12:07,00:12:09,No one looks behind in the Konga exactly.
00:12:09,00:12:12,But I had already urinated at the very end of their route.
00:12:12,00:12:14,So I was there to freak them out.
00:12:14,00:12:19,"Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:12:19,00:12:21,And that is Chuzinski.
00:12:21,00:12:25,My fact this week is that Thomas Jefferson cut his Bible to pieces
00:12:25,00:12:29,and glued it back together in the order he thought it should be written.
00:12:29,00:12:31,Wow.
00:12:31,00:12:32,Yeah.
00:12:32,00:12:33,Great.
00:12:33,00:12:34,He had a better idea for the Bible.
00:12:34,00:12:35,It was in the wrong order.
00:12:35,00:12:36,And he was right.
00:12:36,00:12:39,So this was the New Testament specifically.
00:12:39,00:12:42,"And he was a Christian, obviously Jefferson."
00:12:42,00:12:43,And he had a Bible.
00:12:43,00:12:46,And he wanted to put it all kind of in chronological order.
00:12:46,00:12:47,So he got all the gospels.
00:12:47,00:12:48,He ripped them apart.
00:12:48,00:12:50,He actually had six different volumes.
00:12:50,00:12:52,So he could do lots of experimenting.
00:12:52,00:12:55,"And he had a Greek one, a Latin one, English and French ones."
00:12:55,00:12:57,And he cut up all the gospels.
00:12:57,00:12:58,Paged my page.
00:12:58,00:13:01,Rearranged all the pages in chronological order.
00:13:01,00:13:05,"So, you know, if John said Jesus had a sandwich when he was 17,"
00:13:05,00:13:06,then Matthew said.
00:13:06,00:13:08,And then he went on a slide when he was 20.
00:13:08,00:13:11,He'd sort of put the Matthew after the John bit.
00:13:11,00:13:14,Even though in the actual Bible Matthew had come before the John.
00:13:14,00:13:15,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:15,00:13:16,That's a really good idea.
00:13:16,00:13:17,Yeah.
00:13:17,00:13:19,"Because Matthew, Matthew and John, they're all telling the same story."
00:13:19,00:13:20,"They're telling the same story, different bits of it."
00:13:20,00:13:22,Is there any good bits that he left out?
00:13:22,00:13:23,Do we know?
00:13:23,00:13:26,I actually don't know what the examples are that he left out.
00:13:26,00:13:28,But I know he left out some of the dodgy miracles.
00:13:28,00:13:31,So he was a bit skeptical that some of the stuff might not have happened.
00:13:31,00:13:33,A miracle of the sandwich in the slide.
00:13:33,00:13:34,Exactly.
00:13:34,00:13:41,It was tuner at the top and there was builte at the bottom.
00:13:41,00:13:42,Oh.
00:13:42,00:13:46,"She had stepped down, I would say."
00:13:46,00:13:49,And he glued it back together and he liked it so much.
00:13:49,00:13:52,His new upgraded version that he glued all the pages together
00:13:52,00:13:54,and he sent them to be bound properly.
00:13:54,00:13:57,"And in fact, I believe it still exists somewhere in America."
00:13:57,00:13:58,It's the Smithsonian.
00:13:58,00:13:59,Is it the Smithsonian?
00:13:59,00:14:00,Yeah.
00:14:00,00:14:01,Of course it is.
00:14:01,00:14:02,They've got a lot of Jefferson stuff.
00:14:02,00:14:03,They've got his Bible.
00:14:03,00:14:04,So you can visit it.
00:14:04,00:14:06,"I'm not sure you can flick through it, but I believe you can see it."
00:14:06,00:14:08,You definitely won't be able to flick through it.
00:14:08,00:14:09,"Yeah, but it's very unusual."
00:14:09,00:14:13,There are six volumes that might be opened at the Smithsonian pages.
00:14:13,00:14:16,His desk that he wrote the Declaration of Independence on.
00:14:16,00:14:17,They have that.
00:14:17,00:14:21,"And a polygraph, which I've always thought to be a lie detector."
00:14:21,00:14:22,But it's...
00:14:22,00:14:23,I would have thought that too.
00:14:23,00:14:24,"Well, it is, right?"
00:14:24,00:14:28,"But originally what it was was a way of whenever he wrote letters,"
00:14:28,00:14:30,because he wrote thousands and thousands of letters.
00:14:30,00:14:32,And he always wanted a copy of each letter.
00:14:32,00:14:35,"Because if they made it into the papers, he could show the original."
00:14:35,00:14:38,So it was a machine that was designed that would have a double pencil
00:14:38,00:14:39,with a double ink.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"Well, and it would mimic his writing."
00:14:41,00:14:44,"So he wrote two letters at a time, but the same letter."
00:14:44,00:14:45,"Yeah, amazing."
00:14:45,00:14:46,And makes actually more sense.
00:14:46,00:14:49,"Because polygraph, it means lots of writing."
00:14:49,00:14:51,So it's actually a better term for that machine.
00:14:51,00:14:52,Yeah.
00:14:52,00:14:55,"His Bible, he didn't mean it to be published."
00:14:55,00:14:57,Because it was just a private sort of passion project of his.
00:14:57,00:15:01,"He showed it to a few friends. But then after he died, it became very popular."
00:15:01,00:15:03,"And lots of copies were made of it, it was printed."
00:15:03,00:15:05,"And it was called ""The Life of Morals of Jesus of Nazareth""."
00:15:05,00:15:07,That was his title for it.
00:15:07,00:15:08,That was his name.
00:15:08,00:15:09,"Yeah, he retited it as well."
00:15:09,00:15:10,Because the Bible wasn't good enough.
00:15:10,00:15:11,Yeah.
00:15:11,00:15:15,"He was a kind of a Jesus fan, as opposed to a religion fan in some ways."
00:15:15,00:15:17,"And then 9,000 copies were printed."
00:15:17,00:15:19,"And until the 1950s, when they ran out,"
00:15:19,00:15:22,each newly elected senator got a version of it.
00:15:22,00:15:23,When they were elected.
00:15:23,00:15:24,"Oh, good day."
00:15:24,00:15:25,Yeah.
00:15:25,00:15:27,Do you know how it ends the book?
00:15:27,00:15:30,"Uh, his book, I don't know, damn."
00:15:30,00:15:31,"It ends, I believe."
00:15:31,00:15:34,"Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden."
00:15:34,00:15:36,"And in the garden, a new sepulchre."
00:15:36,00:15:39,Wherein was never manned yet laid.
00:15:39,00:15:44,There they laid Jesus and rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed.
00:15:44,00:15:45,That's it.
00:15:45,00:15:46,No resurrection.
00:15:46,00:15:47,No resurrection.
00:15:47,00:15:48,Oh.
00:15:48,00:15:50,He just dies.
00:15:50,00:15:51,Poor Jesus.
00:15:51,00:15:52,Isn't that amazing?
00:15:52,00:15:54,"And that's like the main bit of, that's when I was told it's good."
00:15:54,00:15:55,Yeah.
00:15:55,00:15:56,That's like the main bit.
00:15:56,00:15:57,Yeah.
00:15:57,00:16:02,"That's like the somber art house reinterpretation, realism bullshit."
00:16:02,00:16:03,Yeah.
00:16:03,00:16:04,"He was an amazing guy though, Jefferson."
00:16:04,00:16:06,"He's quite a confusing person, isn't he?"
00:16:06,00:16:12,Because he has this bizarre legacy where he came up with the idea that all man is created equal
00:16:12,00:16:15,and then he had 600 slaves and everything.
00:16:15,00:16:19,"And actually, even the Monticello, which is the place that he built his home."
00:16:19,00:16:26,Even the Monticello website now acknowledges that Sally Hawkins mothered about six of his children at least.
00:16:26,00:16:29,Who was an enslaved person?
00:16:29,00:16:30,Wow.
00:16:30,00:16:31,Yeah.
00:16:31,00:16:36,Who bizarrely was the daughter of a woman who mothered children of his father-in-law.
00:16:36,00:16:38,So they kept it in the family.
00:16:38,00:16:43,So his wife's dad had lots of affairs with Sally Hawkins mum.
00:16:43,00:16:44,Wow.
00:16:44,00:16:45,Sorry.
00:16:45,00:16:46,It's not Sally Hawkins.
00:16:46,00:16:47,That's a famous actress.
00:16:47,00:16:49,Did I say Sally Hemings?
00:16:49,00:16:53,"Sally Hawkins is of course in Paddington, the shape of water."
00:16:53,00:16:54,She was great.
00:16:54,00:16:56,She was also in the mother of a lot of Jefferson's children.
00:16:56,00:16:57,Wow.
00:16:57,00:16:58,"God, she's versatile."
00:16:58,00:16:59,I know.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"So he was a third president, right?"
00:17:01,00:17:03,"After Washington and then, he was at John Adams."
00:17:03,00:17:04,Yep.
00:17:04,00:17:08,"And he, you know, he did a lot of, he had a lot of remarkable achievements in office."
00:17:08,00:17:12,"As we said, after the Declaration of Independence, he's also responsible for a phrase"
00:17:12,00:17:15,that was a massive hit in the 19th century in America.
00:17:15,00:17:16,"Oh, I tell you this."
00:17:16,00:17:17,Yeah.
00:17:17,00:17:18,So he bumped into a man near his home.
00:17:18,00:17:19,This is the story.
00:17:19,00:17:21,No one knows if it's true or not.
00:17:21,00:17:22,But this guy started complaining.
00:17:22,00:17:25,"They were riding the horses next to each other, some neighbor of his."
00:17:25,00:17:28,And the guy was complaining about everything in Washington and all these ideas they had running things.
00:17:28,00:17:30,So he talked for a couple of hours.
00:17:30,00:17:32,He talked Jefferson's ear off about all this.
00:17:32,00:17:36,"And then eventually, they got to Jefferson's house and Jefferson said, ""Well, this is me."""
00:17:36,00:17:38,Is that the phrase?
00:17:38,00:17:39,No.
00:17:39,00:17:41,That would have been a great phrase.
00:17:41,00:17:45,This is me.
00:17:45,00:17:48,So the guy eventually asked pretty much the first question he'd asked this whole time.
00:17:48,00:17:50,"And he said, ""What's your name, by the way?"""
00:17:50,00:17:53,"And the guy said, ""Well, my name is Thomas Jefferson."""
00:17:53,00:17:55,A massive social clang of this guy's made.
00:17:55,00:17:56,He was deeply embarrassed.
00:17:56,00:17:58,And so he couldn't think of everything to say.
00:17:58,00:18:00,"And he just said, ""My name is Haynes."""
00:18:00,00:18:02,And then he galloped away on his horse.
00:18:02,00:18:06,"So this became a phrase, ""My name is Haynes,"" which is whenever you had to leave suddenly,"
00:18:06,00:18:08,or whenever you were massively embarrassed about something.
00:18:08,00:18:11,"Well, it was basically the 19th century."
00:18:11,00:18:12,Boy was my face red.
00:18:12,00:18:13,That's great.
00:18:13,00:18:14,"I'll get my coats, kind of think."
00:18:14,00:18:15,"Yes, it is like that."
00:18:15,00:18:16,Wow.
00:18:16,00:18:17,And what was it?
00:18:17,00:18:18,My name is Haynes.
00:18:18,00:18:19,My name is Haynes.
00:18:19,00:18:20,My name is Haynes.
00:18:20,00:18:21,Let's start doing it.
00:18:21,00:18:25,"And just very quickly on typos in the Bible, there are some absolute doosies."
00:18:25,00:18:28,So there's one in the 1682.
00:18:28,00:18:31,"There's a 1682 edition, which gets called the Cannibal's Bible."
00:18:31,00:18:35,"Because there's a typo, it should be, if the latter husband hates her,"
00:18:35,00:18:38,"and they mistyped it, so it's if the latter husband ate her."
00:18:38,00:18:40,I'm talking about his wife.
00:18:40,00:18:44,"And there's a great one, the 1944 King James, which has a line, which should be,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,"""Submit yourselves to your own husbands."""
00:18:46,00:18:48,"It's advice for wives, basically."
00:18:48,00:18:52,"But accidentally reads, ""Submit yourselves to your owl husbands."""
00:18:52,00:18:53,Yeah.
00:18:53,00:18:56,It's good advice.
00:18:56,00:19:03,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:19:03,00:19:08,"My fact is that in 19th century America, caviar was a free bar snack."
00:19:08,00:19:10,Yeah.
00:19:10,00:19:11,"Actually, I hate caviar."
00:19:11,00:19:12,Do you?
00:19:12,00:19:14,"Oh, well."
00:19:14,00:19:19,I don't like things that are savory that have the kind of texture that I think sweet things should have.
00:19:19,00:19:21,That's understandable.
00:19:21,00:19:23,"Well, I know where and when you should not go on holiday."
00:19:23,00:19:29,"In 19th century America, because you couldn't move for it, it was so readily available."
00:19:29,00:19:35,"Because there was huge sturgeon fish, the fish that caviar comes from, or classic caviar anyway."
00:19:35,00:19:40,"And they were just so thick in the rivers that people put it in bars, basically like peanuts, to make people thirsty."
00:19:40,00:19:41,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:41,00:19:45,"That's the way of getting people, because it was very salty stuff, so there was a way of getting people thirsty."
00:19:45,00:19:48,"Well, yeah, because it used to be used like salt as well, didn't it?"
00:19:48,00:19:51,You'd sprinkle it on a meal just to add a little bit of salty flavour.
00:19:51,00:19:52,Yeah.
00:19:52,00:19:53,How did they use to eat it?
00:19:53,00:19:57,"Because from what I've read, the best place, and the sort of most encouraged place to eat it from,"
00:19:57,00:20:02,"is the little bit of skin between your index finger and your thumb, so you place it on there."
00:20:02,00:20:05,"Oh, that's the, what's that called, the Snuff Box?"
00:20:05,00:20:06,"Snuff Box, yeah."
00:20:06,00:20:08,It's called the Natural Snuff Box or something.
00:20:08,00:20:11,They say it's because they don't taint the taste by doing that.
00:20:11,00:20:17,"So if you use a metal spoon, for example, that has a metal-y taste that can affect the caviar."
00:20:17,00:20:24,"That sounds just like the kind of thing that high society makes up the weird way to eat the high society food, isn't it?"
00:20:24,00:20:27,But I think it was a bar snack that surely should be on a cocktail stick.
00:20:27,00:20:30,And you could get one little egg at first.
00:20:30,00:20:34,I would think it would just be in a bowl like peanuts with like 12 different types of urine.
00:20:34,00:20:36,I think it's like that.
00:20:36,00:20:37,Exactly.
00:20:37,00:20:39,People don't wash their hands from the back of the toilet.
00:20:39,00:20:41,It's very spiritual to get on your fingers.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Yeah.
00:20:42,00:20:44,You can just do it straight with the fingers.
00:20:44,00:20:45,"Yeah, probably not."
00:20:45,00:20:47,"I mean, you need to have a finger bowl next to it."
00:20:47,00:20:48,Yeah.
00:20:48,00:20:51,"Let's say in Russia you have it on Blini, so maybe they had little bits of bread."
00:20:51,00:20:52,That's perfect.
00:20:52,00:20:55,That's like a little micro plate for each bit of caviar.
00:20:55,00:20:56,"That's a very nice way of eating, I think."
00:20:56,00:20:57,But this is the thing.
00:20:57,00:21:01,"So US caviar was so common, but Russian caviar was thought to be a lot better."
00:21:01,00:21:07,"So quite often, US caviar was exported to Europe and then it was repackaged and relabelled as Russian caviar."
00:21:07,00:21:11,"And it was exported back to the States and sold as Russian caviar as better stuff, even like what?"
00:21:11,00:21:12,Exactly the same.
00:21:12,00:21:13,Am I using it?
00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah.
00:21:14,00:21:18,"And basically what happened was the caviar in America was extremely numerous, like you say,"
00:21:18,00:21:22,"because of Sturgeon were numerous, but then they overfished them."
00:21:22,00:21:26,"And then that meant there was no caviar left in America anymore, which meant you had to get it from Russia,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,which made it much more expensive.
00:21:28,00:21:29,Exactly.
00:21:29,00:21:30,"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:21:30,00:21:31,Yeah.
00:21:31,00:21:36,"Because in Russia before then, before the Western demand increased in Russia, it was sort of peasant food as well."
00:21:36,00:21:37,It wasn't there.
00:21:37,00:21:42,"It was considered much more peasant foodie than sauerkraut, for instance, which is more of a delicacy."
00:21:42,00:21:44,And they used it just as a flavouring.
00:21:44,00:21:51,"And it was only when there's currently a Greek guy called Johannes Varvakis, who discovered Russian caviar on his travels."
00:21:51,00:21:52,So this is delicious.
00:21:52,00:21:55,I'm going to introduce it to High Society in Europe.
00:21:55,00:21:57,And then that was what shot its prices up.
00:21:57,00:22:03,"He made it fashionable, kind of just shows that food, how much you value it, is just about how fashionable someone says it is."
00:22:03,00:22:04,Yeah.
00:22:04,00:22:08,"Apparently, if you were to take, let's say, a 45 kilogram barrel of caviar."
00:22:08,00:22:10,I'm not putting us up my Boston days.
00:22:10,00:22:12,"No, not after last time."
00:22:12,00:22:16,"But if you would take this massive barrel of caviar, which is kind of how they transport it,"
00:22:16,00:22:21,it would take a farm labourer two weeks to earn it back in the olden days in Russia.
00:22:21,00:22:24,And now it would take a decade for them to earn it.
00:22:24,00:22:25,Wow.
00:22:25,00:22:26,Jesus.
00:22:26,00:22:27,That is amazing.
00:22:27,00:22:28,Big difference.
00:22:28,00:22:30,I guess so much of it is because it's sturgeon.
00:22:30,00:22:32,"I mean, you get salmon caviar and you get lump-fish caviar."
00:22:32,00:22:37,"And there are all sorts of other much, much cheaper meals, which are just fish eggs, basically, of different kinds."
00:22:37,00:22:41,"But sturgeon has this kind of, you know, supposed hallmark of quality about it."
00:22:41,00:22:42,It's pretty similar.
00:22:42,00:22:43,"So, okay, here's a question."
00:22:43,00:22:44,Is caviar vegetarian?
00:22:44,00:22:45,Because it is eggs.
00:22:45,00:22:46,Not vegan.
00:22:46,00:22:47,For sure.
00:22:47,00:22:48,Not vegan.
00:22:48,00:22:52,"I'd say no, because you have to kill the sturgeon in order to get it."
00:22:52,00:22:53,Fair play.
00:22:53,00:22:58,"However, there is some, I think, vegetarian caviar out there, where they don't kill the sturgeon."
00:22:58,00:22:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:59,00:23:03,"They make a tiny incision, and then they massage the sturgeon to get it out of them."
00:23:03,00:23:04,"Oh, that's nice."
00:23:04,00:23:06,That's quite a rough massage.
00:23:06,00:23:07,"I'm a rich, good builder."
00:23:07,00:23:09,This is a company in Leeds.
00:23:09,00:23:13,"And then you just squeeze the sturgeon like a toothpaste, too, basically, and all the caviar comes out of it."
00:23:13,00:23:14,But...
00:23:14,00:23:16,And then you put it back in the water?
00:23:16,00:23:17,"Yeah, it survives."
00:23:17,00:23:18,You keep them.
00:23:18,00:23:19,"Yeah, I was reading about this, actually."
00:23:19,00:23:20,Yeah.
00:23:20,00:23:22,You can repeat the process every 15 months.
00:23:22,00:23:23,Yeah.
00:23:23,00:23:24,Yeah.
00:23:24,00:23:26,I read that there was a scientist called Angela Coller.
00:23:26,00:23:29,She spent nine years trying to work out how you didn't...
00:23:29,00:23:32,You wouldn't have to kill the sturgeon in order to extract the eggs.
00:23:32,00:23:34,And I believe it was her who pioneered it.
00:23:34,00:23:35,It could be wrong.
00:23:35,00:23:37,Maybe multiple people around the world had the same idea.
00:23:37,00:23:40,But the process isn't just doing what you said with the incision.
00:23:40,00:23:44,They give the sturgeons an ultrasound to see if they're ready.
00:23:44,00:23:48,"And then they have a protein administered, which you're talking about, which releases the eggs."
00:23:48,00:23:51,And then they massage them out like a toothpaste tuna.
00:23:51,00:23:52,Yeah.
00:23:52,00:23:53,That's really funny.
00:23:53,00:23:54,An ultrasound for a fish.
00:23:54,00:23:55,Yeah.
00:23:55,00:23:56,"You're going to have 100,000 babies."
00:23:56,00:23:57,Congratulations.
00:23:57,00:24:03,"I think they have to give them ultrasound anyway, because there's no way of telling if they're male or female."
00:24:03,00:24:05,So you need to make sure that you've got a female fish.
00:24:05,00:24:07,I think so from the outside.
00:24:07,00:24:09,So you have to check their innards anyway.
00:24:09,00:24:10,Check your own hands.
00:24:10,00:24:12,That's incredible.
00:24:12,00:24:21,One way that you might get some eggs without killing the sturgeon is sometimes producers will take some of the eggs out to check if they're ready or not.
00:24:21,00:24:26,"Because you don't want to kill your sturgeon, get all the eggs out, and it's not at the right stage."
00:24:26,00:24:33,"And so some fisheries will take a female sturgeon, put a incision in her, put a straw in her,"
00:24:33,00:24:37,and then suck out some of the eggs to taste them to see if they taste right.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"And then if they're right, then they'll kill the sturgeon and get the eggs."
00:24:39,00:24:42,"And if they're wrong, then they'll just let her go for a while."
00:24:42,00:24:45,That must be something someone's doing in a posh ration restaurant.
00:24:45,00:24:47,It's just serving up live sturgeon.
00:24:47,00:24:48,Jamming its straw.
00:24:48,00:24:49,I'll just screw it.
00:24:49,00:24:52,"Yes, but we only have paper straws in our food."
00:24:52,00:24:54,So it's good for the environment.
00:24:54,00:24:57,"And then if it's not ready yet, do you just sew it back up?"
00:24:57,00:24:58,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:58,00:25:00,And then that is insane.
00:25:00,00:25:01,Isn't it true?
00:25:01,00:25:04,"They have a bit of a rough old ride sturgeon, because it's not just caviar."
00:25:04,00:25:06,We also use them for beer.
00:25:06,00:25:09,"Don't we? Traditionally, they were the original icing glass providers."
00:25:09,00:25:12,So that's the swim bladder.
00:25:12,00:25:14,And that's what they used to kind of purify beer.
00:25:14,00:25:16,It was used in things like Guinness until a couple of years ago.
00:25:16,00:25:18,I think they got rid of it.
00:25:18,00:25:20,It's to clarify alcoholic drinks.
00:25:20,00:25:22,"Sorry, I don't fully understand it."
00:25:22,00:25:26,"You get the swim bladder, and it's just used in the wine making or the beer making process"
00:25:26,00:25:28,to get rid of a lot of the sediment.
00:25:28,00:25:30,I think it's kind of used like a sieve.
00:25:30,00:25:33,And so that's why a lot of beers aren't vegetarian or vegetarian.
00:25:33,00:25:36,"A lot of vegans kind of have wine come, though, because of that reason."
00:25:36,00:25:39,"Sturgeon are amazing, amazing, amazing fish."
00:25:39,00:25:43,"They can weigh up to 1,500 kilos."
00:25:43,00:25:45,"Okay, like that's a lot."
00:25:45,00:25:47,I work in stone.
00:25:47,00:25:49,There's a lot of stone.
00:25:49,00:25:50,It is.
00:25:50,00:25:51,"No, they are massive."
00:25:51,00:25:53,"They are up to 28 feet long, which I find."
00:25:53,00:25:54,Sorry.
00:25:54,00:25:56,"I mean, that's, yeah, 28 feet long."
00:25:56,00:25:57,Right.
00:25:57,00:25:58,The surgeon.
00:25:58,00:25:59,Thank you.
00:25:59,00:26:00,"Those are the very, very biggest ever found with that."
00:26:00,00:26:01,Yeah.
00:26:01,00:26:02,They've been around that.
00:26:02,00:26:03,Okay.
00:26:03,00:26:04,That's the biggest surgeon.
00:26:04,00:26:09,"So it's, I think the beluga surgeon is the second biggest kind of bony fish."
00:26:09,00:26:11,"And yeah, it's just length of four men."
00:26:11,00:26:12,That is extraordinary.
00:26:12,00:26:13,Yeah.
00:26:13,00:26:14,I see.
00:26:14,00:26:17,"And they take a long time to, this is one of the reasons why caviar is so valuable"
00:26:17,00:26:20,"is that they take so long to reach maturity, right?"
00:26:20,00:26:25,The biggest one sometimes there is not until about 20 that they're producing enough caviar.
00:26:25,00:26:26,Wow.
00:26:26,00:26:27,You have to wait forever.
00:26:27,00:26:31,"So as well as eating fish eggs, you can eat fish sperm."
00:26:31,00:26:33,There's something called Shirako.
00:26:33,00:26:36,That's probably not how you pronounce it in Japan.
00:26:36,00:26:38,It translates as white children.
00:26:38,00:26:43,And it's the raw or cooked sperm of the codfish.
00:26:43,00:26:48,"And in Russia, they eat the sperm of herrings, because they like herrings in Russia."
00:26:48,00:26:52,"They don't, they preserve it, but not only do they eat it on their own sometimes,"
00:26:52,00:26:55,they will eat it with the row of herrings as well.
00:26:55,00:27:00,So they eat the eggs of the herring and the sperm of the herring in the same meal.
00:27:00,00:27:01,It's the same meal.
00:27:01,00:27:03,"I think that's a little unkind, isn't it?"
00:27:03,00:27:04,Why?
00:27:04,00:27:05,To whom?
00:27:05,00:27:07,"To the sperm and the eggs, because they belong together."
00:27:07,00:27:08,They should be...
00:27:08,00:27:09,"Well, you're marrying them."
00:27:09,00:27:13,Then you eat one of each and then a herring grows in your stomach.
00:27:13,00:27:16,"It's not like if you eat an apple seed, then an apple tree will grow out of your mouth."
00:27:16,00:27:18,"Oh man, we've got a lot of stuff to fill you up."
00:27:18,00:27:22,"I do feel like if I eat the sperm on the eggs of a herring,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,I would genuinely worry about that.
00:27:24,00:27:25,"Right, yeah."
00:27:25,00:27:26,You'd worry.
00:27:26,00:27:27,A little bit.
00:27:27,00:27:30,"The sperm is called Malokka, which I thought was Russian for milk."
00:27:30,00:27:32,"And you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong."
00:27:32,00:27:34,"And you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong."
00:27:34,00:27:36,And you came back with a pint the other day.
00:27:36,00:27:38,I hope you enjoyed your tea.
00:27:38,00:27:43,You get ant caviar too.
00:27:43,00:27:44,That's a thing.
00:27:44,00:27:45,What's that?
00:27:45,00:27:49,"It's not pupae and larvae, you know, so it's not eggs really,"
00:27:49,00:27:51,"but it's from a particular Mexican ant,"
00:27:51,00:27:54,which is known locally as La Hormiga Pedora.
00:27:54,00:27:56,You say that as if there's only one ant.
00:27:56,00:27:59,Incredibly.
00:27:59,00:28:01,It's incredibly expensive stuff.
00:28:01,00:28:03,I can't shop.
00:28:03,00:28:05,He cooks it as well as producing it.
00:28:05,00:28:08,So it's a real treat if you're in town.
00:28:08,00:28:11,"No La Hormiga Pedora is the farty ant,"
00:28:11,00:28:13,because they're next to smell like farts.
00:28:13,00:28:16,"But the eggs are a delicacy or the larvae, you know."
00:28:16,00:28:18,"You do get snail caviar, don't you?"
00:28:18,00:28:20,"Which is quite like fish caviar,"
00:28:20,00:28:22,apart from it tastes a bit more like snails.
00:28:22,00:28:23,Have you tried it?
00:28:23,00:28:24,Yeah.
00:28:24,00:28:25,Wow.
00:28:25,00:28:27,You got cowboy caviar?
00:28:27,00:28:29,Is that made of the eggs of cowboys?
00:28:29,00:28:31,"No, it's slang."
00:28:31,00:28:33,It's bulls' testicles that are fried.
00:28:33,00:28:36,So they're also known as rocky mountain oysters.
00:28:36,00:28:37,Have you?
00:28:37,00:28:39,"But they also, they would have those as bar snacks,"
00:28:39,00:28:40,wouldn't they?
00:28:40,00:28:41,"In the olden days,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,you would have testicles as bar snacks.
00:28:43,00:28:44,What?
00:28:44,00:28:45,They eat them a lot somewhere.
00:28:45,00:28:46,I think it might be in Mexico.
00:28:46,00:28:48,It's still a commonity.
00:28:48,00:28:50,It's a thing somewhere in South America.
00:28:50,00:28:53,It was a Montana testicle festival that I read about them in.
00:28:53,00:28:54,So maybe Montana as well.
00:28:54,00:28:55,It makes sense.
00:28:55,00:28:56,You're going to eat them anywhere.
00:28:56,00:28:57,It's going to be there.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"Confusingly, it's also from what I can tell online,"
00:28:59,00:29:01,"cowboy caviar is a salad,"
00:29:01,00:29:04,which is just a lot of salad bits thrown together.
00:29:04,00:29:06,So there's no sense to it.
00:29:06,00:29:07,Wow.
00:29:07,00:29:08,So be careful when ordering.
00:29:08,00:29:10,If you're a vegetarian in Montana.
00:29:10,00:29:11,Yeah.
00:29:11,00:29:13,What else happens at a testicle festival?
00:29:13,00:29:18,I think it's a lot of eating of testicles competitively.
00:29:18,00:29:20,Testicle festival is a very nice phrase to say.
00:29:20,00:29:21,It is.
00:29:21,00:29:22,It is.
00:29:22,00:29:23,It's very nice.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Shave waxing of testicles probably.
00:29:24,00:29:25,Yeah.
00:29:25,00:29:26,I'd have there waxing competitions.
00:29:26,00:29:28,"There's the big bowl contest that I've got here,"
00:29:28,00:29:30,which is men in wet underwear.
00:29:30,00:29:31,So I guess.
00:29:31,00:29:32,No.
00:29:32,00:29:33,That's what it says here.
00:29:33,00:29:35,I wonder if you could call it the festival.
00:29:35,00:29:36,"Yes, you could."
00:29:36,00:29:37,All the testicle.
00:29:37,00:29:40,"No, neither of this good is as good as testicle festival."
00:29:40,00:29:41,No.
00:29:41,00:29:42,"Anyway, they branded it right."
00:29:42,00:29:43,They branded it right.
00:29:43,00:29:44,"Well done, guys."
00:29:44,00:29:45,There's another caviar.
00:29:45,00:29:48,"There's a caviar sort of replacement you can have,"
00:29:48,00:29:51,which is very much like the real Russian thing.
00:29:51,00:29:54,And this is a replacement for a Russian Sevruga caviar.
00:29:54,00:29:57,And this is a kind of caviar that you can get from paddlefish.
00:29:57,00:29:59,"And basically, where most paddlefish are,"
00:29:59,00:30:02,is a place called Warsaw in Missouri.
00:30:02,00:30:04,And so apparently it's so good this stuff.
00:30:04,00:30:07,And all the Russians in Missouri think that this is just like
00:30:07,00:30:09,their Sevruga caviar back home.
00:30:09,00:30:14,And so there's this huge black market caviar fishing problem there.
00:30:14,00:30:15,And it was really good.
00:30:15,00:30:16,"It was this was on Longweed.com, I think."
00:30:16,00:30:18,A really good Longweed about it.
00:30:18,00:30:20,And it was about police descending on this place.
00:30:20,00:30:24,"And it's population doubles in the paddlefish fishing season,"
00:30:24,00:30:25,"which is just a couple of weeks long,"
00:30:25,00:30:27,because people flock there to try and get these fish
00:30:27,00:30:29,and get the caviar out of it.
00:30:29,00:30:31,And they thought we know there are all these Russian people
00:30:31,00:30:34,who are coming and they're illegally poaching these fish
00:30:34,00:30:36,"and then they're going, obviously, selling them."
00:30:36,00:30:37,They're getting so many.
00:30:37,00:30:39,"And gradually, as you're reading this our school,"
00:30:39,00:30:42,"you realize the police have this massive problem,"
00:30:42,00:30:44,"because even though they know these fish are disappearing,"
00:30:44,00:30:46,they know they're illegally taking them.
00:30:46,00:30:48,They can't track down any kind of black market.
00:30:48,00:30:50,They can't trace any money.
00:30:50,00:30:53,And it turns out when actually they start arresting people
00:30:53,00:30:56,"and when they go undercover, then no one's selling it at all."
00:30:56,00:30:58,It's just all these Russians are picking it.
00:30:58,00:30:59,They're just eating it.
00:30:59,00:31:01,They've just got these big Russian families.
00:31:01,00:31:04,So they'll get tens of thousands of pounds worth of caviar
00:31:04,00:31:07,"or some of them will have about 1,000 pounds worth"
00:31:07,00:31:09,of just the fish themselves.
00:31:09,00:31:11,"And they're like, no, why would I sell this?"
00:31:11,00:31:12,We're going to sell this.
00:31:12,00:31:14,They just take it back to their big families
00:31:14,00:31:15,and they eat it all.
00:31:15,00:31:17,And so there's nothing really that they can do.
00:31:17,00:31:19,"They just get taken to the police station and told,"
00:31:19,00:31:20,please don't take that fish again.
00:31:20,00:31:22,And then send home.
00:31:22,00:31:24,"Yeah, they're just liking it."
00:31:24,00:31:26,They like it in Russia.
00:31:26,00:31:27,I can say that much.
00:31:27,00:31:28,I think it's delicious.
00:31:28,00:31:30,I was reading about a sniffer cat called Russick.
00:31:30,00:31:33,Sniffer cat.
00:31:33,00:31:34,Sniffer cat.
00:31:34,00:31:36,Are they just praces?
00:31:36,00:31:37,This entire long read.
00:31:37,00:31:40,It looks like a good district in America.
00:31:40,00:31:41,Look at Sniffer cat.
00:31:41,00:31:43,Which looks like a bit of research.
00:31:43,00:31:45,I've never seen an elephant research
00:31:45,00:31:46,from an hour ago.
00:31:46,00:31:47,This is in Russia.
00:31:47,00:31:50,There was a lot of smuggling
00:31:50,00:31:53,or was a lot of smuggling in the Caspian Sea.
00:31:53,00:31:55,So they would come to a checkpoint
00:31:55,00:31:57,and people would try and get it through on their cars.
00:31:57,00:32:00,And they found that that was a big problem.
00:32:00,00:32:02,But they had this cat that they had adopted
00:32:02,00:32:06,"that was, I believe, a stray who loved eating chunks of sturgeon"
00:32:06,00:32:08,and caviar and so on.
00:32:08,00:32:10,That was being confiscated from the criminals.
00:32:10,00:32:12,"As a result, developed in a really strong nose"
00:32:12,00:32:15,"for Sniffer now, whenever there was sturgeon in the area."
00:32:15,00:32:18,"So what they stopped, what they started doing was"
00:32:18,00:32:21,"every time a car came up, the cat would be sent to go"
00:32:21,00:32:23,"and, you know, maybe they walked on the leash."
00:32:23,00:32:24,I didn't actually get that detail.
00:32:24,00:32:28,And Russik would have a smell and smell out all of these bits
00:32:28,00:32:29,of sturgeon and caviar.
00:32:29,00:32:32,And so good was he at doing it
00:32:32,00:32:35,that they actually retired the Sniffer dog that they had.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"Oh, that has got to hurt."
00:32:37,00:32:40,"Yeah, Sniffer dog and you lose your job to a cat."
00:32:40,00:32:43,"Yeah, first I lost my job to the elephant in that airport"
00:32:43,00:32:44,and now the rest.
00:32:44,00:32:47,"But yeah, so, unfortunately, he died in 2013"
00:32:47,00:32:49,when a vehicle that he was searching
00:32:49,00:32:51,suddenly jerked forward.
00:32:51,00:32:53,Convenience.
00:32:53,00:32:55,I can't believe they didn't do that sooner.
00:32:55,00:32:57,I can't believe no smuggler thought
00:32:57,00:32:59,of doing that straight away.
00:32:59,00:33:02,"So, they've got the cat smelling the cars."
00:33:02,00:33:04,Are they stationing it on the pavement
00:33:04,00:33:05,and cars whizz pass?
00:33:05,00:33:07,"And the cat said like, ""Rewr."""
00:33:07,00:33:09,"And then you know, just stop at that."
00:33:09,00:33:10,It's not like a speed gun.
00:33:10,00:33:11,This is surely at a checkpoint.
00:33:11,00:33:12,It's a checkpoint.
00:33:12,00:33:13,You have to stop at checkpoint.
00:33:13,00:33:17,Hold the gun to the cat and pointing at cars as they go past.
00:33:17,00:33:20,You pull its tail when you want it to snow something.
00:33:20,00:33:24,For sure they want you to stop to car
00:33:24,00:33:26,and you've opened the doors.
00:33:26,00:33:28,Isn't it as easy for you?
00:33:28,00:33:30,We've just covered our big sturgeoner.
00:33:30,00:33:32,I would say I could find sturgeon as easily
00:33:32,00:33:34,and quickly over a cat.
00:33:34,00:33:35,"You're right, they're massive."
00:33:35,00:33:36,They're really big.
00:33:36,00:33:38,They were sat in the sort of passenger seat
00:33:38,00:33:40,with a hat and a fake mask.
00:33:40,00:33:43,Who's my friend Bob?
00:33:43,00:33:45,"What do you say, Kitty?"
00:33:45,00:33:47,That's a sturgeon.
00:33:47,00:33:50,Thank God for Rosset or whatever he's called.
00:33:50,00:33:52,Otherwise I would have believed in Bob.
00:33:52,00:33:53,And it stinks.
00:33:53,00:33:55,"I mean, if there's a car full of fish,"
00:33:55,00:33:57,I'm going to smell it.
00:33:57,00:33:59,I need a magic cat.
00:33:59,00:34:02,But maybe his gift was in telling people about it.
00:34:02,00:34:03,Oh yeah.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"Like most cats, if they smell, they're not going to tell you."
00:34:05,00:34:07,They're not going to throw someone up.
00:34:07,00:34:09,I've not ridden down the most interesting bit of the story.
00:34:09,00:34:10,It was a talking cat.
00:34:10,00:34:12,I'm so sorry.
00:34:12,00:34:14,I missed out the best detail.
00:34:14,00:34:21,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:34:21,00:34:23,And that is my fact.
00:34:23,00:34:26,My fact this week is that wrestling star Andre the Giant
00:34:26,00:34:29,was so massive that once when he drunkenly passed out
00:34:29,00:34:32,"in a hotel lobby, staff couldn't move him"
00:34:32,00:34:34,and had to corner him off with velvet ropes
00:34:34,00:34:36,until he woke up.
00:34:36,00:34:37,So amazing.
00:34:37,00:34:40,"This is, yeah, this is from an anecdote"
00:34:40,00:34:42,"that comes from a book called ""As You Wish"""
00:34:42,00:34:45,"""Inconceivable Tales from the Making of the Princess Bride"""
00:34:45,00:34:48,"by Carrie Elwes, who was the lead actor in it."
00:34:48,00:34:50,He was also in Robin Hood men and types.
00:34:50,00:34:53,And the whole book is just anecdotes about the time
00:34:53,00:34:54,that they were making the movie.
00:34:54,00:34:55,And that's what came out.
00:34:55,00:34:59,"The fact that he used to have all these drunken exescapades,"
00:34:59,00:35:02,one of which meant he passed down.
00:35:02,00:35:04,"And Andre the Giant was in that movie as well, right?"
00:35:04,00:35:06,"He played ""Fesick, the Giant."""
00:35:06,00:35:07,Yeah.
00:35:07,00:35:08,"You're a really typecast, wasn't he?"
00:35:08,00:35:09,Yeah.
00:35:09,00:35:12,"He wasn't going to play ""Fesick, the Giant."""
00:35:12,00:35:14,"And he was a wrestler, Andre the Giant."
00:35:14,00:35:16,"He was a wrestler before he was a film star, really."
00:35:16,00:35:17,Absolutely.
00:35:17,00:35:18,"I mean, that's his big career thing, really."
00:35:18,00:35:20,"Well, before that, he was a rugby player"
00:35:20,00:35:23,"and before that, he was in a furniture removal business."
00:35:23,00:35:25,"And before that, he was a child."
00:35:25,00:35:27,"Before that, he was a tiny egg."
00:35:27,00:35:29,A professional egg.
00:35:29,00:35:33,"But to the WWF, now the WWE, he is one of the great wrestling stars"
00:35:33,00:35:34,of all time.
00:35:34,00:35:36,He was in the period of Hulk Hogan and Macho Man
00:35:36,00:35:39,"and ultimately Warrior, that sort of very classic era"
00:35:39,00:35:40,when they started.
00:35:40,00:35:42,I just don't get wrestling.
00:35:42,00:35:43,What?
00:35:43,00:35:45,It doesn't make any sense to me.
00:35:45,00:35:46,We've covered it before on this podcast
00:35:46,00:35:48,and I find it impossible to research.
00:35:48,00:35:50,"Because everything you read about it, you were like,"
00:35:50,00:35:52,is this real?
00:35:52,00:35:53,Did this really happen?
00:35:53,00:35:58,The confusion of real sport and fake acting is bewildering.
00:35:58,00:36:01,"Like there's this fight between him and Hulk Hogan,"
00:36:01,00:36:03,which was this really famous fight.
00:36:03,00:36:06,And apparently it was super controversial.
00:36:06,00:36:12,It was in 1988 and there was a famous referee called Dave Hebner
00:36:12,00:36:14,who was refereed wrestling matches.
00:36:14,00:36:16,And he happened to have an identical twin.
00:36:16,00:36:17,"Oh, yes."
00:36:17,00:36:19,Who they tracked down for this match.
00:36:19,00:36:21,"And yeah, the referee had an identical twin."
00:36:21,00:36:22,"He didn't really, I think."
00:36:22,00:36:24,"No, he did really."
00:36:24,00:36:26,I've seen the actual pictures.
00:36:26,00:36:29,"Either he did, or there's some amazing Photoshop in going on."
00:36:29,00:36:31,But he had this identical twin.
00:36:31,00:36:36,"And so, right, Andre the Giant's agent got Dave,"
00:36:36,00:36:39,"who was supposed to referee the match, locked him in a cupboard,"
00:36:39,00:36:42,"and then bribed Earl, his identical twin,"
00:36:42,00:36:44,to referee the game instead.
00:36:44,00:36:45,And he did.
00:36:45,00:36:47,And then he made Andre the Giant one.
00:36:47,00:36:49,And then Dave broke out of his closet.
00:36:49,00:36:52,And then him and his identical twin brother had a big fight afterwards
00:36:52,00:36:53,in front of the coach.
00:36:53,00:36:55,This is the weirdest conversation.
00:36:55,00:36:58,I really want to hear Adam do the Coventry of WWF.
00:36:58,00:37:00,I don't understand any of this.
00:37:00,00:37:01,Is that real?
00:37:01,00:37:03,Oh my god.
00:37:03,00:37:05,But the story lies.
00:37:05,00:37:06,The story lies.
00:37:06,00:37:07,You go to the theatre all the time.
00:37:07,00:37:08,Are you standing up?
00:37:08,00:37:09,What the fuck is going on here?
00:37:09,00:37:10,"No, no, no."
00:37:10,00:37:12,"Because in the right-ups of the theatre,"
00:37:12,00:37:13,"it doesn't say,"
00:37:13,00:37:15,and there was an incredibly controversial moment
00:37:15,00:37:19,when Hamlet's mother remarried Hamlet's uncle
00:37:19,00:37:21,"and the audience, you're like,"
00:37:21,00:37:22,"""Okay, this is a story."
00:37:22,00:37:25,"There was in the Wikipedia page that this is not here."""
00:37:25,00:37:27,Was it controversial?
00:37:27,00:37:28,Was it all made up?
00:37:28,00:37:29,It's all made up.
00:37:29,00:37:30,It's all made up.
00:37:30,00:37:31,It's all made up.
00:37:31,00:37:32,Then why is it controversial?
00:37:32,00:37:35,It's controversial in the world of wrestling.
00:37:35,00:37:36,Which is a fake world.
00:37:36,00:37:37,Yeah.
00:37:37,00:37:38,Yeah.
00:37:38,00:37:39,Okay.
00:37:39,00:37:40,Now you're getting it.
00:37:40,00:37:44,"No, it is weird how it's presented as true."
00:37:44,00:37:46,"Normally, if it plays, there is a synopsis."
00:37:46,00:37:48,"Normally when you go out of the play,"
00:37:48,00:37:50,the thing doesn't keep happening else.
00:37:50,00:37:51,"No, but..."
00:37:51,00:37:53,I just think it's amazing that we found
00:37:53,00:37:55,the edge of Anna's comfort zone.
00:37:55,00:37:56,Yeah.
00:37:56,00:37:57,I never thought we'd get there.
00:37:57,00:38:00,Who would know as pro wrestling is fake?
00:38:00,00:38:05,It just makes me have a panic attack when I read about it.
00:38:05,00:38:07,"But it's a drama, like he's standards."
00:38:07,00:38:08,It goes on and on.
00:38:08,00:38:09,Of course it's happening.
00:38:09,00:38:11,Don't smash out into the news at 10.
00:38:11,00:38:13,"And suddenly, they're rolling in."
00:38:13,00:38:16,What about the guy from Holyoke's was fighting the guy
00:38:16,00:38:17,from Emma Dale last week?
00:38:17,00:38:18,What?
00:38:18,00:38:19,I missed that.
00:38:19,00:38:21,"Yeah, one of them got fired in real life, I think."
00:38:21,00:38:22,Yeah.
00:38:22,00:38:23,Although this is all making me wonder about everything.
00:38:23,00:38:24,"Anyway, hang on."
00:38:24,00:38:26,So there was a real life fight between a character.
00:38:26,00:38:27,Someone in...
00:38:27,00:38:29,Someone in Emadale and someone in Holyoke's.
00:38:29,00:38:30,Was it Holyoke's?
00:38:30,00:38:31,"Yes, it was Holyoke's."
00:38:31,00:38:32,Yes.
00:38:32,00:38:33,They got in a big fight.
00:38:33,00:38:34,"Oh, physical fight."
00:38:34,00:38:35,Yeah.
00:38:35,00:38:37,I thought you meant that someone from Holyoke's turned up in Emadale.
00:38:37,00:38:40,Like a character sort of made his way through the membrane
00:38:40,00:38:41,and he ended up...
00:38:41,00:38:43,Because I definitely watched that as well.
00:38:43,00:38:46,Like a weird portal opens between the world.
00:38:46,00:38:48,It's like the treatment show or something.
00:38:48,00:38:49,Yeah.
00:38:49,00:38:51,One of them pint glasses from the old fix.
00:38:51,00:38:54,Snashes through into coronation street.
00:38:54,00:38:56,"Look, we get back to Andre the giant."
00:38:56,00:38:57,"Sorry, I'll take the giant."
00:38:57,00:38:58,"Oh, what's here, giant?"
00:38:58,00:38:59,So no.
00:38:59,00:39:03,It was actually three children in a massive overcome.
00:39:03,00:39:07,"So when he was drinking according to Carrie Ellers,"
00:39:07,00:39:12,"when he was drinking in New York once, the NYPD had to send an undercover cop"
00:39:12,00:39:15,"to follow him around the bars because if he got too drunk,"
00:39:15,00:39:19,there was once time where he fell over and crushed a human underneath
00:39:19,00:39:21,and they didn't want that to happen again.
00:39:21,00:39:22,Yeah.
00:39:22,00:39:23,Not to death.
00:39:23,00:39:24,"No, no, no, no."
00:39:24,00:39:25,I think he was stuck.
00:39:25,00:39:28,"You know, that's seven foot two of massive body on him."
00:39:28,00:39:31,He got so tall because he had acromegaly.
00:39:31,00:39:33,That was the cause of his giant size.
00:39:33,00:39:36,His parents did not recognise him.
00:39:36,00:39:37,So he left home at 14.
00:39:37,00:39:40,"He came back at 19 and they said, ""Who are you?"""
00:39:40,00:39:44,And they'd even seen him wrestling on TV without recognising who he was.
00:39:44,00:39:46,"But yeah, they didn't realise him took quite late, right?"
00:39:46,00:39:49,So he wasn't sort of amazingly huge.
00:39:49,00:39:50,It was normal until he was 15.
00:39:50,00:39:52,"Normal size until he was 15, yeah."
00:39:52,00:39:54,And we keep saying he gets drunk.
00:39:54,00:39:57,"But to give him credit, I don't think he really did get drunk very often."
00:39:57,00:39:59,He basically held his drink incredibly well
00:39:59,00:40:01,and he drank extraordinary amounts.
00:40:01,00:40:04,He'd drink over 100 beers in a night and be fine.
00:40:04,00:40:08,Or I think someone was once asked how much can he drink before he's drunk
00:40:08,00:40:14,and someone said he starts to feel it after the first bottle of vodka or something.
00:40:14,00:40:20,"He used to order a drink, which was a concoction that consisted of 40 ounces of just random liquids,"
00:40:20,00:40:22,which he called the American.
00:40:22,00:40:24,He just had it poured into a pitcher.
00:40:24,00:40:28,And I'm glad he didn't have a cocktail bar because that is the most disgusting sounding drink.
00:40:28,00:40:30,To the random liquids on the menu.
00:40:30,00:40:32,"Well, that's Kerry Elves, again, this is from him."
00:40:32,00:40:35,"And he says it, ""I've never tasted aeroplane fuel, but imagine it's very garlic."""
00:40:35,00:40:37,It's like a top shelf you would have.
00:40:37,00:40:40,"Like, let's say it was your 21st birthday and your friends,"
00:40:40,00:40:41,what did you get drunk?
00:40:41,00:40:42,"They'd buy you a top shelf,"
00:40:42,00:40:44,which is basically one of every shot in a glass.
00:40:44,00:40:45,Oh.
00:40:45,00:40:47,"Your friends would have done the same thing, I'm sure."
00:40:47,00:40:49,"Well, yeah, we would have done, but we didn't finish our croquet in time,"
00:40:49,00:40:51,so we all had to go home.
00:40:51,00:40:55,"When Andre the Giant was in Paris one day,"
00:40:55,00:40:57,he realized that the cars there were quite small
00:40:57,00:41:00,and he could just move them around if he wanted to because he was so strong.
00:41:00,00:41:04,"And so he would get his friends, because in America, they're much bigger, right?"
00:41:04,00:41:09,So he would get his friends cars and then move them into tiny little spaces where they couldn't go.
00:41:09,00:41:12,Got to make parking easier.
00:41:12,00:41:15,If you could just get out of the car and lift it into the space.
00:41:15,00:41:16,That's such a good idea.
00:41:16,00:41:17,You could hardly get into cars.
00:41:17,00:41:18,He was so huge.
00:41:18,00:41:22,There's photos of him getting in and out of a car.
00:41:22,00:41:24,And he basically had to go in on all fours
00:41:24,00:41:26,and be the entire backseat was him.
00:41:26,00:41:27,You know?
00:41:27,00:41:29,"Yeah, he once got into a taxi and they couldn't close the door."
00:41:29,00:41:30,Wow.
00:41:30,00:41:33,"I think we've done it on the podcast before,"
00:41:33,00:41:36,"but when he was a kid, because he couldn't get the bus, the normal bus,"
00:41:36,00:41:38,he used to be driven to school by Samuel Beckett.
00:41:38,00:41:39,Samuel Beckett.
00:41:39,00:41:40,But that's not true.
00:41:40,00:41:41,Is that not true?
00:41:41,00:41:43,That was actually another thing that Elle was claimed.
00:41:43,00:41:45,But it wasn't quite true.
00:41:45,00:41:50,So he grew up in the same French town weirdly as Samuel Beckett moved to in Malia.
00:41:50,00:41:54,And apparently Beckett was kind of a friendly guy and used to drive the kids to school.
00:41:54,00:41:55,Okay.
00:41:55,00:41:57,"And in a way, there was okay back then."
00:41:57,00:42:00,"And he sometimes he would hit to ride with them, but he could fit on the bus."
00:42:00,00:42:02,"Because how small would a bus have to be if, you know?"
00:42:02,00:42:04,"No, he had a pickup truck."
00:42:04,00:42:06,And the kids would sit on the back of the truck.
00:42:06,00:42:07,So it was true that he used to be a lift.
00:42:07,00:42:08,"Yes, he did."
00:42:08,00:42:10,It just wasn't because he couldn't fit on the bus.
00:42:10,00:42:11,Right.
00:42:11,00:42:12,"Yeah, got it."
00:42:12,00:42:13,"He was a really nice guy, though, wasn't he?"
00:42:13,00:42:17,"Everyone said, he was very much a gentle giant, everyone called him."
00:42:17,00:42:22,"And someone said he didn't like cursing people, which now I understand that resting isn't really"
00:42:22,00:42:24,about really hurting people does make sense.
00:42:24,00:42:29,But he was friends with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Arnold Schwarzenegger in this PBS documentary
00:42:29,00:42:31,that you should watch if you're really interested in Andre the Giant.
00:42:31,00:42:35,But Arnold Schwarzenegger said that he was a restaurant within once.
00:42:35,00:42:40,And Andre used to always insist on paying for anyone's dinner or anyone's drinks when he went out with them.
00:42:40,00:42:42,And so Arnold knew this and he tried to sort of sneakily pay.
00:42:42,00:42:47,And Andre lifted him up off his chair and put him on top of a cupboard.
00:42:47,00:42:49,That's brilliant.
00:42:49,00:42:51,"Oh, it's bizarrely."
00:42:51,00:42:53,And it's weird saying Arnold Schwarzenegger say this word.
00:42:53,00:42:54,It's an arm-war.
00:42:54,00:42:58,"So he says, ""And Andre just lifted me up and he put me onto the arm-war."""
00:42:58,00:42:59,Wow.
00:42:59,00:43:03,I thought I'd see Arnold Schwarzenegger use the word arm-war.
00:43:03,00:43:05,He was meant to play physics.
00:43:05,00:43:07,He was meant to play the role in Princess Royce.
00:43:07,00:43:08,Yeah.
00:43:08,00:43:09,He was the original casting choice.
00:43:09,00:43:11,A lot of different films.
00:43:11,00:43:12,Yeah.
00:43:12,00:43:14,"And he didn't because it took so long to make, didn't it?"
00:43:14,00:43:15,It took about a decade to make.
00:43:15,00:43:18,"And by then, Arnold Schwarzenegger was too famous."
00:43:18,00:43:20,"It took a decade to get into production, I think."
00:43:20,00:43:22,"And by then, Arnold Schwarzenegger had a real career."
00:43:22,00:43:23,Gosh.
00:43:23,00:43:24,Wow.
00:43:24,00:43:25,I've got some facts about alcohol tolerance.
00:43:25,00:43:27,But I don't know if you got more on Andre the Giant.
00:43:27,00:43:30,I just said he kept a small farm and he would walk around and play with the animals
00:43:30,00:43:32,because they didn't stare at him for his size.
00:43:32,00:43:34,"I think that's bullshit as well, but worth saying."
00:43:34,00:43:36,"No, I think he definitely likes not being stared at."
00:43:36,00:43:41,It's kind of a tragic life he had because he was obviously lovely
00:43:41,00:43:43,and knew his career depended on being huge.
00:43:43,00:43:46,"But at the same time, he said the Princess Bride was the happiest he'd ever been"
00:43:46,00:43:49,"filming that because for the first time ever, people didn't stare at him"
00:43:49,00:43:52,because I guess he was just an actor on set and then you were to expect.
00:43:52,00:43:53,He loved it.
00:43:53,00:43:58,"And in fact, there's a really nice interview with one of his friends called Lanny"
00:43:58,00:44:03,"who said that after he'd filmed the Princess Bride, Andre invited him out to his house"
00:44:03,00:44:06,"and gave him a bunch of alcohol and said, ""Hey, Jonah, come into my drawing room."
00:44:06,00:44:07,"I'll show you something."""
00:44:07,00:44:08,And made him watch the film.
00:44:08,00:44:11,And then he kept inviting him around and kept making him watch.
00:44:11,00:44:13,And he did it with all his friends because he loved.
00:44:13,00:44:14,He was so proud of it.
00:44:14,00:44:16,"And he said, ""You know, did you think I was good in it?"
00:44:16,00:44:17,"Do you think I was right in the Princess Bride?"""
00:44:17,00:44:20,"And they'd all be like, ""Yeah, you were really great in that, don't worry."""
00:44:20,00:44:21,Have you guys all seen this movie?
00:44:21,00:44:22,Yeah.
00:44:22,00:44:23,Because I actually don't even know what it's about.
00:44:23,00:44:24,"Oh, okay."
00:44:24,00:44:25,"Is it a, is it a..."
00:44:25,00:44:28,"It's a fan to see, yeah."
00:44:28,00:44:29,But a very funny one.
00:44:29,00:44:30,Yeah.
00:44:30,00:44:32,"It is an amazing film, if anyone listening hasn't."
00:44:32,00:44:33,"Yeah, it's a classic."
00:44:33,00:44:34,Yeah.
00:44:34,00:44:35,"Yeah, it's very good."
00:44:35,00:44:38,I also did a bit of reading about just other people who drank a lot.
00:44:38,00:44:39,Okay.
00:44:39,00:44:40,So all of a read.
00:44:40,00:44:41,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:41,00:44:42,The great hellraisers of the 20th Century.
00:44:42,00:44:43,I didn't know this.
00:44:43,00:44:47,"He would frequently expose his penis when drunk, standard practice, I guess."
00:44:47,00:44:51,But he got a tattoo of an eagle's claw on his penis.
00:44:51,00:44:52,Oh.
00:44:52,00:44:53,I know.
00:44:53,00:44:54,"Well, it was just a tattoo of one."
00:44:54,00:44:55,It wasn't an actual claw.
00:44:55,00:44:59,"Yeah, but do you think people got confused and thought, ""An eagle had landed on his jaw?"""
00:44:59,00:45:04,"Well, he then lays, we've got an eagle's head tattooed on his shoulder."
00:45:04,00:45:06,And he would show fellow drinkers his shoulder tattoo.
00:45:06,00:45:10,"And then he'd say, ""Would you like to see where it's perched and make it this cock out?"""
00:45:10,00:45:11,Wow.
00:45:11,00:45:12,I know.
00:45:12,00:45:16,That's quite a labour-intensive practical joke.
00:45:16,00:45:17,"Yeah, really?"
00:45:17,00:45:20,So he died on the set of Gladiator.
00:45:20,00:45:23,"You know, they had to sort of reconstitute his role for the final film."
00:45:23,00:45:27,"But when he died, he'd had 12 double rums, lots of whiskey and an arm wrestle."
00:45:27,00:45:30,Which of those killed him?
00:45:30,00:45:33,I think it was the previous 60-odd years that killed him.
00:45:33,00:45:34,"Yeah, yeah."
00:45:34,00:45:35,"Well, yeah."
00:45:35,00:45:38,Just another film giant is Richard Kiel.
00:45:38,00:45:40,And he's the guy who played Jaws in...
00:45:40,00:45:41,"Oh, Jaws."
00:45:41,00:45:42,In Jaws.
00:45:42,00:45:45,He was amazing.
00:45:45,00:45:46,I really believe it.
00:45:46,00:45:47,He's actually a sturgeon.
00:45:47,00:45:52,"So famous fish, Richard Kiel."
00:45:52,00:45:54,"No, he played Jaws in the Bond films."
00:45:54,00:45:57,But he had lots of jobs before he became an actor.
00:45:57,00:45:58,So he was...
00:45:58,00:46:00,"First of all, he was a cemetery plot salesman."
00:46:00,00:46:01,I just like the...
00:46:01,00:46:03,"So he was seven foot two, whatever, seven foot three."
00:46:03,00:46:05,Imagine someone selling you a cemetery plot who's a giant.
00:46:05,00:46:08,And then he was a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman.
00:46:08,00:46:09,Wow.
00:46:09,00:46:10,"You know how, if you're..."
00:46:10,00:46:12,"If you bury someone, they're six feet under."
00:46:12,00:46:13,Hmm.
00:46:13,00:46:16,He could stand at the bottom of that plot and still talk to you.
00:46:16,00:46:19,He could be able to see his face.
00:46:19,00:46:20,Wow.
00:46:20,00:46:22,A miles to see a vacuum cleaner salesman.
00:46:22,00:46:23,A vacuum cleaner salesman.
00:46:23,00:46:26,"And then he married a woman called Diane, who was five foot one."
00:46:26,00:46:28,And she did an interview and they said...
00:46:28,00:46:29,"Yeah, also, sorry."
00:46:29,00:46:31,He's got lovely needs.
00:46:31,00:46:33,"Interestingly, the opposite."
00:46:33,00:46:35,"They said, ""Why did you marry him?"""
00:46:35,00:46:37,"And she said, ""We just see eye to eye on most things."""
00:46:37,00:46:38,"Oh, sweet."
00:46:38,00:46:39,"Sorry, sweet."
00:46:39,00:46:40,Any more for any more?
00:46:40,00:46:41,I'm done.
00:46:41,00:46:42,I'm out.
00:46:42,00:46:43,"I mean, I'll just tell you."
00:46:43,00:46:44,"Go on, tell us."
00:46:44,00:46:46,"Well, it's just another hell-raise effect."
00:46:46,00:46:47,It's not really relevant.
00:46:47,00:46:48,But a Petro tool?
00:46:48,00:46:49,Yeah.
00:46:49,00:46:50,A big old drinker.
00:46:50,00:46:54,"When he was filming Lawrence of Arabia, he found and bought a precious pair of Greek earrings,"
00:46:54,00:46:56,but he had to get them through customs.
00:46:56,00:46:58,So he smuggled them through in his foreskin.
00:46:58,00:46:59,"Oh, wow."
00:46:59,00:47:00,No.
00:47:00,00:47:01,What did he expect that?
00:47:01,00:47:04,I told you it wasn't relevant.
00:47:04,00:47:05,They're going...
00:47:05,00:47:07,"Are you sure, jumbo?"
00:47:07,00:47:09,Are you sure it's that?
00:47:09,00:47:11,We better get the cat as well.
00:47:11,00:47:15,"A second of it, you know."
00:47:15,00:47:17,She's an elephant.
00:47:17,00:47:18,He's a cat.
00:47:18,00:47:21,"Together, they might cry."
00:47:21,00:47:25,"Okay, that is it."
00:47:25,00:47:26,That is all of our facts.
00:47:26,00:47:28,Thank you so much for listening.
