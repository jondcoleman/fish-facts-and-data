2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:25,800
 >> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Philadelphia.

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,200
 [APPLAUSE]

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,240
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,080
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,080
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,280
 And in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,280
 My fact is that the star of the film Candy Man, where a character has bees coming out of his mouth,

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,360
 negotiated a $1,000 bonus for every time he got stung.

10
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,560
 He ended up with $23,000.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,880
 >> Wow.

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,680
 >> How bad is it to be stung by a bee?

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,240
 Do you think you'd be deliberately angering the bees so that you got a few more stings that they've been mumbling or not?

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,480
 >> I would, but that says more about me than it does about me.

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,760
 Yeah, although in the mouth, I imagine it would be a lot more painful than normal.

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,520
 So this is Candy Man, this is Tony Todd.

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,320
 This is a kind of cult horror film.

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,080
 And one of the inspirations was from the Johnny Carson show,

19
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,400
 where there was a man called Norman Gary, who was a bee-based performer.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,120
 And he had an act where he played the clarinet while covered in bees.

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,240
 And people loved this.

22
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,920
 And he then became the bee wrangler, the official bee person on Candy Man.

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,440
 >> Yeah. >> And I think it's him and Tony Todd,

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,000
 they're the only two people to have done all three Candy Man films is the star and the bee guy.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,760
 >> Can you explain what Candy Man is, because I haven't seen it, so.

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,120
 >> It's, Dan, you watch it like a child.

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,840
 >> Yeah, yeah, it's a horror film.

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,120
 There's a guy who has a hook, and if you say his name into a mirror five times, he kills you.

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,480
 So in theory, you shouldn't do that, but people they do.

30
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,320
 >> They're then.

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,840
 >> Yeah, but it's times if we said it itself, I don't understand.

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,000
 >> But it was written by Clive Barker, the great horror writer.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,720
 I think he did Hellraiser as well.

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,000
 And the bees that they use, actually, there is a logic.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,840
 It wasn't bees that were just ready and furious and waiting to sting.

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,680
 They made sure that the bees were only 12 hours old.

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,760
 So imagine you've just been born.

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,360
 And just suddenly in a Hollywood movie, it's incredible.

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,960
 And so yeah, so they went into the mouth.

40
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,400
 And the idea is that the stings wouldn't be sharpened up.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,640
 Even when he was stung, it wouldn't have the sting of, say, 14-hour old bee.

42
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,880
 And once they'd done each take, the bees would be vacuumed up using a tiny bee vacuum

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,960
 to do you know that you can get a bee vacuum cleaner?

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,120
 How's that different from a normal vacuum cleaner?

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,640
 >> I think it's just a little bit kinder on the bees, I would guess.

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,800
 >> It was a mini one.

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,360
 I guess it was different because it's a bee size.

48
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,560
 Not like a bee would use it as a vacuum cleaner.

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,360
 >> And they'd be sucked up and then returned to their dressing room.

50
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,840
 For the sort of to await the next take.

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,400
 >> Wow.

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,720
 >> They didn't have their own dressing room.

53
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,560
 They do mean a wooden box.

54
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,600
 >> I think.

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
 >> Yeah, well, you've seen our dressing room tonight, that's.

56
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,800
 >> It's full of bees.

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,760
 >> But actually, the main thing is with this beading thing,

58
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,400
 which is what the clarinetist did, okay.

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,840
 So what you do is you get a queen bee and you put it in a little cage by your face.

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,600
 And then all of the other bees kind of come along because they like the queen bee so much

61
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,960
 and they hang around your face.

62
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,280
 And the way that you get them off normally is you spend maybe a couple of hours

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,920
 getting them on so you have a massive bee beard and then you just jump in the air.

64
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,520
 And when you land, all the bees just disappear.

65
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,680
 They just stop holding onto your face.

66
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,480
 >> That's amazing, does that not irritate them?

67
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,320
 >> A little bit, you might get stung a few times.

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,640
 But then you walk backwards and someone's kind of firing smoke in your face

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,120
 so that they're getting a bit sleepy, a little bit drowsy, and then you can get away.

70
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,360
 >> That's so crafty, cool.

71
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,000
 >> Really, that's so weird, because Virginia Madden, who I think was the lead female character

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,440
 in the film, said it used to take ages for there to be ranked as the sweet the bees are.

73
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,480
 >> Well, yeah, because what they did with them is they kind of smeared their face in the pheromone.

74
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,280
 And so the bees just really did not want to leave them.

75
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,320
 She said that it basically, you have pheromones on them, so they're all in love with you, all the bees.

76
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,280
 That's nice, isn't it?

77
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,120
 >> She was allergic to bees, I think.

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,600
 >> She was very slightly, wasn't she?

79
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,920
 >> The director said, no, you're not, you're just afraid.

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:44,600
 This guy Norman Gary, the bee wrangler, he has a Guinness World Record that is obviously

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
 be related, but it is for most bees in a mouth.

82
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
 >> Wow, really?

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
 >> How many guesses?

84
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,600
 >> I would say about 14.

85
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 >> 14?

86
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
 >> 14.

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
 >> 16.

88
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
 >> 16.

89
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 >> 16.

90
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
 >> 16.

91
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
 >> 16.

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
 >> 16.

93
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 >> Okay.

94
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,080
 >> By an incredibly dubious method, Dan Wins.

95
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,120
 >> But you're still out, he had 109 live bees in his mouth at one time.

96
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,200
 And you get a sponge soaked in sugar, and they like that, obviously, so they always seek

97
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,600
 that out, so you can sort of train them to go where you want them to go by that with that

98
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
 sponge.

99
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,800
 So then he put it in his mouth, you have to close your mouth for 10 seconds for the record

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,240
 to be valid, so they're all in there, and then you put a mesh cage up to your lips, you

101
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,880
 blow them all into the cage at the same time, then you close the bag, and then you to do

102
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,600
 the count, you have to allow them to escape one by one while you're telling them.

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
 >> One by one.

104
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
 >> Until then, you don't know if you've got the record, because you've just got to let a bee's

105
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
 in your mouth.

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
 It's easier to count them out than it is to count them in, I guess.

107
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
 >> Yeah, I see that.

108
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,400
 >> Hey, I was looking into horror movies generally, because I realize I just don't know much about

109
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
 sort of like the behind the scenes of movies.

110
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,600
 I found this really fun fact, which is the Omen, the movie The Omen, so Damien, who is, it's

111
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,600
 now the classic name for, yeah, so he wasn't meant to be called Damien.

112
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
 >> Oh, no.

113
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,400
 >> Yeah, originally, the screenwriter, David Celtser, he wanted to name the anti-Christ

114
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,280
 Domlin, D-O-M-L-I-N, and the reason he wanted to call him Domlin is because he knew

115
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,320
 a Domlin who was a totally obnoxious brat, he said.

116
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,800
 It was a friend, it was the child of a friend of his, and it was his wife, the screenwriter's

117
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,000
 wife, who went, you can't fucking do this to Domlin, immortalize him as the anti-Christ

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 in a movie.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
 >> It's not, they're not going to go, well, it might be another Domlin.

120
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
 >> Yeah, exactly.

121
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,400
 >> So it's Damien, yeah, it should have been Domlin.

122
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
 >> Wow.

123
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
 But not all the Damians get that, it seems unfair.

124
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,160
 >> But at least there are all the Damians, there's not just one Damien at the world, he knows

125
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
 it's about him.

126
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,340
 >> They used to have a lot of horror movies within Sexon, like this one Candy Man with

127
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:02,120
 the Bees, with it between 1966 and 1978, there were six major films featuring Bees as

128
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,960
 the main horror in that film.

129
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,400
 One of them was called The Swarm, and the Sunday Times has said it's the worst film ever made.

130
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,640
 Richard Velt in the Wilmington Morning Star said, "The Swarm may not be the worst movie ever

131
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
 made.

132
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,000
 I'll have to see them all to be sure, but it's certainly as bad as any I've ever seen."

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,920
 All the actors involved in this fiasco should be ashamed.

134
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,520
 Apparently, it's absolutely awful, it's got Michael Cain in it.

135
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,520
 It costs tons, it was really expensive, the budget was like 20 million.

136
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,680
 He came out in the same year as Star Wars, which was made for a lot less money, and is basically

137
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,480
 about a load of killer bees.

138
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,240
 Now, the American Bee Association decided to do a cease and desist to the Swarm for defaming

139
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,240
 the American Honey Bee, and as a result, at the end of the movie, there's a disclaimer

140
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,560
 saying that the killer bees in the film are no resemblance to real crop pollinating honey

141
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
 bees.

142
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,960
 I thought it was some resemblance.

143
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,280
 I was reading about the Swarm too, it does sound absolutely amazing, it's two hours and

144
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,320
 forty minutes long, which is hefty.

145
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,040
 Michael Cain said that he only did it because his mother needed a house to live in.

146
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,120
 It's quite sweet, but also, they kept finding all the way through the film, because they

147
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,560
 filmed it with nearly a million bees, so it was a big huge cast, basically.

148
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,840
 Huge got one, the credits at the end, B1, B2, B3.

149
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,560
 But the cast and the crew, they kept finding little yellow dots on their clothing because

150
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,840
 of all the bees, and Michael Cain would eat that, before eventually being informed that

151
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,480
 that was not honey he was eating, but that was just bee excrement that he'd casually been

152
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,280
 snacking on throughout the filming.

153
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
 Wow.

154
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,120
 That's when you do need a bee with a little vacuum cleaner, don't you?

155
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,880
 The cleaner bee.

156
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,440
 Another horror film, which involves animals going nuts, was the birds, and they had a bird

157
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,900
 trainer in the birds, and in fact he's called Ray Berrick, and he trained all birds in

158
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,300
 all films that you've seen with birds in for about twenty years, so like the Birdman of

159
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,000
 Alcatraz is another big one, and he had such cool tricks, so I don't know if you've seen

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,180
 the birds, but there are lots of scenes where the birds fly towards the lens of the camera

161
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,840
 and attack it, and they put meat in the lenses of the camera, so the birds would fly at it.

162
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
 Cool.

163
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,800
 But if you read, it's quite weird, because there are no special effects in that, so they

164
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,420
 just had these birds attacking them all the time, and the lead actor in it said it was Rod Taylor

165
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,920
 who was the lead actor, who said there was one particular raven who absolutely hated him,

166
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,420
 and ravens do take against people, we've discussed this before, so he said he'd get up, go

167
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,880
 on to say every day, this raven would immediately turn up next to him, and go and then start just

168
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,160
 biting him, manically, and every day on set he'd say, look, is Archie working today?

169
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,680
 Archie being the raven, and he'd always turn up, and it was really sad because Tippie

170
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,640
 Hedren, who was his co-star, also had a relationship with a raven, but she had a really nice one,

171
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,560
 so a raven befriended her, loved her, they couldn't actually use that raven in the film because

172
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
 it was too nice.

173
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,360
 But if you watch it, if you watch the movie, and they're all attacking it, but one of them

174
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:14,880
 is just kind of unhushed, they just leave them alone, leave them alone!

175
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,360
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact, my fact this week is that

176
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,260
 as well as using crash test dummies, Volvo tests its cars with a crash test moose, they have

177
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:36,720
 a crash test moose, which as far as I can tell is called moose-us, so this is done in Sweden,

178
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,080
 they have a 790 pound moose surrogate and they make it from a stack of 114 rubber discs,

179
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,440
 and the idea is that it's sort of sitting in front of a car, so rather that's not the moose

180
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,480
 inside the car as a crash test dummy, it's sitting in a distance, and they ram the car into

181
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,120
 it, and it's blaze itself all over the car, so it's just to show the damage that's being

182
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
 done to the car.

183
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,000
 Because actually it's really, it's really important isn't it, because if you're driving

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 along and there's an animal in the way, a lot of people say really the best thing to do

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,720
 is not to swear by the way, because you might hit a tree or another car, you basically

186
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,900
 should keep going, but with a moose you definitely shouldn't do that, and the reason being

187
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,220
 I'm a shop people here know, but basically they've got spindly legs and a massive big fuck off

188
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,260
 body, and so you go into those legs and they just like match sticks just go and then the

189
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,380
 body just hits you at the right height to go right into you, and it's really, really dangerous.

190
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,660
 There is amazing footage of the crash tests happening, and it's yeah, the top of the car

191
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,740
 just gets taken out basically, but I think there are, yeah, did you say there are two of

192
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
 these?

193
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,540
 No, only two on the planet, but they are both in Sweden basically.

194
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,100
 Well, you do need it in Sweden, because that's where they have a lot of moose, of course.

195
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,680
 I'm not saying it's a bad idea, I think, yeah, yeah, no, it's a very good idea. I'm surprised

196
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,940
 there isn't one in Canada to be honest. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but the thing with moose

197
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,380
 in Sweden is there are so many moose in Sweden that if you're travelling across a highway,

198
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:06,020
 you will pass within a thousand feet of a moose every 23 seconds on average. But it's just

199
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:13,420
 one moose and he's really fast. It isn't that amazing actually. Yeah, incredible.

200
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:19,580
 They do have really cool, so there's a place in rural Virginia called the Insurance Institute

201
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,180
 for Highway Safety, and it's their testing centre, and it's where they do a lot of crash

202
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,500
 testing for cars, but they occasionally will have sort of fun darbies between different

203
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
 cars.

204
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
 Oh, what do you mean?

205
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,260
 I've really oversolved that. Basically, I wasn't even that excited about myself, but...

206
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,420
 Well, for their 50th birthday, they had a grudge match between a 1959 Bel Air and a 2009

207
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,420
 Alibou.

208
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,180
 What do you mean they just crash into each other?

209
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,740
 Yeah, yeah. It was to show how much safer cars are these days, because the beautiful old

210
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,380
 1950s car, the whole front just really crumbles and the other one doesn't.

211
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,380
 Wow.

212
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,940
 You're not done with style, haven't you, in that nice old car?

213
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,900
 I guess so. But they really had to persuade people that safety was a good idea for cars.

214
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,580
 Like, that's in car accidents, kept creeping up and up and up, and the car industry kept

215
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,500
 saying, "Guard, yeah, awful, but what are we going to do about it?" And they really had to

216
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
 persuade them.

217
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,140
 So Ford introduced a car in 1956, which had a steering wheel, where the steering wheel,

218
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,020
 if you hit something, the steering wheel column would deform on impact, this is a good thing

219
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,060
 because it means you don't get hit in the middle of the track by a spike of metal, basically.

220
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,660
 The car was not popular, despite being sold with that.

221
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,580
 It was very much outsold by other cars, which had very dangerous steering columns.

222
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,580
 The first crash test dummies were live humans.

223
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:46,380
 So there was this, this happened a few times actually, but from the 1950s they started testing

224
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,100
 the crash impact on human bodies, and there was a researcher called Lawrence Patrick,

225
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,780
 and he basically volunteered himself, and he made the point that, actually, that people

226
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,300
 have been talking about using inanimate objects, all things like the dummies we have today.

227
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,580
 But you can crash a dummy into a car as many times as you like and go, "Oh, look, it's

228
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,820
 really dented here, and it's head's exploded, and it's foot fell off."

229
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,020
 But you don't actually know what that would mean if it was a live human.

230
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,100
 You don't actually know if the dummy is dead, but would this kill a human?

231
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,100
 Right.

232
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,580
 So this guy from 1960 to 1975 was a human crash test dummy, and he used to do things like,

233
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:30,380
 he took a 50-pound metal pendulum to the chest repeatedly, and that was to test the steering

234
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,380
 column.

235
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,020
 So he used to break ribs and things like that.

236
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,060
 Part of his job was hurling his knee repeatedly against a metal bar.

237
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,060
 That's amazing.

238
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,980
 Yeah, he took over 400 deceleration rides to then, that's why you sort of simulate the feeling

239
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,460
 of a crash.

240
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,340
 And yeah, it sounds horrendous, and him and his students would lie down and they'd have

241
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,980
 stuff like what's called a gravity impactor, where you'd have to be lying down and you had

242
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,060
 kind of this like metal rod suspended above your cheek, and then it would just jab you

243
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
 in the cheek.

244
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,820
 It would be like a robot jab you, repeatedly and harder and harder in the cheek, to see

245
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,820
 how much you could take.

246
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,580
 And wanted to say that he couldn't take it anymore, they weren't, well let's make cars that

247
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,140
 don't inflict more than that.

248
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:11,420
 But let's bring it right up to that point.

249
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,380
 And he was, that guy was Lawrence Patrick, you say, and it was one of his students called

250
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,300
 Harold Mertz, who went on to develop the first or the standard crash test dummy, right?

251
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,900
 So it was based on all that kind of stuff.

252
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,100
 Oh wow, because he had such a traumatic experience here.

253
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,300
 Dummies are, they are getting older.

254
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,300
 They are.

255
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,100
 We're all getting older, aren't they?

256
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,100
 Who are we getting older?

257
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,100
 The dummies.

258
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,780
 They've been made to be older now.

259
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,780
 Okay.

260
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,820
 The made older, as in when they're first, oh right, yeah, because how does that work?

261
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,220
 As in the bone cell are stronger.

262
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,700
 They're a bit more fragile, basically, because people are getting older.

263
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,020
 Again, back to your point, James, we're all getting older.

264
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:51,540
 But drivers, drivers are getting, society is aging, so, you know, the crash test dummies

265
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,940
 which simulate, you know, strapping young person in their prime are not a realistic way

266
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,900
 of simulating what's happening if you're driving and you're 120 years old.

267
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
 No.

268
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,900
 You know.

269
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
 And faster as well, they're getting, aren't they?

270
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
 Yeah.

271
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
 Because we're getting faster.

272
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
 And sort of more varied.

273
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,700
 There's this problem with dummies, and it happens with all technology, where it says this

274
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,460
 standard dummies have been made for the average man.

275
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,620
 And so then we've proven that that's how strong this car is.

276
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,580
 And it's always a man, and it's always western man.

277
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,700
 And they finally clocked on to the fact that not everyone on earth is a western man.

278
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,380
 And so obviously like women tend to be lighter, different parts of their body, a bit weaker.

279
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,140
 And so now they've finally started making dummies that are like very in size.

280
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,820
 But one of the things is they've had to get faster.

281
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:41,940
 I think the average American has put on just over two stone in the last 20 years, 25 years.

282
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,940
 Okay.

283
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,060
 So the dummies have had to follow suit.

284
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
 Yeah.

285
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,060
 28 pounds.

286
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,060
 28 pounds.

287
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,060
 28 pounds.

288
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,060
 Yeah.

289
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,180
 Well, that's not much way to put on over 25 years.

290
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,900
 You're actually keeping quite fit if that's all you put on in that period.

291
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,620
 You don't gradually put on more and more weight each year.

292
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,380
 That's not how it's, but that's not like a healthy one.

293
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:09,100
 Sorry, as a man in this 40's, yes you do.

294
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,740
 I've got something you might like, Den.

295
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,740
 Oh yeah.

296
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,940
 There is a theory that crash test dummies explain the Roswell landings.

297
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
 Jesus.

298
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
 What?

299
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,860
 So this is a claim that was made about crash test dummies that people might have mistaken

300
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,220
 crash test dummies being used in parachute drops if you're testing a parachute and you want

301
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,540
 to see how hard someone hits the ground with that particular parachute.

302
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
 Yeah.

303
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,340
 So maybe the Air Force were collecting in crash test dummies and mistook them for alien

304
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,700
 bodies being collected in.

305
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
 Right.

306
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,860
 Because that's where a lot of military testing might happen.

307
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,820
 And these were six foot long things and they were hairless and they were made of a weird

308
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,820
 rubbery substance.

309
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
 Yeah, yeah.

310
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,780
 So it's not a widely adhered to theory.

311
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,780
 No.

312
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,780
 It's obviously aliens.

313
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,780
 I can't do.

314
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,940
 Yeah, I can't believe you thought that would excite me.

315
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,940
 What I wanted you to say is aliens are real.

316
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,940
 That's the...

317
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:57,820
 Speaking of theories and adhering, this is to you.

318
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
 Wow.

319
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,820
 Tenuous.

320
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,820
 Very tenuous.

321
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,820
 Let's go.

322
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,780
 Google has invented a new thing which is human fly paper and the idea is if you have a self-driving

323
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,060
 car, you put this fly paper on the front of your car and one of the problems are one

324
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,420
 of the main ways that people get injured if they get hit by cars is not even the first

325
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,740
 impact is where you get thrown and you end up hitting your head on the floor or stuff like

326
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,300
 that or you get run over.

327
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,980
 And so they think that what might happen is you drive along, you hit pedestrian, instead

328
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,580
 of throwing them over, they stick to the car.

329
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,740
 Oh, wow.

330
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,860
 And then you can slow down and then they can just unstick themselves.

331
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,100
 There must be so many situations where you're late to somewhere and you're like, I'm

332
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,780
 sorry, I'm just going to have to go and you're on passing cars on the highway with a dude

333
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,740
 stuck to the front.

334
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,020
 Oh, I found a great move-related headline because I was looking up some moves facts as well.

335
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,820
 This is a headline from South Dakota.

336
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,380
 Is it Kilo Land or Kilo Land?

337
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,380
 All right.

338
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:04,740
 No one knows and I think it's bad to say no one here cares.

339
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
 Okay.

340
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,940
 Let's say Kilo Land news.

341
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,060
 This is a genuine local news headline in South Dakota.

342
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,740
 This moves from one field into another field.

343
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,700
 The surreal local news story goes on, beyond alert driving near the Marion Road exit on interstate

344
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,700
 90.

345
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,380
 A little after five Thursday night, a combine scared the moose, clearly just one moose involved

346
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,860
 in this whole state.

347
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,540
 Scared the moose out of one field and into another.

348
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,380
 This is the same moose that's been hanging out in the area north of southwestern Sioux Falls

349
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,500
 since Monday.

350
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,340
 So maybe there's a reason that nobody here has been to South Dakota as all I'm trying

351
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:49,260
 to say it's time for fact number three and that is James.

352
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,260
 Okay.

353
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,940
 My fact this week is that Americans used to make the slippers radioactive so they could

354
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,580
 find them in the dark.

355
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,820
 Now I must say, probably not many Americans in this, but I think definitely some of them

356
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,820
 did.

357
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,860
 An advert online for this product, which you could buy in the 1930s called Undaq.

358
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,860
 Okay.

359
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,900
 And it's like a paint and it contains radium, which is radium.

360
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,900
 Sorry.

361
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,800
 Can we just clarify that it wasn't online in the 1940s, was it?

362
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
 You're absolutely right.

363
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,300
 It wasn't online in the 1930s.

364
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,780
 It was a different medium back then.

365
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,440
 It's been put online now.

366
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
 Got it.

367
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
 Just checking.

368
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,740
 I saw it online in the last few days, but yeah, I think it was in magazines and things

369
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
 like this.

370
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:41,100
 And it was called Undaq and it says, the advert says does Undaq really contain radium?

371
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,500
 Most assuredly.

372
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,820
 So it's real radioactive stuff and the whole point of it is you would put it on things so

373
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,260
 you could find them in the dark.

374
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,740
 So they said that you were putting on watches and clocks on push buttons on the buckles

375
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,420
 of your bedroom slippers, on house numbers, flashlights, compasses, flashlights, I don't

376
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,420
 know why.

377
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,420
 Because you can turn them.

378
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
 Well, you need to find it in the dark.

379
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,420
 Yeah.

380
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
 You're absolutely right.

381
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,580
 And basically, in the 1930s, they were putting radium on everything, even though not realizing

382
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,740
 perhaps that it was killing people.

383
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,740
 Yeah.

384
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,540
 Yeah, they were obsessed.

385
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,180
 It was a craze, complete and like the newspaper has constantly contained it.

386
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,820
 I think George Bernard Shaw said the world has run raving mad on the subject of radium.

387
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:31,580
 And of course, there was very famous the radium girls who are the people who worked in sort

388
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,300
 of 19, 19s.

389
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,220
 And the radium girls were there and they had to paint radium onto clocks to make their hands

390
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,500
 glow in the dark and they would lick the paint brushes.

391
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,980
 And so they would swallow a little bit of radium every single time they did that.

392
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,740
 Which was extremely bad for them.

393
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,740
 It turned out.

394
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,740
 It was.

395
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,740
 Still, they would paint like little messages on the teeth for the boyfriends and like their

396
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,260
 clothes would glow in the dark.

397
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,380
 So when they went out clubbing or whatever they did in the 1920s, they would always wear

398
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,140
 the work clothes because it meant they shined in the night clothes.

399
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,020
 They were like queuing glow sticks, dancing in the clubs, wow.

400
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,220
 They were properly were glowers in one, so it was a big scandal by the 1920s.

401
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,420
 They started dying and people realised it was probably because of all this radium.

402
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,300
 And when they exhumed their bodies years later, they were still glowing from all this

403
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,620
 radium.

404
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,620
 It was amazing.

405
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,420
 And they'd open their cupboards in the morning and all their clothes are just glowing,

406
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,420
 absolutely bizarre.

407
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,100
 And then of course, because they were getting very sick, there were lawsuits.

408
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,340
 And it was due to a guy called Leonard Grossman who was a lawyer who worked pro bono for the

409
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,780
 whole time and it was after eight appeals that they managed to get the companies to admit

410
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,980
 that they were wrong and managed to get something back.

411
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:46,100
 Although the last one, the last radium girl died at the age of 107, not so long ago, only

412
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,700
 in the last 20 years, I think.

413
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,180
 But she quit within a week of working that because she hated the taste of the paint.

414
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
 Yes.

415
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:59,980
 She was counting herself lucky in 177 in 2014, but like they want to know, I suppose, and

416
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,460
 it must have been so exciting.

417
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,340
 And also Uranium had the same thing when Uranium then became the thing and this was this

418
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,860
 other very, very dangerous, nuclear substance people got very into.

419
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:14,060
 There was a time when hamburgers came with free shares in Uranium minds, like little happy

420
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,220
 meal, but it was a share in Uranium.

421
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,220
 Really?

422
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,220
 Wow.

423
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,220
 Yes.

424
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,220
 There was some, right?

425
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,900
 You know, B-O-U-G-I-E, the sort of things.

426
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
 Bougie.

427
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
 Bougie.

428
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
 Sorry.

429
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,780
 There were radioactive bougies which were wax-covered rods to be inserted into the penis.

430
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,700
 Sorry, I didn't know this word bougie until now, is that what it is?

431
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
 Bougie, yeah.

432
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,420
 Well, there's a, there's a modern meaning of bougie which is a bit different, a bit different

433
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,420
 to that.

434
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
 Is that what bougie nights?

435
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
 That movie's about.

436
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
 Yeah, that's right.

437
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
 Yeah.

438
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,660
 It basically is about that, isn't it?

439
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,980
 Yeah, wow.

440
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,380
 Some people said if you fed your chickens radium, then their eggs would incubate themselves.

441
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,380
 Wow.

442
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,980
 Not true.

443
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:02,020
 We have, weirdly, you mentioned the curries early, so Mary, Mary Curie, she, she was in the

444
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,020
 news this year.

445
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,580
 She's in our book, our new book.

446
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,580
 She.

447
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,380
 Yeah, because someone, it was her birthday and the cake arrived, surprise cake, they opened

448
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,660
 it up and on the cake was a drawing of Mary Curie.

449
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,220
 And she was confused because she had no idea who it was.

450
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,180
 It turns out that there was a mishearing over the phone.

451
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:29,820
 What the parent had actually asked for was a cake of Mariah Carey and as a result, had this

452
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,860
 noble prize winner on her cake, no idea who it was.

453
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,060
 All I want for Christmas is uranium.

454
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:50,380
 So Mary Curie, Pierre, her husband died in a traffic accident, and then years later, she started

455
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,260
 dating again, and she had an affair with a married man, which was very scandalous at

456
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
 the time.

457
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,980
 And it led to this huge course of love.

458
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:02,820
 There were either two or five armed duels over this affair that she had.

459
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,180
 And the wife of the man she was having the affair with, her name was Madame Long Van.

460
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,260
 She had someone break into Curie's house and steal the love letters.

461
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,300
 All of this about Mary Curie, noble prize winning, you know, and the letters were stolen,

462
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,940
 and then they were leaked to the press.

463
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,060
 So suddenly this is a huge story.

464
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:25,500
 And her lover, Paul Long Van, had a duel between him and a journalist who'd insulted him.

465
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,140
 And there's a letter from Einstein to Mary Curie saying, don't worry about all this.

466
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,140
 This is irrelevant.

467
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,140
 Really?

468
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,140
 It's really cool.

469
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,220
 Just before she won the Nobel Prize, so her Nobel Prize was slightly overshadowed by this

470
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,220
 huge story.

471
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,220
 Yeah, yeah.

472
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,220
 Three days before she was due to go and collect it, the story broke.

473
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,460
 And they were saying, oh, maybe don't come and collect the Nobel Prize because this is scandalous.

474
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,580
 But then Einstein wrote her a letter saying, forget all that, you've got the award.

475
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
 Get the award.

476
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,580
 Wow.

477
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,220
 She used to be always called on to test the radiant products.

478
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,660
 You know, you were saying at the start, James, that a lot of products called themselves

479
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
 radio active.

480
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,460
 But they didn't always have it in, is that right?

481
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,700
 Yeah, they very often just pretended and then put a bit of different glow in the dark stuff

482
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
 in it.

483
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,460
 She would be called to verify that stuff contained radium that it, like, definitely was

484
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,460
 deadly, basically.

485
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,980
 It would be like, my child's toy says it's radioactive.

486
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,780
 Can you just check, Mary Curie, that it is?

487
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,460
 Do you be like, yep, definitely got lots of radium in it.

488
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,460
 Wow.

489
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,460
 Good luck to that kid.

490
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
 Wow.

491
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,660
 She actually fell on a little bit of hard times after a while and she didn't have enough

492
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,380
 radium to continue her research because radium was really, really expensive.

493
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,980
 There's not much of it in the ground, so it's really hard to get.

494
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,460
 So, there was a fundraising campaign led by American women and Curie traveled to the United

495
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:42,460
 States and she was presented with one gram of radium by President Warren Harding in 1921.

496
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,460
 That's so cool.

497
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,460
 A single gram.

498
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,540
 Okay, and it doesn't sound like a lot of that, right?

499
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:55,980
 But it was cost them $100,000 for a single gram of radium and that at the time in 1921 was

500
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,220
 about that average budget of a Hollywood movie.

501
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,700
 You could make a whole movie.

502
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
 That's so cool.

503
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
 Isn't that amazing?

504
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,220
 They did, because when they were trying to refine it in the foot, like before they'd even

505
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,900
 discovered it, they were using a thing called pitch blend which is a kind of uranium

506
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
 ore.

507
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,700
 And it's got the, it's got radium in it but it needs to be refined a lot.

508
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,820
 They went through seven tons of pitch blend and they ended up with one gram of radium

509
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,460
 after all of that refining.

510
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,460
 That's incredible.

511
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:30,300
 This is why there was a ballet dancer and choreographer called Lowie Fuller who in 1904 created

512
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,300
 the radium dance, which was a really famous dance at the time and she wanted all the ballerinas

513
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,460
 to be wearing head-to-toe costumes made entirely of radium.

514
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,380
 She was sort of mates with Mary Curie and she wrote to her and said, can you make me a bunch

515
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,900
 of ballerinas dresses made entirely of radium?

516
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,620
 And thought, thank God, Mary Curie said, I'd absolutely love to.

517
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,500
 It sounds like a great idea but it's just too expensive.

518
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,140
 And so she had to make do with a slightly less glow in the dark other material and the ballerinas

519
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,980
 lived just the other day.

520
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,460
 Have you heard of a magic radium massage?

521
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,460
 No.

522
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,820
 This was a 30s product which is curious because if the radium girls were dying in the 1920s,

523
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,820
 then you would think...

524
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,100
 Well, this studies a lot of radium until sort of 40s and 50s I think.

525
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,980
 Well, the magic radium massage, this ointment, when massaged into the sex parts, this is

526
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,140
 the other, acts as a healthy tonic and stimulant, tending to give firmness and strength to the

527
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,340
 organs.

528
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,980
 It is especially effective for improving the circulation in the genital organs when they

529
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,580
 feel cold, clammy and lifeless.

530
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,580
 Soon.

531
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,500
 I mean, that is useful if you need to get up to go to the toilet of a night.

532
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
 You just follow your car.

533
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 Where's...

534
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,220
 Where did I leave that penis?

535
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
 Yeah.

536
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,220
 Okay.

537
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:48,700
 It's time to move on to our final fact of the show.

538
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,660
 That is Chazinski.

539
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:56,500
 My fact this week is that the man who introduced chewing gum to the world had already been president

540
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,180
 of Mexico 11 times.

541
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
 It's crazy.

542
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,540
 It's a very strange career trajectory.

543
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:10,020
 Of course, it's probably the most famous famous of Mexican ever, General Santa Anna in

544
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
 the 19th century.

545
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,580
 He was president constantly.

546
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,260
 He's sort of hated in three different, very specific places.

547
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,660
 So the U.S. hate him, Mexicans hate him, and Texans hate him, and I know Texas is part of

548
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,460
 the U.S., but some people say that they don't, they pretend they aren't.

549
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,460
 But yeah, he's...

550
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,340
 So he was at the back of Alamo and he was disgraced there because he was very, very brutal.

551
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:38,220
 And then that was what led to the cries of remember the Alamo, which led to him and his

552
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,660
 troops being defeated at just interlater.

553
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,660
 But anyway, he had lots of sort of military defeats and somehow they kept on making

554
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,620
 him president again, he kept on being exiled from the country.

555
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:54,660
 And when he was finally exiled from Mexico permanently in 1869, he went to New Jersey and all

556
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,660
 he brought with him.

557
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,380
 That's not the joke.

558
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:04,860
 The joke is not, that's what you do when you hit a rock bottom.

559
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:10,740
 Wow, you can just say New Jersey and I agree with you a lot.

560
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,740
 It's good to know.

561
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:17,980
 So he went to New Jersey and he brought with him as insurance a ton of this chicle gum which

562
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,220
 they all chewed in Mexico and the bloke he was living with said, "Oh, what's that gum?

563
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,220
 Can I try and make something out of it?

564
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,620
 I'm going to try and sell it."

565
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:29,500
 And he tried to make sort of tires out of it and toys out of it and masks and Wellington

566
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,500
 boots and none of it stuck, as it were.

567
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,580
 And so eventually he saw Santa Anna chewing it one day and so he thought, "Okay, I'll

568
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,500
 try and sell it to people and tell them to chew on it."

569
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:44,280
 And they loved it and their chewing gum was born or popularised at least in the West.

570
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,100
 He was quite amazing, wasn't he Santa Anna?

571
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,300
 So after the independence from Spain in 1821, basically a whole country just kept having

572
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,180
 these coups and counts of coups and whatever and he just kept reinventing himself to whoever

573
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,180
 was taking over.

574
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,180
 He said, "Oh, I'm with these guys and then they would make him president."

575
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:05,460
 So at one stage he started off as conservative and then he became liberal, then he became

576
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:11,940
 Democrat and then he became a dictator and all those times, each time he became the president.

577
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:17,220
 By way of comparison, Donald Trump started off as a Republican, became a member of the

578
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:23,500
 independence party, then was a Democrat and then was a Republican again, hasn't been a dictator.

579
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
 Yeah.

580
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,380
 Yeah, he's like, he just kept reinventing himself so he could get the power.

581
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,380
 Yeah.

582
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,380
 It's really amazing.

583
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:37,940
 He didn't go to either of his own weddings.

584
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,420
 He couldn't be bothered to turn up, basically, or he was travelling or busy or whatever.

585
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,020
 So he just deputized someone by...

586
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,420
 Let me just say, you are about to get married.

587
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,420
 Certainly, yeah.

588
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,420
 It doesn't work that way.

589
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,420
 Oh, no.

590
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:54,740
 So he married twice, mostly for, we think for money, both times, because the women he was

591
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,220
 marrying had very large estates and he was in need of cash.

592
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:06,060
 So the first wedding he had, he empowered his father-in-law to be as his proxy.

593
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
 Oh.

594
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,500
 So basically, her dad would walk up the aisle.

595
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
 He could.

596
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
 He gave her away to himself.

597
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
 Basically, yeah.

598
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
 Wow.

599
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,460
 Do we know if he sort of jumped round the other side of her earlier?

600
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,460
 Yeah.

601
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,460
 I've just put a different hat on myself.

602
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,460
 Yeah.

603
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,620
 He actually lost Texas to the US, possibly because he was having sex in a tent.

604
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,620
 No.

605
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:33,340
 So this is the tale is that, at the Battle of Jacinto, he was distracted by a Texan woman

606
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,980
 who, so it was a ploy on her part, she's sort of this folk hero.

607
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,900
 And this is reported at the time by an English journalist.

608
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,980
 And apparently, this Texan woman snuck into his tent and seduced him and shagged away.

609
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,740
 And then he lost the battle while he was in the tent, not in charge of his troops.

610
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,740
 And then had to leg it.

611
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,220
 How long was that sex session that he lost?

612
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,060
 Well, the battle, the battle famously only took 18 minutes.

613
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:59,300
 That's not too bad, didn't it?

614
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,900
 In my house.

615
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,260
 My wife will be going to hear that, 18 minutes, he can do 18 minutes.

616
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,140
 Dad, you could always use a proxy if you have to.

617
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:17,260
 So it's okay, honey, your dad's on his way over at home.

618
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,540
 Did he still have his leg at the time, that that happened?

619
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,260
 He did have his original leg at that time, yeah.

620
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,700
 He, one of the other things he was famous for was losing a leg in a conflict called the

621
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,100
 pastry war, which was against French forces who had invaded Mexico.

622
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,380
 I think that's why it's called that.

623
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,060
 So he was wounded and he had his leg amputated.

624
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:42,900
 And then four years later, as a kind of political move, he had it disinterred and he held a state

625
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,740
 funeral for his leg.

626
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,900
 So he got to attend.

627
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,060
 And it was a really fancy funeral.

628
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:52,620
 So the leg got taken to the capital in a coach and there was a beautiful monument constructed

629
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:57,260
 and there was cannon fire and poems were read and then the leg was eventually re-buried.

630
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,260
 Yeah.

631
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,820
 How should is that for his wife that he shows up to a funeral for his leg, but not to his own

632
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,820
 wedding?

633
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,740
 But then on the bright side per two years after he'd done that, it was exhumed again by his

634
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:14,820
 opponents and dragged through the streets with people chanting death to the cripple.

635
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,580
 So yeah, he was obsessed with this leg.

636
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,620
 He used to sort of like before he'd even done the big state funeral, he used to carry it

637
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,540
 around waving it above him in parade.

638
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
 Really?

639
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,900
 And he gave it two funerals.

640
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:32,460
 He gave it a small funeral on his little hacienda before the big one when it first got lost.

641
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,820
 He was always reminding people, like one of these really annoying, like you couldn't,

642
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,500
 you'd always let it drop into conversation.

643
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,980
 But the pastry world, do you know why it was called that specifically?

644
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,980
 No, I don't.

645
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,340
 It is related to the French thing, but it's specifically because there was one French

646
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:53,500
 pastry cafe in Mexico and it was owed a big debt by the government and it wasn't being

647
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,500
 paid.

648
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,860
 And so this pastry chef called the French government and said, "Mexico has me all this money,

649
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,380
 it's not paying."

650
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,060
 And so it got a bit out of hand and war happened.

651
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,060
 Oh, man.

652
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,140
 Because of that.

653
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:12,460
 The French ended up really overreacting, so they tried them up and said they owe me an arm

654
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,460
 in a leg.

655
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:21,220
 They negotiated down to half of that.

656
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,540
 You know, you can visit his leg in Illinois.

657
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,540
 Yes.

658
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,540
 Well, his fake leg.

659
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,940
 It's in a museum in Illinois.

660
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,980
 And there's like a chicken dinner there as well because supposedly he was eating chicken

661
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,500
 at the time, so it sort of like sets the same thing up.

662
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,980
 So when you say his fake leg, you mean this prosthesis?

663
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
 Yeah.

664
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,980
 Yeah, exactly.

665
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,420
 And then someone galloped off away when he wasn't looking, took his leg and it's now in Illinois.

666
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,420
 It's been there for years.

667
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,420
 Yes.

668
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,420
 So this was another fight.

669
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,220
 This was the later battle that he actually lost, wasn't it?

670
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,220
 Yeah.

671
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,220
 When he had the prosthetic leg.

672
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,220
 And as you say, he was eating a chicken dinner in his tent and-

673
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,700
 The battle was lost again.

674
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,700
 He really lingered over it.

675
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,220
 He spent about 20 minutes eating the chicken, yeah.

676
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,220
 Disaster.

677
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,540
 It was going to have to stay out of tents.

678
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:08,700
 I always think it's really weird, though, because in that thing where the soldiers came

679
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:13,980
 along and they took his leg and they also took $18,000 and the chicken dinner.

680
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,180
 But everyone that always talks about the chicken dinner.

681
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
 Yeah.

682
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
 That's true.

683
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,180
 It's so weird.

684
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,180
 And then he got another leg, the knee.

685
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,180
 He got a peg leg.

686
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,180
 Yeah.

687
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,660
 And so just a piece of wood for a prosthesis.

688
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,660
 And then that got stolen as well.

689
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,660
 Oh.

690
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,660
 Yeah.

691
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,220
 It got stolen and was reportedly later used by Lieutenant Abner double day as a baseball bat.

692
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,220
 Wow.

693
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
 Wow.

694
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,140
 Hey, so this fact was also about the fact that he introduced chewing gum to the world.

695
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,140
 Oh, yes.

696
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,060
 I mentioned a couple of chewing gum things I found.

697
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,660
 So chewing gum, obviously we had chewing gum that was around for a while.

698
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,860
 And then bubble gum arrived and bubble gum was invented in Philadelphia.

699
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,860
 Yeah.

700
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,860
 How cool is that?

701
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,860
 Did you guys know that?

702
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,860
 Probably.

703
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,860
 You didn't know that.

704
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,860
 Okay.

705
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,860
 So bubble gum was invented here.

706
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,540
 It was by a guy called Frank H. Fleer, although he didn't invent bubble gum itself.

707
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,620
 So double bubble was the first ever bubble gum that came out.

708
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,620
 You guys.

709
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,620
 What?

710
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,620
 Yeah.

711
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,620
 There was no bubble before.

712
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,140
 No, chewing gum was just chewed.

713
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,980
 And then he was like, let's take a bit.

714
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,340
 He went straight to double bubble gum.

715
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,340
 There's no single bubble.

716
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
 Oh, I see.

717
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,340
 Well, no, no.

718
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,700
 There was a prototype which didn't work, yeah.

719
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,740
 So he's not the inventor of double bubble.

720
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,540
 He is the inventor of its prototype, blibber blibber.

721
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,540
 Stop.

722
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,540
 Absolutely true.

723
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,660
 Blibber blibber was the original bubble gum that he invented.

724
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,340
 But unfortunately, it didn't quite work out.

725
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,580
 So the problem was, is when you blew the bubble, no one could say it for a start.

726
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,580
 Blibber blibber.

727
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,580
 Blibber blibber.

728
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
 Blibber blibber.

729
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,580
 So, yeah.

730
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,580
 So Frank H. Fleer.

731
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,580
 So the problem was, is that you would blow the bubble, it would pop, and it would go all

732
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,580
 of your face.

733
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:51,820
 But the stickiness of it was too much that you needed a solvent to actually take it off

734
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,380
 your face.

735
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,140
 So when he was marketing it initially, it was with this little product that would make

736
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,140
 sure that it would come up.

737
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
 So it didn't work out.

738
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,500
 Never sold, never made it actually to shops.

739
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,140
 But instead, then someone who was working for him said, let's take it differently.

740
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,460
 And that's how we have double bubble.

741
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,460
 Wow.

742
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,460
 That's great.

743
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
 So when was that?

744
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,260
 This was 1906, that he posted this, yeah.

745
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:19,420
 Because there was one other claimant to the invention of bubble gum, who is Waldo Seaman,

746
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,420
 who...

747
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,420
 Wow.

748
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
 What did he call his?

749
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,700
 And I didn't go down very well.

750
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
 I don't...

751
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,580
 With chewing gum, make sure you never swallow.

752
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,540
 That's what I'm saying.

753
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,700
 So Mr... Mr Seaman was...

754
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,700
 Waldo Seaman.

755
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
 Working for a entire company.

756
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,700
 Where's Waldo?

757
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,700
 Which Waldo?

758
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:49,700
 That's a much more difficult and more adult version of the purchase than that.

759
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:59,620
 He's easier to spot though, you turn the lights off, you shine and don't look glows in the dark.

760
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:05,300
 That's the best UV Seaman Wesley bubble gum joke that's ever been made.

761
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,940
 That's the only one.

762
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,940
 No.

763
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,940
 Top 10.

764
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,620
 Anyway, he was a very serious guy wanting to be taken seriously.

765
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:18,380
 His business was in making plastics and rubber and polymers, and he worked for a tyre company.

766
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,740
 And so when he made this thing that blew bubbles, the tyre company thought, well, that's

767
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,740
 a huge defect.

768
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,420
 We don't want tyres that are bubbles, so just stop making it.

769
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,060
 And so he had to stop making it.

770
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,780
 But interestingly, did you know that tyre manufacturers, Goodya Tire and Rubber, for instance,

771
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,020
 are the biggest provider of the rubber core of chewing gum today?

772
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,020
 Is it?

773
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,020
 Yeah, of course.

774
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,020
 It's a bit of a tyre in it.

775
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,340
 Because it's not made out of that chickly stuff anymore, it's made out of, like, petrochemicals,

776
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,340
 basically chewing gum.

777
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,340
 Yeah, essentially.

778
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,340
 Yeah.

779
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,820
 It's made out of kind of rubber in the middle of it.

780
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
 That's amazing.

781
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,820
 Yeah.

782
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,180
 So actually, when cars drive over the road, they should be able to just pick up the chewing

783
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,420
 gum and just become part of the tyre.

784
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,420
 Oh, yeah.

785
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,780
 And eventually, you just have a massively high car.

786
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,780
 Yeah.

787
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,780
 Yeah.

788
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,140
 The ancient Greeks had chewing gum, a kind of chewing gum, yeah.

789
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,980
 So as you say, it was popularized when it became nice.

790
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,940
 But the ancient Greeks were going around chewing mastic gum, sometimes, that was a thing.

791
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,540
 And it was really horrible back in the old days because it used to be made with paraffin.

792
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,900
 So it's very bitter and very, you know, brittle and unwholesome.

793
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,940
 The one thing that you might do, if you had some paraffin chewing gum, is you'd have

794
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,700
 a plate of sugar next to you, and you just have to repeatedly take it out of your mouth,

795
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,780
 dip it in the sugar and put it back in.

796
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,780
 Oh, nice.

797
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,780
 Yeah.

798
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,780
 Is that all right?

799
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
 No, not that.

800
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
 Not like that.

801
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,860
 I've explained it wrong.

802
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,460
 We're going to have to move on in a second.

803
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,460
 Oh, one more thing about chewing gum.

804
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,460
 Yeah.

805
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,020
 The University of Copenhagen is currently working on fertility chewing gum.

806
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,020
 So...

807
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:55,900
 Is this another Waldo Seaman invention?

808
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:03,620
 It's the second best Waldo Seaman bubble gum based.

809
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:10,260
 No, it's for women to chew so that you know where you are in your menstrual cycles.

810
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:15,980
 So if you chew it, it reacts with the, I guess, the enzymes in your saliva, and it turns

811
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,780
 a particular colour depending on how far along you are and whether you're in the perfect

812
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
 time to consume.

813
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,460
 But then do you have to keep pulling it out of your mouth and looking at it and then

814
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,980
 putting it back in again?

815
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,980
 I think there's a...

816
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,780
 Well, you have to take it out at least once, yeah.

817
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,980
 But that is cool.

818
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,980
 It's...

819
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,980
 Yes, it is.

820
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,340
 If it happens, that's going to be great.

821
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,300
 In 1904, they had a big craze in America of chewing gum parties.

822
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
 Cool.

823
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,140
 And the idea of what you would do there is you would, each guest would come along with

824
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,820
 a big pack of chewing gum, actually lots of packs, and then everyone would sit around

825
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,740
 and chew their chewing gum until it was soft, and then they'd put it on a plate and

826
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,260
 they would sculpt it into things.

827
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,260
 Cool.

828
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,260
 And that was the game.

829
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,260
 That's kind of fun.

830
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,260
 I thought you were going to say that.

831
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,260
 This audience doesn't seem to think it's much fun.

832
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,260
 Oh.

833
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,260
 Wow.

834
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,260
 Philadelphia is a bit too good for that, apparently.

835
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,260
 Okay.

836
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,260
 Let's wrap up.

837
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,260
 Okay.

838
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,260
 That is it.

839
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,260
 That is all of our facts.

840
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,900
 Thank you so much for listening.

841
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,940

 You can go to our website.

853
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,940
 No such thing as a fish.com.

854
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,940
 You have everything up there.

855
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,940
 There's future tour dates.

856

00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,660
 There's links to things like our book.

858
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,780
 And last thing to say is, guys, thank you so much.

859
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,780
 That was so much fun.

860
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,780
