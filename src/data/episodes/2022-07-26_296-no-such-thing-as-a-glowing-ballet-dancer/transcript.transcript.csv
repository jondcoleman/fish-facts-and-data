00:00:14,00:00:25,">> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Philadelphia."
00:00:25,00:00:31,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:31,00:00:33,>> My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:33,00:00:37,"I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:37,00:00:42,And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:42,00:00:47,"And in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy."
00:00:47,00:00:53,"My fact is that the star of the film Candy Man, where a character has bees coming out of his mouth,"
00:00:53,00:00:58,"negotiated a $1,000 bonus for every time he got stung."
00:00:58,00:01:02,"He ended up with $23,000."
00:01:02,00:01:03,>> Wow.
00:01:03,00:01:05,>> How bad is it to be stung by a bee?
00:01:05,00:01:12,Do you think you'd be deliberately angering the bees so that you got a few more stings that they've been mumbling or not?
00:01:12,00:01:16,">> I would, but that says more about me than it does about me."
00:01:16,00:01:19,"Yeah, although in the mouth, I imagine it would be a lot more painful than normal."
00:01:19,00:01:22,"So this is Candy Man, this is Tony Todd."
00:01:22,00:01:24,This is a kind of cult horror film.
00:01:24,00:01:28,"And one of the inspirations was from the Johnny Carson show,"
00:01:28,00:01:32,"where there was a man called Norman Gary, who was a bee-based performer."
00:01:32,00:01:37,And he had an act where he played the clarinet while covered in bees.
00:01:37,00:01:39,And people loved this.
00:01:39,00:01:43,"And he then became the bee wrangler, the official bee person on Candy Man."
00:01:43,00:01:46,">> Yeah. >> And I think it's him and Tony Todd,"
00:01:46,00:01:52,they're the only two people to have done all three Candy Man films is the star and the bee guy.
00:01:52,00:01:55,">> Can you explain what Candy Man is, because I haven't seen it, so."
00:01:55,00:01:59,">> It's, Dan, you watch it like a child."
00:01:59,00:02:00,">> Yeah, yeah, it's a horror film."
00:02:00,00:02:05,"There's a guy who has a hook, and if you say his name into a mirror five times, he kills you."
00:02:05,00:02:08,"So in theory, you shouldn't do that, but people they do."
00:02:08,00:02:09,>> They're then.
00:02:09,00:02:12,">> Yeah, but it's times if we said it itself, I don't understand."
00:02:12,00:02:16,">> But it was written by Clive Barker, the great horror writer."
00:02:16,00:02:17,I think he did Hellraiser as well.
00:02:17,00:02:21,"And the bees that they use, actually, there is a logic."
00:02:21,00:02:24,It wasn't bees that were just ready and furious and waiting to sting.
00:02:24,00:02:27,They made sure that the bees were only 12 hours old.
00:02:27,00:02:29,So imagine you've just been born.
00:02:29,00:02:33,"And just suddenly in a Hollywood movie, it's incredible."
00:02:33,00:02:35,"And so yeah, so they went into the mouth."
00:02:35,00:02:39,And the idea is that the stings wouldn't be sharpened up.
00:02:39,00:02:43,"Even when he was stung, it wouldn't have the sting of, say, 14-hour old bee."
00:02:43,00:02:50,"And once they'd done each take, the bees would be vacuumed up using a tiny bee vacuum"
00:02:50,00:02:52,to do you know that you can get a bee vacuum cleaner?
00:02:52,00:02:55,How's that different from a normal vacuum cleaner?
00:02:55,00:02:58,">> I think it's just a little bit kinder on the bees, I would guess."
00:02:58,00:02:59,>> It was a mini one.
00:02:59,00:03:02,I guess it was different because it's a bee size.
00:03:02,00:03:04,Not like a bee would use it as a vacuum cleaner.
00:03:04,00:03:08,>> And they'd be sucked up and then returned to their dressing room.
00:03:08,00:03:10,For the sort of to await the next take.
00:03:10,00:03:11,>> Wow.
00:03:11,00:03:13,>> They didn't have their own dressing room.
00:03:13,00:03:15,They do mean a wooden box.
00:03:15,00:03:16,>> I think.
00:03:16,00:03:19,">> Yeah, well, you've seen our dressing room tonight, that's."
00:03:19,00:03:20,>> It's full of bees.
00:03:20,00:03:25,">> But actually, the main thing is with this beading thing,"
00:03:25,00:03:27,"which is what the clarinetist did, okay."
00:03:27,00:03:31,So what you do is you get a queen bee and you put it in a little cage by your face.
00:03:31,00:03:35,And then all of the other bees kind of come along because they like the queen bee so much
00:03:35,00:03:36,and they hang around your face.
00:03:36,00:03:40,And the way that you get them off normally is you spend maybe a couple of hours
00:03:40,00:03:43,getting them on so you have a massive bee beard and then you just jump in the air.
00:03:43,00:03:46,"And when you land, all the bees just disappear."
00:03:46,00:03:50,They just stop holding onto your face.
00:03:50,00:03:54,">> That's amazing, does that not irritate them?"
00:03:54,00:03:56,">> A little bit, you might get stung a few times."
00:03:56,00:04:00,But then you walk backwards and someone's kind of firing smoke in your face
00:04:00,00:04:04,"so that they're getting a bit sleepy, a little bit drowsy, and then you can get away."
00:04:04,00:04:05,">> That's so crafty, cool."
00:04:05,00:04:11,">> Really, that's so weird, because Virginia Madden, who I think was the lead female character"
00:04:11,00:04:15,"in the film, said it used to take ages for there to be ranked as the sweet the bees are."
00:04:15,00:04:20,">> Well, yeah, because what they did with them is they kind of smeared their face in the pheromone."
00:04:20,00:04:23,And so the bees just really did not want to leave them.
00:04:23,00:04:29,"She said that it basically, you have pheromones on them, so they're all in love with you, all the bees."
00:04:29,00:04:30,"That's nice, isn't it?"
00:04:30,00:04:32,">> She was allergic to bees, I think."
00:04:32,00:04:33,">> She was very slightly, wasn't she?"
00:04:33,00:04:35,">> The director said, no, you're not, you're just afraid."
00:04:35,00:04:44,"This guy Norman Gary, the bee wrangler, he has a Guinness World Record that is obviously"
00:04:44,00:04:47,"be related, but it is for most bees in a mouth."
00:04:47,00:04:49,">> Wow, really?"
00:04:49,00:04:50,>> How many guesses?
00:04:50,00:04:54,>> I would say about 14.
00:04:54,00:04:55,>> 14?
00:04:55,00:04:56,>> 14.
00:04:56,00:04:57,>> 16.
00:04:57,00:04:58,>> 16.
00:04:58,00:04:59,>> 16.
00:04:59,00:05:00,>> 16.
00:05:00,00:05:01,>> 16.
00:05:01,00:05:02,>> 16.
00:05:02,00:05:03,>> Okay.
00:05:03,00:05:08,">> By an incredibly dubious method, Dan Wins."
00:05:08,00:05:13,">> But you're still out, he had 109 live bees in his mouth at one time."
00:05:13,00:05:18,"And you get a sponge soaked in sugar, and they like that, obviously, so they always seek"
00:05:18,00:05:22,"that out, so you can sort of train them to go where you want them to go by that with that"
00:05:22,00:05:23,sponge.
00:05:23,00:05:27,"So then he put it in his mouth, you have to close your mouth for 10 seconds for the record"
00:05:27,00:05:32,"to be valid, so they're all in there, and then you put a mesh cage up to your lips, you"
00:05:32,00:05:36,"blow them all into the cage at the same time, then you close the bag, and then you to do"
00:05:36,00:05:40,"the count, you have to allow them to escape one by one while you're telling them."
00:05:40,00:05:43,>> One by one.
00:05:43,00:05:47,">> Until then, you don't know if you've got the record, because you've just got to let a bee's"
00:05:47,00:05:48,in your mouth.
00:05:48,00:05:50,"It's easier to count them out than it is to count them in, I guess."
00:05:50,00:05:51,">> Yeah, I see that."
00:05:51,00:05:55,">> Hey, I was looking into horror movies generally, because I realize I just don't know much about"
00:05:55,00:05:57,sort of like the behind the scenes of movies.
00:05:57,00:06:02,"I found this really fun fact, which is the Omen, the movie The Omen, so Damien, who is, it's"
00:06:02,00:06:06,"now the classic name for, yeah, so he wasn't meant to be called Damien."
00:06:06,00:06:07,">> Oh, no."
00:06:07,00:06:12,">> Yeah, originally, the screenwriter, David Celtser, he wanted to name the anti-Christ"
00:06:12,00:06:18,"Domlin, D-O-M-L-I-N, and the reason he wanted to call him Domlin is because he knew"
00:06:18,00:06:22,"a Domlin who was a totally obnoxious brat, he said."
00:06:22,00:06:27,"It was a friend, it was the child of a friend of his, and it was his wife, the screenwriter's"
00:06:27,00:06:33,"wife, who went, you can't fucking do this to Domlin, immortalize him as the anti-Christ"
00:06:33,00:06:34,in a movie.
00:06:34,00:06:36,">> It's not, they're not going to go, well, it might be another Domlin."
00:06:36,00:06:37,">> Yeah, exactly."
00:06:37,00:06:41,">> So it's Damien, yeah, it should have been Domlin."
00:06:41,00:06:42,>> Wow.
00:06:42,00:06:44,"But not all the Damians get that, it seems unfair."
00:06:44,00:06:49,">> But at least there are all the Damians, there's not just one Damien at the world, he knows"
00:06:49,00:06:50,it's about him.
00:06:50,00:06:54,">> They used to have a lot of horror movies within Sexon, like this one Candy Man with"
00:06:54,00:07:02,"the Bees, with it between 1966 and 1978, there were six major films featuring Bees as"
00:07:02,00:07:04,the main horror in that film.
00:07:04,00:07:12,"One of them was called The Swarm, and the Sunday Times has said it's the worst film ever made."
00:07:12,00:07:16,"Richard Velt in the Wilmington Morning Star said, ""The Swarm may not be the worst movie ever"
00:07:16,00:07:17,made.
00:07:17,00:07:23,"I'll have to see them all to be sure, but it's certainly as bad as any I've ever seen."""
00:07:23,00:07:25,All the actors involved in this fiasco should be ashamed.
00:07:25,00:07:30,"Apparently, it's absolutely awful, it's got Michael Cain in it."
00:07:30,00:07:34,"It costs tons, it was really expensive, the budget was like 20 million."
00:07:34,00:07:39,"He came out in the same year as Star Wars, which was made for a lot less money, and is basically"
00:07:39,00:07:41,about a load of killer bees.
00:07:41,00:07:47,"Now, the American Bee Association decided to do a cease and desist to the Swarm for defaming"
00:07:47,00:07:52,"the American Honey Bee, and as a result, at the end of the movie, there's a disclaimer"
00:07:52,00:07:57,saying that the killer bees in the film are no resemblance to real crop pollinating honey
00:07:57,00:07:58,bees.
00:07:58,00:08:03,I thought it was some resemblance.
00:08:03,00:08:07,"I was reading about the Swarm too, it does sound absolutely amazing, it's two hours and"
00:08:07,00:08:10,"forty minutes long, which is hefty."
00:08:10,00:08:14,Michael Cain said that he only did it because his mother needed a house to live in.
00:08:14,00:08:19,"It's quite sweet, but also, they kept finding all the way through the film, because they"
00:08:19,00:08:23,"filmed it with nearly a million bees, so it was a big huge cast, basically."
00:08:23,00:08:27,"Huge got one, the credits at the end, B1, B2, B3."
00:08:27,00:08:32,"But the cast and the crew, they kept finding little yellow dots on their clothing because"
00:08:32,00:08:36,"of all the bees, and Michael Cain would eat that, before eventually being informed that"
00:08:36,00:08:41,"that was not honey he was eating, but that was just bee excrement that he'd casually been"
00:08:41,00:08:43,snacking on throughout the filming.
00:08:43,00:08:44,Wow.
00:08:44,00:08:48,"That's when you do need a bee with a little vacuum cleaner, don't you?"
00:08:48,00:08:50,The cleaner bee.
00:08:50,00:08:56,"Another horror film, which involves animals going nuts, was the birds, and they had a bird"
00:08:56,00:09:00,"trainer in the birds, and in fact he's called Ray Berrick, and he trained all birds in"
00:09:00,00:09:04,"all films that you've seen with birds in for about twenty years, so like the Birdman of"
00:09:04,00:09:09,"Alcatraz is another big one, and he had such cool tricks, so I don't know if you've seen"
00:09:09,00:09:13,"the birds, but there are lots of scenes where the birds fly towards the lens of the camera"
00:09:13,00:09:17,"and attack it, and they put meat in the lenses of the camera, so the birds would fly at it."
00:09:17,00:09:18,Cool.
00:09:18,00:09:21,"But if you read, it's quite weird, because there are no special effects in that, so they"
00:09:21,00:09:27,"just had these birds attacking them all the time, and the lead actor in it said it was Rod Taylor"
00:09:27,00:09:31,"who was the lead actor, who said there was one particular raven who absolutely hated him,"
00:09:31,00:09:35,"and ravens do take against people, we've discussed this before, so he said he'd get up, go"
00:09:35,00:09:40,"on to say every day, this raven would immediately turn up next to him, and go and then start just"
00:09:40,00:09:46,"biting him, manically, and every day on set he'd say, look, is Archie working today?"
00:09:46,00:09:51,"Archie being the raven, and he'd always turn up, and it was really sad because Tippie"
00:09:51,00:09:56,"Hedren, who was his co-star, also had a relationship with a raven, but she had a really nice one,"
00:09:56,00:10:01,"so a raven befriended her, loved her, they couldn't actually use that raven in the film because"
00:10:01,00:10:02,it was too nice.
00:10:02,00:10:06,"But if you watch it, if you watch the movie, and they're all attacking it, but one of them"
00:10:06,00:10:14,"is just kind of unhushed, they just leave them alone, leave them alone!"
00:10:14,00:10:21,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact, my fact this week is that"
00:10:21,00:10:29,"as well as using crash test dummies, Volvo tests its cars with a crash test moose, they have"
00:10:29,00:10:36,"a crash test moose, which as far as I can tell is called moose-us, so this is done in Sweden,"
00:10:36,00:10:43,"they have a 790 pound moose surrogate and they make it from a stack of 114 rubber discs,"
00:10:43,00:10:47,"and the idea is that it's sort of sitting in front of a car, so rather that's not the moose"
00:10:47,00:10:53,"inside the car as a crash test dummy, it's sitting in a distance, and they ram the car into"
00:10:53,00:10:58,"it, and it's blaze itself all over the car, so it's just to show the damage that's being"
00:10:58,00:10:59,done to the car.
00:10:59,00:11:02,"Because actually it's really, it's really important isn't it, because if you're driving"
00:11:02,00:11:06,"along and there's an animal in the way, a lot of people say really the best thing to do"
00:11:06,00:11:09,"is not to swear by the way, because you might hit a tree or another car, you basically"
00:11:09,00:11:14,"should keep going, but with a moose you definitely shouldn't do that, and the reason being"
00:11:14,00:11:20,"I'm a shop people here know, but basically they've got spindly legs and a massive big fuck off"
00:11:20,00:11:26,"body, and so you go into those legs and they just like match sticks just go and then the"
00:11:26,00:11:31,"body just hits you at the right height to go right into you, and it's really, really dangerous."
00:11:31,00:11:35,"There is amazing footage of the crash tests happening, and it's yeah, the top of the car"
00:11:35,00:11:38,"just gets taken out basically, but I think there are, yeah, did you say there are two of"
00:11:38,00:11:39,these?
00:11:39,00:11:43,"No, only two on the planet, but they are both in Sweden basically."
00:11:43,00:11:47,"Well, you do need it in Sweden, because that's where they have a lot of moose, of course."
00:11:47,00:11:50,"I'm not saying it's a bad idea, I think, yeah, yeah, no, it's a very good idea. I'm surprised"
00:11:50,00:11:53,"there isn't one in Canada to be honest. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but the thing with moose"
00:11:53,00:11:59,"in Sweden is there are so many moose in Sweden that if you're travelling across a highway,"
00:11:59,00:12:06,you will pass within a thousand feet of a moose every 23 seconds on average. But it's just
00:12:06,00:12:13,"one moose and he's really fast. It isn't that amazing actually. Yeah, incredible."
00:12:13,00:12:19,"They do have really cool, so there's a place in rural Virginia called the Insurance Institute"
00:12:19,00:12:24,"for Highway Safety, and it's their testing centre, and it's where they do a lot of crash"
00:12:24,00:12:29,"testing for cars, but they occasionally will have sort of fun darbies between different"
00:12:29,00:12:30,cars.
00:12:30,00:12:31,"Oh, what do you mean?"
00:12:31,00:12:37,"I've really oversolved that. Basically, I wasn't even that excited about myself, but..."
00:12:37,00:12:42,"Well, for their 50th birthday, they had a grudge match between a 1959 Bel Air and a 2009"
00:12:42,00:12:43,Alibou.
00:12:43,00:12:45,What do you mean they just crash into each other?
00:12:45,00:12:48,"Yeah, yeah. It was to show how much safer cars are these days, because the beautiful old"
00:12:48,00:12:53,"1950s car, the whole front just really crumbles and the other one doesn't."
00:12:53,00:12:54,Wow.
00:12:54,00:12:57,"You're not done with style, haven't you, in that nice old car?"
00:12:57,00:13:02,I guess so. But they really had to persuade people that safety was a good idea for cars.
00:13:02,00:13:07,"Like, that's in car accidents, kept creeping up and up and up, and the car industry kept"
00:13:07,00:13:13,"saying, ""Guard, yeah, awful, but what are we going to do about it?"" And they really had to"
00:13:13,00:13:14,persuade them.
00:13:14,00:13:19,"So Ford introduced a car in 1956, which had a steering wheel, where the steering wheel,"
00:13:19,00:13:24,"if you hit something, the steering wheel column would deform on impact, this is a good thing"
00:13:24,00:13:29,"because it means you don't get hit in the middle of the track by a spike of metal, basically."
00:13:29,00:13:31,"The car was not popular, despite being sold with that."
00:13:31,00:13:35,"It was very much outsold by other cars, which had very dangerous steering columns."
00:13:35,00:13:40,The first crash test dummies were live humans.
00:13:40,00:13:46,"So there was this, this happened a few times actually, but from the 1950s they started testing"
00:13:46,00:13:51,"the crash impact on human bodies, and there was a researcher called Lawrence Patrick,"
00:13:51,00:13:55,"and he basically volunteered himself, and he made the point that, actually, that people"
00:13:55,00:14:00,"have been talking about using inanimate objects, all things like the dummies we have today."
00:14:00,00:14:04,"But you can crash a dummy into a car as many times as you like and go, ""Oh, look, it's"
00:14:04,00:14:07,"really dented here, and it's head's exploded, and it's foot fell off."""
00:14:07,00:14:12,But you don't actually know what that would mean if it was a live human.
00:14:12,00:14:17,"You don't actually know if the dummy is dead, but would this kill a human?"
00:14:17,00:14:18,Right.
00:14:18,00:14:24,"So this guy from 1960 to 1975 was a human crash test dummy, and he used to do things like,"
00:14:24,00:14:30,"he took a 50-pound metal pendulum to the chest repeatedly, and that was to test the steering"
00:14:30,00:14:31,column.
00:14:31,00:14:33,So he used to break ribs and things like that.
00:14:33,00:14:37,Part of his job was hurling his knee repeatedly against a metal bar.
00:14:37,00:14:38,That's amazing.
00:14:38,00:14:42,"Yeah, he took over 400 deceleration rides to then, that's why you sort of simulate the feeling"
00:14:42,00:14:44,of a crash.
00:14:44,00:14:47,"And yeah, it sounds horrendous, and him and his students would lie down and they'd have"
00:14:47,00:14:51,"stuff like what's called a gravity impactor, where you'd have to be lying down and you had"
00:14:51,00:14:57,"kind of this like metal rod suspended above your cheek, and then it would just jab you"
00:14:57,00:14:58,in the cheek.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"It would be like a robot jab you, repeatedly and harder and harder in the cheek, to see"
00:15:00,00:15:01,how much you could take.
00:15:01,00:15:04,"And wanted to say that he couldn't take it anymore, they weren't, well let's make cars that"
00:15:04,00:15:06,don't inflict more than that.
00:15:06,00:15:11,But let's bring it right up to that point.
00:15:11,00:15:15,"And he was, that guy was Lawrence Patrick, you say, and it was one of his students called"
00:15:15,00:15:20,"Harold Mertz, who went on to develop the first or the standard crash test dummy, right?"
00:15:20,00:15:21,So it was based on all that kind of stuff.
00:15:21,00:15:25,"Oh wow, because he had such a traumatic experience here."
00:15:25,00:15:27,"Dummies are, they are getting older."
00:15:27,00:15:28,They are.
00:15:28,00:15:30,"We're all getting older, aren't they?"
00:15:30,00:15:31,Who are we getting older?
00:15:31,00:15:32,The dummies.
00:15:32,00:15:33,They've been made to be older now.
00:15:33,00:15:34,Okay.
00:15:34,00:15:38,"The made older, as in when they're first, oh right, yeah, because how does that work?"
00:15:38,00:15:40,As in the bone cell are stronger.
00:15:40,00:15:43,"They're a bit more fragile, basically, because people are getting older."
00:15:43,00:15:46,"Again, back to your point, James, we're all getting older."
00:15:46,00:15:51,"But drivers, drivers are getting, society is aging, so, you know, the crash test dummies"
00:15:51,00:15:56,"which simulate, you know, strapping young person in their prime are not a realistic way"
00:15:56,00:16:00,of simulating what's happening if you're driving and you're 120 years old.
00:16:00,00:16:01,No.
00:16:01,00:16:02,You know.
00:16:02,00:16:03,"And faster as well, they're getting, aren't they?"
00:16:03,00:16:04,Yeah.
00:16:04,00:16:05,Because we're getting faster.
00:16:05,00:16:06,And sort of more varied.
00:16:06,00:16:10,"There's this problem with dummies, and it happens with all technology, where it says this"
00:16:10,00:16:13,standard dummies have been made for the average man.
00:16:13,00:16:17,And so then we've proven that that's how strong this car is.
00:16:17,00:16:20,"And it's always a man, and it's always western man."
00:16:20,00:16:24,And they finally clocked on to the fact that not everyone on earth is a western man.
00:16:24,00:16:29,"And so obviously like women tend to be lighter, different parts of their body, a bit weaker."
00:16:29,00:16:33,And so now they've finally started making dummies that are like very in size.
00:16:33,00:16:34,But one of the things is they've had to get faster.
00:16:34,00:16:41,"I think the average American has put on just over two stone in the last 20 years, 25 years."
00:16:41,00:16:42,Okay.
00:16:42,00:16:45,So the dummies have had to follow suit.
00:16:45,00:16:46,Yeah.
00:16:46,00:16:47,28 pounds.
00:16:47,00:16:48,28 pounds.
00:16:48,00:16:49,28 pounds.
00:16:49,00:16:50,Yeah.
00:16:50,00:16:55,"Well, that's not much way to put on over 25 years."
00:16:55,00:16:58,You're actually keeping quite fit if that's all you put on in that period.
00:16:58,00:17:01,You don't gradually put on more and more weight each year.
00:17:01,00:17:03,"That's not how it's, but that's not like a healthy one."
00:17:03,00:17:09,"Sorry, as a man in this 40's, yes you do."
00:17:09,00:17:10,"I've got something you might like, Den."
00:17:10,00:17:11,Oh yeah.
00:17:11,00:17:14,There is a theory that crash test dummies explain the Roswell landings.
00:17:14,00:17:15,Jesus.
00:17:15,00:17:16,What?
00:17:16,00:17:21,So this is a claim that was made about crash test dummies that people might have mistaken
00:17:21,00:17:25,crash test dummies being used in parachute drops if you're testing a parachute and you want
00:17:25,00:17:28,to see how hard someone hits the ground with that particular parachute.
00:17:28,00:17:29,Yeah.
00:17:29,00:17:32,So maybe the Air Force were collecting in crash test dummies and mistook them for alien
00:17:32,00:17:33,bodies being collected in.
00:17:33,00:17:34,Right.
00:17:34,00:17:36,Because that's where a lot of military testing might happen.
00:17:36,00:17:39,And these were six foot long things and they were hairless and they were made of a weird
00:17:39,00:17:40,rubbery substance.
00:17:40,00:17:41,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:41,00:17:43,So it's not a widely adhered to theory.
00:17:43,00:17:44,No.
00:17:44,00:17:45,It's obviously aliens.
00:17:45,00:17:46,I can't do.
00:17:46,00:17:48,"Yeah, I can't believe you thought that would excite me."
00:17:48,00:17:50,What I wanted you to say is aliens are real.
00:17:50,00:17:51,That's the...
00:17:51,00:17:57,"Speaking of theories and adhering, this is to you."
00:17:57,00:17:58,Wow.
00:17:58,00:17:59,Tenuous.
00:17:59,00:18:00,Very tenuous.
00:18:00,00:18:01,Let's go.
00:18:01,00:18:06,Google has invented a new thing which is human fly paper and the idea is if you have a self-driving
00:18:06,00:18:11,"car, you put this fly paper on the front of your car and one of the problems are one"
00:18:11,00:18:15,of the main ways that people get injured if they get hit by cars is not even the first
00:18:15,00:18:19,impact is where you get thrown and you end up hitting your head on the floor or stuff like
00:18:19,00:18:21,that or you get run over.
00:18:21,00:18:25,"And so they think that what might happen is you drive along, you hit pedestrian, instead"
00:18:25,00:18:28,"of throwing them over, they stick to the car."
00:18:28,00:18:30,"Oh, wow."
00:18:30,00:18:34,And then you can slow down and then they can just unstick themselves.
00:18:34,00:18:38,"There must be so many situations where you're late to somewhere and you're like, I'm"
00:18:38,00:18:42,"sorry, I'm just going to have to go and you're on passing cars on the highway with a dude"
00:18:42,00:18:46,stuck to the front.
00:18:46,00:18:51,"Oh, I found a great move-related headline because I was looking up some moves facts as well."
00:18:51,00:18:53,This is a headline from South Dakota.
00:18:53,00:18:56,Is it Kilo Land or Kilo Land?
00:18:56,00:18:57,All right.
00:18:57,00:19:04,No one knows and I think it's bad to say no one here cares.
00:19:04,00:19:05,Okay.
00:19:05,00:19:07,Let's say Kilo Land news.
00:19:07,00:19:11,This is a genuine local news headline in South Dakota.
00:19:11,00:19:14,This moves from one field into another field.
00:19:14,00:19:18,"The surreal local news story goes on, beyond alert driving near the Marion Road exit on interstate"
00:19:18,00:19:19,90.
00:19:19,00:19:24,"A little after five Thursday night, a combine scared the moose, clearly just one moose involved"
00:19:24,00:19:25,in this whole state.
00:19:25,00:19:28,Scared the moose out of one field and into another.
00:19:28,00:19:32,This is the same moose that's been hanging out in the area north of southwestern Sioux Falls
00:19:32,00:19:36,since Monday.
00:19:36,00:19:39,So maybe there's a reason that nobody here has been to South Dakota as all I'm trying
00:19:39,00:19:49,to say it's time for fact number three and that is James.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Okay.
00:19:50,00:19:54,My fact this week is that Americans used to make the slippers radioactive so they could
00:19:54,00:19:58,find them in the dark.
00:19:58,00:20:04,"Now I must say, probably not many Americans in this, but I think definitely some of them"
00:20:04,00:20:05,did.
00:20:05,00:20:11,"An advert online for this product, which you could buy in the 1930s called Undaq."
00:20:11,00:20:12,Okay.
00:20:12,00:20:15,"And it's like a paint and it contains radium, which is radium."
00:20:15,00:20:16,Sorry.
00:20:16,00:20:21,"Can we just clarify that it wasn't online in the 1940s, was it?"
00:20:21,00:20:22,You're absolutely right.
00:20:22,00:20:24,It wasn't online in the 1930s.
00:20:24,00:20:25,It was a different medium back then.
00:20:25,00:20:27,It's been put online now.
00:20:27,00:20:28,Got it.
00:20:28,00:20:29,Just checking.
00:20:29,00:20:33,"I saw it online in the last few days, but yeah, I think it was in magazines and things"
00:20:33,00:20:34,like this.
00:20:34,00:20:41,"And it was called Undaq and it says, the advert says does Undaq really contain radium?"
00:20:41,00:20:44,Most assuredly.
00:20:44,00:20:48,So it's real radioactive stuff and the whole point of it is you would put it on things so
00:20:48,00:20:50,you could find them in the dark.
00:20:50,00:20:54,So they said that you were putting on watches and clocks on push buttons on the buckles
00:20:54,00:21:00,"of your bedroom slippers, on house numbers, flashlights, compasses, flashlights, I don't"
00:21:00,00:21:01,know why.
00:21:01,00:21:02,Because you can turn them.
00:21:02,00:21:03,"Well, you need to find it in the dark."
00:21:03,00:21:04,Yeah.
00:21:04,00:21:05,You're absolutely right.
00:21:05,00:21:10,"And basically, in the 1930s, they were putting radium on everything, even though not realizing"
00:21:10,00:21:12,perhaps that it was killing people.
00:21:12,00:21:13,Yeah.
00:21:13,00:21:15,"Yeah, they were obsessed."
00:21:15,00:21:20,"It was a craze, complete and like the newspaper has constantly contained it."
00:21:20,00:21:25,I think George Bernard Shaw said the world has run raving mad on the subject of radium.
00:21:25,00:21:31,"And of course, there was very famous the radium girls who are the people who worked in sort"
00:21:31,00:21:35,"of 19, 19s."
00:21:35,00:21:39,And the radium girls were there and they had to paint radium onto clocks to make their hands
00:21:39,00:21:42,glow in the dark and they would lick the paint brushes.
00:21:42,00:21:45,And so they would swallow a little bit of radium every single time they did that.
00:21:45,00:21:47,Which was extremely bad for them.
00:21:47,00:21:48,It turned out.
00:21:48,00:21:49,It was.
00:21:49,00:21:53,"Still, they would paint like little messages on the teeth for the boyfriends and like their"
00:21:53,00:21:55,clothes would glow in the dark.
00:21:55,00:22:00,"So when they went out clubbing or whatever they did in the 1920s, they would always wear"
00:22:00,00:22:03,the work clothes because it meant they shined in the night clothes.
00:22:03,00:22:06,"They were like queuing glow sticks, dancing in the clubs, wow."
00:22:06,00:22:10,"They were properly were glowers in one, so it was a big scandal by the 1920s."
00:22:10,00:22:13,They started dying and people realised it was probably because of all this radium.
00:22:13,00:22:17,"And when they exhumed their bodies years later, they were still glowing from all this"
00:22:17,00:22:18,radium.
00:22:18,00:22:19,It was amazing.
00:22:19,00:22:23,"And they'd open their cupboards in the morning and all their clothes are just glowing,"
00:22:23,00:22:24,absolutely bizarre.
00:22:24,00:22:28,"And then of course, because they were getting very sick, there were lawsuits."
00:22:28,00:22:32,And it was due to a guy called Leonard Grossman who was a lawyer who worked pro bono for the
00:22:32,00:22:37,whole time and it was after eight appeals that they managed to get the companies to admit
00:22:37,00:22:39,that they were wrong and managed to get something back.
00:22:39,00:22:46,"Although the last one, the last radium girl died at the age of 107, not so long ago, only"
00:22:46,00:22:47,"in the last 20 years, I think."
00:22:47,00:22:52,But she quit within a week of working that because she hated the taste of the paint.
00:22:52,00:22:53,Yes.
00:22:53,00:22:59,"She was counting herself lucky in 177 in 2014, but like they want to know, I suppose, and"
00:22:59,00:23:01,it must have been so exciting.
00:23:01,00:23:05,And also Uranium had the same thing when Uranium then became the thing and this was this
00:23:05,00:23:08,"other very, very dangerous, nuclear substance people got very into."
00:23:08,00:23:14,"There was a time when hamburgers came with free shares in Uranium minds, like little happy"
00:23:14,00:23:16,"meal, but it was a share in Uranium."
00:23:16,00:23:17,Really?
00:23:17,00:23:18,Wow.
00:23:18,00:23:19,Yes.
00:23:19,00:23:20,"There was some, right?"
00:23:20,00:23:23,"You know, B-O-U-G-I-E, the sort of things."
00:23:23,00:23:24,Bougie.
00:23:24,00:23:25,Bougie.
00:23:25,00:23:26,Sorry.
00:23:26,00:23:30,There were radioactive bougies which were wax-covered rods to be inserted into the penis.
00:23:30,00:23:33,"Sorry, I didn't know this word bougie until now, is that what it is?"
00:23:33,00:23:34,"Bougie, yeah."
00:23:34,00:23:37,"Well, there's a, there's a modern meaning of bougie which is a bit different, a bit different"
00:23:37,00:23:38,to that.
00:23:38,00:23:39,Is that what bougie nights?
00:23:39,00:23:40,That movie's about.
00:23:40,00:23:41,"Yeah, that's right."
00:23:41,00:23:42,Yeah.
00:23:42,00:23:45,"It basically is about that, isn't it?"
00:23:45,00:23:47,"Yeah, wow."
00:23:47,00:23:53,"Some people said if you fed your chickens radium, then their eggs would incubate themselves."
00:23:53,00:23:54,Wow.
00:23:54,00:23:55,Not true.
00:23:55,00:24:02,"We have, weirdly, you mentioned the curries early, so Mary, Mary Curie, she, she was in the"
00:24:02,00:24:03,news this year.
00:24:03,00:24:04,"She's in our book, our new book."
00:24:04,00:24:05,She.
00:24:05,00:24:10,"Yeah, because someone, it was her birthday and the cake arrived, surprise cake, they opened"
00:24:10,00:24:14,it up and on the cake was a drawing of Mary Curie.
00:24:14,00:24:18,And she was confused because she had no idea who it was.
00:24:18,00:24:21,It turns out that there was a mishearing over the phone.
00:24:21,00:24:29,"What the parent had actually asked for was a cake of Mariah Carey and as a result, had this"
00:24:29,00:24:34,"noble prize winner on her cake, no idea who it was."
00:24:34,00:24:39,All I want for Christmas is uranium.
00:24:39,00:24:50,"So Mary Curie, Pierre, her husband died in a traffic accident, and then years later, she started"
00:24:50,00:24:54,"dating again, and she had an affair with a married man, which was very scandalous at"
00:24:54,00:24:55,the time.
00:24:55,00:24:56,And it led to this huge course of love.
00:24:56,00:25:02,There were either two or five armed duels over this affair that she had.
00:25:02,00:25:07,"And the wife of the man she was having the affair with, her name was Madame Long Van."
00:25:07,00:25:11,She had someone break into Curie's house and steal the love letters.
00:25:11,00:25:15,"All of this about Mary Curie, noble prize winning, you know, and the letters were stolen,"
00:25:15,00:25:16,and then they were leaked to the press.
00:25:16,00:25:19,So suddenly this is a huge story.
00:25:19,00:25:25,"And her lover, Paul Long Van, had a duel between him and a journalist who'd insulted him."
00:25:25,00:25:31,"And there's a letter from Einstein to Mary Curie saying, don't worry about all this."
00:25:31,00:25:32,This is irrelevant.
00:25:32,00:25:33,Really?
00:25:33,00:25:34,It's really cool.
00:25:34,00:25:38,"Just before she won the Nobel Prize, so her Nobel Prize was slightly overshadowed by this"
00:25:38,00:25:39,huge story.
00:25:39,00:25:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:25:40,00:25:44,"Three days before she was due to go and collect it, the story broke."
00:25:44,00:25:47,"And they were saying, oh, maybe don't come and collect the Nobel Prize because this is scandalous."
00:25:47,00:25:50,"But then Einstein wrote her a letter saying, forget all that, you've got the award."
00:25:50,00:25:51,Get the award.
00:25:51,00:25:52,Wow.
00:25:52,00:25:55,She used to be always called on to test the radiant products.
00:25:55,00:25:58,"You know, you were saying at the start, James, that a lot of products called themselves"
00:25:58,00:25:59,radio active.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"But they didn't always have it in, is that right?"
00:26:01,00:26:04,"Yeah, they very often just pretended and then put a bit of different glow in the dark stuff"
00:26:04,00:26:05,in it.
00:26:05,00:26:09,"She would be called to verify that stuff contained radium that it, like, definitely was"
00:26:09,00:26:10,"deadly, basically."
00:26:10,00:26:12,"It would be like, my child's toy says it's radioactive."
00:26:12,00:26:14,"Can you just check, Mary Curie, that it is?"
00:26:14,00:26:17,"Do you be like, yep, definitely got lots of radium in it."
00:26:17,00:26:18,Wow.
00:26:18,00:26:19,Good luck to that kid.
00:26:19,00:26:20,Wow.
00:26:20,00:26:23,She actually fell on a little bit of hard times after a while and she didn't have enough
00:26:23,00:26:28,"radium to continue her research because radium was really, really expensive."
00:26:28,00:26:30,"There's not much of it in the ground, so it's really hard to get."
00:26:30,00:26:36,"So, there was a fundraising campaign led by American women and Curie traveled to the United"
00:26:36,00:26:42,States and she was presented with one gram of radium by President Warren Harding in 1921.
00:26:42,00:26:43,That's so cool.
00:26:43,00:26:44,A single gram.
00:26:44,00:26:47,"Okay, and it doesn't sound like a lot of that, right?"
00:26:47,00:26:55,"But it was cost them $100,000 for a single gram of radium and that at the time in 1921 was"
00:26:55,00:27:01,about that average budget of a Hollywood movie.
00:27:01,00:27:02,You could make a whole movie.
00:27:02,00:27:03,That's so cool.
00:27:03,00:27:04,Isn't that amazing?
00:27:04,00:27:07,"They did, because when they were trying to refine it in the foot, like before they'd even"
00:27:07,00:27:11,"discovered it, they were using a thing called pitch blend which is a kind of uranium"
00:27:11,00:27:12,ore.
00:27:12,00:27:16,"And it's got the, it's got radium in it but it needs to be refined a lot."
00:27:16,00:27:21,They went through seven tons of pitch blend and they ended up with one gram of radium
00:27:21,00:27:23,after all of that refining.
00:27:23,00:27:24,That's incredible.
00:27:24,00:27:30,This is why there was a ballet dancer and choreographer called Lowie Fuller who in 1904 created
00:27:30,00:27:34,"the radium dance, which was a really famous dance at the time and she wanted all the ballerinas"
00:27:34,00:27:39,to be wearing head-to-toe costumes made entirely of radium.
00:27:39,00:27:42,"She was sort of mates with Mary Curie and she wrote to her and said, can you make me a bunch"
00:27:42,00:27:44,of ballerinas dresses made entirely of radium?
00:27:44,00:27:47,"And thought, thank God, Mary Curie said, I'd absolutely love to."
00:27:47,00:27:50,It sounds like a great idea but it's just too expensive.
00:27:50,00:27:55,And so she had to make do with a slightly less glow in the dark other material and the ballerinas
00:27:55,00:27:57,lived just the other day.
00:27:57,00:28:00,Have you heard of a magic radium massage?
00:28:00,00:28:01,No.
00:28:01,00:28:05,"This was a 30s product which is curious because if the radium girls were dying in the 1920s,"
00:28:05,00:28:06,then you would think...
00:28:06,00:28:09,"Well, this studies a lot of radium until sort of 40s and 50s I think."
00:28:09,00:28:13,"Well, the magic radium massage, this ointment, when massaged into the sex parts, this is"
00:28:13,00:28:18,"the other, acts as a healthy tonic and stimulant, tending to give firmness and strength to the"
00:28:18,00:28:19,organs.
00:28:19,00:28:22,It is especially effective for improving the circulation in the genital organs when they
00:28:22,00:28:25,"feel cold, clammy and lifeless."
00:28:25,00:28:26,Soon.
00:28:26,00:28:31,"I mean, that is useful if you need to get up to go to the toilet of a night."
00:28:31,00:28:33,You just follow your car.
00:28:33,00:28:34,Where's...
00:28:34,00:28:37,Where did I leave that penis?
00:28:37,00:28:38,Yeah.
00:28:38,00:28:39,Okay.
00:28:39,00:28:48,It's time to move on to our final fact of the show.
00:28:48,00:28:50,That is Chazinski.
00:28:50,00:28:56,My fact this week is that the man who introduced chewing gum to the world had already been president
00:28:56,00:28:59,of Mexico 11 times.
00:28:59,00:29:00,It's crazy.
00:29:00,00:29:03,It's a very strange career trajectory.
00:29:03,00:29:10,"Of course, it's probably the most famous famous of Mexican ever, General Santa Anna in"
00:29:10,00:29:11,the 19th century.
00:29:11,00:29:13,He was president constantly.
00:29:13,00:29:18,"He's sort of hated in three different, very specific places."
00:29:18,00:29:22,"So the U.S. hate him, Mexicans hate him, and Texans hate him, and I know Texas is part of"
00:29:22,00:29:27,"the U.S., but some people say that they don't, they pretend they aren't."
00:29:27,00:29:28,"But yeah, he's..."
00:29:28,00:29:33,"So he was at the back of Alamo and he was disgraced there because he was very, very brutal."
00:29:33,00:29:38,"And then that was what led to the cries of remember the Alamo, which led to him and his"
00:29:38,00:29:40,troops being defeated at just interlater.
00:29:40,00:29:45,"But anyway, he had lots of sort of military defeats and somehow they kept on making"
00:29:45,00:29:48,"him president again, he kept on being exiled from the country."
00:29:48,00:29:54,"And when he was finally exiled from Mexico permanently in 1869, he went to New Jersey and all"
00:29:54,00:29:55,he brought with him.
00:29:55,00:29:57,That's not the joke.
00:29:57,00:30:04,"The joke is not, that's what you do when you hit a rock bottom."
00:30:04,00:30:10,"Wow, you can just say New Jersey and I agree with you a lot."
00:30:10,00:30:12,It's good to know.
00:30:12,00:30:17,So he went to New Jersey and he brought with him as insurance a ton of this chicle gum which
00:30:17,00:30:22,"they all chewed in Mexico and the bloke he was living with said, ""Oh, what's that gum?"
00:30:22,00:30:23,Can I try and make something out of it?
00:30:23,00:30:24,"I'm going to try and sell it."""
00:30:24,00:30:29,And he tried to make sort of tires out of it and toys out of it and masks and Wellington
00:30:29,00:30:32,"boots and none of it stuck, as it were."
00:30:32,00:30:36,"And so eventually he saw Santa Anna chewing it one day and so he thought, ""Okay, I'll"
00:30:36,00:30:38,"try and sell it to people and tell them to chew on it."""
00:30:38,00:30:44,And they loved it and their chewing gum was born or popularised at least in the West.
00:30:44,00:30:46,"He was quite amazing, wasn't he Santa Anna?"
00:30:46,00:30:51,"So after the independence from Spain in 1821, basically a whole country just kept having"
00:30:51,00:30:56,these coups and counts of coups and whatever and he just kept reinventing himself to whoever
00:30:56,00:30:57,was taking over.
00:30:57,00:31:00,"He said, ""Oh, I'm with these guys and then they would make him president."""
00:31:00,00:31:05,"So at one stage he started off as conservative and then he became liberal, then he became"
00:31:05,00:31:11,"Democrat and then he became a dictator and all those times, each time he became the president."
00:31:11,00:31:17,"By way of comparison, Donald Trump started off as a Republican, became a member of the"
00:31:17,00:31:23,"independence party, then was a Democrat and then was a Republican again, hasn't been a dictator."
00:31:23,00:31:24,Yeah.
00:31:24,00:31:29,"Yeah, he's like, he just kept reinventing himself so he could get the power."
00:31:29,00:31:30,Yeah.
00:31:30,00:31:31,It's really amazing.
00:31:31,00:31:37,He didn't go to either of his own weddings.
00:31:37,00:31:41,"He couldn't be bothered to turn up, basically, or he was travelling or busy or whatever."
00:31:41,00:31:43,So he just deputized someone by...
00:31:43,00:31:45,"Let me just say, you are about to get married."
00:31:45,00:31:46,"Certainly, yeah."
00:31:46,00:31:47,It doesn't work that way.
00:31:47,00:31:49,"Oh, no."
00:31:49,00:31:54,"So he married twice, mostly for, we think for money, both times, because the women he was"
00:31:54,00:31:59,marrying had very large estates and he was in need of cash.
00:31:59,00:32:06,"So the first wedding he had, he empowered his father-in-law to be as his proxy."
00:32:06,00:32:07,Oh.
00:32:07,00:32:10,"So basically, her dad would walk up the aisle."
00:32:10,00:32:11,He could.
00:32:11,00:32:12,He gave her away to himself.
00:32:12,00:32:13,"Basically, yeah."
00:32:13,00:32:14,Wow.
00:32:14,00:32:17,Do we know if he sort of jumped round the other side of her earlier?
00:32:17,00:32:18,Yeah.
00:32:18,00:32:20,I've just put a different hat on myself.
00:32:20,00:32:21,Yeah.
00:32:21,00:32:25,"He actually lost Texas to the US, possibly because he was having sex in a tent."
00:32:25,00:32:26,No.
00:32:26,00:32:33,"So this is the tale is that, at the Battle of Jacinto, he was distracted by a Texan woman"
00:32:33,00:32:36,"who, so it was a ploy on her part, she's sort of this folk hero."
00:32:36,00:32:39,And this is reported at the time by an English journalist.
00:32:39,00:32:43,"And apparently, this Texan woman snuck into his tent and seduced him and shagged away."
00:32:43,00:32:47,"And then he lost the battle while he was in the tent, not in charge of his troops."
00:32:47,00:32:48,And then had to leg it.
00:32:48,00:32:51,How long was that sex session that he lost?
00:32:51,00:32:54,"Well, the battle, the battle famously only took 18 minutes."
00:32:54,00:32:59,"That's not too bad, didn't it?"
00:32:59,00:33:01,In my house.
00:33:01,00:33:05,"My wife will be going to hear that, 18 minutes, he can do 18 minutes."
00:33:05,00:33:08,"Dad, you could always use a proxy if you have to."
00:33:08,00:33:17,"So it's okay, honey, your dad's on his way over at home."
00:33:17,00:33:20,"Did he still have his leg at the time, that that happened?"
00:33:20,00:33:23,"He did have his original leg at that time, yeah."
00:33:23,00:33:27,"He, one of the other things he was famous for was losing a leg in a conflict called the"
00:33:27,00:33:32,"pastry war, which was against French forces who had invaded Mexico."
00:33:32,00:33:33,I think that's why it's called that.
00:33:33,00:33:37,So he was wounded and he had his leg amputated.
00:33:37,00:33:42,"And then four years later, as a kind of political move, he had it disinterred and he held a state"
00:33:42,00:33:44,funeral for his leg.
00:33:44,00:33:45,So he got to attend.
00:33:45,00:33:47,And it was a really fancy funeral.
00:33:47,00:33:52,So the leg got taken to the capital in a coach and there was a beautiful monument constructed
00:33:52,00:33:57,and there was cannon fire and poems were read and then the leg was eventually re-buried.
00:33:57,00:33:58,Yeah.
00:33:58,00:34:03,"How should is that for his wife that he shows up to a funeral for his leg, but not to his own"
00:34:03,00:34:04,wedding?
00:34:04,00:34:10,"But then on the bright side per two years after he'd done that, it was exhumed again by his"
00:34:10,00:34:14,opponents and dragged through the streets with people chanting death to the cripple.
00:34:14,00:34:17,"So yeah, he was obsessed with this leg."
00:34:17,00:34:21,"He used to sort of like before he'd even done the big state funeral, he used to carry it"
00:34:21,00:34:23,around waving it above him in parade.
00:34:23,00:34:24,Really?
00:34:24,00:34:26,And he gave it two funerals.
00:34:26,00:34:32,He gave it a small funeral on his little hacienda before the big one when it first got lost.
00:34:32,00:34:35,"He was always reminding people, like one of these really annoying, like you couldn't,"
00:34:35,00:34:38,you'd always let it drop into conversation.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"But the pastry world, do you know why it was called that specifically?"
00:34:41,00:34:42,"No, I don't."
00:34:42,00:34:47,"It is related to the French thing, but it's specifically because there was one French"
00:34:47,00:34:53,pastry cafe in Mexico and it was owed a big debt by the government and it wasn't being
00:34:53,00:34:54,paid.
00:34:54,00:34:57,"And so this pastry chef called the French government and said, ""Mexico has me all this money,"
00:34:57,00:34:59,"it's not paying."""
00:34:59,00:35:02,And so it got a bit out of hand and war happened.
00:35:02,00:35:03,"Oh, man."
00:35:03,00:35:06,Because of that.
00:35:06,00:35:12,"The French ended up really overreacting, so they tried them up and said they owe me an arm"
00:35:12,00:35:13,in a leg.
00:35:13,00:35:21,They negotiated down to half of that.
00:35:21,00:35:24,"You know, you can visit his leg in Illinois."
00:35:24,00:35:25,Yes.
00:35:25,00:35:26,"Well, his fake leg."
00:35:26,00:35:28,It's in a museum in Illinois.
00:35:28,00:35:33,And there's like a chicken dinner there as well because supposedly he was eating chicken
00:35:33,00:35:35,"at the time, so it sort of like sets the same thing up."
00:35:35,00:35:37,"So when you say his fake leg, you mean this prosthesis?"
00:35:37,00:35:38,Yeah.
00:35:38,00:35:39,"Yeah, exactly."
00:35:39,00:35:44,"And then someone galloped off away when he wasn't looking, took his leg and it's now in Illinois."
00:35:44,00:35:45,It's been there for years.
00:35:45,00:35:46,Yes.
00:35:46,00:35:47,So this was another fight.
00:35:47,00:35:49,"This was the later battle that he actually lost, wasn't it?"
00:35:49,00:35:50,Yeah.
00:35:50,00:35:51,When he had the prosthetic leg.
00:35:51,00:35:55,"And as you say, he was eating a chicken dinner in his tent and-"
00:35:55,00:35:56,The battle was lost again.
00:35:56,00:35:58,He really lingered over it.
00:35:58,00:36:01,"He spent about 20 minutes eating the chicken, yeah."
00:36:01,00:36:02,Disaster.
00:36:02,00:36:04,It was going to have to stay out of tents.
00:36:04,00:36:08,"I always think it's really weird, though, because in that thing where the soldiers came"
00:36:08,00:36:13,"along and they took his leg and they also took $18,000 and the chicken dinner."
00:36:13,00:36:16,But everyone that always talks about the chicken dinner.
00:36:16,00:36:17,Yeah.
00:36:17,00:36:18,That's true.
00:36:18,00:36:19,It's so weird.
00:36:19,00:36:20,"And then he got another leg, the knee."
00:36:20,00:36:21,He got a peg leg.
00:36:21,00:36:22,Yeah.
00:36:22,00:36:23,And so just a piece of wood for a prosthesis.
00:36:23,00:36:25,And then that got stolen as well.
00:36:25,00:36:26,Oh.
00:36:26,00:36:27,Yeah.
00:36:27,00:36:31,It got stolen and was reportedly later used by Lieutenant Abner double day as a baseball bat.
00:36:31,00:36:32,Wow.
00:36:32,00:36:33,Wow.
00:36:33,00:36:37,"Hey, so this fact was also about the fact that he introduced chewing gum to the world."
00:36:37,00:36:38,"Oh, yes."
00:36:38,00:36:41,I mentioned a couple of chewing gum things I found.
00:36:41,00:36:44,"So chewing gum, obviously we had chewing gum that was around for a while."
00:36:44,00:36:48,And then bubble gum arrived and bubble gum was invented in Philadelphia.
00:36:48,00:36:49,Yeah.
00:36:49,00:36:50,How cool is that?
00:36:50,00:36:52,Did you guys know that?
00:36:52,00:36:53,Probably.
00:36:53,00:36:54,You didn't know that.
00:36:54,00:36:55,Okay.
00:36:55,00:36:56,So bubble gum was invented here.
00:36:56,00:37:00,"It was by a guy called Frank H. Fleer, although he didn't invent bubble gum itself."
00:37:00,00:37:03,So double bubble was the first ever bubble gum that came out.
00:37:03,00:37:04,You guys.
00:37:04,00:37:05,What?
00:37:05,00:37:06,Yeah.
00:37:06,00:37:07,There was no bubble before.
00:37:07,00:37:09,"No, chewing gum was just chewed."
00:37:09,00:37:10,"And then he was like, let's take a bit."
00:37:10,00:37:12,He went straight to double bubble gum.
00:37:12,00:37:13,There's no single bubble.
00:37:13,00:37:14,"Oh, I see."
00:37:14,00:37:15,"Well, no, no."
00:37:15,00:37:18,"There was a prototype which didn't work, yeah."
00:37:18,00:37:21,So he's not the inventor of double bubble.
00:37:21,00:37:25,"He is the inventor of its prototype, blibber blibber."
00:37:25,00:37:26,Stop.
00:37:26,00:37:27,Absolutely true.
00:37:27,00:37:31,Blibber blibber was the original bubble gum that he invented.
00:37:31,00:37:34,"But unfortunately, it didn't quite work out."
00:37:34,00:37:37,"So the problem was, is when you blew the bubble, no one could say it for a start."
00:37:37,00:37:38,Blibber blibber.
00:37:38,00:37:39,Blibber blibber.
00:37:39,00:37:40,Blibber blibber.
00:37:40,00:37:41,"So, yeah."
00:37:41,00:37:42,So Frank H. Fleer.
00:37:42,00:37:45,"So the problem was, is that you would blow the bubble, it would pop, and it would go all"
00:37:45,00:37:46,of your face.
00:37:46,00:37:51,But the stickiness of it was too much that you needed a solvent to actually take it off
00:37:51,00:37:53,your face.
00:37:53,00:37:58,"So when he was marketing it initially, it was with this little product that would make"
00:37:58,00:37:59,sure that it would come up.
00:37:59,00:38:01,So it didn't work out.
00:38:01,00:38:03,"Never sold, never made it actually to shops."
00:38:03,00:38:07,"But instead, then someone who was working for him said, let's take it differently."
00:38:07,00:38:08,And that's how we have double bubble.
00:38:08,00:38:09,Wow.
00:38:09,00:38:10,That's great.
00:38:10,00:38:11,So when was that?
00:38:11,00:38:14,"This was 1906, that he posted this, yeah."
00:38:14,00:38:19,"Because there was one other claimant to the invention of bubble gum, who is Waldo Seaman,"
00:38:19,00:38:20,who...
00:38:20,00:38:21,Wow.
00:38:21,00:38:23,What did he call his?
00:38:23,00:38:27,And I didn't go down very well.
00:38:27,00:38:28,I don't...
00:38:28,00:38:30,"With chewing gum, make sure you never swallow."
00:38:30,00:38:32,That's what I'm saying.
00:38:32,00:38:36,So Mr... Mr Seaman was...
00:38:36,00:38:37,Waldo Seaman.
00:38:37,00:38:38,Working for a entire company.
00:38:38,00:38:39,Where's Waldo?
00:38:39,00:38:40,Which Waldo?
00:38:40,00:38:49,That's a much more difficult and more adult version of the purchase than that.
00:38:49,00:38:59,"He's easier to spot though, you turn the lights off, you shine and don't look glows in the dark."
00:38:59,00:39:05,That's the best UV Seaman Wesley bubble gum joke that's ever been made.
00:39:05,00:39:07,That's the only one.
00:39:07,00:39:08,No.
00:39:08,00:39:09,Top 10.
00:39:09,00:39:13,"Anyway, he was a very serious guy wanting to be taken seriously."
00:39:13,00:39:18,"His business was in making plastics and rubber and polymers, and he worked for a tyre company."
00:39:18,00:39:21,"And so when he made this thing that blew bubbles, the tyre company thought, well, that's"
00:39:21,00:39:22,a huge defect.
00:39:22,00:39:27,"We don't want tyres that are bubbles, so just stop making it."
00:39:27,00:39:29,And so he had to stop making it.
00:39:29,00:39:33,"But interestingly, did you know that tyre manufacturers, Goodya Tire and Rubber, for instance,"
00:39:33,00:39:38,are the biggest provider of the rubber core of chewing gum today?
00:39:38,00:39:39,Is it?
00:39:39,00:39:40,"Yeah, of course."
00:39:40,00:39:41,It's a bit of a tyre in it.
00:39:41,00:39:44,"Because it's not made out of that chickly stuff anymore, it's made out of, like, petrochemicals,"
00:39:44,00:39:45,basically chewing gum.
00:39:45,00:39:46,"Yeah, essentially."
00:39:46,00:39:47,Yeah.
00:39:47,00:39:48,It's made out of kind of rubber in the middle of it.
00:39:48,00:39:49,That's amazing.
00:39:49,00:39:50,Yeah.
00:39:50,00:39:54,"So actually, when cars drive over the road, they should be able to just pick up the chewing"
00:39:54,00:39:56,gum and just become part of the tyre.
00:39:56,00:39:57,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:57,00:40:00,"And eventually, you just have a massively high car."
00:40:00,00:40:01,Yeah.
00:40:01,00:40:02,Yeah.
00:40:02,00:40:06,"The ancient Greeks had chewing gum, a kind of chewing gum, yeah."
00:40:06,00:40:08,"So as you say, it was popularized when it became nice."
00:40:08,00:40:13,"But the ancient Greeks were going around chewing mastic gum, sometimes, that was a thing."
00:40:13,00:40:18,And it was really horrible back in the old days because it used to be made with paraffin.
00:40:18,00:40:22,"So it's very bitter and very, you know, brittle and unwholesome."
00:40:22,00:40:25,"The one thing that you might do, if you had some paraffin chewing gum, is you'd have"
00:40:25,00:40:29,"a plate of sugar next to you, and you just have to repeatedly take it out of your mouth,"
00:40:29,00:40:31,dip it in the sugar and put it back in.
00:40:31,00:40:32,"Oh, nice."
00:40:32,00:40:33,Yeah.
00:40:33,00:40:34,Is that all right?
00:40:34,00:40:35,"No, not that."
00:40:35,00:40:36,Not like that.
00:40:36,00:40:40,I've explained it wrong.
00:40:40,00:40:42,We're going to have to move on in a second.
00:40:42,00:40:43,"Oh, one more thing about chewing gum."
00:40:43,00:40:44,Yeah.
00:40:44,00:40:48,The University of Copenhagen is currently working on fertility chewing gum.
00:40:48,00:40:49,So...
00:40:49,00:40:55,Is this another Waldo Seaman invention?
00:40:55,00:41:03,It's the second best Waldo Seaman bubble gum based.
00:41:03,00:41:10,"No, it's for women to chew so that you know where you are in your menstrual cycles."
00:41:10,00:41:15,"So if you chew it, it reacts with the, I guess, the enzymes in your saliva, and it turns"
00:41:15,00:41:19,a particular colour depending on how far along you are and whether you're in the perfect
00:41:19,00:41:20,time to consume.
00:41:20,00:41:23,But then do you have to keep pulling it out of your mouth and looking at it and then
00:41:23,00:41:25,putting it back in again?
00:41:25,00:41:26,I think there's a...
00:41:26,00:41:29,"Well, you have to take it out at least once, yeah."
00:41:29,00:41:31,But that is cool.
00:41:31,00:41:32,It's...
00:41:32,00:41:33,"Yes, it is."
00:41:33,00:41:36,"If it happens, that's going to be great."
00:41:36,00:41:40,"In 1904, they had a big craze in America of chewing gum parties."
00:41:40,00:41:41,Cool.
00:41:41,00:41:44,"And the idea of what you would do there is you would, each guest would come along with"
00:41:44,00:41:47,"a big pack of chewing gum, actually lots of packs, and then everyone would sit around"
00:41:47,00:41:51,"and chew their chewing gum until it was soft, and then they'd put it on a plate and"
00:41:51,00:41:54,they would sculpt it into things.
00:41:54,00:41:55,Cool.
00:41:55,00:41:58,And that was the game.
00:41:58,00:41:59,That's kind of fun.
00:41:59,00:42:00,I thought you were going to say that.
00:42:00,00:42:03,This audience doesn't seem to think it's much fun.
00:42:03,00:42:04,Oh.
00:42:04,00:42:05,Wow.
00:42:05,00:42:08,"Philadelphia is a bit too good for that, apparently."
00:42:08,00:42:09,Okay.
00:42:09,00:42:10,Let's wrap up.
00:42:10,00:42:11,Okay.
00:42:11,00:42:12,That is it.
00:42:12,00:42:13,That is all of our facts.
