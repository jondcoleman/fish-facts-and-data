 [MUSIC]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.800
 >> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Philadelphia.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.200
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.240
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.080
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.080
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.280
 And in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 My fact is that the star of the film Candy Man, where a character has bees coming out of his mouth,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.360
 negotiated a $1,000 bonus for every time he got stung.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.560
 He ended up with $23,000.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.880
 >> Wow.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.680
 >> How bad is it to be stung by a bee?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.240
 Do you think you'd be deliberately angering the bees so that you got a few more stings that they've been mumbling or not?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.480
 >> I would, but that says more about me than it does about me.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.760
 Yeah, although in the mouth, I imagine it would be a lot more painful than normal.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.520
 So this is Candy Man, this is Tony Todd.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.320
 This is a kind of cult horror film.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.080
 And one of the inspirations was from the Johnny Carson show,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.400
 where there was a man called Norman Gary, who was a bee-based performer.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.120
 And he had an act where he played the clarinet while covered in bees.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.240
 And people loved this.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.920
 And he then became the bee wrangler, the official bee person on Candy Man.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.440
 >> Yeah. >> And I think it's him and Tony Todd,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.000
 they're the only two people to have done all three Candy Man films is the star and the bee guy.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.760
 >> Can you explain what Candy Man is, because I haven't seen it, so.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.120
 >> It's, Dan, you watch it like a child.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.840
 >> Yeah, yeah, it's a horror film.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.120
 There's a guy who has a hook, and if you say his name into a mirror five times, he kills you.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.480
 So in theory, you shouldn't do that, but people they do.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.320
 >> They're then.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.840
 >> Yeah, but it's times if we said it itself, I don't understand.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.000
 >> But it was written by Clive Barker, the great horror writer.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.720
 I think he did Hellraiser as well.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.000
 And the bees that they use, actually, there is a logic.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.840
 It wasn't bees that were just ready and furious and waiting to sting.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.680
 They made sure that the bees were only 12 hours old.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.760
 So imagine you've just been born.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.360
 And just suddenly in a Hollywood movie, it's incredible.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.960
 And so yeah, so they went into the mouth.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.400
 And the idea is that the stings wouldn't be sharpened up.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.640
 Even when he was stung, it wouldn't have the sting of, say, 14-hour old bee.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.880
 And once they'd done each take, the bees would be vacuumed up using a tiny bee vacuum

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.960
 to do you know that you can get a bee vacuum cleaner?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.120
 How's that different from a normal vacuum cleaner?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.640
 >> I think it's just a little bit kinder on the bees, I would guess.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.800
 >> It was a mini one.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.360
 I guess it was different because it's a bee size.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.560
 Not like a bee would use it as a vacuum cleaner.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.360
 >> And they'd be sucked up and then returned to their dressing room.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.840
 For the sort of to await the next take.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.400
 >> Wow.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.720
 >> They didn't have their own dressing room.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.560
 They do mean a wooden box.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.600
 >> I think.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 >> Yeah, well, you've seen our dressing room tonight, that's.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.800
 >> It's full of bees.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.760
 >> But actually, the main thing is with this beading thing,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.400
 which is what the clarinetist did, okay.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.840
 So what you do is you get a queen bee and you put it in a little cage by your face.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.600
 And then all of the other bees kind of come along because they like the queen bee so much

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.960
 and they hang around your face.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.280
 And the way that you get them off normally is you spend maybe a couple of hours

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.920
 getting them on so you have a massive bee beard and then you just jump in the air.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.520
 And when you land, all the bees just disappear.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.680
 They just stop holding onto your face.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.480
 >> That's amazing, does that not irritate them?

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.320
 >> A little bit, you might get stung a few times.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.640
 But then you walk backwards and someone's kind of firing smoke in your face

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.120
 so that they're getting a bit sleepy, a little bit drowsy, and then you can get away.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.360
 >> That's so crafty, cool.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.000
 >> Really, that's so weird, because Virginia Madden, who I think was the lead female character

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.440
 in the film, said it used to take ages for there to be ranked as the sweet the bees are.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.480
 >> Well, yeah, because what they did with them is they kind of smeared their face in the pheromone.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.280
 And so the bees just really did not want to leave them.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.320
 She said that it basically, you have pheromones on them, so they're all in love with you, all the bees.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.280
 That's nice, isn't it?

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.120
 >> She was allergic to bees, I think.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.600
 >> She was very slightly, wasn't she?

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.920
 >> The director said, no, you're not, you're just afraid.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:44.600
 This guy Norman Gary, the bee wrangler, he has a Guinness World Record that is obviously

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.600
 be related, but it is for most bees in a mouth.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.600
 >> Wow, really?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600
 >> How many guesses?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 >> I would say about 14.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600
 >> 14?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.600
 >> 14.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.600
 >> 16.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600
 >> 16.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600
 >> 16.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.600
 >> 16.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.600
 >> 16.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600
 >> 16.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.600
 >> Okay.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.080
 >> By an incredibly dubious method, Dan Wins.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.120
 >> But you're still out, he had 109 live bees in his mouth at one time.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.200
 And you get a sponge soaked in sugar, and they like that, obviously, so they always seek

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.600
 that out, so you can sort of train them to go where you want them to go by that with that

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.600
 sponge.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.800
 So then he put it in his mouth, you have to close your mouth for 10 seconds for the record

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.240
 to be valid, so they're all in there, and then you put a mesh cage up to your lips, you

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.880
 blow them all into the cage at the same time, then you close the bag, and then you to do

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.600
 the count, you have to allow them to escape one by one while you're telling them.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.600
 >> One by one.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.600
 >> Until then, you don't know if you've got the record, because you've just got to let a bee's

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600
 in your mouth.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.600
 It's easier to count them out than it is to count them in, I guess.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.600
 >> Yeah, I see that.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.400
 >> Hey, I was looking into horror movies generally, because I realize I just don't know much about

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.400
 sort of like the behind the scenes of movies.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.600
 I found this really fun fact, which is the Omen, the movie The Omen, so Damien, who is, it's

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.600
 now the classic name for, yeah, so he wasn't meant to be called Damien.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600
 >> Oh, no.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.400
 >> Yeah, originally, the screenwriter, David Celtser, he wanted to name the anti-Christ

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.280
 Domlin, D-O-M-L-I-N, and the reason he wanted to call him Domlin is because he knew

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.320
 a Domlin who was a totally obnoxious brat, he said.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.800
 It was a friend, it was the child of a friend of his, and it was his wife, the screenwriter's

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.000
 wife, who went, you can't fucking do this to Domlin, immortalize him as the anti-Christ

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 in a movie.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.400
 >> It's not, they're not going to go, well, it might be another Domlin.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.400
 >> Yeah, exactly.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.400
 >> So it's Damien, yeah, it should have been Domlin.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.400
 >> Wow.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.400
 But not all the Damians get that, it seems unfair.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.160
 >> But at least there are all the Damians, there's not just one Damien at the world, he knows

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.160
 it's about him.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.340
 >> They used to have a lot of horror movies within Sexon, like this one Candy Man with

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:02.120
 the Bees, with it between 1966 and 1978, there were six major films featuring Bees as

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.960
 the main horror in that film.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:12.400
 One of them was called The Swarm, and the Sunday Times has said it's the worst film ever made.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.640
 Richard Velt in the Wilmington Morning Star said, "The Swarm may not be the worst movie ever

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.640
 made.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.000
 I'll have to see them all to be sure, but it's certainly as bad as any I've ever seen."

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.920
 All the actors involved in this fiasco should be ashamed.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.520
 Apparently, it's absolutely awful, it's got Michael Cain in it.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.520
 It costs tons, it was really expensive, the budget was like 20 million.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.680
 He came out in the same year as Star Wars, which was made for a lot less money, and is basically

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.480
 about a load of killer bees.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.240
 Now, the American Bee Association decided to do a cease and desist to the Swarm for defaming

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.240
 the American Honey Bee, and as a result, at the end of the movie, there's a disclaimer

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.560
 saying that the killer bees in the film are no resemblance to real crop pollinating honey

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.560
 bees.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.960
 I thought it was some resemblance.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.280
 I was reading about the Swarm too, it does sound absolutely amazing, it's two hours and

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.320
 forty minutes long, which is hefty.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.040
 Michael Cain said that he only did it because his mother needed a house to live in.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.120
 It's quite sweet, but also, they kept finding all the way through the film, because they

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.560
 filmed it with nearly a million bees, so it was a big huge cast, basically.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.840
 Huge got one, the credits at the end, B1, B2, B3.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.560
 But the cast and the crew, they kept finding little yellow dots on their clothing because

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.840
 of all the bees, and Michael Cain would eat that, before eventually being informed that

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.480
 that was not honey he was eating, but that was just bee excrement that he'd casually been

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.280
 snacking on throughout the filming.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.280
 Wow.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.120
 That's when you do need a bee with a little vacuum cleaner, don't you?

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.880
 The cleaner bee.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.440
 Another horror film, which involves animals going nuts, was the birds, and they had a bird

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.900
 trainer in the birds, and in fact he's called Ray Berrick, and he trained all birds in

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.300
 all films that you've seen with birds in for about twenty years, so like the Birdman of

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:09.000
 Alcatraz is another big one, and he had such cool tricks, so I don't know if you've seen

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.180
 the birds, but there are lots of scenes where the birds fly towards the lens of the camera

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.840
 and attack it, and they put meat in the lenses of the camera, so the birds would fly at it.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840
 Cool.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.800
 But if you read, it's quite weird, because there are no special effects in that, so they

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:27.420
 just had these birds attacking them all the time, and the lead actor in it said it was Rod Taylor

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.920
 who was the lead actor, who said there was one particular raven who absolutely hated him,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.420
 and ravens do take against people, we've discussed this before, so he said he'd get up, go

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.880
 on to say every day, this raven would immediately turn up next to him, and go and then start just

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.160
 biting him, manically, and every day on set he'd say, look, is Archie working today?

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.680
 Archie being the raven, and he'd always turn up, and it was really sad because Tippie

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.640
 Hedren, who was his co-star, also had a relationship with a raven, but she had a really nice one,

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.560
 so a raven befriended her, loved her, they couldn't actually use that raven in the film because

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.560
 it was too nice.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.360
 But if you watch it, if you watch the movie, and they're all attacking it, but one of them

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:14.880
 is just kind of unhushed, they just leave them alone, leave them alone!

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:21.360
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact, my fact this week is that

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:29.260
 as well as using crash test dummies, Volvo tests its cars with a crash test moose, they have

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:36.720
 a crash test moose, which as far as I can tell is called moose-us, so this is done in Sweden,

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:43.080
 they have a 790 pound moose surrogate and they make it from a stack of 114 rubber discs,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.440
 and the idea is that it's sort of sitting in front of a car, so rather that's not the moose

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.480
 inside the car as a crash test dummy, it's sitting in a distance, and they ram the car into

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.120
 it, and it's blaze itself all over the car, so it's just to show the damage that's being

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.120
 done to the car.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.000
 Because actually it's really, it's really important isn't it, because if you're driving

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 along and there's an animal in the way, a lot of people say really the best thing to do

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.720
 is not to swear by the way, because you might hit a tree or another car, you basically

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.900
 should keep going, but with a moose you definitely shouldn't do that, and the reason being

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:20.220
 I'm a shop people here know, but basically they've got spindly legs and a massive big fuck off

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:26.260
 body, and so you go into those legs and they just like match sticks just go and then the

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:31.380
 body just hits you at the right height to go right into you, and it's really, really dangerous.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.660
 There is amazing footage of the crash tests happening, and it's yeah, the top of the car

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.740
 just gets taken out basically, but I think there are, yeah, did you say there are two of

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.740
 these?

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.540
 No, only two on the planet, but they are both in Sweden basically.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.100
 Well, you do need it in Sweden, because that's where they have a lot of moose, of course.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.680
 I'm not saying it's a bad idea, I think, yeah, yeah, no, it's a very good idea. I'm surprised

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.940
 there isn't one in Canada to be honest. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but the thing with moose

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:59.380
 in Sweden is there are so many moose in Sweden that if you're travelling across a highway,

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:06.020
 you will pass within a thousand feet of a moose every 23 seconds on average. But it's just

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:13.420
 one moose and he's really fast. It isn't that amazing actually. Yeah, incredible.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:19.580
 They do have really cool, so there's a place in rural Virginia called the Insurance Institute

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:24.180
 for Highway Safety, and it's their testing centre, and it's where they do a lot of crash

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:29.500
 testing for cars, but they occasionally will have sort of fun darbies between different

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.500
 cars.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.500
 Oh, what do you mean?

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:37.260
 I've really oversolved that. Basically, I wasn't even that excited about myself, but...

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:42.420
 Well, for their 50th birthday, they had a grudge match between a 1959 Bel Air and a 2009

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.420
 Alibou.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.180
 What do you mean they just crash into each other?

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.740
 Yeah, yeah. It was to show how much safer cars are these days, because the beautiful old

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.380
 1950s car, the whole front just really crumbles and the other one doesn't.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.380
 Wow.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.940
 You're not done with style, haven't you, in that nice old car?

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.900
 I guess so. But they really had to persuade people that safety was a good idea for cars.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:07.580
 Like, that's in car accidents, kept creeping up and up and up, and the car industry kept

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:13.500
 saying, "Guard, yeah, awful, but what are we going to do about it?" And they really had to

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.500
 persuade them.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.140
 So Ford introduced a car in 1956, which had a steering wheel, where the steering wheel,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:24.020
 if you hit something, the steering wheel column would deform on impact, this is a good thing

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.060
 because it means you don't get hit in the middle of the track by a spike of metal, basically.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.660
 The car was not popular, despite being sold with that.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.580
 It was very much outsold by other cars, which had very dangerous steering columns.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:40.580
 The first crash test dummies were live humans.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:46.380
 So there was this, this happened a few times actually, but from the 1950s they started testing

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:51.100
 the crash impact on human bodies, and there was a researcher called Lawrence Patrick,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.780
 and he basically volunteered himself, and he made the point that, actually, that people

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.300
 have been talking about using inanimate objects, all things like the dummies we have today.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.580
 But you can crash a dummy into a car as many times as you like and go, "Oh, look, it's

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.820
 really dented here, and it's head's exploded, and it's foot fell off."

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.020
 But you don't actually know what that would mean if it was a live human.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:17.100
 You don't actually know if the dummy is dead, but would this kill a human?

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.100
 Right.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:24.580
 So this guy from 1960 to 1975 was a human crash test dummy, and he used to do things like,

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:30.380
 he took a 50-pound metal pendulum to the chest repeatedly, and that was to test the steering

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.380
 column.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.020
 So he used to break ribs and things like that.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.060
 Part of his job was hurling his knee repeatedly against a metal bar.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.060
 That's amazing.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.980
 Yeah, he took over 400 deceleration rides to then, that's why you sort of simulate the feeling

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.460
 of a crash.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.340
 And yeah, it sounds horrendous, and him and his students would lie down and they'd have

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.980
 stuff like what's called a gravity impactor, where you'd have to be lying down and you had

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:57.060
 kind of this like metal rod suspended above your cheek, and then it would just jab you

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.060
 in the cheek.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.820
 It would be like a robot jab you, repeatedly and harder and harder in the cheek, to see

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.820
 how much you could take.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.580
 And wanted to say that he couldn't take it anymore, they weren't, well let's make cars that

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.140
 don't inflict more than that.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:11.420
 But let's bring it right up to that point.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.380
 And he was, that guy was Lawrence Patrick, you say, and it was one of his students called

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:20.300
 Harold Mertz, who went on to develop the first or the standard crash test dummy, right?

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.900
 So it was based on all that kind of stuff.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.100
 Oh wow, because he had such a traumatic experience here.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.300
 Dummies are, they are getting older.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.300
 They are.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.100
 We're all getting older, aren't they?

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.100
 Who are we getting older?

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.100
 The dummies.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.780
 They've been made to be older now.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:34.780
 Okay.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.820
 The made older, as in when they're first, oh right, yeah, because how does that work?

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.220
 As in the bone cell are stronger.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.700
 They're a bit more fragile, basically, because people are getting older.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.020
 Again, back to your point, James, we're all getting older.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:51.540
 But drivers, drivers are getting, society is aging, so, you know, the crash test dummies

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:56.940
 which simulate, you know, strapping young person in their prime are not a realistic way

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.900
 of simulating what's happening if you're driving and you're 120 years old.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.900
 No.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:02.900
 You know.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:03.900
 And faster as well, they're getting, aren't they?

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:04.900
 Yeah.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.900
 Because we're getting faster.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.900
 And sort of more varied.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.700
 There's this problem with dummies, and it happens with all technology, where it says this

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.460
 standard dummies have been made for the average man.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.620
 And so then we've proven that that's how strong this car is.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.580
 And it's always a man, and it's always western man.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.700
 And they finally clocked on to the fact that not everyone on earth is a western man.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.380
 And so obviously like women tend to be lighter, different parts of their body, a bit weaker.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.140
 And so now they've finally started making dummies that are like very in size.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.820
 But one of the things is they've had to get faster.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:41.940
 I think the average American has put on just over two stone in the last 20 years, 25 years.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:42.940
 Okay.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.060
 So the dummies have had to follow suit.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.060
 Yeah.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.060
 28 pounds.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.060
 28 pounds.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.060
 28 pounds.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.060
 Yeah.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:55.180
 Well, that's not much way to put on over 25 years.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.900
 You're actually keeping quite fit if that's all you put on in that period.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.620
 You don't gradually put on more and more weight each year.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.380
 That's not how it's, but that's not like a healthy one.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:09.100
 Sorry, as a man in this 40's, yes you do.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.740
 I've got something you might like, Den.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.740
 Oh yeah.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.940
 There is a theory that crash test dummies explain the Roswell landings.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:15.940
 Jesus.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:16.940
 What?

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:21.860
 So this is a claim that was made about crash test dummies that people might have mistaken

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.220
 crash test dummies being used in parachute drops if you're testing a parachute and you want

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.540
 to see how hard someone hits the ground with that particular parachute.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.540
 Yeah.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.340
 So maybe the Air Force were collecting in crash test dummies and mistook them for alien

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.700
 bodies being collected in.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.700
 Right.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.860
 Because that's where a lot of military testing might happen.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.820
 And these were six foot long things and they were hairless and they were made of a weird

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:40.820
 rubbery substance.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.820
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.780
 So it's not a widely adhered to theory.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.780
 No.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.780
 It's obviously aliens.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.780
 I can't do.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.940
 Yeah, I can't believe you thought that would excite me.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.940
 What I wanted you to say is aliens are real.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.940
 That's the...

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:57.820
 Speaking of theories and adhering, this is to you.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.820
 Wow.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:17:59.820
 Tenuous.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.820
 Very tenuous.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.820
 Let's go.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:06.780
 Google has invented a new thing which is human fly paper and the idea is if you have a self-driving

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.060
 car, you put this fly paper on the front of your car and one of the problems are one

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.420
 of the main ways that people get injured if they get hit by cars is not even the first

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.740
 impact is where you get thrown and you end up hitting your head on the floor or stuff like

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.300
 that or you get run over.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.980
 And so they think that what might happen is you drive along, you hit pedestrian, instead

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.580
 of throwing them over, they stick to the car.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.740
 Oh, wow.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.860
 And then you can slow down and then they can just unstick themselves.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.100
 There must be so many situations where you're late to somewhere and you're like, I'm

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.780
 sorry, I'm just going to have to go and you're on passing cars on the highway with a dude

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.740
 stuck to the front.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.020
 Oh, I found a great move-related headline because I was looking up some moves facts as well.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.820
 This is a headline from South Dakota.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.380
 Is it Kilo Land or Kilo Land?

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.380
 All right.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:04.740
 No one knows and I think it's bad to say no one here cares.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.740
 Okay.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.940
 Let's say Kilo Land news.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.060
 This is a genuine local news headline in South Dakota.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.740
 This moves from one field into another field.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.700
 The surreal local news story goes on, beyond alert driving near the Marion Road exit on interstate

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.700
 90.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:24.380
 A little after five Thursday night, a combine scared the moose, clearly just one moose involved

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.860
 in this whole state.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.540
 Scared the moose out of one field and into another.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.380
 This is the same moose that's been hanging out in the area north of southwestern Sioux Falls

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.500
 since Monday.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.340
 So maybe there's a reason that nobody here has been to South Dakota as all I'm trying

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:49.260
 to say it's time for fact number three and that is James.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.260
 Okay.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.940
 My fact this week is that Americans used to make the slippers radioactive so they could

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.580
 find them in the dark.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:04.820
 Now I must say, probably not many Americans in this, but I think definitely some of them

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.820
 did.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:11.860
 An advert online for this product, which you could buy in the 1930s called Undaq.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:12.860
 Okay.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.900
 And it's like a paint and it contains radium, which is radium.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.900
 Sorry.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:21.800
 Can we just clarify that it wasn't online in the 1940s, was it?

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800
 You're absolutely right.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.300
 It wasn't online in the 1930s.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.780
 It was a different medium back then.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.440
 It's been put online now.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.440
 Got it.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.440
 Just checking.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.740
 I saw it online in the last few days, but yeah, I think it was in magazines and things

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.740
 like this.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:41.100
 And it was called Undaq and it says, the advert says does Undaq really contain radium?

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.500
 Most assuredly.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.820
 So it's real radioactive stuff and the whole point of it is you would put it on things so

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.260
 you could find them in the dark.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:54.740
 So they said that you were putting on watches and clocks on push buttons on the buckles

00:20:54.740 --> 00:21:00.420
 of your bedroom slippers, on house numbers, flashlights, compasses, flashlights, I don't

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.420
 know why.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.420
 Because you can turn them.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.420
 Well, you need to find it in the dark.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.420
 Yeah.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.420
 You're absolutely right.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:10.580
 And basically, in the 1930s, they were putting radium on everything, even though not realizing

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.740
 perhaps that it was killing people.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:13.740
 Yeah.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.540
 Yeah, they were obsessed.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:20.180
 It was a craze, complete and like the newspaper has constantly contained it.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:25.820
 I think George Bernard Shaw said the world has run raving mad on the subject of radium.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:31.580
 And of course, there was very famous the radium girls who are the people who worked in sort

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.300
 of 19, 19s.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:39.220
 And the radium girls were there and they had to paint radium onto clocks to make their hands

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.500
 glow in the dark and they would lick the paint brushes.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.980
 And so they would swallow a little bit of radium every single time they did that.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.740
 Which was extremely bad for them.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:48.740
 It turned out.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.740
 It was.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.740
 Still, they would paint like little messages on the teeth for the boyfriends and like their

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.260
 clothes would glow in the dark.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:00.380
 So when they went out clubbing or whatever they did in the 1920s, they would always wear

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.140
 the work clothes because it meant they shined in the night clothes.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.020
 They were like queuing glow sticks, dancing in the clubs, wow.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.220
 They were properly were glowers in one, so it was a big scandal by the 1920s.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.420
 They started dying and people realised it was probably because of all this radium.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.300
 And when they exhumed their bodies years later, they were still glowing from all this

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.620
 radium.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:19.620
 It was amazing.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.420
 And they'd open their cupboards in the morning and all their clothes are just glowing,

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.420
 absolutely bizarre.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.100
 And then of course, because they were getting very sick, there were lawsuits.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:32.340
 And it was due to a guy called Leonard Grossman who was a lawyer who worked pro bono for the

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:37.780
 whole time and it was after eight appeals that they managed to get the companies to admit

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.980
 that they were wrong and managed to get something back.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:46.100
 Although the last one, the last radium girl died at the age of 107, not so long ago, only

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.700
 in the last 20 years, I think.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.180
 But she quit within a week of working that because she hated the taste of the paint.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.180
 Yes.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:59.980
 She was counting herself lucky in 177 in 2014, but like they want to know, I suppose, and

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.460
 it must have been so exciting.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.340
 And also Uranium had the same thing when Uranium then became the thing and this was this

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.860
 other very, very dangerous, nuclear substance people got very into.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:14.060
 There was a time when hamburgers came with free shares in Uranium minds, like little happy

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.220
 meal, but it was a share in Uranium.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.220
 Really?

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.220
 Wow.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.220
 Yes.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.220
 There was some, right?

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.900
 You know, B-O-U-G-I-E, the sort of things.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.900
 Bougie.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.900
 Bougie.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.900
 Sorry.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.780
 There were radioactive bougies which were wax-covered rods to be inserted into the penis.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.700
 Sorry, I didn't know this word bougie until now, is that what it is?

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.700
 Bougie, yeah.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.420
 Well, there's a, there's a modern meaning of bougie which is a bit different, a bit different

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.420
 to that.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.420
 Is that what bougie nights?

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.420
 That movie's about.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:41.420
 Yeah, that's right.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.420
 Yeah.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.660
 It basically is about that, isn't it?

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.980
 Yeah, wow.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:53.380
 Some people said if you fed your chickens radium, then their eggs would incubate themselves.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.380
 Wow.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.980
 Not true.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:02.020
 We have, weirdly, you mentioned the curries early, so Mary, Mary Curie, she, she was in the

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.020
 news this year.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.580
 She's in our book, our new book.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.580
 She.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:10.380
 Yeah, because someone, it was her birthday and the cake arrived, surprise cake, they opened

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.660
 it up and on the cake was a drawing of Mary Curie.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.220
 And she was confused because she had no idea who it was.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.180
 It turns out that there was a mishearing over the phone.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:29.820
 What the parent had actually asked for was a cake of Mariah Carey and as a result, had this

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.860
 noble prize winner on her cake, no idea who it was.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.060
 All I want for Christmas is uranium.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:50.380
 So Mary Curie, Pierre, her husband died in a traffic accident, and then years later, she started

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:54.260
 dating again, and she had an affair with a married man, which was very scandalous at

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.260
 the time.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.980
 And it led to this huge course of love.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:02.820
 There were either two or five armed duels over this affair that she had.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.180
 And the wife of the man she was having the affair with, her name was Madame Long Van.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.260
 She had someone break into Curie's house and steal the love letters.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.300
 All of this about Mary Curie, noble prize winning, you know, and the letters were stolen,

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.940
 and then they were leaked to the press.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.060
 So suddenly this is a huge story.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:25.500
 And her lover, Paul Long Van, had a duel between him and a journalist who'd insulted him.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:31.140
 And there's a letter from Einstein to Mary Curie saying, don't worry about all this.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.140
 This is irrelevant.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.140
 Really?

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.140
 It's really cool.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:38.220
 Just before she won the Nobel Prize, so her Nobel Prize was slightly overshadowed by this

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.220
 huge story.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.220
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.220
 Three days before she was due to go and collect it, the story broke.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.460
 And they were saying, oh, maybe don't come and collect the Nobel Prize because this is scandalous.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.580
 But then Einstein wrote her a letter saying, forget all that, you've got the award.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.580
 Get the award.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.580
 Wow.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.220
 She used to be always called on to test the radiant products.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.660
 You know, you were saying at the start, James, that a lot of products called themselves

00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.660
 radio active.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.460
 But they didn't always have it in, is that right?

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.700
 Yeah, they very often just pretended and then put a bit of different glow in the dark stuff

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.700
 in it.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.460
 She would be called to verify that stuff contained radium that it, like, definitely was

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.460
 deadly, basically.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.980
 It would be like, my child's toy says it's radioactive.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.780
 Can you just check, Mary Curie, that it is?

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.460
 Do you be like, yep, definitely got lots of radium in it.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.460
 Wow.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.460
 Good luck to that kid.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.460
 Wow.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.660
 She actually fell on a little bit of hard times after a while and she didn't have enough

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.380
 radium to continue her research because radium was really, really expensive.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.980
 There's not much of it in the ground, so it's really hard to get.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:36.460
 So, there was a fundraising campaign led by American women and Curie traveled to the United

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:42.460
 States and she was presented with one gram of radium by President Warren Harding in 1921.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.460
 That's so cool.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.460
 A single gram.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.540
 Okay, and it doesn't sound like a lot of that, right?

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:55.980
 But it was cost them $100,000 for a single gram of radium and that at the time in 1921 was

00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:01.220
 about that average budget of a Hollywood movie.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.700
 You could make a whole movie.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.700
 That's so cool.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:04.700
 Isn't that amazing?

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.220
 They did, because when they were trying to refine it in the foot, like before they'd even

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.900
 discovered it, they were using a thing called pitch blend which is a kind of uranium

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.900
 ore.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.700
 And it's got the, it's got radium in it but it needs to be refined a lot.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.820
 They went through seven tons of pitch blend and they ended up with one gram of radium

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.460
 after all of that refining.

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.460
 That's incredible.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:30.300
 This is why there was a ballet dancer and choreographer called Lowie Fuller who in 1904 created

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.300
 the radium dance, which was a really famous dance at the time and she wanted all the ballerinas

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:39.460
 to be wearing head-to-toe costumes made entirely of radium.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.380
 She was sort of mates with Mary Curie and she wrote to her and said, can you make me a bunch

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.900
 of ballerinas dresses made entirely of radium?

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.620
 And thought, thank God, Mary Curie said, I'd absolutely love to.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.500
 It sounds like a great idea but it's just too expensive.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.140
 And so she had to make do with a slightly less glow in the dark other material and the ballerinas

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.980
 lived just the other day.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.460
 Have you heard of a magic radium massage?

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.460
 No.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.820
 This was a 30s product which is curious because if the radium girls were dying in the 1920s,

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.820
 then you would think...

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.100
 Well, this studies a lot of radium until sort of 40s and 50s I think.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.980
 Well, the magic radium massage, this ointment, when massaged into the sex parts, this is

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:18.140
 the other, acts as a healthy tonic and stimulant, tending to give firmness and strength to the

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.340
 organs.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.980
 It is especially effective for improving the circulation in the genital organs when they

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.580
 feel cold, clammy and lifeless.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.580
 Soon.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.500
 I mean, that is useful if you need to get up to go to the toilet of a night.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.500
 You just follow your car.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.500
 Where's...

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.220
 Where did I leave that penis?

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.220
 Yeah.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.220
 Okay.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:48.700
 It's time to move on to our final fact of the show.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.660
 That is Chazinski.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:56.500
 My fact this week is that the man who introduced chewing gum to the world had already been president

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.180
 of Mexico 11 times.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.180
 It's crazy.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.540
 It's a very strange career trajectory.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:10.020
 Of course, it's probably the most famous famous of Mexican ever, General Santa Anna in

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.020
 the 19th century.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.580
 He was president constantly.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:18.260
 He's sort of hated in three different, very specific places.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:22.660
 So the U.S. hate him, Mexicans hate him, and Texans hate him, and I know Texas is part of

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:27.460
 the U.S., but some people say that they don't, they pretend they aren't.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.460
 But yeah, he's...

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:33.340
 So he was at the back of Alamo and he was disgraced there because he was very, very brutal.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:38.220
 And then that was what led to the cries of remember the Alamo, which led to him and his

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.660
 troops being defeated at just interlater.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:45.660
 But anyway, he had lots of sort of military defeats and somehow they kept on making

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.620
 him president again, he kept on being exiled from the country.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:54.660
 And when he was finally exiled from Mexico permanently in 1869, he went to New Jersey and all

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.660
 he brought with him.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.380
 That's not the joke.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:04.860
 The joke is not, that's what you do when you hit a rock bottom.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:10.740
 Wow, you can just say New Jersey and I agree with you a lot.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.740
 It's good to know.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:17.980
 So he went to New Jersey and he brought with him as insurance a ton of this chicle gum which

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.220
 they all chewed in Mexico and the bloke he was living with said, "Oh, what's that gum?

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.220
 Can I try and make something out of it?

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.620
 I'm going to try and sell it."

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:29.500
 And he tried to make sort of tires out of it and toys out of it and masks and Wellington

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.500
 boots and none of it stuck, as it were.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.580
 And so eventually he saw Santa Anna chewing it one day and so he thought, "Okay, I'll

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.500
 try and sell it to people and tell them to chew on it."

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:44.280
 And they loved it and their chewing gum was born or popularised at least in the West.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.100
 He was quite amazing, wasn't he Santa Anna?

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:51.300
 So after the independence from Spain in 1821, basically a whole country just kept having

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:56.180
 these coups and counts of coups and whatever and he just kept reinventing himself to whoever

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.180
 was taking over.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.180
 He said, "Oh, I'm with these guys and then they would make him president."

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.460
 So at one stage he started off as conservative and then he became liberal, then he became

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:11.940
 Democrat and then he became a dictator and all those times, each time he became the president.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:17.220
 By way of comparison, Donald Trump started off as a Republican, became a member of the

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:23.500
 independence party, then was a Democrat and then was a Republican again, hasn't been a dictator.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.500
 Yeah.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:29.380
 Yeah, he's like, he just kept reinventing himself so he could get the power.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.380
 Yeah.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:31.380
 It's really amazing.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:37.940
 He didn't go to either of his own weddings.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.420
 He couldn't be bothered to turn up, basically, or he was travelling or busy or whatever.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.020
 So he just deputized someone by...

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.420
 Let me just say, you are about to get married.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.420
 Certainly, yeah.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.420
 It doesn't work that way.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.420
 Oh, no.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:54.740
 So he married twice, mostly for, we think for money, both times, because the women he was

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:59.220
 marrying had very large estates and he was in need of cash.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:06.060
 So the first wedding he had, he empowered his father-in-law to be as his proxy.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.060
 Oh.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:10.500
 So basically, her dad would walk up the aisle.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.500
 He could.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.500
 He gave her away to himself.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.500
 Basically, yeah.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.500
 Wow.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.460
 Do we know if he sort of jumped round the other side of her earlier?

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.460
 Yeah.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.460
 I've just put a different hat on myself.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.460
 Yeah.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.620
 He actually lost Texas to the US, possibly because he was having sex in a tent.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.620
 No.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:33.340
 So this is the tale is that, at the Battle of Jacinto, he was distracted by a Texan woman

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.980
 who, so it was a ploy on her part, she's sort of this folk hero.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.900
 And this is reported at the time by an English journalist.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.980
 And apparently, this Texan woman snuck into his tent and seduced him and shagged away.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.740
 And then he lost the battle while he was in the tent, not in charge of his troops.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.740
 And then had to leg it.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.220
 How long was that sex session that he lost?

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.060
 Well, the battle, the battle famously only took 18 minutes.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:59.300
 That's not too bad, didn't it?

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.900
 In my house.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.260
 My wife will be going to hear that, 18 minutes, he can do 18 minutes.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.140
 Dad, you could always use a proxy if you have to.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:17.260
 So it's okay, honey, your dad's on his way over at home.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.540
 Did he still have his leg at the time, that that happened?

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.260
 He did have his original leg at that time, yeah.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.700
 He, one of the other things he was famous for was losing a leg in a conflict called the

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.100
 pastry war, which was against French forces who had invaded Mexico.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.380
 I think that's why it's called that.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.060
 So he was wounded and he had his leg amputated.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:42.900
 And then four years later, as a kind of political move, he had it disinterred and he held a state

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.740
 funeral for his leg.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:45.900
 So he got to attend.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.060
 And it was a really fancy funeral.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:52.620
 So the leg got taken to the capital in a coach and there was a beautiful monument constructed

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:57.260
 and there was cannon fire and poems were read and then the leg was eventually re-buried.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:58.260
 Yeah.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:03.820
 How should is that for his wife that he shows up to a funeral for his leg, but not to his own

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:04.820
 wedding?

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:10.740
 But then on the bright side per two years after he'd done that, it was exhumed again by his

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.820
 opponents and dragged through the streets with people chanting death to the cripple.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.580
 So yeah, he was obsessed with this leg.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.620
 He used to sort of like before he'd even done the big state funeral, he used to carry it

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.540
 around waving it above him in parade.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.540
 Really?

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.900
 And he gave it two funerals.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:32.460
 He gave it a small funeral on his little hacienda before the big one when it first got lost.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.820
 He was always reminding people, like one of these really annoying, like you couldn't,

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.500
 you'd always let it drop into conversation.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.980
 But the pastry world, do you know why it was called that specifically?

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.980
 No, I don't.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:47.340
 It is related to the French thing, but it's specifically because there was one French

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:53.500
 pastry cafe in Mexico and it was owed a big debt by the government and it wasn't being

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.500
 paid.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.860
 And so this pastry chef called the French government and said, "Mexico has me all this money,

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.380
 it's not paying."

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.060
 And so it got a bit out of hand and war happened.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.060
 Oh, man.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.140
 Because of that.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:12.460
 The French ended up really overreacting, so they tried them up and said they owe me an arm

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.460
 in a leg.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:21.220
 They negotiated down to half of that.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.540
 You know, you can visit his leg in Illinois.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.540
 Yes.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.540
 Well, his fake leg.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.940
 It's in a museum in Illinois.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:33.980
 And there's like a chicken dinner there as well because supposedly he was eating chicken

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.500
 at the time, so it sort of like sets the same thing up.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.980
 So when you say his fake leg, you mean this prosthesis?

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:38.980
 Yeah.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:39.980
 Yeah, exactly.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:44.420
 And then someone galloped off away when he wasn't looking, took his leg and it's now in Illinois.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.420
 It's been there for years.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.420
 Yes.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.420
 So this was another fight.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.220
 This was the later battle that he actually lost, wasn't it?

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.220
 Yeah.

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.220
 When he had the prosthetic leg.

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:55.220
 And as you say, he was eating a chicken dinner in his tent and-

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.700
 The battle was lost again.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.700
 He really lingered over it.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.220
 He spent about 20 minutes eating the chicken, yeah.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.220
 Disaster.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.540
 It was going to have to stay out of tents.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.700
 I always think it's really weird, though, because in that thing where the soldiers came

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.980
 along and they took his leg and they also took $18,000 and the chicken dinner.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.180
 But everyone that always talks about the chicken dinner.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.180
 Yeah.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.180
 That's true.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.180
 It's so weird.

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:20.180
 And then he got another leg, the knee.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.180
 He got a peg leg.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.180
 Yeah.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.660
 And so just a piece of wood for a prosthesis.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.660
 And then that got stolen as well.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:26.660
 Oh.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.660
 Yeah.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:31.220
 It got stolen and was reportedly later used by Lieutenant Abner double day as a baseball bat.

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:32.220
 Wow.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.220
 Wow.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:37.140
 Hey, so this fact was also about the fact that he introduced chewing gum to the world.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.140
 Oh, yes.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.060
 I mentioned a couple of chewing gum things I found.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.660
 So chewing gum, obviously we had chewing gum that was around for a while.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.860
 And then bubble gum arrived and bubble gum was invented in Philadelphia.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.860
 Yeah.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.860
 How cool is that?

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.860
 Did you guys know that?

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:53.860
 Probably.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:54.860
 You didn't know that.

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.860
 Okay.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.860
 So bubble gum was invented here.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.540
 It was by a guy called Frank H. Fleer, although he didn't invent bubble gum itself.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.620
 So double bubble was the first ever bubble gum that came out.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.620
 You guys.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:05.620
 What?

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:06.620
 Yeah.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:07.620
 There was no bubble before.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.140
 No, chewing gum was just chewed.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.980
 And then he was like, let's take a bit.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.340
 He went straight to double bubble gum.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.340
 There's no single bubble.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.340
 Oh, I see.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.340
 Well, no, no.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.700
 There was a prototype which didn't work, yeah.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.740
 So he's not the inventor of double bubble.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.540
 He is the inventor of its prototype, blibber blibber.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:26.540
 Stop.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.540
 Absolutely true.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.660
 Blibber blibber was the original bubble gum that he invented.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.340
 But unfortunately, it didn't quite work out.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.580
 So the problem was, is when you blew the bubble, no one could say it for a start.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.580
 Blibber blibber.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.580
 Blibber blibber.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.580
 Blibber blibber.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.580
 So, yeah.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.580
 So Frank H. Fleer.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.580
 So the problem was, is that you would blow the bubble, it would pop, and it would go all

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.580
 of your face.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:51.820
 But the stickiness of it was too much that you needed a solvent to actually take it off

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.380
 your face.

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:58.140
 So when he was marketing it initially, it was with this little product that would make

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.140
 sure that it would come up.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.140
 So it didn't work out.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.500
 Never sold, never made it actually to shops.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:07.140
 But instead, then someone who was working for him said, let's take it differently.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.460
 And that's how we have double bubble.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.460
 Wow.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.460
 That's great.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.460
 So when was that?

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.260
 This was 1906, that he posted this, yeah.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:19.420
 Because there was one other claimant to the invention of bubble gum, who is Waldo Seaman,

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:20.420
 who...

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.420
 Wow.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.420
 What did he call his?

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.700
 And I didn't go down very well.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.700
 I don't...

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.580
 With chewing gum, make sure you never swallow.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.540
 That's what I'm saying.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.700
 So Mr... Mr Seaman was...

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.700
 Waldo Seaman.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:38.700
 Working for a entire company.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.700
 Where's Waldo?

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.700
 Which Waldo?

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:49.700
 That's a much more difficult and more adult version of the purchase than that.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:59.620
 He's easier to spot though, you turn the lights off, you shine and don't look glows in the dark.

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:05.300
 That's the best UV Seaman Wesley bubble gum joke that's ever been made.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.940
 That's the only one.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:08.940
 No.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:09.940
 Top 10.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.620
 Anyway, he was a very serious guy wanting to be taken seriously.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:18.380
 His business was in making plastics and rubber and polymers, and he worked for a tyre company.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:21.740
 And so when he made this thing that blew bubbles, the tyre company thought, well, that's

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:22.740
 a huge defect.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:27.420
 We don't want tyres that are bubbles, so just stop making it.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.060
 And so he had to stop making it.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.780
 But interestingly, did you know that tyre manufacturers, Goodya Tire and Rubber, for instance,

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:38.020
 are the biggest provider of the rubber core of chewing gum today?

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:39.020
 Is it?

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.020
 Yeah, of course.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.020
 It's a bit of a tyre in it.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.340
 Because it's not made out of that chickly stuff anymore, it's made out of, like, petrochemicals,

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.340
 basically chewing gum.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.340
 Yeah, essentially.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.340
 Yeah.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.820
 It's made out of kind of rubber in the middle of it.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.820
 That's amazing.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.820
 Yeah.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:54.180
 So actually, when cars drive over the road, they should be able to just pick up the chewing

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.420
 gum and just become part of the tyre.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:57.420
 Oh, yeah.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:00.780
 And eventually, you just have a massively high car.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.780
 Yeah.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:02.780
 Yeah.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:06.140
 The ancient Greeks had chewing gum, a kind of chewing gum, yeah.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.980
 So as you say, it was popularized when it became nice.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:13.940
 But the ancient Greeks were going around chewing mastic gum, sometimes, that was a thing.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:18.540
 And it was really horrible back in the old days because it used to be made with paraffin.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.900
 So it's very bitter and very, you know, brittle and unwholesome.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.940
 The one thing that you might do, if you had some paraffin chewing gum, is you'd have

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.700
 a plate of sugar next to you, and you just have to repeatedly take it out of your mouth,

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.780
 dip it in the sugar and put it back in.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.780
 Oh, nice.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:33.780
 Yeah.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:34.780
 Is that all right?

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:35.780
 No, not that.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.780
 Not like that.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.860
 I've explained it wrong.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.460
 We're going to have to move on in a second.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.460
 Oh, one more thing about chewing gum.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:44.460
 Yeah.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.020
 The University of Copenhagen is currently working on fertility chewing gum.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.020
 So...

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:55.900
 Is this another Waldo Seaman invention?

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:03.620
 It's the second best Waldo Seaman bubble gum based.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:10.260
 No, it's for women to chew so that you know where you are in your menstrual cycles.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:15.980
 So if you chew it, it reacts with the, I guess, the enzymes in your saliva, and it turns

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.780
 a particular colour depending on how far along you are and whether you're in the perfect

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:20.780
 time to consume.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.460
 But then do you have to keep pulling it out of your mouth and looking at it and then

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.980
 putting it back in again?

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:26.980
 I think there's a...

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.780
 Well, you have to take it out at least once, yeah.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.980
 But that is cool.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:32.980
 It's...

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:33.980
 Yes, it is.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.340
 If it happens, that's going to be great.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:40.300
 In 1904, they had a big craze in America of chewing gum parties.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.300
 Cool.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.140
 And the idea of what you would do there is you would, each guest would come along with

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.820
 a big pack of chewing gum, actually lots of packs, and then everyone would sit around

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:51.740
 and chew their chewing gum until it was soft, and then they'd put it on a plate and

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.260
 they would sculpt it into things.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.260
 Cool.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.260
 And that was the game.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.260
 That's kind of fun.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.260
 I thought you were going to say that.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.260
 This audience doesn't seem to think it's much fun.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.260
 Oh.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.260
 Wow.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.260
 Philadelphia is a bit too good for that, apparently.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.260
 Okay.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.260
 Let's wrap up.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.260
 Okay.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.260
 That is it.

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.260
 That is all of our facts.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:16.900
