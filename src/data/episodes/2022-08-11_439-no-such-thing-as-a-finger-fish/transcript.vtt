 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.840
 you from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here with Anna

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.440
 Tyshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go!

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.240
 Starting with fact number one and that is Andy. My fact is that there's a theory that the Bronte

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.280
 sisters all died young because they spent a lot of their life drinking graveyard water.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.200
 [Music]

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.280
 You said graveyard water as though we're all familiar with it. It's like spring water.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.080
 You've all seen it on the shutters but still sparking.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.960
 [Laughter]

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.880
 Yeah, well no, you're right. It's not a thing anymore but I think graveyard water was a much

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.240
 bigger thing in the 19th century before proper hygiene standards and before proper

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.880
 you know water piping. So this is water that has happened to go through a graveyard.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.840
 It's filtered, yeah it's filtered. Whenever you buy a bottle of water and it says filtered,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.320
 that's what it means. No, so they lived in this town called Howarth which is in West Yorkshire

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.480
 and it was an extremely sickly place. Very low life expectancy, excellent running down the streets.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.320
 I mean, you know, bad ventilation. You said it was Yorkshire. Sorry, yeah, okay.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.240
 And also the Bronte family home, the pass nearer to they lived in, right next to it had a graveyard

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:51.920
 and there there is a whoo-hoo and there it was very overcrowded as well and there is a strong

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.640
 theory or a strong suggestion it's possible that decomposing matter from the graveyard

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.720
 would have filtered into the water supply and that might have really bandjacked the town's

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.360
 overall health. Those who were using kind of public water sources. Yeah, it definitely would have gone

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.680
 into the village which is in like a valley. But yeah, and presumably there weren't taps back

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.040
 then so they must have been collecting water from somewhere. So they lived in the past niche and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.160
 they had their own well. Yes, okay. And what I find really interesting is that the well was cleaned

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.360
 in 1847 and that was the first time it had been cleaned in 20 years and the father of the Bronte's

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.080
 wrote that they'd taken eight yellow tin cans out of it. That's how polluted it was. But it was in

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:44.160
 1848 and 1849 that Bramwell, Emily and Anne all died so the year afterwards. So the year after

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.080
 their well was out of use perhaps. Right. So maybe they stopped using the well for a bit and then

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.080
 they started using the more common water that everyone else was drinking and then that might

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.160
 have made them sick. Did they not think when they were drinking something that looked like Gatorade

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.120
 that maybe, maybe that wasn't going to be good for them. If it's the only thing you can drink. Yeah,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.480
 really. What do you do? We actually say the Bronte's died young but you know they lived

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.560
 to ripe old ages by comparison. Did they? Well, I mean not really. They lived to 29, 30, 31 and

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.760
 39. Exactly. The average life expectancy obviously one has to account for the 40% of people who die

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.680
 in early childhood. But yeah, it was 25. And I reckon Charlotte at 38 would have seemed like

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.560
 an old hag by the time she copped it. But yeah, all the others did die pretty young except their

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.600
 dad who lived to 84 while all died. It was a very sickly place and the town was inspected in 1850

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.200
 by a man who was called Benjamin Herschel Babbage and his findings basically were that it was just

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.320
 an extremely unhealthy place. It was poorly ventilated. Some people were living in cellars.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.360
 And it was their dad actually who got this guy in to check the water supply. So it was the year

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.080
 after three of his children had died and he said we need to do something about this. Do you think

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.000
 after the first child died he was like oh I must get this water checked and then the second kid

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.320
 dies he's like damn it I really must get this water check. Well the first one was Bramwell who

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.720
 died of alcoholism. Yes. Actually he had two daughters who died before that. So they had two

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.200
 daughters who died like 14, 15 didn't they which sounds very which is very sad. And they were in

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.440
 the school which was right at the bottom of the hill where the water definitely would have been

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.960
 pretty rank. But Bramwell died of alcoholism but the pub where he drank in is the first place you

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.040
 get to after if you look at the map it's house graveyard pub and apparently they used to make

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.360
 their beer out of the water. So is it possible then that we've maligned him and he didn't die of

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.760
 alcoholism. Well he definitely wasn't alcoholic as well. I think people do say that he might have

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.880
 died of TB and he was an alcoholic but you know he might have died of other stuff as well. So we

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.080
 might have unfairly maligned him. There was opium involved as well I think. It was a concoction

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.760
 of stuff. He wasn't living a very healthy life. I'd say that. But it's always said that alcoholism

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.320
 during you know not the graveyard order. Yeah I am with Dan here. I actually think that the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.920
 Bramwell myth may have been you know taken to the extreme of like this killed him and actually

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.400
 I'm not sure we totally have evidence. But Babbage's report was funny. He was particularly appalled

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.480
 by the toilet setup in the village which was consisted of two toilets that were shared each

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.240
 by like 12 families. So they were out in the street and he was appalled by the public view of them

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.120
 which I don't think contributes to people's ill health. You might do. That people could see you

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.440
 while you're pooing. Yeah he basically said there's in fact he said there's two toilets that are just

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.000
 on the public street in view of the houses and of passes by whilst a third is perched upon an

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.360
 eminence commanding the whole length of the main street. Have you ever been like have you ever been

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.600
 to like a restaurant or something that's on the top of a really high building and then sometimes

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.320
 they put the toilet and they have pretty much a window because there's nothing else can look in

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.600
 and you can poo and look out over the whole city. No I've never seen that. I can't remember where I've

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.600
 been and done that but it's really it's something it's quite something. It sounds quite uncommon.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.480
 You said it is though it might be a standard thing in high buildings but I'm not sure it's normal.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:09.360
 No actually no my local Greg's has one of those. You could sit in Greg's and as an eminence over

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.240
 the whole of South London. So the the brontes in general they're putting them back together in a

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.680
 way. Pretty much so basically all the contents of the house were sold off after Patrick who's the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.160
 father pop Bronte he died in 1861 and all the contents were sold off because you know you

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.760
 have a new person who comes in and the furniture changes. Because he was a was a curate vicar

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.880
 priestee guide not a priest because he has six children but the Bronte society they've been

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.320
 putting the house back together which is very exciting and they've been slowly slowly buying

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.680
 an auction various bits of Bronte paraphernalia so there was a table that they wrote at one

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.200
 kind of normal medium-sized darkwood table 580 000 pounds it's been bought.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.360
 But did they all write on this table? I think a lot of them did. I don't know if any key works

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.280
 would definitely pinned on that table but it was the writing table. Do you think that's a big table?

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.880
 Yeah do you think like as a writer that you are and we all are really do you think that really now

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.280
 we should get actually quite a nice ornate table because in the future they're gonna look at it and

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.640
 go on that table from Ikea was like yeah what's the point of putting that in a museum? Exactly I

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.480
 like Terry Pratchett's table where he wrote most of his novels as soon as he passed away his assistant

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.560
 Rob put a glass plate over the table so that every single scuff mark every single you know mug

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.560
 wear and yeah it's there now for all time. It's a great idea. It's like chewing them underneath.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.000
 Another really cool item I don't know if it was at auction that they had to buy it back or

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.320
 whether they just still have it but Charlotte Bronte was given a bit of Napoleon's coffin

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.360
 which is really cool. How did they get his coffin? He was dead. Oh yeah. Because he had about seven

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.360
 coffins I think Napoleon he was inside multiple layers. Like a Russian doll. Like a Russian doll

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.280
 yeah yeah he's there was a small coffin. It's quite awkward for Napoleon as a poor guy. Do you mean like

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:09.760
 a French pastry or something? Did you say Charlotte got Napoleon's coffin? Yeah yeah from her sexy

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.440
 Belgian tutor who she was in love with. Really? He was a married man so I don't think any impropriety

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.240
 ever occurred but she she loved him and they had quite a good friendship as well so yeah.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.520
 Because she wasn't the big Napoleon fan this is the great thing about the Bronte is when they were

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.480
 younger they actually wrote more words than when they were adults because they wrote these amazing

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.720
 books together these fairy tales and they were they created worlds they created the world of

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.120
 angrier and gondol and I think this was based on some toy soldiers that

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.120
 Bramwell got given by their dad but they all played with them and they all claimed a soldier

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.080
 and Emily claimed Wellington and then Bramwell claimed Napoleon and they'd sort of like fight

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.280
 each other and stuff and then the other two claimed a gravy boy and a waiting boy but I think they

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.640
 upgraded them at some point to the Antarctic explorers Paris and Ross. A gravy boy? A gravy boy

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.600
 yeah. Again just like I said gravy had water like it was a thing. I don't think a gravy boy is a thing.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.360
 You know in American football they have a water boy who brings on all of their drinks and stuff.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:15.120
 But I do now yeah. Well gravy boy is the same in cricket. On your cucumber sandwiches. Yeah yeah

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.960
 she's bringing some gravy. Was she quite obsessed with Wellington, Emily? I don't know how obsessed

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:26.400
 she was. She probably was. I think she was and I think she met him later in life in like his late

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.320
 life. Napoleon was buried in a lot of coffins like a beef Wellington. Yeah, wasn't he? That's

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:38.080
 even worse. Doesn't make sense. Beef Wellington doesn't have multiple pastry layers. Puff pastry.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.440
 I suppose it is it is layered. It's got a layer of mushrooms and stuff. Yeah he was covered in duck

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:51.040
 cells. Just on their on their writing as kids and the cool stuff that they had. I don't know if

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.680
 any of these remain but they wrote in tiny books sometimes. So some of their stories they wrote

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.760
 in books that were small enough for their dolls or their soldiers to read. Which sounds so cool.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.440
 The writing is microscopic and I think there was one book that in fact we do have some of them because

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.640
 there are photos and they're about like the size of the thumb, human thumb really. We know there's

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.360
 one because actually the Bronte house has bought one of them back. Have they million pounds? The

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.600
 tiny book or the tiny book? I don't know. I have no idea how they're funding it. Oh actually I do

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:27.200
 know how they might be funding it because the actual Bronte's themselves were funded indirectly

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:33.760
 through piracy. So wait so Grandpa Bronte he was a trader but also he had plenty of dealings with

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.000
 Cornish pirates who committed actual murders and a lot of his money a lot of his estate would have

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.560
 come from his nefarious activities and the Bronte sisters paid for their novels to be published

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.640
 and they did a lot of that thanks to money they got from their aunt on that side of the family.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.040
 So basically they were pirate funded. So you're saying that the current Bronte estate has some

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.440
 sort of treasure chest that they're still taking book liens out of. Where are they getting these

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.160
 millions from? They pay for anything in doubloons if you notice that for the auctions. I read an

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.120
 article about the Bronte society who run the museum. I don't know if it's the same people

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:11.520
 but apparently they made a loss last year of £100,000 and actually because not many people

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:17.520
 have been visiting I think possibly due to Covid they've been asking firms in the UK who use the

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.240
 name Bronte they're saying well you know okay fine you're allowed to use nothing we can do but

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.960
 can you not give us a bit of money for it. And Richard Wilcox who's the chairman of the Bronte

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:33.840
 society he said there are dozens of companies who are selling Bronte stone cooked chicken

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.360
 outdoor clothing. Have you never had a Bronte chicken? Bronte fried chicken it's lovely it's

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.720
 been uh how's it cooked it's sort of they leave it on a moor for three days. Yeah it's very moorish

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:52.640
 and also spring water and what I found is that there is Bronte water that you can buy from the

00:11:52.640 --> 00:12:00.080
 springs in Howarth. No we've ruined their industry with this podcast. And I just want to kind of

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.760
 balance it out to say that they are part of a company called Waterlogic UK and they recently

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.520
 announced the world's first Covid secure range of drinking water dispensers. Okay actually weirdly

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.880
 the Bronte society themselves just on Bronte merch they do they sell a Branwell Bronte I think it's a

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:25.920
 wine bottle stopper or a corkscrew but given that he died of alcoholism. I wonder if they get a cut

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.600
 from all the companies then that are in this town where they grew up. Well that's what they're saying

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.960
 they don't and at the moment there's no legal reason that they should. Because they've really

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.040
 come for it haven't they like all the salons are like Jane Hare you know and stuff like just like

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:47.280
 I love that so Charlotte Bronte was a teacher and in 1836 she started writing about her

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:53.360
 experience as a teacher and she's just so mean to the students it's amazing there's one extract which

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:59.120
 says am I to spend all the best part of my life in this wretched bondage forcibly suppressing my

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:05.680
 rage at the idleness the apathy and the hyperbolical and most asinine stupidity of those fat-headed

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.400
 oats. Wow like she did not like her kids. Teachers listening to this are nodding as well right

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.160
 now. Is that Emily? That was Charlotte. Charlotte sorry sorry. I have a theory about Bramwell Bronte

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:26.240
 which is that he inspired a very famous film okay it's um to do with his okay no no I'm going to

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.680
 give you a clue first otherwise I don't think you'll get there. Did he want to stop someone and his

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.040
 mum shot someone? Yeah. Oh Jesus Christ okay you only know two films between you. Andy knows.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:42.080
 It's Avatar. It's Avatar. So it's what yeah yeah. He was green. Yeah yeah. Lou. I was thinking of the Hulk.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:49.920
 No so he um he basically had this affair we think um and this is partly based on the biography of

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.480
 Charlotte that was written by Mrs Gaskell very interestingly so Patrick the dad commissioned

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.600
 Mrs Gaskell to write. Who we should say Charlotte. Famous author, famous British author. Did she

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.400
 have a first name? Elizabeth but she always goes by Mrs. Bizarrely snobbish about that like when

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.200
 she wrote to George Elliott once she said um love love your stuff George but I wish I could be

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.000
 addressing a Mrs rather than a miss. Just a bit. Given that she was writing to someone trading under

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.520
 a man's name. Yeah. An insane thing to say. And also don't upset George Elliott because you're

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.080
 going to get a big right hand. She'll have that you and you will not come back from that.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:31.520
 But anyway what we think is that Brownwell had an affair with this much older woman. He was 25

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.960
 and she was 43 and he was working as a governess not a governess. A governess. A governess. A

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:43.840
 tutor for her children. Mrs Doubtfire. Exactly. I really thought you were going to get it there.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:52.320
 You know it. So she's called Lydia Robinson and that's Brownwell Bronte as the initials are BB

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.480
 and in the film the very famous film The Graduate obviously where Mrs Robinson is the older woman

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:03.120
 who seduces a younger man. It's Benjamin Braddock initials BB. Okay. And the author of the original

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.400
 book I don't think ever commented on whether it was inspired by that but it was a famous affair

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:14.400
 between an old woman. Charlotte had a superpower by the way. Oh yeah. She could see in the dark

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.480
 how cool is that. Well in the absolute pitch dark. Yeah basically I mean that was there's stories

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.480
 that she was short-sighted so short-sighted that if she was trying to even play piano she couldn't

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.600
 read the sheet music it was that it was that bad for her. But as soon as the lights went out as soon

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.600
 as it was night time her students said that she could read perfectly what was on the page

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:41.760
 when no one else could. Right. Okay. It's good fact. It's a great fact. Thank you. We don't

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.000
 acknowledge each other's facts that often on the show but a truly good one comes up I'm glad

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.440
 we did. It sounds like she was an inspiring teacher who you know. A lot of people said this.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.840
 Taught her kids an imaginative story. No she could she could do. No. I think actually I do

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:01.520
 by that because I know that Anne the youngest of the sisters she could hear things over 300 miles

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:07.440
 away. She could bring metal to her. And then their green brother Bramwell only when he got angry

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:19.440
 destroy everything. Okay it is time for fact number two and that is James. Okay my fact this week

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:27.040
 is that if you swim too close to an iceberg you can get sucked in. Not in danger of it. Not one of

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.680
 my top worries I don't think. It's worth remembering you never know when you might find yourself in

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:37.600
 that situation Anna. You're right on Titanic too or something. So yeah how do they do that? Do they

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.960
 generate their own currents near them? They do not. In a way they generate their own currents.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.880
 They're moving around a lot. They're changing a lot. Icebergs are melting all the time.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.640
 Lots of changes inside an iceberg and I'm especially talking about very big ones and when

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:58.800
 things are moving around currents get formed and that's what happened. And I read this in I was

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.480
 basically going through some old archives of an NPR radio show called Only a Game and I found this

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:11.760
 article from 2001 about someone called Jill Hyneth and she is one of the most remarkable people I've

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:18.640
 ever come across in the 20 years I've done this job. She was the first person to swim inside of

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:24.480
 an iceberg. There was a massive one that carved off from Antarctica. It was about the size of Jamaica

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.320
 and she and her partner went to National Geographic and said we'd like to do this article about

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.200
 diving through the caves of icebergs and they said wow really there are caves in icebergs and

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:42.240
 they went we think so and sure enough they got some funding and they went and did it and the story

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:50.320
 of her going through this iceberg is remarkable. My wife's gone to swim in an iceberg the size of

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:59.680
 a Caribbean island. Jamaica? Yes. Extraordinarily she went up her own accord. Completely bizarre

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:07.440
 decision. Yeah it sounds absolutely incredible doesn't it and some quite dodgy moments in there.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:13.360
 Every moment, every moment is dodgy in there. Yeah so first of all they are next to this massive

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.600
 iceberg and they jump into the water and the first thing that happens is you're jumping into

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.520
 ice cold water and I don't know I'm sure some of you might have done that before it really hits

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:27.040
 you hard and it can really take the breath out of you but in her case she said it's like an ice cream

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.520
 headache like the worst ice cream headache you've ever had is the first thing that you feel and then

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.560
 you go down and down and down and you see an entrance and you enter this iceberg and it's

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:42.400
 all blue like she says it's like a robin's egg the floor's red and orange and yellow all these

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:50.480
 amazing colors and then everything goes wrong. And so she and her partner they're swimming through it

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.880
 and after a while of taking lots of video footage they turn around to go back out

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.760
 but because it's a melting iceberg because it's a living beast that's just changing shape all the

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:05.680
 times their exit shuts and they're stuck inside the iceberg and she's going I'm trying not to

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.240
 panic because if I start breathing too heavily every breath I take is a precious breath. Every

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:18.000
 movie you make. Every movie you make. No one's watching her. So frightening. And so she they

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.760
 just wait they patiently wait and then a new opening happens it's like a weird mirror labyrinth

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.480
 you know like something you would see in a weird fantasy movie a new opening happens and they

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.880
 manage to get out and then they just have to wait a while to acclimatize don't they you can't just

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.640
 go straight back up so. And so the people on the boat are thinking well they're gone yeah because

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.880
 they've heard all these changes and this carving and bits have fallen off the people on the boat

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.280
 are like well that's the end of them then. Yeah but then they come back up they go up they tell

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.240
 their story it's all going nice you'd think that's enough we've explored it they go let's get back in

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.800
 there let's do it again so they go for a second time. Well what are the chances of that going

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.400
 wrong again? Exactly. I mean it's not going to happen twice is it? Yeah it sounded like even

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.040
 there was a scary moment at one point on this expedition when she resurfaced and the boat I

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:08.000
 think had drifted and she came up through a hole in the ice but the ice around her was so high she

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.760
 couldn't see anything and you're in the middle of the Antarctic and her boat disappeared and I

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.840
 think the boat just happened to swing around she just glimpsed the stern. It's because they had to

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:23.200
 take the anchor up and so it drifted while the anchor was up so they're nearly lost at sea basically

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.960
 in this moment so they get back on the boat and you think all right let's get back to home. Don't

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.000
 go back a third time. They go a third time they go a third time and this time they get stuck inside

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.080
 and in order to get out she basically got up to a point in the iceberg where there was a there

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.840
 was a gap at the top for them to climb out but it was 130 feet above their heads so you're looking

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.680
 at a climbing wall basically that's unclimbable except yes and I couldn't quite get it because

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.320
 she's out of the water by this time so she's just climbing up the iceberg. So she must be inside of

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:56.880
 the iceberg where there's a hole on the inside. It's like a triathlon kind of thing you know you

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.600
 do the swimming bit and then you do the climbing bit. When do you do the cycling bit? There's a

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.280
 bike at the top of the iceberg. But this is where the story genuinely turns a bit Brian blessedy

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.840
 for me because I just think this is impossible. So she climbs up 130 feet. But here's the thing

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.160
 right this is solid ice wall right so how do you climb ice wall and she thinks to herself hang on

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.560
 there's little animals that burrow themselves into the ice wall which are creating natural

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.760
 handholds for me to do and apparently there's enough of these that she could scale 130. So it's

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.520
 a little fish exactly the size of her finger which makes a little hole where it lives. The fish finger

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:37.280
 yeah well the finger fish yeah yeah yeah and they make holes in the ice bag and she can use them to

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.800
 grip onto and pull herself up. So she climbs up yeah I know it's blessed this is suddenly all the way up

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.800
 all the way 130 feet. The fish living 100 feet up on the iceberg. 130. How did they get up there?

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.280
 Who no I guess if the previous fish have gone up there. Icebergs flip over all the time.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.360
 Yeah don't know do we think what has there been cracks in the iceberg? Oh there's some cracks in

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:03.120
 her story. And they all climb out this way 130 feet up and then they're back on the boat and

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:09.200
 then they slip down the iceberg. And so they're sitting on the boat not long afterwards I think

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.600
 they're having some drinks and some food and then suddenly they just hear screaming from other people

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.200
 on the boat and there's huge cracking noises and basically there's been such a melting point on

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.240
 the iceberg that it cracks in on itself and they go well if we were in there we'd be dead we'd be

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:31.840
 squished in a second so then they go back again no they don't. But what a story. Yeah it is quite

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.120
 quite an odd thing to choose to do with your life. You must have to have a very unusual

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.680
 personality not to panic in all of these circumstances like she did one other dive

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.680
 which she described and it was into a really really small cave so she's a cave diver

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.400
 basically so underwater cave diver and she was taking a scientist down there with her who obviously

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:59.440
 had been trained properly how to dive but the scientist got wedged in this tiny cave and panicked.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:05.600
 Luckily a tiny fish came and nibbled her out. And it was a really nice story because earlier

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:11.440
 in the dive she had found that fish and it had a thorn in its fin yes and she pulled the thorn out

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.080
 and then the fish came back to help her. Yeah okay it's not a Bronte novel it's this is a real life.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.800
 So she's wedged? She's wedged and they have a guideline which is the only way you can find your

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.360
 way back to the entrance of the cave because you know it's full of other channels and tunnels and

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.360
 stuff so you'll never find your way back otherwise. The guideline's broken which is the only thing to

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.600
 lead them back to the entrance somehow and I'm not quite sure how Jill does this while she's

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:39.280
 trying to fix the guideline she loses her partner who was previously wedged in a rock.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.840
 Yeah seems careless a bit of an oversight so she spends 73 minutes desperately looking

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.600
 for her partner while trapped in this cave no idea if she's gonna escape. That's extraordinary.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.040
 And also thinking oh god I've killed this scientist how awkward. But imagine the moment and maybe it's

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.120
 all worth it for this when finally she realized she has not only found her way to the entrance

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.000
 but she sees a little glimpse of light but there is wasting at the entrance the scientists who

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.480
 apparently her mask is just full of tears because the scientists assume that Jill's dead and she's

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:12.160
 probably gonna die too waiting at the entrance for her and that's amazing. She was all right and she

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.240
 said the weirdest thoughts go through your head like when she thought she was gonna die you think

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.560
 things like oh my god I have to get home then my husband doesn't know how to do the taxes.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:30.000
 Wow that's an amazing story and also it's given me a new respect for the word guideline. Yeah

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.080
 you know we're so used to hearing about the conceptual guidelines the theoretical ones.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.160
 Government guidelines suggest. Yeah exactly and actually guidelines can save your life.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.520
 I was reading about what Heinearth studies in the other areas of life because loads of loads of

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:50.000
 cave diving particularly and have you guys heard of the Hallow Cline? No. So she studies animals

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.160
 which are often found beneath the Hallow Cline and the Hallow Cline is a boundary between fresh

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.880
 water which is higher up and salt water which is lower down and she says the boundary layer is as

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:07.040
 thin as a sheet of paper but you can also see it when you're in the cave when you dive. So as you

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:13.280
 go through it everything goes blurry for a second because you've broken the barrier between the two

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.120
 kinds of water. Like going through a mirror which takes you to a parallel universe. It's exactly

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.360
 like that it's exactly like that and then as soon as you get down to the salt water everything snaps

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.200
 back into perfect clarity of focus and you look up and you can see the Hallow Cline above you.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:31.200
 But you meet the salt water version of yourself on the other side upside down. Yes yes yes and

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:41.040
 then you have to climb using fishy ice hulls downwards. Early cave divers. The first UK cave

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:47.360
 diver was in 1935 and potentially this is the first world cave dive. Quite late. That's what I

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.680
 thought right? I read in a few places this was the world's first cave diving and then a few others

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.520
 first UK. It happened at Wookie Hall and it was a lady called Penelope Powell and she did it with

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.280
 a guy called Graham Balkam. I think that yeah I think it is in the UK because you find lots of

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.720
 accounts of other people trying similar things around the world and usually you just attach a

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.640
 hose to yourself and go deep in but definitely in Britain and it's thought of as the birth of

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:15.440
 cave diving. Yeah it's like a proper sport basically. Yeah so Balkam actually tried going into a

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:21.520
 different cave first and he made his own massively long snorkel out of a hose pipe and a woman's

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:29.040
 bike frame and he almost died because that didn't work very well. So they upgraded their gear in

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.960
 fact when he went down with Penelope Mossy Powell as she was called but it was... Sorry sorry let's

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:41.280
 just go back to that a second. Penelope Powell her nickname was Mossy. Mossy? And is she a singer?

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:47.840
 Her nickname was the thirties. Mossy Powell wow. Do we know why she had the nickname? She had just

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:54.080
 hair on the southern side of her body. I'm not sure but I know that you would have gone along

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:59.280
 very well with me. Anyway they then at that point would have a hard hat and that would be attached

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.760
 to this hose called the Divers Umbilical which is a basically a combined breathing hose and phone

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.320
 so that you could communicate with the surface. So they went into a hole and they went you know

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:14.800
 many many chambers in a long way 170 foot they went in and the air pumps have to be manually

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.280
 operated at the surface so they were actually broadcasting on local radio. I don't know why

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:26.480
 they didn't make this national. Only local. We'll be right back with Wet Let Wet. You can tune in in

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:33.040
 the Cheddar Gorge area it was an exciting time. Anyway so they were broadcast but their air would

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.760
 only last about 50 seconds so they'd be saying it was Mosley Graham who did the talking to the

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.080
 surface and then about every 50 seconds he'd have to say actually could I get some more air please

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.560
 and then the people at the surface would have to pump air in. Just one more thing on the Wookie

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:52.640
 Hole expedition you can actually see a painting that was done 84 years after the actual event

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.440
 occurred and it was done by a guy who's called Philip Gray and he's an artist and he went down

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:04.000
 into the place where she went so he dove down with his with his painting equipment and a light

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.080
 and he did the painting down there it's the first of its kind. You have to explain how. So I'm guessing

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.920
 this is because it was a bit odd. I'm excited to hear your guesses. Do you know the actual answer?

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:22.240
 He went 19 feet down so either he went down and there's a cave system where he could pop up into

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:27.280
 a dry bit and he could illuminate it so he had everything let's say in a plastic bag as a block

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.680
 and then he painted the painting there put it put the painting in the bag and then came back up

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.920
 which I'm guessing must be the way. He definitely painted it there he didn't go down take a photo

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.480
 and then painted it. No he painted it down there. If you were to use water paints right but you use

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.760
 salt water and you're in the you're above the hallow client you're above the hallow client might it

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:52.320
 still work. Yeah yeah so I think it's gonna be pretty blurry painting. Is it possible the painting

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.600
 is just absolute dog shit? It looks pretty cool actually. I think it looks good. I'm sorry I'm sorry.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:04.240
 I was looking at the world's deepest dive in scuba this is and it was by Ahmed Gabba in the Red Sea

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:15.200
 in 2014 and he went 1090 feet down the dive took 13 hours and 15 minutes. What? The thing is 13 hours

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:20.560
 50 minutes how much of that do you think he was going down? Oh not very much because you have to

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.200
 slowly come back up because otherwise you'd get the decompression stuff. So he was going back up

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:32.880
 for 10 hours of it. He went down for 15 minutes and then had to come back up for 13 hours and 35

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.800
 minutes. It's like when you're driving along the motorway and it's incredibly clear the way

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.480
 you're going and you can see the other side of the motorway. I'm only going down to the

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.200
 station I've got to come back through that. And obviously if he went quicker then he'd get the

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:53.680
 bends. He'd die. Do you know another thing that you can get from diving which isn't the bends and

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:59.280
 isn't as dangerous as the bends but is nitrogen narcosis which sounds actually quite fun. It's

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:04.960
 basically getting drunk and it's also known as the martini effect. Divers compare it to drinking

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:10.640
 one martini for every 10 meters that you descend after 30 meters. It doesn't really seem to cause

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:16.080
 much harm except to your judgement which can be a problem. Sorry so let's just work this out. So

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:25.040
 after 30 meters every 10 meters it's one martini. This guy went 332 meters. It's basically like he

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:35.120
 had 30 martinis. He was absolutely hammered. My limit is two. I think genuinely one of them

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:45.040
 gets me pretty too. How do you like your martinis Mr. Bub? Oh yeah. This is fine. Where's the fucking

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:54.880
 olive? Bubba looks at the empty jar of olives. It came with 33 olives. Wow. That's incredible.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:00.000
 It is. So there is a way to get around it if you don't want to be completely pissed 300 meters

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.080
 underwater. Oh you drink a small glass of milk before you go down, don't you? That just helps.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:12.720
 Big roast dinner and then pop down. No you use helium instead of nitrogen. So normally diving

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:19.040
 equipment, the gas that you have is oxygen and nitrogen combination and the the ratio depends

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.080
 on kind of what kind of dive you're doing but weirdly you can replace nitrogen with helium

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.720
 and apparently we can kind of breathe that okay as well. They don't quite know why this doesn't

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:33.120
 give you the narcosis but helium is less fat soluble and it seems like there's more soluble

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.360
 the gas the more drunk you'll get and so I guess it's pretty bad though if you're in trouble it's

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:45.920
 like oh boy oh boy oh boy could someone help me I'm really stuck I'm getting stuck dancing

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:57.120
 in this ice pack. Okay it is time for fact number three and that is my fact. My fact this week is

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:04.720
 that every cup of mint tea you drink contains the essence of a hundred insects. This is part of

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.920
 a study which was done by Trier University in Germany a guy called Henrik Krehenwinkel he's

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.840
 an ecological geneticist and basically what he was looking into is how can we monitor invasive

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:21.360
 pests how can we see if a insect is going endangered around the world one thought that came

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:27.760
 about is this new development which has been around for a bit now EDNA. We mentioned it years ago in

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.480
 our book of the year 2019 where we talked about a New Zealand scientist called Neil Gamble going to

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.520
 Loch Ness and trying to look for the dandruff of the Loch Ness monster. It's basically the idea is

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.440
 that you take a little scoop of something whether it's like water I guess tea in this case and then

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.920
 you look very very closely at all the molecules in it and you can find remnants of the DNA can't you

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.800
 of other stuff that once passed through the scene. And the E stands for environmental so it's things

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.200
 that have been in the area like you might have breathed on it and given some of your DNA to it

00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.800
 or yeah exactly so one of the things that they thought they would test out is could you tell from

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.880
 taking a sample of tea from an area could you look through it with the EDNA method and work

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:12.800
 out how many different species have been landing on the plants peeing on the plants chewing on the

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:18.160
 plants doing whatever it is on the plants and if you could do that and you could get that information

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:23.200
 then you could look to let's say plants that are hidden in museums from the same area from years ago

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.440
 and you would be able to tell is there a decrease in the population is there an increase so clever

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.880
 you could look at other it's an interesting way of then looking at how pesticides can travel

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:37.760
 across the world on boats and so on and become a pest somewhere else you can then suddenly notice

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:43.280
 by testing tea leaves from say barley you'd be like hang on a second there's there's a sudden

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.000
 showing up of this invasive pest which they don't have here and they can get on top of it before

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.920
 it then takes over is it clever or is it lazy is it just a scientist saying I could go to barley

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:59.280
 or india and investigate this or I could pop to asda pick up some of these tips it could be both

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.920
 can't it often the clever thing to do is the lazy thing because you're saving resources very good

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.160
 point yeah but that but that is what literally they were doing they were popping to their local

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:12.240
 grocery stores and they were just buying teas from around the world I think it's what's amazing

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.600
 because they're Trier this university in Germany right that one of the reasons that this is such

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.600
 a good place to study this is that Trier has a specimen bank and the role of the specimen bank

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.560
 is just to collect leaves from different trees across Germany and they've been doing it for 35

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.040
 years they've been doing it for decades I'm not sure what their original justification is in my

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.720
 garden yeah they gave for a fee and they they freeze the leaves in liquid nitrogen so there's

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:39.040
 this German specimen bank which is just a load of leaves in liquid nitrogen I mean it's insane

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.080
 well and they've just gone we know this will come in handy one day and it has yeah it genuinely has

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:49.760
 it's unbelievable yeah the reason the tea is so useful is that if you technically from a herbarium

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.320
 you know it's a sort of samples of ancient plants that what they do is they keep leaves dark and dry

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.080
 basically to keep them in a kind of suspended animation and that is basically the same process

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.960
 as making tea because you're drying the leaves out you're shredding them up and you're just keeping

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.760
 them in kind of suspended animation in a teabag and so that it's perfect to test that as opposed to

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:14.080
 herbarium it's amazing and uh krem winkel this guy he says that straight elva hands christian

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:21.840
 anderson novel yeah he said little boy little girl come to my tea and pour him now he's following

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:30.560
 the trail of teabags I've left he said probably 99.999% or something like this of DNA which we extract

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:36.400
 is the tea DNA and only a tiny fraction of what's left is from insects and he says which of course

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:43.120
 is good for tea drinkers because they want to drink the tea and not the insects but he says

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:49.440
 that actually it's quite good to know that there's some tiny bits of arthropod DNA because that shows

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:55.040
 that they haven't used really loads and loads of pesticides yeah so that's kind of clever yeah and

00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:01.760
 if you want to try it yourself contribute to his research he claims that you can dry your own plants

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.520
 now I don't know if he's actually accepting these specimens but he says if you want to dry your own

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:10.880
 plants and I thought this was quite cool you just need you can get like a ziploc bag sourced from

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:17.680
 some diver presumably and then you dry plants out by just popping in one of those weird silica

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:30.720
 packets that you get inside oh I always eat those that's really funny um EDNA oh yeah it floats in

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.120
 air you just take if you take an air sample there will be tiny tiny amounts of EDNA floating in it

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.560
 so like if someone comes into this room later today after we've gone home yeah and they took

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:46.080
 a jam jar of air they'd be able to get bits of our DNA pretty much yeah it's amazing it's amazing

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.240
 but this led me on to another fact and this was actually sent to us by a listener recently called

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.520
 Andrew Ferguson so thank you to Andrew for this and you might find this fact familiar but it's

00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:02.000
 that on a windy day in San Francisco Zoo strands of giraffe semen can be found floating on the breeze

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.440
 yeah I remember that fact now that was posted on the qi boards by james 12 years ago

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:13.360
 and it's based on an interview with a zookeeper at San Francisco and I followed the link to the

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.920
 original interview with the zookeeper and it's no longer on the internet they'll have suppressed

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.400
 that like billy though won't they because that will not do ticket sales any good but I bet that's

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.640
 one of the facts that we must have posted a dozen times on the internet like that I've tried

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.840
 about it because it's amazing yeah and it's just taken a life of its own yeah if you test the air

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:38.720
 in a zoo yeah with a jam jar you can work out which animals are in the zoo by using e-dna

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:44.160
 what how useful how incredibly useful I'm always going to the zoo and not being able to tell which

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:49.600
 animals are there well you know for instance you could get go to a zoo get a jam jar get a load

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:56.480
 of air close the jam jar take the air away go to a pcr laboratory and then it will tell you

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:03.120
 they have giraffes there really interesting really as really useful for when the sign is down

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:07.440
 yeah the giraffe enclosure london zoo's actually done away with the guides now they just hand you

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:13.040
 a jam jar on arrival it would be an incredibly good kind of like crap alternate zoo it's just

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.840
 the jam jar zoo it's the cheapskate parents visit to the zoo you don't cross the barriers you just

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:24.640
 scoop it to the jar take it home with your kids and go look there's giraffes in here well um there

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.680
 are two studies that have found this one in Denmark and one in England but one interesting part about

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:35.920
 it is that you can not only tell which species are in the zoo but you can get DNA from the food

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:43.520
 that's fed to the animals so if you're feeding your giraffe like vole sausages then it would

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:48.080
 collect the DNA from the voles as well even though there aren't any voles in your zoo wow and then you

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:53.600
 can get the zoo I presume shut down because that feels like it breaches some rules doesn't it

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:58.800
 vol sausage that feels like it's an even better zoo now in the jar you know because you're getting

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:04.000
 more you're getting more animals than you yeah yeah yeah I don't think does anyone does anyone eat

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.720
 vole I've never there's not much meat on a vole I don't think no no it needs to be quite desperate

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:18.080
 Heston's probably done it yeah um have you got other edna stuff I don't know good stuff cool great

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:26.320
 I got some stuff about voles um there was an area of the UK where they used edna in the water

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:31.440
 and they found that there must be some water voles there by looking at the edna oh yeah and then a

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.640
 bit later they put a kind of video camera up and found that there was water voles there so it just

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.680
 shows that it works great okay that's what I thought you were gonna say it was just giraffes having a

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:50.880
 picnic I was looking at the relationships between tea and animals you know like tea pests and there's

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.600
 actually certain types of tea which rely on tea pests to be made there's the tea green leaf hopper

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.840
 which is one of the main attacks of the tea plant also has lots of other names it's called the tea

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:08.160
 jacid or smoke boy or jumping boy and actually you get special tea which um waits for the tea green

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:13.280
 leaf hopper to attack it because then tea releases these chemicals it releases very specific chemicals

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:17.360
 depending on what it knows is attacking it and the chemicals it releases when it's attacked by this

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:23.280
 creature actually make the tea taste quite nice so if you get it at the right time you get um for

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:28.560
 instance something called dong ding oolong um tea which actually I think it's pronounced tongue

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:33.600
 ting but I like the idea of changing the phrase ding dong yeah dong ding it's like you know what's

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:41.600
 he called leslie philips if leslie philips goes through that layer of salt water he goes dong ding

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:49.200
 have you need to know who leslie philips is if you don't know who leslie philips is then why are

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:56.720
 you listening to this we can help you yeah anyway brownie it tastes like honey google hq's gonna

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:01.280
 freak their nuts but they see the spike on leslie philips it's like you're on it's been a leslie philips

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:11.680
 event um the shot hole borough is a teapest shot hole I said um it's latin name is eulacea

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:19.600
 fornicatus oh dear do you know how it got the name fornicatus anyone can guess it was the only

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:25.280
 was the first specimen found in the act of having sex was it shagging the scientist as he discovered

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:31.760
 it no it's because the word fornicate means arch shaped doesn't really it does fornix in latin

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:38.000
 means arch and so it's nothing to do with fornication as you guys thought apart from that the word

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.560
 fornix also meant brothel because brothels were often found in vaults oh wow and that's why we

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:49.920
 get the word fornication that's so interesting so if you're not actually in a vault it doesn't

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:58.400
 count as fornicating I'm here in a legal loophole you're on it I present the flat roof

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.680
 which exonerates my client

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:10.080
 um one of the guys responsible for tea uh particularly asam tea was robert the bruce

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:16.400
 that's it yeah specifically a Scottish man called robert bruce oh come on sorry

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:22.240
 middle name there I don't know he's just robert bruce he was a Scottish man who was in India

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:30.000
 in the 1820s and um this story is quite boring actually no spiders involved no battles he does

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.560
 share a moderately common name with a great skudget hero but not the same but similar similar

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:42.320
 similar yeah great um I was really saved us all a minute of time actually no thank you yeah I

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:49.360
 appreciate it I was reading about ways that farmers try to avoid using pesticides and

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:55.040
 use nature or whatever they can in order to help their crops and uh one of the methods that's used

00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:02.000
 is there's an army of ducks that people hire in order to eat all of the pests so quite famously

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.200
 in Cape Town in South Africa there's a wine estate where they employ around 2000 ducks that every

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:14.240
 morning they walk from their little duck homes all the way to um the the vineyard and the ducks

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.600
 spend a full day there uh just eating all of the worms and all of the why don't they keep the ducks

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.280
 next to the vineyard so they don't need to walk all the way from their duck well it's the cost of

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.560
 accommodation isn't it it's you know you can't you've got to commute sometimes and you want to

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.320
 separate work from personal life as well because yeah they get up at 7 a.m they all march as one uh

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:38.080
 to work at 10 30 uh they spend the day eating the snails and the pests um back home by 4 p.m

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:42.800
 10 30 till 4 yeah oh bloody hell I think they actually the bosses should be cracking the web

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:48.320
 a bit more well they back home by 4 they leave at 7 30 no no no they get up at 7 right they go to

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:53.840
 work at 10 30 they're back by 4 so they're knocking off at 2 30 I'd say but here's the thing as well

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.080
 so these are uh runner ducks and so what it means is that they've got great speed on them so if they

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:03.120
 see a snail going for a leaf they could get there before it does an ordinary duck there's no way it

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:10.960
 could catch a snail you need a special runner duck so here's the thing though they have to hire along

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:17.600
 with the ducks to come with them a bunch of geese who act as bodyguards to the ducks there oh my god

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.240
 because this is a cartoony oh this is something I've seen before this is this is the old woman

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:26.240
 who's wanted to fly some warped version of it who's guarding the geese the old woman who hired a duck

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:34.080
 what the fuck she hired a duck so the problem is is that the ducks get spooked really easily if

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:39.840
 they're eating the snails and so on let's say an owl comes by right the geese's job is to scare away

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.400
 the owls and all the other animals that come in that because apparently as soon as a duck sees an

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:49.600
 owl it just freaks out and they all go scattering and running away it causes chaos so yeah but here's

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:55.440
 the thing it's used for many different kinds of fields and farms uh but the one thing it's not

00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:01.200
 used for is for tea leaves and it's because you have to pick something that the ducks themselves

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.000
 aren't going to want to eat and they apparently love tea leaves so I cannot believe the climax of

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 this story is that tea is the one thing that does not involve this very convoluted process

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.640
 and the really interesting thing is this is nothing to do with what we're talking about

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.760
 it is this is a pest control but they can't use it for tea leaves you know what I saved us a minute

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:28.960
 earlier am I not talking about robert the roost oh my god no look it's a pest it's tangentially

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:41.760
 okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that is

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:47.280
 Anna my fact is that the first railway in greenland was built to transport a meteorite

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.840
 first and and one of the only I think lots of places say the only but James I think you might

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:59.360
 have found some other rogue railways in greenland oh yeah found all sorts so there'll be the green

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:07.200
 and railway section later but um this is a really interesting story which I found after some seriously

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.760
 in-depth research actually took me ages to get there but eventually on the back of an innocent

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:18.000
 smoothie bottle uh Hannah yeah why are we getting our facts from innocent smoothie bottles look I

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.880
 read this and I thought because Anna's clearly on a side hustle advertising deal with innocent

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:27.520
 smoothie I'm not saying that it's any better or worse than other smoothies but um it wasn't where

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:33.120
 the fact came from but it's it led me to it because it said in 1894 an explorer found a meteorite on

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:38.480
 the sensibly named meteorite island funny bit of humor from innocent um he decided to take it home

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:43.600
 because it's the biggest ever but weighing 58 tons it took three years and a new railway to get it back

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:49.040
 while it got there in the end this guy's story has taught us a lot mainly that it's better to stick to

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:54.640
 the lighter things in life innocent smoothies have 30 lighter on natural sugar this smoothie is a

00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:00.560
 lot easier to carry home than a meteorite that's a shoehorn isn't it rock on that's a shoe oh it's

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:06.480
 an amazing fact that the brontes all died from drinking graveyard water what that reminds us

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:12.880
 are innocent is that actually life is not never ending and you should enjoy every second of it

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:18.480
 and why not enjoy the next few seconds by having this delicious innocent smoothie I thought it was

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:23.200
 one of the best crowbars I've ever seen have you tried actually have you tried the innocent um graveyard

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:30.480
 smoothie it's um it's an acquired taste a lot of body a lot of body anyways I thought that's what the

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:36.000
 hell are they talking about that's absolutely loopy um but then no looked looked into it and this was

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:44.400
 from an expedition in the 1890s into Greenland it was by the explorer Robert Peary and he was

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:49.680
 led by Inuit guides to a meteorite that people have been hearing about for almost a hundred years

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.160
 um but hadn't quite been able to track down so the Inuits knew where it was and used it a lot as

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:59.600
 I'm sure we'll talk about and other Europeans had got there tried to find it eventually he found it

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:06.720
 and the biggest piece which is called Anigito was so heavy that he had to construct kind of a

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.440
 little railroad by laying down lots of timber and then putting steel rail tracks I think it was sort

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.240
 of two mini bits because you had to build one bit of railroad road to sort of push it up the hill

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:22.160
 then they rolled it down the hill to the harbour and then once on the coastline then they had to

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:27.040
 build another railroad over a bridge that they constructed to get it onto the boat wow it's

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.400
 amazing he went to enormous lengths to steal this quite important aspect

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:37.600
 that's one way of looking at it yeah yeah and it's not a quick heist is it it's it's quite

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:43.280
 noticeable yeah he took all three I think yes I think are they still to this day at the American

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:47.760
 Museum of Natural History one of them is the biggest one is in the American Museum of Natural

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.080
 History yeah and there's tens of tons and this name means tent didn't doesn't it and then he took

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:56.880
 the other two slightly smaller ones called dog and woman yeah and um the people there they had

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.280
 hammer stones and they would chip off bits of the ore and that would allow them to put tips on

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.280
 their spears and that kind of thing it was the sole source of metal right in yeah yeah yeah

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:10.960
 but yeah he didn't he did steal it and um when he got back to New York um he made a lot of money

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:18.240
 off of it he sold it for $40,000 which is roughly 1.3 mil in today's money the equivalent but before

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.360
 he did that when the boat docked he'd set it up as like a circus thing where you would come and visit

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.760
 to see come see the meteorite and he would charge a quarter for every person it just looks like a

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:34.320
 rock yeah but it's more exciting than your jar of edna at the zoo but still it's a big rock but 20

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:39.040
 20,000 people went to see that and he charged them a quarter a piece to go and touch it or have a look

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:45.600
 at it and so that's about $5,000 at the time which again is about $150,000 so it became very rich

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.520
 off his stolen item when he sold them he was he was selling them to raise the money for another

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.280
 journey north that's what he was using the money for yeah he was desperate to get to the north pole

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.560
 really he was desperate to get to the north pole basically there were claims for a long time that

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:02.640
 peary was the first guy to get to the north pole yeah and those claims are not true he did not

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:08.080
 make it oh you're saying categorically how are you i'm i mean i am on your side here but yeah well

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:13.520
 okay um all right let's put it this way right his triumphant expedition to the north pole as we

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:20.080
 call it yeah uh was in 1909 and the evidence is as follows uh the only people who witnessed him are

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:24.400
 four iniquate people who were all sworn to secrecy and his man servant Matthew Henson

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:29.360
 his diary was inconsistent he didn't record the readings that would have proved where he got to

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:34.800
 he also was a 54 year old man with no toes uh due to frostbite he would have had to manage three

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:39.520
 times the average speed the expedition had achieved earlier on under less difficult conditions

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.280
 that record has never been equaled in the history of Arctic exploration he would have had to

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:49.760
 travel 70 miles a day no explorer has ever covered this ground over the same number of days um it

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.640
 it just he didn't get there if he had got there it's not even him who really did it was Matthew

00:50:54.640 --> 00:51:00.800
 Henson who is his partner who is sort of got shunned from history and from that trip to the

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.560
 point where he was sort of seen as a man servant they were partners and they were he was an amazing

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:08.720
 explorer himself Matthew Henson it was because he was black that he was sort of not given the credit

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.760
 there's lots of thoughts about whether or not he got there but Wally Herbert is the British

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:18.880
 expedition leader who went there to try and use the calculations to see if he managed it

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:23.200
 he claims that he didn't but in the process of doing it Wally Herbert then claimed to be the

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:30.000
 first person to do it I think Wally Herbert is definitely a legit explorer whether or not his

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 claim that period didn't make it is true or not is different I think I think he definitely made it

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.920
 but what's amazing is when you travel and you're trying to get to the north pole the problem is

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:42.960
 is that you're on a moving body of land aren't you the ice is just constantly moving so when

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.440
 Wally Herbert was trying to get there you would take a reading of where you were after an hour

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.160
 and suddenly you were eight kilometers further away than you were because of the way the ice was

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:56.720
 shifting but the thing is like he was what at the very end I remember reading he was something like

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:01.600
 was it like 130 meters from the north pole and he was kind of on his hands and knees

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:10.000
 but luckily some small fishes had made holes so what are the amazing things with Wally is that he

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.720
 I think they even passed it at one point and not realized like when they were having a sleep

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.280
 they sort of just they just like the the drift took them over yeah so they woke up and they

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:23.680
 realized that it was achievable to get to in the day so they sent a telegram to the queen

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:29.200
 saying your majesty we have got to the north pole and the first british to do it risky yeah

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.920
 if they haven't actually done that because they hadn't actually done it and the rest of the day

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:37.280
 became a chase to get there so that the telegram wasn't alive and they managed it but just they

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:41.680
 only just it's good to set yourself these challenges sometimes if you've got a deadline yeah I often

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:46.400
 say yes I've researched three of the four facts for this week's show that's all fine but it is in

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.120
 america it's very controversial because they you know what peary what peary got there in a lot of

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.640
 people's opinions and to say it opinions take out he didn't make well you're gonna be getting a lot

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:58.880
 of emails podcast at qi.com bring it on i'll be surprised if the emails make it to my inbox

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:06.320
 i imagine they'll stop about 70 miles short it was all kind of unedifying i think it was that real

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:12.320
 desperation for fame and glory and it was so competitive and like you say with henson henson

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:17.440
 probably if they did get there henson claimed to have got there first so henson went for a stroll

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:21.520
 i think when they're at what they thought was roughly the north pole and then henson came back

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:26.080
 this is according to henson's diaries henson came back and was like oh wow so cool i'm pretty sure

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:31.360
 i just wandered over to it and i was the first person to be sitting on top of the world what a dick

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:39.440
 move just gonna go for a quick uh well then so peary's like what a dick move and so he snuck off

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.720
 took two of the inuit guides of the four snuck off and found his own way to what was his own

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.720
 you sneak off in a completely speechless environment that's almost that's more impressive actually to

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:53.440
 find a way of sneaking there's one big tree just behind it peary doesn't seem like a great

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:58.000
 guy in a number of ways it's because i haven't got that from you that you think that so one of the

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.720
 other things he did and this this really is the truly shabby thing so he persuaded in 1897 which

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:11.600
 was his um that was the meteorite nicking uh trip uh heist um he persuaded six inuit people to

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.520
 return with him to america kind of so that they could be sort of put on stage as part of a lecture

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:22.080
 series um four of them died shortly after arriving uh of tb and the youngest one was called minnick and

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:26.720
 he was adopted by an american family minnick was given an american name he was named minnick peary

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:32.080
 wallace uh and several years later many years later he uh was at the american museum of natural

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:37.520
 history and he came across some bones in the ethnographic department which was his father's

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:44.720
 skeleton breaking which peary had simply sold to the museum as a kind of display piece minnick

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:49.840
 obviously wanted and fought very hard to have the skeletons returned for a ritual burial uh the

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:56.400
 museum refused and um peary eventually paid for minnick to go home but the family's skeletons

00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:01.280
 weren't released and buried in green until 1993 yeah but did you see that they gave him a fake

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:07.200
 burial first yeah so when minnick came over uh and his father died and minnick said i need to

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.800
 bury him with the proper inuit rituals right um they gave him a bit massive log wearing sort of

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:18.080
 big furs disguised as his dad disguised as sort of shoved his head on i put yeah yeah they pretended

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:22.800
 it was his dad they were burying i guess maybe you don't get up too close um yeah so he thought he

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.560
 buried his dad and it was a few years later i think when he was like oh can i tell you about

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.360
 another railway on greenland because this is all going a bit dark yes yes yes good idea good idea

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:35.280
 there's basically a few that have been built and they're mostly like small ones just to transport

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:40.080
 fish from you know the fishing place to the place where people live they're not very big you know

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:44.800
 it's not like a huge railway going through the country but it's not a tiny one where like carriages

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:52.560
 for fish the fish sits in a tiny fish yeah it's not that um but there's a coal railway uh in

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:58.800
 greenland and it's on disco island which disco island is the second largest island in greenland

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:02.560
 after the main one and it's one of the hundred largest islands in the world but i'd never heard

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:09.200
 about until this week disco island can any of you guess yep how disco island got its name

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:17.200
 it's in greenland i mean this feels like another fornicans trap doesn't it i mean yeah disco it's

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:22.880
 completely circular it's shaped like a desk one theory the people there they'd do the macarena

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:28.160
 that's where we got the macarena yes that's not a common theory the also the macarena

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:36.240
 light bounces off the snow much like a disco ball very good not a theory uh rounded is a theory

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:42.640
 okay another one is that it's short for discovery island another one is that the mountains are

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:51.040
 quite flat on it so they look like desks desks but the most common is probably that it was named

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:57.200
 after a guy called marmaduke he was an english explorer and waila and that it was originally
