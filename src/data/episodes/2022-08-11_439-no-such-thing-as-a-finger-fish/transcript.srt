 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,840
 you from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here with Anna

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,440
 Tyshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go!

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,240
 Starting with fact number one and that is Andy. My fact is that there's a theory that the Bronte

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,280
 sisters all died young because they spent a lot of their life drinking graveyard water.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,200
 [Music]

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,280
 You said graveyard water as though we're all familiar with it. It's like spring water.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,080
 You've all seen it on the shutters but still sparking.

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,960
 [Laughter]

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,880
 Yeah, well no, you're right. It's not a thing anymore but I think graveyard water was a much

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:10,240
 bigger thing in the 19th century before proper hygiene standards and before proper

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,880
 you know water piping. So this is water that has happened to go through a graveyard.

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,840
 It's filtered, yeah it's filtered. Whenever you buy a bottle of water and it says filtered,

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,320
 that's what it means. No, so they lived in this town called Howarth which is in West Yorkshire

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,480
 and it was an extremely sickly place. Very low life expectancy, excellent running down the streets.

18
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,320
 I mean, you know, bad ventilation. You said it was Yorkshire. Sorry, yeah, okay.

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:42,240
 And also the Bronte family home, the pass nearer to they lived in, right next to it had a graveyard

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:51,920
 and there there is a whoo-hoo and there it was very overcrowded as well and there is a strong

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,640
 theory or a strong suggestion it's possible that decomposing matter from the graveyard

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,720
 would have filtered into the water supply and that might have really bandjacked the town's

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,360
 overall health. Those who were using kind of public water sources. Yeah, it definitely would have gone

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,680
 into the village which is in like a valley. But yeah, and presumably there weren't taps back

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,040
 then so they must have been collecting water from somewhere. So they lived in the past niche and

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,160
 they had their own well. Yes, okay. And what I find really interesting is that the well was cleaned

27
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,360
 in 1847 and that was the first time it had been cleaned in 20 years and the father of the Bronte's

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,080
 wrote that they'd taken eight yellow tin cans out of it. That's how polluted it was. But it was in

29
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:44,160
 1848 and 1849 that Bramwell, Emily and Anne all died so the year afterwards. So the year after

30
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,080
 their well was out of use perhaps. Right. So maybe they stopped using the well for a bit and then

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
 they started using the more common water that everyone else was drinking and then that might

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,160
 have made them sick. Did they not think when they were drinking something that looked like Gatorade

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,120
 that maybe, maybe that wasn't going to be good for them. If it's the only thing you can drink. Yeah,

34
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,480
 really. What do you do? We actually say the Bronte's died young but you know they lived

35
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,560
 to ripe old ages by comparison. Did they? Well, I mean not really. They lived to 29, 30, 31 and

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,760
 39. Exactly. The average life expectancy obviously one has to account for the 40% of people who die

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,680
 in early childhood. But yeah, it was 25. And I reckon Charlotte at 38 would have seemed like

38
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,560
 an old hag by the time she copped it. But yeah, all the others did die pretty young except their

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,600
 dad who lived to 84 while all died. It was a very sickly place and the town was inspected in 1850

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,200
 by a man who was called Benjamin Herschel Babbage and his findings basically were that it was just

41
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,320
 an extremely unhealthy place. It was poorly ventilated. Some people were living in cellars.

42
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,360
 And it was their dad actually who got this guy in to check the water supply. So it was the year

43
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,080
 after three of his children had died and he said we need to do something about this. Do you think

44
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,000
 after the first child died he was like oh I must get this water checked and then the second kid

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,320
 dies he's like damn it I really must get this water check. Well the first one was Bramwell who

46
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,720
 died of alcoholism. Yes. Actually he had two daughters who died before that. So they had two

47
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,200
 daughters who died like 14, 15 didn't they which sounds very which is very sad. And they were in

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,440
 the school which was right at the bottom of the hill where the water definitely would have been

49
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,960
 pretty rank. But Bramwell died of alcoholism but the pub where he drank in is the first place you

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,040
 get to after if you look at the map it's house graveyard pub and apparently they used to make

51
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,360
 their beer out of the water. So is it possible then that we've maligned him and he didn't die of

52
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,760
 alcoholism. Well he definitely wasn't alcoholic as well. I think people do say that he might have

53
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,880
 died of TB and he was an alcoholic but you know he might have died of other stuff as well. So we

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,080
 might have unfairly maligned him. There was opium involved as well I think. It was a concoction

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,760
 of stuff. He wasn't living a very healthy life. I'd say that. But it's always said that alcoholism

56
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,320
 during you know not the graveyard order. Yeah I am with Dan here. I actually think that the

57
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,920
 Bramwell myth may have been you know taken to the extreme of like this killed him and actually

58
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,400
 I'm not sure we totally have evidence. But Babbage's report was funny. He was particularly appalled

59
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,480
 by the toilet setup in the village which was consisted of two toilets that were shared each

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,240
 by like 12 families. So they were out in the street and he was appalled by the public view of them

61
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,120
 which I don't think contributes to people's ill health. You might do. That people could see you

62
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,440
 while you're pooing. Yeah he basically said there's in fact he said there's two toilets that are just

63
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,000
 on the public street in view of the houses and of passes by whilst a third is perched upon an

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,360
 eminence commanding the whole length of the main street. Have you ever been like have you ever been

65
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,600
 to like a restaurant or something that's on the top of a really high building and then sometimes

66
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,320
 they put the toilet and they have pretty much a window because there's nothing else can look in

67
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,600
 and you can poo and look out over the whole city. No I've never seen that. I can't remember where I've

68
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
 been and done that but it's really it's something it's quite something. It sounds quite uncommon.

69
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,480
 You said it is though it might be a standard thing in high buildings but I'm not sure it's normal.

70
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,360
 No actually no my local Greg's has one of those. You could sit in Greg's and as an eminence over

71
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,240
 the whole of South London. So the the brontes in general they're putting them back together in a

72
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,680
 way. Pretty much so basically all the contents of the house were sold off after Patrick who's the

73
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,160
 father pop Bronte he died in 1861 and all the contents were sold off because you know you

74
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,760
 have a new person who comes in and the furniture changes. Because he was a was a curate vicar

75
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,880
 priestee guide not a priest because he has six children but the Bronte society they've been

76
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,320
 putting the house back together which is very exciting and they've been slowly slowly buying

77
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,680
 an auction various bits of Bronte paraphernalia so there was a table that they wrote at one

78
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,200
 kind of normal medium-sized darkwood table 580 000 pounds it's been bought.

79
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,360
 But did they all write on this table? I think a lot of them did. I don't know if any key works

80
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,280
 would definitely pinned on that table but it was the writing table. Do you think that's a big table?

81
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,880
 Yeah do you think like as a writer that you are and we all are really do you think that really now

82
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,280
 we should get actually quite a nice ornate table because in the future they're gonna look at it and

83
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,640
 go on that table from Ikea was like yeah what's the point of putting that in a museum? Exactly I

84
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,480
 like Terry Pratchett's table where he wrote most of his novels as soon as he passed away his assistant

85
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,560
 Rob put a glass plate over the table so that every single scuff mark every single you know mug

86
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,560
 wear and yeah it's there now for all time. It's a great idea. It's like chewing them underneath.

87
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,000
 Another really cool item I don't know if it was at auction that they had to buy it back or

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,320
 whether they just still have it but Charlotte Bronte was given a bit of Napoleon's coffin

89
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,360
 which is really cool. How did they get his coffin? He was dead. Oh yeah. Because he had about seven

90
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
 coffins I think Napoleon he was inside multiple layers. Like a Russian doll. Like a Russian doll

91
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,280
 yeah yeah he's there was a small coffin. It's quite awkward for Napoleon as a poor guy. Do you mean like

92
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:09,760
 a French pastry or something? Did you say Charlotte got Napoleon's coffin? Yeah yeah from her sexy

93
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,440
 Belgian tutor who she was in love with. Really? He was a married man so I don't think any impropriety

94
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,240
 ever occurred but she she loved him and they had quite a good friendship as well so yeah.

95
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,520
 Because she wasn't the big Napoleon fan this is the great thing about the Bronte is when they were

96
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,480
 younger they actually wrote more words than when they were adults because they wrote these amazing

97
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,720
 books together these fairy tales and they were they created worlds they created the world of

98
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,120
 angrier and gondol and I think this was based on some toy soldiers that

99
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,120
 Bramwell got given by their dad but they all played with them and they all claimed a soldier

100
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,080
 and Emily claimed Wellington and then Bramwell claimed Napoleon and they'd sort of like fight

101
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,280
 each other and stuff and then the other two claimed a gravy boy and a waiting boy but I think they

102
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,640
 upgraded them at some point to the Antarctic explorers Paris and Ross. A gravy boy? A gravy boy

103
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,600
 yeah. Again just like I said gravy had water like it was a thing. I don't think a gravy boy is a thing.

104
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,360
 You know in American football they have a water boy who brings on all of their drinks and stuff.

105
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:15,120
 But I do now yeah. Well gravy boy is the same in cricket. On your cucumber sandwiches. Yeah yeah

106
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,960
 she's bringing some gravy. Was she quite obsessed with Wellington, Emily? I don't know how obsessed

107
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,400
 she was. She probably was. I think she was and I think she met him later in life in like his late

108
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,320
 life. Napoleon was buried in a lot of coffins like a beef Wellington. Yeah, wasn't he? That's

109
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,080
 even worse. Doesn't make sense. Beef Wellington doesn't have multiple pastry layers. Puff pastry.

110
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,440
 I suppose it is it is layered. It's got a layer of mushrooms and stuff. Yeah he was covered in duck

111
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:51,040
 cells. Just on their on their writing as kids and the cool stuff that they had. I don't know if

112
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,680
 any of these remain but they wrote in tiny books sometimes. So some of their stories they wrote

113
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,760
 in books that were small enough for their dolls or their soldiers to read. Which sounds so cool.

114
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,440
 The writing is microscopic and I think there was one book that in fact we do have some of them because

115
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,640
 there are photos and they're about like the size of the thumb, human thumb really. We know there's

116
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,360
 one because actually the Bronte house has bought one of them back. Have they million pounds? The

117
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,600
 tiny book or the tiny book? I don't know. I have no idea how they're funding it. Oh actually I do

118
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,200
 know how they might be funding it because the actual Bronte's themselves were funded indirectly

119
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,760
 through piracy. So wait so Grandpa Bronte he was a trader but also he had plenty of dealings with

120
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,000
 Cornish pirates who committed actual murders and a lot of his money a lot of his estate would have

121
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,560
 come from his nefarious activities and the Bronte sisters paid for their novels to be published

122
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,640
 and they did a lot of that thanks to money they got from their aunt on that side of the family.

123
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,040
 So basically they were pirate funded. So you're saying that the current Bronte estate has some

124
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,440
 sort of treasure chest that they're still taking book liens out of. Where are they getting these

125
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,160
 millions from? They pay for anything in doubloons if you notice that for the auctions. I read an

126
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,120
 article about the Bronte society who run the museum. I don't know if it's the same people

127
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,520
 but apparently they made a loss last year of £100,000 and actually because not many people

128
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,520
 have been visiting I think possibly due to Covid they've been asking firms in the UK who use the

129
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,240
 name Bronte they're saying well you know okay fine you're allowed to use nothing we can do but

130
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,960
 can you not give us a bit of money for it. And Richard Wilcox who's the chairman of the Bronte

131
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:33,840
 society he said there are dozens of companies who are selling Bronte stone cooked chicken

132
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,360
 outdoor clothing. Have you never had a Bronte chicken? Bronte fried chicken it's lovely it's

133
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,720
 been uh how's it cooked it's sort of they leave it on a moor for three days. Yeah it's very moorish

134
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:52,640
 and also spring water and what I found is that there is Bronte water that you can buy from the

135
00:11:52,640 --> 00:12:00,080
 springs in Howarth. No we've ruined their industry with this podcast. And I just want to kind of

136
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,760
 balance it out to say that they are part of a company called Waterlogic UK and they recently

137
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,520
 announced the world's first Covid secure range of drinking water dispensers. Okay actually weirdly

138
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,880
 the Bronte society themselves just on Bronte merch they do they sell a Branwell Bronte I think it's a

139
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:25,920
 wine bottle stopper or a corkscrew but given that he died of alcoholism. I wonder if they get a cut

140
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,600
 from all the companies then that are in this town where they grew up. Well that's what they're saying

141
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,960
 they don't and at the moment there's no legal reason that they should. Because they've really

142
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,040
 come for it haven't they like all the salons are like Jane Hare you know and stuff like just like

143
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:47,280
 I love that so Charlotte Bronte was a teacher and in 1836 she started writing about her

144
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,360
 experience as a teacher and she's just so mean to the students it's amazing there's one extract which

145
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,120
 says am I to spend all the best part of my life in this wretched bondage forcibly suppressing my

146
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,680
 rage at the idleness the apathy and the hyperbolical and most asinine stupidity of those fat-headed

147
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,400
 oats. Wow like she did not like her kids. Teachers listening to this are nodding as well right

148
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,160
 now. Is that Emily? That was Charlotte. Charlotte sorry sorry. I have a theory about Bramwell Bronte

149
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:26,240
 which is that he inspired a very famous film okay it's um to do with his okay no no I'm going to

150
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,680
 give you a clue first otherwise I don't think you'll get there. Did he want to stop someone and his

151
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,040
 mum shot someone? Yeah. Oh Jesus Christ okay you only know two films between you. Andy knows.

152
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,080
 It's Avatar. It's Avatar. So it's what yeah yeah. He was green. Yeah yeah. Lou. I was thinking of the Hulk.

153
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,920
 No so he um he basically had this affair we think um and this is partly based on the biography of

154
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,480
 Charlotte that was written by Mrs Gaskell very interestingly so Patrick the dad commissioned

155
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,600
 Mrs Gaskell to write. Who we should say Charlotte. Famous author, famous British author. Did she

156
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,400
 have a first name? Elizabeth but she always goes by Mrs. Bizarrely snobbish about that like when

157
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,200
 she wrote to George Elliott once she said um love love your stuff George but I wish I could be

158
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,000
 addressing a Mrs rather than a miss. Just a bit. Given that she was writing to someone trading under

159
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,520
 a man's name. Yeah. An insane thing to say. And also don't upset George Elliott because you're

160
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,080
 going to get a big right hand. She'll have that you and you will not come back from that.

161
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:31,520
 But anyway what we think is that Brownwell had an affair with this much older woman. He was 25

162
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,960
 and she was 43 and he was working as a governess not a governess. A governess. A governess. A

163
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,840
 tutor for her children. Mrs Doubtfire. Exactly. I really thought you were going to get it there.

164
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,320
 You know it. So she's called Lydia Robinson and that's Brownwell Bronte as the initials are BB

165
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,480
 and in the film the very famous film The Graduate obviously where Mrs Robinson is the older woman

166
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,120
 who seduces a younger man. It's Benjamin Braddock initials BB. Okay. And the author of the original

167
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,400
 book I don't think ever commented on whether it was inspired by that but it was a famous affair

168
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,400
 between an old woman. Charlotte had a superpower by the way. Oh yeah. She could see in the dark

169
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,480
 how cool is that. Well in the absolute pitch dark. Yeah basically I mean that was there's stories

170
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,480
 that she was short-sighted so short-sighted that if she was trying to even play piano she couldn't

171
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,600
 read the sheet music it was that it was that bad for her. But as soon as the lights went out as soon

172
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,600
 as it was night time her students said that she could read perfectly what was on the page

173
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,760
 when no one else could. Right. Okay. It's good fact. It's a great fact. Thank you. We don't

174
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,000
 acknowledge each other's facts that often on the show but a truly good one comes up I'm glad

175
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,440
 we did. It sounds like she was an inspiring teacher who you know. A lot of people said this.

176
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,840
 Taught her kids an imaginative story. No she could she could do. No. I think actually I do

177
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,520
 by that because I know that Anne the youngest of the sisters she could hear things over 300 miles

178
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,440
 away. She could bring metal to her. And then their green brother Bramwell only when he got angry

179
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:19,440
 destroy everything. Okay it is time for fact number two and that is James. Okay my fact this week

180
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:27,040
 is that if you swim too close to an iceberg you can get sucked in. Not in danger of it. Not one of

181
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,680
 my top worries I don't think. It's worth remembering you never know when you might find yourself in

182
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,600
 that situation Anna. You're right on Titanic too or something. So yeah how do they do that? Do they

183
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,960
 generate their own currents near them? They do not. In a way they generate their own currents.

184
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,880
 They're moving around a lot. They're changing a lot. Icebergs are melting all the time.

185
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,640
 Lots of changes inside an iceberg and I'm especially talking about very big ones and when

186
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,800
 things are moving around currents get formed and that's what happened. And I read this in I was

187
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,480
 basically going through some old archives of an NPR radio show called Only a Game and I found this

188
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,760
 article from 2001 about someone called Jill Hyneth and she is one of the most remarkable people I've

189
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,640
 ever come across in the 20 years I've done this job. She was the first person to swim inside of

190
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,480
 an iceberg. There was a massive one that carved off from Antarctica. It was about the size of Jamaica

191
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,320
 and she and her partner went to National Geographic and said we'd like to do this article about

192
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,200
 diving through the caves of icebergs and they said wow really there are caves in icebergs and

193
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,240
 they went we think so and sure enough they got some funding and they went and did it and the story

194
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:50,320
 of her going through this iceberg is remarkable. My wife's gone to swim in an iceberg the size of

195
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:59,680
 a Caribbean island. Jamaica? Yes. Extraordinarily she went up her own accord. Completely bizarre

196
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:07,440
 decision. Yeah it sounds absolutely incredible doesn't it and some quite dodgy moments in there.

197
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,360
 Every moment, every moment is dodgy in there. Yeah so first of all they are next to this massive

198
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,600
 iceberg and they jump into the water and the first thing that happens is you're jumping into

199
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,520
 ice cold water and I don't know I'm sure some of you might have done that before it really hits

200
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,040
 you hard and it can really take the breath out of you but in her case she said it's like an ice cream

201
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,520
 headache like the worst ice cream headache you've ever had is the first thing that you feel and then

202
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,560
 you go down and down and down and you see an entrance and you enter this iceberg and it's

203
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,400
 all blue like she says it's like a robin's egg the floor's red and orange and yellow all these

204
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:50,480
 amazing colors and then everything goes wrong. And so she and her partner they're swimming through it

205
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,880
 and after a while of taking lots of video footage they turn around to go back out

206
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,760
 but because it's a melting iceberg because it's a living beast that's just changing shape all the

207
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,680
 times their exit shuts and they're stuck inside the iceberg and she's going I'm trying not to

208
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,240
 panic because if I start breathing too heavily every breath I take is a precious breath. Every

209
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:18,000
 movie you make. Every movie you make. No one's watching her. So frightening. And so she they

210
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,760
 just wait they patiently wait and then a new opening happens it's like a weird mirror labyrinth

211
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,480
 you know like something you would see in a weird fantasy movie a new opening happens and they

212
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,880
 manage to get out and then they just have to wait a while to acclimatize don't they you can't just

213
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,640
 go straight back up so. And so the people on the boat are thinking well they're gone yeah because

214
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,880
 they've heard all these changes and this carving and bits have fallen off the people on the boat

215
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,280
 are like well that's the end of them then. Yeah but then they come back up they go up they tell

216
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,240
 their story it's all going nice you'd think that's enough we've explored it they go let's get back in

217
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,800
 there let's do it again so they go for a second time. Well what are the chances of that going

218
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,400
 wrong again? Exactly. I mean it's not going to happen twice is it? Yeah it sounded like even

219
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,040
 there was a scary moment at one point on this expedition when she resurfaced and the boat I

220
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,000
 think had drifted and she came up through a hole in the ice but the ice around her was so high she

221
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,760
 couldn't see anything and you're in the middle of the Antarctic and her boat disappeared and I

222
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,840
 think the boat just happened to swing around she just glimpsed the stern. It's because they had to

223
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,200
 take the anchor up and so it drifted while the anchor was up so they're nearly lost at sea basically

224
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,960
 in this moment so they get back on the boat and you think all right let's get back to home. Don't

225
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,000
 go back a third time. They go a third time they go a third time and this time they get stuck inside

226
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,080
 and in order to get out she basically got up to a point in the iceberg where there was a there

227
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,840
 was a gap at the top for them to climb out but it was 130 feet above their heads so you're looking

228
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,680
 at a climbing wall basically that's unclimbable except yes and I couldn't quite get it because

229
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,320
 she's out of the water by this time so she's just climbing up the iceberg. So she must be inside of

230
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,880
 the iceberg where there's a hole on the inside. It's like a triathlon kind of thing you know you

231
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,600
 do the swimming bit and then you do the climbing bit. When do you do the cycling bit? There's a

232
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,280
 bike at the top of the iceberg. But this is where the story genuinely turns a bit Brian blessedy

233
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,840
 for me because I just think this is impossible. So she climbs up 130 feet. But here's the thing

234
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,160
 right this is solid ice wall right so how do you climb ice wall and she thinks to herself hang on

235
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,560
 there's little animals that burrow themselves into the ice wall which are creating natural

236
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,760
 handholds for me to do and apparently there's enough of these that she could scale 130. So it's

237
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,520
 a little fish exactly the size of her finger which makes a little hole where it lives. The fish finger

238
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,280
 yeah well the finger fish yeah yeah yeah and they make holes in the ice bag and she can use them to

239
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,800
 grip onto and pull herself up. So she climbs up yeah I know it's blessed this is suddenly all the way up

240
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,800
 all the way 130 feet. The fish living 100 feet up on the iceberg. 130. How did they get up there?

241
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,280
 Who no I guess if the previous fish have gone up there. Icebergs flip over all the time.

242
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,360
 Yeah don't know do we think what has there been cracks in the iceberg? Oh there's some cracks in

243
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,120
 her story. And they all climb out this way 130 feet up and then they're back on the boat and

244
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:09,200
 then they slip down the iceberg. And so they're sitting on the boat not long afterwards I think

245
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,600
 they're having some drinks and some food and then suddenly they just hear screaming from other people

246
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,200
 on the boat and there's huge cracking noises and basically there's been such a melting point on

247
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,240
 the iceberg that it cracks in on itself and they go well if we were in there we'd be dead we'd be

248
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:31,840
 squished in a second so then they go back again no they don't. But what a story. Yeah it is quite

249
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,120
 quite an odd thing to choose to do with your life. You must have to have a very unusual

250
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,680
 personality not to panic in all of these circumstances like she did one other dive

251
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,680
 which she described and it was into a really really small cave so she's a cave diver

252
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,400
 basically so underwater cave diver and she was taking a scientist down there with her who obviously

253
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:59,440
 had been trained properly how to dive but the scientist got wedged in this tiny cave and panicked.

254
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,600
 Luckily a tiny fish came and nibbled her out. And it was a really nice story because earlier

255
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,440
 in the dive she had found that fish and it had a thorn in its fin yes and she pulled the thorn out

256
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,080
 and then the fish came back to help her. Yeah okay it's not a Bronte novel it's this is a real life.

257
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,800
 So she's wedged? She's wedged and they have a guideline which is the only way you can find your

258
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,360
 way back to the entrance of the cave because you know it's full of other channels and tunnels and

259
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,360
 stuff so you'll never find your way back otherwise. The guideline's broken which is the only thing to

260
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,600
 lead them back to the entrance somehow and I'm not quite sure how Jill does this while she's

261
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,280
 trying to fix the guideline she loses her partner who was previously wedged in a rock.

262
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,840
 Yeah seems careless a bit of an oversight so she spends 73 minutes desperately looking

263
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,600
 for her partner while trapped in this cave no idea if she's gonna escape. That's extraordinary.

264
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,040
 And also thinking oh god I've killed this scientist how awkward. But imagine the moment and maybe it's

265
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,120
 all worth it for this when finally she realized she has not only found her way to the entrance

266
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,000
 but she sees a little glimpse of light but there is wasting at the entrance the scientists who

267
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,480
 apparently her mask is just full of tears because the scientists assume that Jill's dead and she's

268
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,160
 probably gonna die too waiting at the entrance for her and that's amazing. She was all right and she

269
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,240
 said the weirdest thoughts go through your head like when she thought she was gonna die you think

270
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,560
 things like oh my god I have to get home then my husband doesn't know how to do the taxes.

271
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:30,000
 Wow that's an amazing story and also it's given me a new respect for the word guideline. Yeah

272
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,080
 you know we're so used to hearing about the conceptual guidelines the theoretical ones.

273
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,160
 Government guidelines suggest. Yeah exactly and actually guidelines can save your life.

274
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,520
 I was reading about what Heinearth studies in the other areas of life because loads of loads of

275
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,000
 cave diving particularly and have you guys heard of the Hallow Cline? No. So she studies animals

276
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,160
 which are often found beneath the Hallow Cline and the Hallow Cline is a boundary between fresh

277
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,880
 water which is higher up and salt water which is lower down and she says the boundary layer is as

278
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,040
 thin as a sheet of paper but you can also see it when you're in the cave when you dive. So as you

279
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,280
 go through it everything goes blurry for a second because you've broken the barrier between the two

280
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,120
 kinds of water. Like going through a mirror which takes you to a parallel universe. It's exactly

281
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,360
 like that it's exactly like that and then as soon as you get down to the salt water everything snaps

282
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,200
 back into perfect clarity of focus and you look up and you can see the Hallow Cline above you.

283
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,200
 But you meet the salt water version of yourself on the other side upside down. Yes yes yes and

284
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:41,040
 then you have to climb using fishy ice hulls downwards. Early cave divers. The first UK cave

285
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,360
 diver was in 1935 and potentially this is the first world cave dive. Quite late. That's what I

286
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,680
 thought right? I read in a few places this was the world's first cave diving and then a few others

287
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,520
 first UK. It happened at Wookie Hall and it was a lady called Penelope Powell and she did it with

288
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,280
 a guy called Graham Balkam. I think that yeah I think it is in the UK because you find lots of

289
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,720
 accounts of other people trying similar things around the world and usually you just attach a

290
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,640
 hose to yourself and go deep in but definitely in Britain and it's thought of as the birth of

291
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,440
 cave diving. Yeah it's like a proper sport basically. Yeah so Balkam actually tried going into a

292
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,520
 different cave first and he made his own massively long snorkel out of a hose pipe and a woman's

293
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:29,040
 bike frame and he almost died because that didn't work very well. So they upgraded their gear in

294
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,960
 fact when he went down with Penelope Mossy Powell as she was called but it was... Sorry sorry let's

295
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,280
 just go back to that a second. Penelope Powell her nickname was Mossy. Mossy? And is she a singer?

296
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:47,840
 Her nickname was the thirties. Mossy Powell wow. Do we know why she had the nickname? She had just

297
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,080
 hair on the southern side of her body. I'm not sure but I know that you would have gone along

298
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,280
 very well with me. Anyway they then at that point would have a hard hat and that would be attached

299
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,760
 to this hose called the Divers Umbilical which is a basically a combined breathing hose and phone

300
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,320
 so that you could communicate with the surface. So they went into a hole and they went you know

301
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,800
 many many chambers in a long way 170 foot they went in and the air pumps have to be manually

302
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,280
 operated at the surface so they were actually broadcasting on local radio. I don't know why

303
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:26,480
 they didn't make this national. Only local. We'll be right back with Wet Let Wet. You can tune in in

304
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,040
 the Cheddar Gorge area it was an exciting time. Anyway so they were broadcast but their air would

305
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,760
 only last about 50 seconds so they'd be saying it was Mosley Graham who did the talking to the

306
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,080
 surface and then about every 50 seconds he'd have to say actually could I get some more air please

307
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,560
 and then the people at the surface would have to pump air in. Just one more thing on the Wookie

308
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,640
 Hole expedition you can actually see a painting that was done 84 years after the actual event

309
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,440
 occurred and it was done by a guy who's called Philip Gray and he's an artist and he went down

310
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,000
 into the place where she went so he dove down with his with his painting equipment and a light

311
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,080
 and he did the painting down there it's the first of its kind. You have to explain how. So I'm guessing

312
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,920
 this is because it was a bit odd. I'm excited to hear your guesses. Do you know the actual answer?

313
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:22,240
 He went 19 feet down so either he went down and there's a cave system where he could pop up into

314
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,280
 a dry bit and he could illuminate it so he had everything let's say in a plastic bag as a block

315
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,680
 and then he painted the painting there put it put the painting in the bag and then came back up

316
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,920
 which I'm guessing must be the way. He definitely painted it there he didn't go down take a photo

317
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,480
 and then painted it. No he painted it down there. If you were to use water paints right but you use

318
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,760
 salt water and you're in the you're above the hallow client you're above the hallow client might it

319
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,320
 still work. Yeah yeah so I think it's gonna be pretty blurry painting. Is it possible the painting

320
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,600
 is just absolute dog shit? It looks pretty cool actually. I think it looks good. I'm sorry I'm sorry.

321
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:04,240
 I was looking at the world's deepest dive in scuba this is and it was by Ahmed Gabba in the Red Sea

322
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:15,200
 in 2014 and he went 1090 feet down the dive took 13 hours and 15 minutes. What? The thing is 13 hours

323
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,560
 50 minutes how much of that do you think he was going down? Oh not very much because you have to

324
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,200
 slowly come back up because otherwise you'd get the decompression stuff. So he was going back up

325
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:32,880
 for 10 hours of it. He went down for 15 minutes and then had to come back up for 13 hours and 35

326
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,800
 minutes. It's like when you're driving along the motorway and it's incredibly clear the way

327
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:42,480
 you're going and you can see the other side of the motorway. I'm only going down to the

328
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,200
 station I've got to come back through that. And obviously if he went quicker then he'd get the

329
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,680
 bends. He'd die. Do you know another thing that you can get from diving which isn't the bends and

330
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,280
 isn't as dangerous as the bends but is nitrogen narcosis which sounds actually quite fun. It's

331
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,960
 basically getting drunk and it's also known as the martini effect. Divers compare it to drinking

332
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,640
 one martini for every 10 meters that you descend after 30 meters. It doesn't really seem to cause

333
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,080
 much harm except to your judgement which can be a problem. Sorry so let's just work this out. So

334
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:25,040
 after 30 meters every 10 meters it's one martini. This guy went 332 meters. It's basically like he

335
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:35,120
 had 30 martinis. He was absolutely hammered. My limit is two. I think genuinely one of them

336
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:45,040
 gets me pretty too. How do you like your martinis Mr. Bub? Oh yeah. This is fine. Where's the fucking

337
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:54,880
 olive? Bubba looks at the empty jar of olives. It came with 33 olives. Wow. That's incredible.

338
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,000
 It is. So there is a way to get around it if you don't want to be completely pissed 300 meters

339
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,080
 underwater. Oh you drink a small glass of milk before you go down, don't you? That just helps.

340
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:12,720
 Big roast dinner and then pop down. No you use helium instead of nitrogen. So normally diving

341
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,040
 equipment, the gas that you have is oxygen and nitrogen combination and the the ratio depends

342
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,080
 on kind of what kind of dive you're doing but weirdly you can replace nitrogen with helium

343
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,720
 and apparently we can kind of breathe that okay as well. They don't quite know why this doesn't

344
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,120
 give you the narcosis but helium is less fat soluble and it seems like there's more soluble

345
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,360
 the gas the more drunk you'll get and so I guess it's pretty bad though if you're in trouble it's

346
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:45,920
 like oh boy oh boy oh boy could someone help me I'm really stuck I'm getting stuck dancing

347
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:57,120
 in this ice pack. Okay it is time for fact number three and that is my fact. My fact this week is

348
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,720
 that every cup of mint tea you drink contains the essence of a hundred insects. This is part of

349
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,920
 a study which was done by Trier University in Germany a guy called Henrik Krehenwinkel he's

350
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:15,840
 an ecological geneticist and basically what he was looking into is how can we monitor invasive

351
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,360
 pests how can we see if a insect is going endangered around the world one thought that came

352
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,760
 about is this new development which has been around for a bit now EDNA. We mentioned it years ago in

353
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,480
 our book of the year 2019 where we talked about a New Zealand scientist called Neil Gamble going to

354
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,520
 Loch Ness and trying to look for the dandruff of the Loch Ness monster. It's basically the idea is

355
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,440
 that you take a little scoop of something whether it's like water I guess tea in this case and then

356
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,920
 you look very very closely at all the molecules in it and you can find remnants of the DNA can't you

357
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,800
 of other stuff that once passed through the scene. And the E stands for environmental so it's things

358
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,200
 that have been in the area like you might have breathed on it and given some of your DNA to it

359
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,800
 or yeah exactly so one of the things that they thought they would test out is could you tell from

360
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,880
 taking a sample of tea from an area could you look through it with the EDNA method and work

361
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,800
 out how many different species have been landing on the plants peeing on the plants chewing on the

362
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,160
 plants doing whatever it is on the plants and if you could do that and you could get that information

363
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,200
 then you could look to let's say plants that are hidden in museums from the same area from years ago

364
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,440
 and you would be able to tell is there a decrease in the population is there an increase so clever

365
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,880
 you could look at other it's an interesting way of then looking at how pesticides can travel

366
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,760
 across the world on boats and so on and become a pest somewhere else you can then suddenly notice

367
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,280
 by testing tea leaves from say barley you'd be like hang on a second there's there's a sudden

368
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,000
 showing up of this invasive pest which they don't have here and they can get on top of it before

369
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,920
 it then takes over is it clever or is it lazy is it just a scientist saying I could go to barley

370
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,280
 or india and investigate this or I could pop to asda pick up some of these tips it could be both

371
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,920
 can't it often the clever thing to do is the lazy thing because you're saving resources very good

372
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,160
 point yeah but that but that is what literally they were doing they were popping to their local

373
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,240
 grocery stores and they were just buying teas from around the world I think it's what's amazing

374
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,600
 because they're Trier this university in Germany right that one of the reasons that this is such

375
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,600
 a good place to study this is that Trier has a specimen bank and the role of the specimen bank

376
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,560
 is just to collect leaves from different trees across Germany and they've been doing it for 35

377
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,040
 years they've been doing it for decades I'm not sure what their original justification is in my

378
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,720
 garden yeah they gave for a fee and they they freeze the leaves in liquid nitrogen so there's

379
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,040
 this German specimen bank which is just a load of leaves in liquid nitrogen I mean it's insane

380
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,080
 well and they've just gone we know this will come in handy one day and it has yeah it genuinely has

381
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,760
 it's unbelievable yeah the reason the tea is so useful is that if you technically from a herbarium

382
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,320
 you know it's a sort of samples of ancient plants that what they do is they keep leaves dark and dry

383
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,080
 basically to keep them in a kind of suspended animation and that is basically the same process

384
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,960
 as making tea because you're drying the leaves out you're shredding them up and you're just keeping

385
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,760
 them in kind of suspended animation in a teabag and so that it's perfect to test that as opposed to

386
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,080
 herbarium it's amazing and uh krem winkel this guy he says that straight elva hands christian

387
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:21,840
 anderson novel yeah he said little boy little girl come to my tea and pour him now he's following

388
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:30,560
 the trail of teabags I've left he said probably 99.999% or something like this of DNA which we extract

389
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,400
 is the tea DNA and only a tiny fraction of what's left is from insects and he says which of course

390
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,120
 is good for tea drinkers because they want to drink the tea and not the insects but he says

391
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,440
 that actually it's quite good to know that there's some tiny bits of arthropod DNA because that shows

392
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,040
 that they haven't used really loads and loads of pesticides yeah so that's kind of clever yeah and

393
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,760
 if you want to try it yourself contribute to his research he claims that you can dry your own plants

394
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,520
 now I don't know if he's actually accepting these specimens but he says if you want to dry your own

395
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,880
 plants and I thought this was quite cool you just need you can get like a ziploc bag sourced from

396
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,680
 some diver presumably and then you dry plants out by just popping in one of those weird silica

397
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:30,720
 packets that you get inside oh I always eat those that's really funny um EDNA oh yeah it floats in

398
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,120
 air you just take if you take an air sample there will be tiny tiny amounts of EDNA floating in it

399
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,560
 so like if someone comes into this room later today after we've gone home yeah and they took

400
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,080
 a jam jar of air they'd be able to get bits of our DNA pretty much yeah it's amazing it's amazing

401
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,240
 but this led me on to another fact and this was actually sent to us by a listener recently called

402
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,520
 Andrew Ferguson so thank you to Andrew for this and you might find this fact familiar but it's

403
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,000
 that on a windy day in San Francisco Zoo strands of giraffe semen can be found floating on the breeze

404
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,440
 yeah I remember that fact now that was posted on the qi boards by james 12 years ago

405
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,360
 and it's based on an interview with a zookeeper at San Francisco and I followed the link to the

406
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,920
 original interview with the zookeeper and it's no longer on the internet they'll have suppressed

407
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,400
 that like billy though won't they because that will not do ticket sales any good but I bet that's

408
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,640
 one of the facts that we must have posted a dozen times on the internet like that I've tried

409
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,840
 about it because it's amazing yeah and it's just taken a life of its own yeah if you test the air

410
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:38,720
 in a zoo yeah with a jam jar you can work out which animals are in the zoo by using e-dna

411
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,160
 what how useful how incredibly useful I'm always going to the zoo and not being able to tell which

412
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,600
 animals are there well you know for instance you could get go to a zoo get a jam jar get a load

413
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:56,480
 of air close the jam jar take the air away go to a pcr laboratory and then it will tell you

414
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,120
 they have giraffes there really interesting really as really useful for when the sign is down

415
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,440
 yeah the giraffe enclosure london zoo's actually done away with the guides now they just hand you

416
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,040
 a jam jar on arrival it would be an incredibly good kind of like crap alternate zoo it's just

417
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,840
 the jam jar zoo it's the cheapskate parents visit to the zoo you don't cross the barriers you just

418
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:24,640
 scoop it to the jar take it home with your kids and go look there's giraffes in here well um there

419
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,680
 are two studies that have found this one in Denmark and one in England but one interesting part about

420
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,920
 it is that you can not only tell which species are in the zoo but you can get DNA from the food

421
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:43,520
 that's fed to the animals so if you're feeding your giraffe like vole sausages then it would

422
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,080
 collect the DNA from the voles as well even though there aren't any voles in your zoo wow and then you

423
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,600
 can get the zoo I presume shut down because that feels like it breaches some rules doesn't it

424
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,800
 vol sausage that feels like it's an even better zoo now in the jar you know because you're getting

425
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,000
 more you're getting more animals than you yeah yeah yeah I don't think does anyone does anyone eat

426
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,720
 vole I've never there's not much meat on a vole I don't think no no it needs to be quite desperate

427
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:18,080
 Heston's probably done it yeah um have you got other edna stuff I don't know good stuff cool great

428
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:26,320
 I got some stuff about voles um there was an area of the UK where they used edna in the water

429
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,440
 and they found that there must be some water voles there by looking at the edna oh yeah and then a

430
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,640
 bit later they put a kind of video camera up and found that there was water voles there so it just

431
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,680
 shows that it works great okay that's what I thought you were gonna say it was just giraffes having a

432
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:50,880
 picnic I was looking at the relationships between tea and animals you know like tea pests and there's

433
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,600
 actually certain types of tea which rely on tea pests to be made there's the tea green leaf hopper

434
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,840
 which is one of the main attacks of the tea plant also has lots of other names it's called the tea

435
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:08,160
 jacid or smoke boy or jumping boy and actually you get special tea which um waits for the tea green

436
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,280
 leaf hopper to attack it because then tea releases these chemicals it releases very specific chemicals

437
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,360
 depending on what it knows is attacking it and the chemicals it releases when it's attacked by this

438
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,280
 creature actually make the tea taste quite nice so if you get it at the right time you get um for

439
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,560
 instance something called dong ding oolong um tea which actually I think it's pronounced tongue

440
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,600
 ting but I like the idea of changing the phrase ding dong yeah dong ding it's like you know what's

441
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:41,600
 he called leslie philips if leslie philips goes through that layer of salt water he goes dong ding

442
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:49,200
 have you need to know who leslie philips is if you don't know who leslie philips is then why are

443
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:56,720
 you listening to this we can help you yeah anyway brownie it tastes like honey google hq's gonna

444
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,280
 freak their nuts but they see the spike on leslie philips it's like you're on it's been a leslie philips

445
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:11,680
 event um the shot hole borough is a teapest shot hole I said um it's latin name is eulacea

446
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:19,600
 fornicatus oh dear do you know how it got the name fornicatus anyone can guess it was the only

447
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:25,280
 was the first specimen found in the act of having sex was it shagging the scientist as he discovered

448
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,760
 it no it's because the word fornicate means arch shaped doesn't really it does fornix in latin

449
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,000
 means arch and so it's nothing to do with fornication as you guys thought apart from that the word

450
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,560
 fornix also meant brothel because brothels were often found in vaults oh wow and that's why we

451
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,920
 get the word fornication that's so interesting so if you're not actually in a vault it doesn't

452
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:58,400
 count as fornicating I'm here in a legal loophole you're on it I present the flat roof

453
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,680
 which exonerates my client

454
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:10,080
 um one of the guys responsible for tea uh particularly asam tea was robert the bruce

455
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:16,400
 that's it yeah specifically a Scottish man called robert bruce oh come on sorry

456
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,240
 middle name there I don't know he's just robert bruce he was a Scottish man who was in India

457
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:30,000
 in the 1820s and um this story is quite boring actually no spiders involved no battles he does

458
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,560
 share a moderately common name with a great skudget hero but not the same but similar similar

459
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,320
 similar yeah great um I was really saved us all a minute of time actually no thank you yeah I

460
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:49,360
 appreciate it I was reading about ways that farmers try to avoid using pesticides and

461
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:55,040
 use nature or whatever they can in order to help their crops and uh one of the methods that's used

462
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:02,000
 is there's an army of ducks that people hire in order to eat all of the pests so quite famously

463
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,200
 in Cape Town in South Africa there's a wine estate where they employ around 2000 ducks that every

464
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:14,240
 morning they walk from their little duck homes all the way to um the the vineyard and the ducks

465
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,600
 spend a full day there uh just eating all of the worms and all of the why don't they keep the ducks

466
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,280
 next to the vineyard so they don't need to walk all the way from their duck well it's the cost of

467
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,560
 accommodation isn't it it's you know you can't you've got to commute sometimes and you want to

468
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,320
 separate work from personal life as well because yeah they get up at 7 a.m they all march as one uh

469
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:38,080
 to work at 10 30 uh they spend the day eating the snails and the pests um back home by 4 p.m

470
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,800
 10 30 till 4 yeah oh bloody hell I think they actually the bosses should be cracking the web

471
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,320
 a bit more well they back home by 4 they leave at 7 30 no no no they get up at 7 right they go to

472
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,840
 work at 10 30 they're back by 4 so they're knocking off at 2 30 I'd say but here's the thing as well

473
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,080
 so these are uh runner ducks and so what it means is that they've got great speed on them so if they

474
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:03,120
 see a snail going for a leaf they could get there before it does an ordinary duck there's no way it

475
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:10,960
 could catch a snail you need a special runner duck so here's the thing though they have to hire along

476
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,600
 with the ducks to come with them a bunch of geese who act as bodyguards to the ducks there oh my god

477
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,240
 because this is a cartoony oh this is something I've seen before this is this is the old woman

478
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,240
 who's wanted to fly some warped version of it who's guarding the geese the old woman who hired a duck

479
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:34,080
 what the fuck she hired a duck so the problem is is that the ducks get spooked really easily if

480
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:39,840
 they're eating the snails and so on let's say an owl comes by right the geese's job is to scare away

481
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,400
 the owls and all the other animals that come in that because apparently as soon as a duck sees an

482
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,600
 owl it just freaks out and they all go scattering and running away it causes chaos so yeah but here's

483
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:55,440
 the thing it's used for many different kinds of fields and farms uh but the one thing it's not

484
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,200
 used for is for tea leaves and it's because you have to pick something that the ducks themselves

485
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,000
 aren't going to want to eat and they apparently love tea leaves so I cannot believe the climax of

486
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 this story is that tea is the one thing that does not involve this very convoluted process

487
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,640
 and the really interesting thing is this is nothing to do with what we're talking about

488
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,760
 it is this is a pest control but they can't use it for tea leaves you know what I saved us a minute

489
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,960
 earlier am I not talking about robert the roost oh my god no look it's a pest it's tangentially

490
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:41,760
 okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that is

491
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,280
 Anna my fact is that the first railway in greenland was built to transport a meteorite

492
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,840
 first and and one of the only I think lots of places say the only but James I think you might

493
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:59,360
 have found some other rogue railways in greenland oh yeah found all sorts so there'll be the green

494
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:07,200
 and railway section later but um this is a really interesting story which I found after some seriously

495
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,760
 in-depth research actually took me ages to get there but eventually on the back of an innocent

496
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,000
 smoothie bottle uh Hannah yeah why are we getting our facts from innocent smoothie bottles look I

497
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,880
 read this and I thought because Anna's clearly on a side hustle advertising deal with innocent

498
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,520
 smoothie I'm not saying that it's any better or worse than other smoothies but um it wasn't where

499
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,120
 the fact came from but it's it led me to it because it said in 1894 an explorer found a meteorite on

500
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:38,480
 the sensibly named meteorite island funny bit of humor from innocent um he decided to take it home

501
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,600
 because it's the biggest ever but weighing 58 tons it took three years and a new railway to get it back

502
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,040
 while it got there in the end this guy's story has taught us a lot mainly that it's better to stick to

503
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,640
 the lighter things in life innocent smoothies have 30 lighter on natural sugar this smoothie is a

504
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,560
 lot easier to carry home than a meteorite that's a shoehorn isn't it rock on that's a shoe oh it's

505
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,480
 an amazing fact that the brontes all died from drinking graveyard water what that reminds us

506
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,880
 are innocent is that actually life is not never ending and you should enjoy every second of it

507
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,480
 and why not enjoy the next few seconds by having this delicious innocent smoothie I thought it was

508
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,200
 one of the best crowbars I've ever seen have you tried actually have you tried the innocent um graveyard

509
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:30,480
 smoothie it's um it's an acquired taste a lot of body a lot of body anyways I thought that's what the

510
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:36,000
 hell are they talking about that's absolutely loopy um but then no looked looked into it and this was

511
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:44,400
 from an expedition in the 1890s into Greenland it was by the explorer Robert Peary and he was

512
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,680
 led by Inuit guides to a meteorite that people have been hearing about for almost a hundred years

513
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,160
 um but hadn't quite been able to track down so the Inuits knew where it was and used it a lot as

514
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,600
 I'm sure we'll talk about and other Europeans had got there tried to find it eventually he found it

515
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:06,720
 and the biggest piece which is called Anigito was so heavy that he had to construct kind of a

516
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,440
 little railroad by laying down lots of timber and then putting steel rail tracks I think it was sort

517
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,240
 of two mini bits because you had to build one bit of railroad road to sort of push it up the hill

518
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:22,160
 then they rolled it down the hill to the harbour and then once on the coastline then they had to

519
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,040
 build another railroad over a bridge that they constructed to get it onto the boat wow it's

520
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,400
 amazing he went to enormous lengths to steal this quite important aspect

521
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:37,600
 that's one way of looking at it yeah yeah and it's not a quick heist is it it's it's quite

522
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:43,280
 noticeable yeah he took all three I think yes I think are they still to this day at the American

523
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,760
 Museum of Natural History one of them is the biggest one is in the American Museum of Natural

524
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,080
 History yeah and there's tens of tons and this name means tent didn't doesn't it and then he took

525
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,880
 the other two slightly smaller ones called dog and woman yeah and um the people there they had

526
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,280
 hammer stones and they would chip off bits of the ore and that would allow them to put tips on

527
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,280
 their spears and that kind of thing it was the sole source of metal right in yeah yeah yeah

528
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,960
 but yeah he didn't he did steal it and um when he got back to New York um he made a lot of money

529
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:18,240
 off of it he sold it for $40,000 which is roughly 1.3 mil in today's money the equivalent but before

530
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:23,360
 he did that when the boat docked he'd set it up as like a circus thing where you would come and visit

531
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,760
 to see come see the meteorite and he would charge a quarter for every person it just looks like a

532
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:34,320
 rock yeah but it's more exciting than your jar of edna at the zoo but still it's a big rock but 20

533
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,040
 20,000 people went to see that and he charged them a quarter a piece to go and touch it or have a look

534
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:45,600
 at it and so that's about $5,000 at the time which again is about $150,000 so it became very rich

535
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,520
 off his stolen item when he sold them he was he was selling them to raise the money for another

536
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,280
 journey north that's what he was using the money for yeah he was desperate to get to the north pole

537
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,560
 really he was desperate to get to the north pole basically there were claims for a long time that

538
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:02,640
 peary was the first guy to get to the north pole yeah and those claims are not true he did not

539
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,080
 make it oh you're saying categorically how are you i'm i mean i am on your side here but yeah well

540
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:13,520
 okay um all right let's put it this way right his triumphant expedition to the north pole as we

541
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:20,080
 call it yeah uh was in 1909 and the evidence is as follows uh the only people who witnessed him are

542
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,400
 four iniquate people who were all sworn to secrecy and his man servant Matthew Henson

543
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,360
 his diary was inconsistent he didn't record the readings that would have proved where he got to

544
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,800
 he also was a 54 year old man with no toes uh due to frostbite he would have had to manage three

545
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,520
 times the average speed the expedition had achieved earlier on under less difficult conditions

546
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,280
 that record has never been equaled in the history of Arctic exploration he would have had to

547
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:49,760
 travel 70 miles a day no explorer has ever covered this ground over the same number of days um it

548
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,640
 it just he didn't get there if he had got there it's not even him who really did it was Matthew

549
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:00,800
 Henson who is his partner who is sort of got shunned from history and from that trip to the

550
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,560
 point where he was sort of seen as a man servant they were partners and they were he was an amazing

551
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,720
 explorer himself Matthew Henson it was because he was black that he was sort of not given the credit

552
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,760
 there's lots of thoughts about whether or not he got there but Wally Herbert is the British

553
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,880
 expedition leader who went there to try and use the calculations to see if he managed it

554
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,200
 he claims that he didn't but in the process of doing it Wally Herbert then claimed to be the

555
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:30,000
 first person to do it I think Wally Herbert is definitely a legit explorer whether or not his

556
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 claim that period didn't make it is true or not is different I think I think he definitely made it

557
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,920
 but what's amazing is when you travel and you're trying to get to the north pole the problem is

558
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,960
 is that you're on a moving body of land aren't you the ice is just constantly moving so when

559
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,440
 Wally Herbert was trying to get there you would take a reading of where you were after an hour

560
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,160
 and suddenly you were eight kilometers further away than you were because of the way the ice was

561
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,720
 shifting but the thing is like he was what at the very end I remember reading he was something like

562
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,600
 was it like 130 meters from the north pole and he was kind of on his hands and knees

563
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:10,000
 but luckily some small fishes had made holes so what are the amazing things with Wally is that he

564
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,720
 I think they even passed it at one point and not realized like when they were having a sleep

565
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,280
 they sort of just they just like the the drift took them over yeah so they woke up and they

566
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,680
 realized that it was achievable to get to in the day so they sent a telegram to the queen

567
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:29,200
 saying your majesty we have got to the north pole and the first british to do it risky yeah

568
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,920
 if they haven't actually done that because they hadn't actually done it and the rest of the day

569
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,280
 became a chase to get there so that the telegram wasn't alive and they managed it but just they

570
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,680
 only just it's good to set yourself these challenges sometimes if you've got a deadline yeah I often

571
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,400
 say yes I've researched three of the four facts for this week's show that's all fine but it is in

572
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,120
 america it's very controversial because they you know what peary what peary got there in a lot of

573
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,640
 people's opinions and to say it opinions take out he didn't make well you're gonna be getting a lot

574
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,880
 of emails podcast at qi.com bring it on i'll be surprised if the emails make it to my inbox

575
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:06,320
 i imagine they'll stop about 70 miles short it was all kind of unedifying i think it was that real

576
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:12,320
 desperation for fame and glory and it was so competitive and like you say with henson henson

577
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,440
 probably if they did get there henson claimed to have got there first so henson went for a stroll

578
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,520
 i think when they're at what they thought was roughly the north pole and then henson came back

579
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,080
 this is according to henson's diaries henson came back and was like oh wow so cool i'm pretty sure

580
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:31,360
 i just wandered over to it and i was the first person to be sitting on top of the world what a dick

581
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:39,440
 move just gonna go for a quick uh well then so peary's like what a dick move and so he snuck off

582
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,720
 took two of the inuit guides of the four snuck off and found his own way to what was his own

583
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,720
 you sneak off in a completely speechless environment that's almost that's more impressive actually to

584
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,440
 find a way of sneaking there's one big tree just behind it peary doesn't seem like a great

585
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,000
 guy in a number of ways it's because i haven't got that from you that you think that so one of the

586
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,720
 other things he did and this this really is the truly shabby thing so he persuaded in 1897 which

587
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:11,600
 was his um that was the meteorite nicking uh trip uh heist um he persuaded six inuit people to

588
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,520
 return with him to america kind of so that they could be sort of put on stage as part of a lecture

589
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:22,080
 series um four of them died shortly after arriving uh of tb and the youngest one was called minnick and

590
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,720
 he was adopted by an american family minnick was given an american name he was named minnick peary

591
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,080
 wallace uh and several years later many years later he uh was at the american museum of natural

592
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:37,520
 history and he came across some bones in the ethnographic department which was his father's

593
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:44,720
 skeleton breaking which peary had simply sold to the museum as a kind of display piece minnick

594
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,840
 obviously wanted and fought very hard to have the skeletons returned for a ritual burial uh the

595
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:56,400
 museum refused and um peary eventually paid for minnick to go home but the family's skeletons

596
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,280
 weren't released and buried in green until 1993 yeah but did you see that they gave him a fake

597
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,200
 burial first yeah so when minnick came over uh and his father died and minnick said i need to

598
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,800
 bury him with the proper inuit rituals right um they gave him a bit massive log wearing sort of

599
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,080
 big furs disguised as his dad disguised as sort of shoved his head on i put yeah yeah they pretended

600
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,800
 it was his dad they were burying i guess maybe you don't get up too close um yeah so he thought he

601
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,560
 buried his dad and it was a few years later i think when he was like oh can i tell you about

602
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:31,360
 another railway on greenland because this is all going a bit dark yes yes yes good idea good idea

603
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,280
 there's basically a few that have been built and they're mostly like small ones just to transport

604
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,080
 fish from you know the fishing place to the place where people live they're not very big you know

605
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,800
 it's not like a huge railway going through the country but it's not a tiny one where like carriages

606
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:52,560
 for fish the fish sits in a tiny fish yeah it's not that um but there's a coal railway uh in

607
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:58,800
 greenland and it's on disco island which disco island is the second largest island in greenland

608
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,560
 after the main one and it's one of the hundred largest islands in the world but i'd never heard

609
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:09,200
 about until this week disco island can any of you guess yep how disco island got its name

610
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:17,200
 it's in greenland i mean this feels like another fornicans trap doesn't it i mean yeah disco it's

611
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:22,880
 completely circular it's shaped like a desk one theory the people there they'd do the macarena

612
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,160
 that's where we got the macarena yes that's not a common theory the also the macarena

613
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:36,240
 light bounces off the snow much like a disco ball very good not a theory uh rounded is a theory

614
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:42,640
 okay another one is that it's short for discovery island another one is that the mountains are

615
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:51,040
 quite flat on it so they look like desks desks but the most common is probably that it was named

616
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:57,200
 after a guy called marmaduke he was an english explorer and waila and that it was originally

617
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:04,480
 called duckies island oh then duck hose island and then dick hose island and then dusk goes island

618
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,640
 and eventually disco island wow okay so it's not the next magaloof if anyone's got it on a map

619
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:18,160
 the tickets i got one more fact on peri explorer robert peri brought vaseline to the north pole

620
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:24,800
 to protect his skin from chafing and his mechanical equipment from rusting oh yeah and i found this

621
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:31,920
 fact on a twitter site called at vaseline facts which is yeah which is a great handle unfortunately

622
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:39,280
 it only lasted for three tweets and you got the others um i got yeah but they're not really that

623
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:45,920
 interesting i so the word vaseline derives from the german word wasa water and the greek word

624
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:52,480
 allion yeah olive oil did they do the one about how in south america the movie grease was called

625
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,640
 vaseline oh they should have they should have but no they didn't they kind of just ran out after three

626
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,360
 in the only interaction that this twitter account at vaseline facts had was just one response to

627
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,320
 their tweets which after the one i just told you about um how it got its name uh someone just wrote

628
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:16,160
 back saying din ask and that was and that was from at fuck vaseline facts wow to be honest if i if i'd
