00:00:13,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to"
00:00:18,00:00:23,"you from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here with Anna"
00:00:23,00:00:29,"Tyshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:29,00:00:35,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go!"
00:00:35,00:00:42,Starting with fact number one and that is Andy. My fact is that there's a theory that the Bronte
00:00:42,00:00:47,sisters all died young because they spent a lot of their life drinking graveyard water.
00:00:47,00:00:49,[Music]
00:00:49,00:00:53,You said graveyard water as though we're all familiar with it. It's like spring water.
00:00:53,00:00:56,You've all seen it on the shutters but still sparking.
00:00:56,00:00:58,[Laughter]
00:00:58,00:01:02,"Yeah, well no, you're right. It's not a thing anymore but I think graveyard water was a much"
00:01:02,00:01:10,bigger thing in the 19th century before proper hygiene standards and before proper
00:01:10,00:01:14,you know water piping. So this is water that has happened to go through a graveyard.
00:01:14,00:01:19,"It's filtered, yeah it's filtered. Whenever you buy a bottle of water and it says filtered,"
00:01:19,00:01:24,"that's what it means. No, so they lived in this town called Howarth which is in West Yorkshire"
00:01:24,00:01:30,"and it was an extremely sickly place. Very low life expectancy, excellent running down the streets."
00:01:30,00:01:34,"I mean, you know, bad ventilation. You said it was Yorkshire. Sorry, yeah, okay."
00:01:34,00:01:42,"And also the Bronte family home, the pass nearer to they lived in, right next to it had a graveyard"
00:01:42,00:01:51,and there there is a whoo-hoo and there it was very overcrowded as well and there is a strong
00:01:51,00:01:56,theory or a strong suggestion it's possible that decomposing matter from the graveyard
00:01:56,00:02:00,would have filtered into the water supply and that might have really bandjacked the town's
00:02:00,00:02:05,"overall health. Those who were using kind of public water sources. Yeah, it definitely would have gone"
00:02:05,00:02:11,"into the village which is in like a valley. But yeah, and presumably there weren't taps back"
00:02:11,00:02:15,then so they must have been collecting water from somewhere. So they lived in the past niche and
00:02:15,00:02:22,"they had their own well. Yes, okay. And what I find really interesting is that the well was cleaned"
00:02:22,00:02:29,in 1847 and that was the first time it had been cleaned in 20 years and the father of the Bronte's
00:02:29,00:02:36,wrote that they'd taken eight yellow tin cans out of it. That's how polluted it was. But it was in
00:02:36,00:02:44,"1848 and 1849 that Bramwell, Emily and Anne all died so the year afterwards. So the year after"
00:02:44,00:02:50,their well was out of use perhaps. Right. So maybe they stopped using the well for a bit and then
00:02:50,00:02:54,they started using the more common water that everyone else was drinking and then that might
00:02:54,00:02:58,have made them sick. Did they not think when they were drinking something that looked like Gatorade
00:02:58,00:03:03,"that maybe, maybe that wasn't going to be good for them. If it's the only thing you can drink. Yeah,"
00:03:03,00:03:06,really. What do you do? We actually say the Bronte's died young but you know they lived
00:03:06,00:03:12,"to ripe old ages by comparison. Did they? Well, I mean not really. They lived to 29, 30, 31 and"
00:03:12,00:03:17,39. Exactly. The average life expectancy obviously one has to account for the 40% of people who die
00:03:17,00:03:23,"in early childhood. But yeah, it was 25. And I reckon Charlotte at 38 would have seemed like"
00:03:23,00:03:28,"an old hag by the time she copped it. But yeah, all the others did die pretty young except their"
00:03:28,00:03:35,dad who lived to 84 while all died. It was a very sickly place and the town was inspected in 1850
00:03:35,00:03:41,by a man who was called Benjamin Herschel Babbage and his findings basically were that it was just
00:03:41,00:03:46,an extremely unhealthy place. It was poorly ventilated. Some people were living in cellars.
00:03:46,00:03:51,And it was their dad actually who got this guy in to check the water supply. So it was the year
00:03:51,00:03:56,after three of his children had died and he said we need to do something about this. Do you think
00:03:56,00:04:00,after the first child died he was like oh I must get this water checked and then the second kid
00:04:00,00:04:04,dies he's like damn it I really must get this water check. Well the first one was Bramwell who
00:04:04,00:04:08,died of alcoholism. Yes. Actually he had two daughters who died before that. So they had two
00:04:08,00:04:13,"daughters who died like 14, 15 didn't they which sounds very which is very sad. And they were in"
00:04:13,00:04:17,the school which was right at the bottom of the hill where the water definitely would have been
00:04:17,00:04:24,pretty rank. But Bramwell died of alcoholism but the pub where he drank in is the first place you
00:04:24,00:04:31,get to after if you look at the map it's house graveyard pub and apparently they used to make
00:04:31,00:04:37,their beer out of the water. So is it possible then that we've maligned him and he didn't die of
00:04:37,00:04:41,alcoholism. Well he definitely wasn't alcoholic as well. I think people do say that he might have
00:04:41,00:04:44,died of TB and he was an alcoholic but you know he might have died of other stuff as well. So we
00:04:44,00:04:50,might have unfairly maligned him. There was opium involved as well I think. It was a concoction
00:04:50,00:04:53,of stuff. He wasn't living a very healthy life. I'd say that. But it's always said that alcoholism
00:04:53,00:04:58,during you know not the graveyard order. Yeah I am with Dan here. I actually think that the
00:04:58,00:05:03,Bramwell myth may have been you know taken to the extreme of like this killed him and actually
00:05:03,00:05:08,I'm not sure we totally have evidence. But Babbage's report was funny. He was particularly appalled
00:05:08,00:05:14,by the toilet setup in the village which was consisted of two toilets that were shared each
00:05:14,00:05:20,by like 12 families. So they were out in the street and he was appalled by the public view of them
00:05:20,00:05:25,which I don't think contributes to people's ill health. You might do. That people could see you
00:05:25,00:05:29,while you're pooing. Yeah he basically said there's in fact he said there's two toilets that are just
00:05:29,00:05:34,on the public street in view of the houses and of passes by whilst a third is perched upon an
00:05:34,00:05:39,eminence commanding the whole length of the main street. Have you ever been like have you ever been
00:05:39,00:05:43,to like a restaurant or something that's on the top of a really high building and then sometimes
00:05:43,00:05:48,they put the toilet and they have pretty much a window because there's nothing else can look in
00:05:48,00:05:53,and you can poo and look out over the whole city. No I've never seen that. I can't remember where I've
00:05:53,00:05:57,been and done that but it's really it's something it's quite something. It sounds quite uncommon.
00:05:57,00:06:02,You said it is though it might be a standard thing in high buildings but I'm not sure it's normal.
00:06:02,00:06:09,No actually no my local Greg's has one of those. You could sit in Greg's and as an eminence over
00:06:09,00:06:16,the whole of South London. So the the brontes in general they're putting them back together in a
00:06:16,00:06:21,way. Pretty much so basically all the contents of the house were sold off after Patrick who's the
00:06:21,00:06:26,father pop Bronte he died in 1861 and all the contents were sold off because you know you
00:06:26,00:06:31,have a new person who comes in and the furniture changes. Because he was a was a curate vicar
00:06:31,00:06:36,priestee guide not a priest because he has six children but the Bronte society they've been
00:06:36,00:06:40,putting the house back together which is very exciting and they've been slowly slowly buying
00:06:40,00:06:45,an auction various bits of Bronte paraphernalia so there was a table that they wrote at one
00:06:45,00:06:51,kind of normal medium-sized darkwood table 580 000 pounds it's been bought.
00:06:51,00:06:57,But did they all write on this table? I think a lot of them did. I don't know if any key works
00:06:57,00:07:01,would definitely pinned on that table but it was the writing table. Do you think that's a big table?
00:07:01,00:07:06,Yeah do you think like as a writer that you are and we all are really do you think that really now
00:07:06,00:07:11,we should get actually quite a nice ornate table because in the future they're gonna look at it and
00:07:11,00:07:16,go on that table from Ikea was like yeah what's the point of putting that in a museum? Exactly I
00:07:16,00:07:22,like Terry Pratchett's table where he wrote most of his novels as soon as he passed away his assistant
00:07:22,00:07:28,Rob put a glass plate over the table so that every single scuff mark every single you know mug
00:07:28,00:07:34,wear and yeah it's there now for all time. It's a great idea. It's like chewing them underneath.
00:07:37,00:07:42,Another really cool item I don't know if it was at auction that they had to buy it back or
00:07:42,00:07:46,whether they just still have it but Charlotte Bronte was given a bit of Napoleon's coffin
00:07:46,00:07:51,which is really cool. How did they get his coffin? He was dead. Oh yeah. Because he had about seven
00:07:51,00:07:55,coffins I think Napoleon he was inside multiple layers. Like a Russian doll. Like a Russian doll
00:07:55,00:08:01,yeah yeah he's there was a small coffin. It's quite awkward for Napoleon as a poor guy. Do you mean like
00:08:01,00:08:09,a French pastry or something? Did you say Charlotte got Napoleon's coffin? Yeah yeah from her sexy
00:08:09,00:08:15,Belgian tutor who she was in love with. Really? He was a married man so I don't think any impropriety
00:08:15,00:08:20,ever occurred but she she loved him and they had quite a good friendship as well so yeah.
00:08:20,00:08:23,Because she wasn't the big Napoleon fan this is the great thing about the Bronte is when they were
00:08:23,00:08:28,younger they actually wrote more words than when they were adults because they wrote these amazing
00:08:28,00:08:34,books together these fairy tales and they were they created worlds they created the world of
00:08:34,00:08:39,angrier and gondol and I think this was based on some toy soldiers that
00:08:39,00:08:43,Bramwell got given by their dad but they all played with them and they all claimed a soldier
00:08:43,00:08:48,and Emily claimed Wellington and then Bramwell claimed Napoleon and they'd sort of like fight
00:08:48,00:08:53,each other and stuff and then the other two claimed a gravy boy and a waiting boy but I think they
00:08:53,00:08:58,upgraded them at some point to the Antarctic explorers Paris and Ross. A gravy boy? A gravy boy
00:08:58,00:09:03,yeah. Again just like I said gravy had water like it was a thing. I don't think a gravy boy is a thing.
00:09:03,00:09:07,You know in American football they have a water boy who brings on all of their drinks and stuff.
00:09:07,00:09:15,But I do now yeah. Well gravy boy is the same in cricket. On your cucumber sandwiches. Yeah yeah
00:09:15,00:09:20,"she's bringing some gravy. Was she quite obsessed with Wellington, Emily? I don't know how obsessed"
00:09:20,00:09:26,she was. She probably was. I think she was and I think she met him later in life in like his late
00:09:26,00:09:32,"life. Napoleon was buried in a lot of coffins like a beef Wellington. Yeah, wasn't he? That's"
00:09:32,00:09:38,even worse. Doesn't make sense. Beef Wellington doesn't have multiple pastry layers. Puff pastry.
00:09:38,00:09:43,I suppose it is it is layered. It's got a layer of mushrooms and stuff. Yeah he was covered in duck
00:09:43,00:09:51,cells. Just on their on their writing as kids and the cool stuff that they had. I don't know if
00:09:51,00:09:55,any of these remain but they wrote in tiny books sometimes. So some of their stories they wrote
00:09:55,00:09:59,in books that were small enough for their dolls or their soldiers to read. Which sounds so cool.
00:09:59,00:10:05,The writing is microscopic and I think there was one book that in fact we do have some of them because
00:10:05,00:10:10,"there are photos and they're about like the size of the thumb, human thumb really. We know there's"
00:10:10,00:10:15,one because actually the Bronte house has bought one of them back. Have they million pounds? The
00:10:15,00:10:21,tiny book or the tiny book? I don't know. I have no idea how they're funding it. Oh actually I do
00:10:21,00:10:27,know how they might be funding it because the actual Bronte's themselves were funded indirectly
00:10:27,00:10:33,through piracy. So wait so Grandpa Bronte he was a trader but also he had plenty of dealings with
00:10:33,00:10:38,Cornish pirates who committed actual murders and a lot of his money a lot of his estate would have
00:10:38,00:10:42,come from his nefarious activities and the Bronte sisters paid for their novels to be published
00:10:42,00:10:46,and they did a lot of that thanks to money they got from their aunt on that side of the family.
00:10:46,00:10:51,So basically they were pirate funded. So you're saying that the current Bronte estate has some
00:10:51,00:10:55,sort of treasure chest that they're still taking book liens out of. Where are they getting these
00:10:55,00:11:00,millions from? They pay for anything in doubloons if you notice that for the auctions. I read an
00:11:00,00:11:05,article about the Bronte society who run the museum. I don't know if it's the same people
00:11:05,00:11:11,"but apparently they made a loss last year of £100,000 and actually because not many people"
00:11:11,00:11:17,have been visiting I think possibly due to Covid they've been asking firms in the UK who use the
00:11:17,00:11:22,name Bronte they're saying well you know okay fine you're allowed to use nothing we can do but
00:11:22,00:11:26,can you not give us a bit of money for it. And Richard Wilcox who's the chairman of the Bronte
00:11:26,00:11:33,society he said there are dozens of companies who are selling Bronte stone cooked chicken
00:11:34,00:11:39,outdoor clothing. Have you never had a Bronte chicken? Bronte fried chicken it's lovely it's
00:11:39,00:11:44,been uh how's it cooked it's sort of they leave it on a moor for three days. Yeah it's very moorish
00:11:44,00:11:52,and also spring water and what I found is that there is Bronte water that you can buy from the
00:11:52,00:12:00,springs in Howarth. No we've ruined their industry with this podcast. And I just want to kind of
00:12:00,00:12:05,balance it out to say that they are part of a company called Waterlogic UK and they recently
00:12:05,00:12:11,announced the world's first Covid secure range of drinking water dispensers. Okay actually weirdly
00:12:11,00:12:16,the Bronte society themselves just on Bronte merch they do they sell a Branwell Bronte I think it's a
00:12:16,00:12:25,wine bottle stopper or a corkscrew but given that he died of alcoholism. I wonder if they get a cut
00:12:25,00:12:29,from all the companies then that are in this town where they grew up. Well that's what they're saying
00:12:29,00:12:32,they don't and at the moment there's no legal reason that they should. Because they've really
00:12:32,00:12:37,come for it haven't they like all the salons are like Jane Hare you know and stuff like just like
00:12:37,00:12:47,I love that so Charlotte Bronte was a teacher and in 1836 she started writing about her
00:12:47,00:12:53,experience as a teacher and she's just so mean to the students it's amazing there's one extract which
00:12:53,00:12:59,says am I to spend all the best part of my life in this wretched bondage forcibly suppressing my
00:12:59,00:13:05,rage at the idleness the apathy and the hyperbolical and most asinine stupidity of those fat-headed
00:13:05,00:13:10,oats. Wow like she did not like her kids. Teachers listening to this are nodding as well right
00:13:10,00:13:16,now. Is that Emily? That was Charlotte. Charlotte sorry sorry. I have a theory about Bramwell Bronte
00:13:16,00:13:26,which is that he inspired a very famous film okay it's um to do with his okay no no I'm going to
00:13:26,00:13:29,give you a clue first otherwise I don't think you'll get there. Did he want to stop someone and his
00:13:29,00:13:35,mum shot someone? Yeah. Oh Jesus Christ okay you only know two films between you. Andy knows.
00:13:35,00:13:42,It's Avatar. It's Avatar. So it's what yeah yeah. He was green. Yeah yeah. Lou. I was thinking of the Hulk.
00:13:42,00:13:49,No so he um he basically had this affair we think um and this is partly based on the biography of
00:13:49,00:13:54,Charlotte that was written by Mrs Gaskell very interestingly so Patrick the dad commissioned
00:13:54,00:13:59,"Mrs Gaskell to write. Who we should say Charlotte. Famous author, famous British author. Did she"
00:13:59,00:14:04,have a first name? Elizabeth but she always goes by Mrs. Bizarrely snobbish about that like when
00:14:04,00:14:09,she wrote to George Elliott once she said um love love your stuff George but I wish I could be
00:14:09,00:14:14,addressing a Mrs rather than a miss. Just a bit. Given that she was writing to someone trading under
00:14:14,00:14:19,a man's name. Yeah. An insane thing to say. And also don't upset George Elliott because you're
00:14:19,00:14:24,going to get a big right hand. She'll have that you and you will not come back from that.
00:14:24,00:14:31,But anyway what we think is that Brownwell had an affair with this much older woman. He was 25
00:14:31,00:14:36,and she was 43 and he was working as a governess not a governess. A governess. A governess. A
00:14:36,00:14:43,tutor for her children. Mrs Doubtfire. Exactly. I really thought you were going to get it there.
00:14:45,00:14:52,You know it. So she's called Lydia Robinson and that's Brownwell Bronte as the initials are BB
00:14:52,00:14:56,and in the film the very famous film The Graduate obviously where Mrs Robinson is the older woman
00:14:56,00:15:03,who seduces a younger man. It's Benjamin Braddock initials BB. Okay. And the author of the original
00:15:03,00:15:08,book I don't think ever commented on whether it was inspired by that but it was a famous affair
00:15:08,00:15:14,between an old woman. Charlotte had a superpower by the way. Oh yeah. She could see in the dark
00:15:15,00:15:20,how cool is that. Well in the absolute pitch dark. Yeah basically I mean that was there's stories
00:15:20,00:15:24,that she was short-sighted so short-sighted that if she was trying to even play piano she couldn't
00:15:24,00:15:29,read the sheet music it was that it was that bad for her. But as soon as the lights went out as soon
00:15:29,00:15:35,as it was night time her students said that she could read perfectly what was on the page
00:15:35,00:15:41,when no one else could. Right. Okay. It's good fact. It's a great fact. Thank you. We don't
00:15:41,00:15:46,acknowledge each other's facts that often on the show but a truly good one comes up I'm glad
00:15:46,00:15:51,we did. It sounds like she was an inspiring teacher who you know. A lot of people said this.
00:15:51,00:15:55,Taught her kids an imaginative story. No she could she could do. No. I think actually I do
00:15:55,00:16:01,by that because I know that Anne the youngest of the sisters she could hear things over 300 miles
00:16:01,00:16:07,away. She could bring metal to her. And then their green brother Bramwell only when he got angry
00:16:08,00:16:19,destroy everything. Okay it is time for fact number two and that is James. Okay my fact this week
00:16:19,00:16:27,is that if you swim too close to an iceberg you can get sucked in. Not in danger of it. Not one of
00:16:27,00:16:31,my top worries I don't think. It's worth remembering you never know when you might find yourself in
00:16:31,00:16:37,that situation Anna. You're right on Titanic too or something. So yeah how do they do that? Do they
00:16:37,00:16:42,generate their own currents near them? They do not. In a way they generate their own currents.
00:16:42,00:16:46,They're moving around a lot. They're changing a lot. Icebergs are melting all the time.
00:16:46,00:16:52,Lots of changes inside an iceberg and I'm especially talking about very big ones and when
00:16:52,00:16:58,things are moving around currents get formed and that's what happened. And I read this in I was
00:16:58,00:17:04,basically going through some old archives of an NPR radio show called Only a Game and I found this
00:17:04,00:17:11,article from 2001 about someone called Jill Hyneth and she is one of the most remarkable people I've
00:17:11,00:17:18,ever come across in the 20 years I've done this job. She was the first person to swim inside of
00:17:18,00:17:24,an iceberg. There was a massive one that carved off from Antarctica. It was about the size of Jamaica
00:17:24,00:17:30,and she and her partner went to National Geographic and said we'd like to do this article about
00:17:30,00:17:35,diving through the caves of icebergs and they said wow really there are caves in icebergs and
00:17:35,00:17:42,they went we think so and sure enough they got some funding and they went and did it and the story
00:17:42,00:17:50,of her going through this iceberg is remarkable. My wife's gone to swim in an iceberg the size of
00:17:50,00:17:59,a Caribbean island. Jamaica? Yes. Extraordinarily she went up her own accord. Completely bizarre
00:17:59,00:18:07,decision. Yeah it sounds absolutely incredible doesn't it and some quite dodgy moments in there.
00:18:07,00:18:13,"Every moment, every moment is dodgy in there. Yeah so first of all they are next to this massive"
00:18:13,00:18:17,iceberg and they jump into the water and the first thing that happens is you're jumping into
00:18:17,00:18:21,ice cold water and I don't know I'm sure some of you might have done that before it really hits
00:18:21,00:18:27,you hard and it can really take the breath out of you but in her case she said it's like an ice cream
00:18:27,00:18:31,headache like the worst ice cream headache you've ever had is the first thing that you feel and then
00:18:31,00:18:36,you go down and down and down and you see an entrance and you enter this iceberg and it's
00:18:36,00:18:42,all blue like she says it's like a robin's egg the floor's red and orange and yellow all these
00:18:42,00:18:50,amazing colors and then everything goes wrong. And so she and her partner they're swimming through it
00:18:50,00:18:54,and after a while of taking lots of video footage they turn around to go back out
00:18:54,00:18:59,but because it's a melting iceberg because it's a living beast that's just changing shape all the
00:18:59,00:19:05,times their exit shuts and they're stuck inside the iceberg and she's going I'm trying not to
00:19:05,00:19:10,panic because if I start breathing too heavily every breath I take is a precious breath. Every
00:19:10,00:19:18,movie you make. Every movie you make. No one's watching her. So frightening. And so she they
00:19:18,00:19:23,just wait they patiently wait and then a new opening happens it's like a weird mirror labyrinth
00:19:23,00:19:28,you know like something you would see in a weird fantasy movie a new opening happens and they
00:19:28,00:19:32,manage to get out and then they just have to wait a while to acclimatize don't they you can't just
00:19:32,00:19:36,go straight back up so. And so the people on the boat are thinking well they're gone yeah because
00:19:36,00:19:40,they've heard all these changes and this carving and bits have fallen off the people on the boat
00:19:40,00:19:45,are like well that's the end of them then. Yeah but then they come back up they go up they tell
00:19:45,00:19:50,their story it's all going nice you'd think that's enough we've explored it they go let's get back in
00:19:50,00:19:54,there let's do it again so they go for a second time. Well what are the chances of that going
00:19:54,00:19:58,wrong again? Exactly. I mean it's not going to happen twice is it? Yeah it sounded like even
00:19:58,00:20:03,there was a scary moment at one point on this expedition when she resurfaced and the boat I
00:20:03,00:20:08,think had drifted and she came up through a hole in the ice but the ice around her was so high she
00:20:08,00:20:13,couldn't see anything and you're in the middle of the Antarctic and her boat disappeared and I
00:20:13,00:20:17,think the boat just happened to swing around she just glimpsed the stern. It's because they had to
00:20:17,00:20:23,take the anchor up and so it drifted while the anchor was up so they're nearly lost at sea basically
00:20:23,00:20:26,in this moment so they get back on the boat and you think all right let's get back to home. Don't
00:20:26,00:20:32,go back a third time. They go a third time they go a third time and this time they get stuck inside
00:20:32,00:20:38,and in order to get out she basically got up to a point in the iceberg where there was a there
00:20:38,00:20:43,was a gap at the top for them to climb out but it was 130 feet above their heads so you're looking
00:20:43,00:20:47,at a climbing wall basically that's unclimbable except yes and I couldn't quite get it because
00:20:47,00:20:52,she's out of the water by this time so she's just climbing up the iceberg. So she must be inside of
00:20:52,00:20:56,the iceberg where there's a hole on the inside. It's like a triathlon kind of thing you know you
00:20:56,00:21:01,do the swimming bit and then you do the climbing bit. When do you do the cycling bit? There's a
00:21:01,00:21:07,bike at the top of the iceberg. But this is where the story genuinely turns a bit Brian blessedy
00:21:07,00:21:11,for me because I just think this is impossible. So she climbs up 130 feet. But here's the thing
00:21:11,00:21:16,right this is solid ice wall right so how do you climb ice wall and she thinks to herself hang on
00:21:16,00:21:20,there's little animals that burrow themselves into the ice wall which are creating natural
00:21:20,00:21:25,handholds for me to do and apparently there's enough of these that she could scale 130. So it's
00:21:25,00:21:31,a little fish exactly the size of her finger which makes a little hole where it lives. The fish finger
00:21:31,00:21:37,yeah well the finger fish yeah yeah yeah and they make holes in the ice bag and she can use them to
00:21:37,00:21:42,grip onto and pull herself up. So she climbs up yeah I know it's blessed this is suddenly all the way up
00:21:42,00:21:48,all the way 130 feet. The fish living 100 feet up on the iceberg. 130. How did they get up there?
00:21:48,00:21:53,Who no I guess if the previous fish have gone up there. Icebergs flip over all the time.
00:21:53,00:21:57,Yeah don't know do we think what has there been cracks in the iceberg? Oh there's some cracks in
00:21:57,00:22:03,her story. And they all climb out this way 130 feet up and then they're back on the boat and
00:22:03,00:22:09,then they slip down the iceberg. And so they're sitting on the boat not long afterwards I think
00:22:09,00:22:13,they're having some drinks and some food and then suddenly they just hear screaming from other people
00:22:13,00:22:19,on the boat and there's huge cracking noises and basically there's been such a melting point on
00:22:19,00:22:24,the iceberg that it cracks in on itself and they go well if we were in there we'd be dead we'd be
00:22:24,00:22:31,squished in a second so then they go back again no they don't. But what a story. Yeah it is quite
00:22:31,00:22:37,quite an odd thing to choose to do with your life. You must have to have a very unusual
00:22:37,00:22:41,personality not to panic in all of these circumstances like she did one other dive
00:22:42,00:22:47,which she described and it was into a really really small cave so she's a cave diver
00:22:47,00:22:52,basically so underwater cave diver and she was taking a scientist down there with her who obviously
00:22:52,00:22:59,had been trained properly how to dive but the scientist got wedged in this tiny cave and panicked.
00:22:59,00:23:05,Luckily a tiny fish came and nibbled her out. And it was a really nice story because earlier
00:23:05,00:23:11,in the dive she had found that fish and it had a thorn in its fin yes and she pulled the thorn out
00:23:11,00:23:16,and then the fish came back to help her. Yeah okay it's not a Bronte novel it's this is a real life.
00:23:16,00:23:20,So she's wedged? She's wedged and they have a guideline which is the only way you can find your
00:23:20,00:23:25,way back to the entrance of the cave because you know it's full of other channels and tunnels and
00:23:25,00:23:29,stuff so you'll never find your way back otherwise. The guideline's broken which is the only thing to
00:23:29,00:23:33,lead them back to the entrance somehow and I'm not quite sure how Jill does this while she's
00:23:33,00:23:39,trying to fix the guideline she loses her partner who was previously wedged in a rock.
00:23:39,00:23:43,Yeah seems careless a bit of an oversight so she spends 73 minutes desperately looking
00:23:43,00:23:47,for her partner while trapped in this cave no idea if she's gonna escape. That's extraordinary.
00:23:47,00:23:53,And also thinking oh god I've killed this scientist how awkward. But imagine the moment and maybe it's
00:23:53,00:23:57,all worth it for this when finally she realized she has not only found her way to the entrance
00:23:57,00:24:02,but she sees a little glimpse of light but there is wasting at the entrance the scientists who
00:24:02,00:24:06,apparently her mask is just full of tears because the scientists assume that Jill's dead and she's
00:24:06,00:24:12,probably gonna die too waiting at the entrance for her and that's amazing. She was all right and she
00:24:12,00:24:16,said the weirdest thoughts go through your head like when she thought she was gonna die you think
00:24:16,00:24:20,things like oh my god I have to get home then my husband doesn't know how to do the taxes.
00:24:20,00:24:30,Wow that's an amazing story and also it's given me a new respect for the word guideline. Yeah
00:24:30,00:24:34,you know we're so used to hearing about the conceptual guidelines the theoretical ones.
00:24:34,00:24:38,Government guidelines suggest. Yeah exactly and actually guidelines can save your life.
00:24:38,00:24:43,I was reading about what Heinearth studies in the other areas of life because loads of loads of
00:24:43,00:24:50,cave diving particularly and have you guys heard of the Hallow Cline? No. So she studies animals
00:24:50,00:24:56,which are often found beneath the Hallow Cline and the Hallow Cline is a boundary between fresh
00:24:56,00:25:00,water which is higher up and salt water which is lower down and she says the boundary layer is as
00:25:00,00:25:07,thin as a sheet of paper but you can also see it when you're in the cave when you dive. So as you
00:25:07,00:25:13,go through it everything goes blurry for a second because you've broken the barrier between the two
00:25:13,00:25:17,kinds of water. Like going through a mirror which takes you to a parallel universe. It's exactly
00:25:17,00:25:21,like that it's exactly like that and then as soon as you get down to the salt water everything snaps
00:25:21,00:25:25,back into perfect clarity of focus and you look up and you can see the Hallow Cline above you.
00:25:25,00:25:31,But you meet the salt water version of yourself on the other side upside down. Yes yes yes and
00:25:31,00:25:41,then you have to climb using fishy ice hulls downwards. Early cave divers. The first UK cave
00:25:41,00:25:47,diver was in 1935 and potentially this is the first world cave dive. Quite late. That's what I
00:25:47,00:25:51,thought right? I read in a few places this was the world's first cave diving and then a few others
00:25:51,00:25:57,first UK. It happened at Wookie Hall and it was a lady called Penelope Powell and she did it with
00:25:57,00:26:01,a guy called Graham Balkam. I think that yeah I think it is in the UK because you find lots of
00:26:01,00:26:04,accounts of other people trying similar things around the world and usually you just attach a
00:26:04,00:26:08,hose to yourself and go deep in but definitely in Britain and it's thought of as the birth of
00:26:08,00:26:15,cave diving. Yeah it's like a proper sport basically. Yeah so Balkam actually tried going into a
00:26:15,00:26:21,different cave first and he made his own massively long snorkel out of a hose pipe and a woman's
00:26:21,00:26:29,bike frame and he almost died because that didn't work very well. So they upgraded their gear in
00:26:29,00:26:34,fact when he went down with Penelope Mossy Powell as she was called but it was... Sorry sorry let's
00:26:34,00:26:41,just go back to that a second. Penelope Powell her nickname was Mossy. Mossy? And is she a singer?
00:26:41,00:26:47,Her nickname was the thirties. Mossy Powell wow. Do we know why she had the nickname? She had just
00:26:47,00:26:54,hair on the southern side of her body. I'm not sure but I know that you would have gone along
00:26:54,00:26:59,very well with me. Anyway they then at that point would have a hard hat and that would be attached
00:26:59,00:27:03,to this hose called the Divers Umbilical which is a basically a combined breathing hose and phone
00:27:03,00:27:08,so that you could communicate with the surface. So they went into a hole and they went you know
00:27:08,00:27:14,many many chambers in a long way 170 foot they went in and the air pumps have to be manually
00:27:14,00:27:19,operated at the surface so they were actually broadcasting on local radio. I don't know why
00:27:19,00:27:26,they didn't make this national. Only local. We'll be right back with Wet Let Wet. You can tune in in
00:27:26,00:27:33,the Cheddar Gorge area it was an exciting time. Anyway so they were broadcast but their air would
00:27:33,00:27:37,only last about 50 seconds so they'd be saying it was Mosley Graham who did the talking to the
00:27:37,00:27:42,surface and then about every 50 seconds he'd have to say actually could I get some more air please
00:27:42,00:27:46,and then the people at the surface would have to pump air in. Just one more thing on the Wookie
00:27:46,00:27:52,Hole expedition you can actually see a painting that was done 84 years after the actual event
00:27:52,00:27:57,occurred and it was done by a guy who's called Philip Gray and he's an artist and he went down
00:27:57,00:28:04,into the place where she went so he dove down with his with his painting equipment and a light
00:28:04,00:28:10,and he did the painting down there it's the first of its kind. You have to explain how. So I'm guessing
00:28:10,00:28:15,this is because it was a bit odd. I'm excited to hear your guesses. Do you know the actual answer?
00:28:15,00:28:22,He went 19 feet down so either he went down and there's a cave system where he could pop up into
00:28:22,00:28:27,a dry bit and he could illuminate it so he had everything let's say in a plastic bag as a block
00:28:27,00:28:31,and then he painted the painting there put it put the painting in the bag and then came back up
00:28:31,00:28:35,which I'm guessing must be the way. He definitely painted it there he didn't go down take a photo
00:28:35,00:28:40,and then painted it. No he painted it down there. If you were to use water paints right but you use
00:28:40,00:28:45,salt water and you're in the you're above the hallow client you're above the hallow client might it
00:28:45,00:28:52,still work. Yeah yeah so I think it's gonna be pretty blurry painting. Is it possible the painting
00:28:52,00:28:57,is just absolute dog shit? It looks pretty cool actually. I think it looks good. I'm sorry I'm sorry.
00:28:57,00:29:04,I was looking at the world's deepest dive in scuba this is and it was by Ahmed Gabba in the Red Sea
00:29:04,00:29:15,in 2014 and he went 1090 feet down the dive took 13 hours and 15 minutes. What? The thing is 13 hours
00:29:15,00:29:20,50 minutes how much of that do you think he was going down? Oh not very much because you have to
00:29:20,00:29:25,slowly come back up because otherwise you'd get the decompression stuff. So he was going back up
00:29:25,00:29:32,for 10 hours of it. He went down for 15 minutes and then had to come back up for 13 hours and 35
00:29:32,00:29:36,minutes. It's like when you're driving along the motorway and it's incredibly clear the way
00:29:36,00:29:42,you're going and you can see the other side of the motorway. I'm only going down to the
00:29:42,00:29:47,station I've got to come back through that. And obviously if he went quicker then he'd get the
00:29:47,00:29:53,bends. He'd die. Do you know another thing that you can get from diving which isn't the bends and
00:29:53,00:29:59,isn't as dangerous as the bends but is nitrogen narcosis which sounds actually quite fun. It's
00:29:59,00:30:04,basically getting drunk and it's also known as the martini effect. Divers compare it to drinking
00:30:04,00:30:10,one martini for every 10 meters that you descend after 30 meters. It doesn't really seem to cause
00:30:10,00:30:16,much harm except to your judgement which can be a problem. Sorry so let's just work this out. So
00:30:16,00:30:25,after 30 meters every 10 meters it's one martini. This guy went 332 meters. It's basically like he
00:30:25,00:30:35,had 30 martinis. He was absolutely hammered. My limit is two. I think genuinely one of them
00:30:35,00:30:45,gets me pretty too. How do you like your martinis Mr. Bub? Oh yeah. This is fine. Where's the fucking
00:30:45,00:30:54,olive? Bubba looks at the empty jar of olives. It came with 33 olives. Wow. That's incredible.
00:30:54,00:31:00,It is. So there is a way to get around it if you don't want to be completely pissed 300 meters
00:31:00,00:31:04,"underwater. Oh you drink a small glass of milk before you go down, don't you? That just helps."
00:31:04,00:31:12,Big roast dinner and then pop down. No you use helium instead of nitrogen. So normally diving
00:31:12,00:31:19,"equipment, the gas that you have is oxygen and nitrogen combination and the the ratio depends"
00:31:19,00:31:24,on kind of what kind of dive you're doing but weirdly you can replace nitrogen with helium
00:31:24,00:31:28,and apparently we can kind of breathe that okay as well. They don't quite know why this doesn't
00:31:28,00:31:33,give you the narcosis but helium is less fat soluble and it seems like there's more soluble
00:31:33,00:31:37,the gas the more drunk you'll get and so I guess it's pretty bad though if you're in trouble it's
00:31:37,00:31:45,like oh boy oh boy oh boy could someone help me I'm really stuck I'm getting stuck dancing
00:31:45,00:31:57,in this ice pack. Okay it is time for fact number three and that is my fact. My fact this week is
00:31:57,00:32:04,that every cup of mint tea you drink contains the essence of a hundred insects. This is part of
00:32:04,00:32:09,a study which was done by Trier University in Germany a guy called Henrik Krehenwinkel he's
00:32:09,00:32:15,an ecological geneticist and basically what he was looking into is how can we monitor invasive
00:32:15,00:32:21,pests how can we see if a insect is going endangered around the world one thought that came
00:32:21,00:32:27,about is this new development which has been around for a bit now EDNA. We mentioned it years ago in
00:32:27,00:32:32,our book of the year 2019 where we talked about a New Zealand scientist called Neil Gamble going to
00:32:32,00:32:37,Loch Ness and trying to look for the dandruff of the Loch Ness monster. It's basically the idea is
00:32:37,00:32:41,that you take a little scoop of something whether it's like water I guess tea in this case and then
00:32:41,00:32:45,you look very very closely at all the molecules in it and you can find remnants of the DNA can't you
00:32:45,00:32:50,of other stuff that once passed through the scene. And the E stands for environmental so it's things
00:32:50,00:32:55,that have been in the area like you might have breathed on it and given some of your DNA to it
00:32:55,00:33:00,or yeah exactly so one of the things that they thought they would test out is could you tell from
00:33:00,00:33:06,taking a sample of tea from an area could you look through it with the EDNA method and work
00:33:06,00:33:12,out how many different species have been landing on the plants peeing on the plants chewing on the
00:33:12,00:33:18,plants doing whatever it is on the plants and if you could do that and you could get that information
00:33:18,00:33:23,then you could look to let's say plants that are hidden in museums from the same area from years ago
00:33:23,00:33:27,and you would be able to tell is there a decrease in the population is there an increase so clever
00:33:27,00:33:32,you could look at other it's an interesting way of then looking at how pesticides can travel
00:33:32,00:33:37,across the world on boats and so on and become a pest somewhere else you can then suddenly notice
00:33:37,00:33:43,by testing tea leaves from say barley you'd be like hang on a second there's there's a sudden
00:33:43,00:33:48,showing up of this invasive pest which they don't have here and they can get on top of it before
00:33:48,00:33:53,it then takes over is it clever or is it lazy is it just a scientist saying I could go to barley
00:33:53,00:33:59,or india and investigate this or I could pop to asda pick up some of these tips it could be both
00:33:59,00:34:03,can't it often the clever thing to do is the lazy thing because you're saving resources very good
00:34:03,00:34:08,point yeah but that but that is what literally they were doing they were popping to their local
00:34:08,00:34:12,grocery stores and they were just buying teas from around the world I think it's what's amazing
00:34:12,00:34:15,because they're Trier this university in Germany right that one of the reasons that this is such
00:34:15,00:34:19,a good place to study this is that Trier has a specimen bank and the role of the specimen bank
00:34:19,00:34:24,is just to collect leaves from different trees across Germany and they've been doing it for 35
00:34:24,00:34:29,years they've been doing it for decades I'm not sure what their original justification is in my
00:34:29,00:34:34,garden yeah they gave for a fee and they they freeze the leaves in liquid nitrogen so there's
00:34:34,00:34:39,this German specimen bank which is just a load of leaves in liquid nitrogen I mean it's insane
00:34:39,00:34:44,well and they've just gone we know this will come in handy one day and it has yeah it genuinely has
00:34:44,00:34:49,it's unbelievable yeah the reason the tea is so useful is that if you technically from a herbarium
00:34:49,00:34:54,you know it's a sort of samples of ancient plants that what they do is they keep leaves dark and dry
00:34:54,00:34:58,basically to keep them in a kind of suspended animation and that is basically the same process
00:34:58,00:35:02,as making tea because you're drying the leaves out you're shredding them up and you're just keeping
00:35:02,00:35:07,them in kind of suspended animation in a teabag and so that it's perfect to test that as opposed to
00:35:07,00:35:14,herbarium it's amazing and uh krem winkel this guy he says that straight elva hands christian
00:35:14,00:35:21,anderson novel yeah he said little boy little girl come to my tea and pour him now he's following
00:35:21,00:35:30,the trail of teabags I've left he said probably 99.999% or something like this of DNA which we extract
00:35:30,00:35:36,is the tea DNA and only a tiny fraction of what's left is from insects and he says which of course
00:35:36,00:35:43,is good for tea drinkers because they want to drink the tea and not the insects but he says
00:35:43,00:35:49,that actually it's quite good to know that there's some tiny bits of arthropod DNA because that shows
00:35:49,00:35:55,that they haven't used really loads and loads of pesticides yeah so that's kind of clever yeah and
00:35:55,00:36:01,if you want to try it yourself contribute to his research he claims that you can dry your own plants
00:36:01,00:36:05,now I don't know if he's actually accepting these specimens but he says if you want to dry your own
00:36:05,00:36:10,plants and I thought this was quite cool you just need you can get like a ziploc bag sourced from
00:36:10,00:36:17,some diver presumably and then you dry plants out by just popping in one of those weird silica
00:36:17,00:36:30,packets that you get inside oh I always eat those that's really funny um EDNA oh yeah it floats in
00:36:30,00:36:35,air you just take if you take an air sample there will be tiny tiny amounts of EDNA floating in it
00:36:35,00:36:40,so like if someone comes into this room later today after we've gone home yeah and they took
00:36:40,00:36:46,a jam jar of air they'd be able to get bits of our DNA pretty much yeah it's amazing it's amazing
00:36:46,00:36:50,but this led me on to another fact and this was actually sent to us by a listener recently called
00:36:50,00:36:55,Andrew Ferguson so thank you to Andrew for this and you might find this fact familiar but it's
00:36:55,00:37:02,that on a windy day in San Francisco Zoo strands of giraffe semen can be found floating on the breeze
00:37:02,00:37:07,yeah I remember that fact now that was posted on the qi boards by james 12 years ago
00:37:07,00:37:13,and it's based on an interview with a zookeeper at San Francisco and I followed the link to the
00:37:13,00:37:17,original interview with the zookeeper and it's no longer on the internet they'll have suppressed
00:37:17,00:37:22,that like billy though won't they because that will not do ticket sales any good but I bet that's
00:37:22,00:37:26,one of the facts that we must have posted a dozen times on the internet like that I've tried
00:37:26,00:37:31,about it because it's amazing yeah and it's just taken a life of its own yeah if you test the air
00:37:31,00:37:38,in a zoo yeah with a jam jar you can work out which animals are in the zoo by using e-dna
00:37:38,00:37:44,what how useful how incredibly useful I'm always going to the zoo and not being able to tell which
00:37:44,00:37:49,animals are there well you know for instance you could get go to a zoo get a jam jar get a load
00:37:49,00:37:56,of air close the jam jar take the air away go to a pcr laboratory and then it will tell you
00:37:57,00:38:03,they have giraffes there really interesting really as really useful for when the sign is down
00:38:03,00:38:07,yeah the giraffe enclosure london zoo's actually done away with the guides now they just hand you
00:38:07,00:38:13,a jam jar on arrival it would be an incredibly good kind of like crap alternate zoo it's just
00:38:13,00:38:17,the jam jar zoo it's the cheapskate parents visit to the zoo you don't cross the barriers you just
00:38:17,00:38:24,scoop it to the jar take it home with your kids and go look there's giraffes in here well um there
00:38:24,00:38:29,are two studies that have found this one in Denmark and one in England but one interesting part about
00:38:29,00:38:35,it is that you can not only tell which species are in the zoo but you can get DNA from the food
00:38:35,00:38:43,that's fed to the animals so if you're feeding your giraffe like vole sausages then it would
00:38:43,00:38:48,collect the DNA from the voles as well even though there aren't any voles in your zoo wow and then you
00:38:48,00:38:53,can get the zoo I presume shut down because that feels like it breaches some rules doesn't it
00:38:53,00:38:58,vol sausage that feels like it's an even better zoo now in the jar you know because you're getting
00:38:58,00:39:04,more you're getting more animals than you yeah yeah yeah I don't think does anyone does anyone eat
00:39:04,00:39:10,vole I've never there's not much meat on a vole I don't think no no it needs to be quite desperate
00:39:10,00:39:18,Heston's probably done it yeah um have you got other edna stuff I don't know good stuff cool great
00:39:18,00:39:26,I got some stuff about voles um there was an area of the UK where they used edna in the water
00:39:26,00:39:31,and they found that there must be some water voles there by looking at the edna oh yeah and then a
00:39:31,00:39:36,bit later they put a kind of video camera up and found that there was water voles there so it just
00:39:36,00:39:39,shows that it works great okay that's what I thought you were gonna say it was just giraffes having a
00:39:39,00:39:50,picnic I was looking at the relationships between tea and animals you know like tea pests and there's
00:39:50,00:39:55,actually certain types of tea which rely on tea pests to be made there's the tea green leaf hopper
00:39:55,00:39:59,which is one of the main attacks of the tea plant also has lots of other names it's called the tea
00:39:59,00:40:08,jacid or smoke boy or jumping boy and actually you get special tea which um waits for the tea green
00:40:08,00:40:13,leaf hopper to attack it because then tea releases these chemicals it releases very specific chemicals
00:40:13,00:40:17,depending on what it knows is attacking it and the chemicals it releases when it's attacked by this
00:40:17,00:40:23,creature actually make the tea taste quite nice so if you get it at the right time you get um for
00:40:23,00:40:28,instance something called dong ding oolong um tea which actually I think it's pronounced tongue
00:40:28,00:40:33,ting but I like the idea of changing the phrase ding dong yeah dong ding it's like you know what's
00:40:33,00:40:41,he called leslie philips if leslie philips goes through that layer of salt water he goes dong ding
00:40:41,00:40:49,have you need to know who leslie philips is if you don't know who leslie philips is then why are
00:40:49,00:40:56,you listening to this we can help you yeah anyway brownie it tastes like honey google hq's gonna
00:40:56,00:41:01,freak their nuts but they see the spike on leslie philips it's like you're on it's been a leslie philips
00:41:01,00:41:11,event um the shot hole borough is a teapest shot hole I said um it's latin name is eulacea
00:41:11,00:41:19,fornicatus oh dear do you know how it got the name fornicatus anyone can guess it was the only
00:41:19,00:41:25,was the first specimen found in the act of having sex was it shagging the scientist as he discovered
00:41:25,00:41:31,it no it's because the word fornicate means arch shaped doesn't really it does fornix in latin
00:41:31,00:41:38,means arch and so it's nothing to do with fornication as you guys thought apart from that the word
00:41:38,00:41:44,fornix also meant brothel because brothels were often found in vaults oh wow and that's why we
00:41:44,00:41:49,get the word fornication that's so interesting so if you're not actually in a vault it doesn't
00:41:49,00:41:58,count as fornicating I'm here in a legal loophole you're on it I present the flat roof
00:41:58,00:42:01,which exonerates my client
00:42:01,00:42:10,um one of the guys responsible for tea uh particularly asam tea was robert the bruce
00:42:10,00:42:16,that's it yeah specifically a Scottish man called robert bruce oh come on sorry
00:42:16,00:42:22,middle name there I don't know he's just robert bruce he was a Scottish man who was in India
00:42:22,00:42:30,in the 1820s and um this story is quite boring actually no spiders involved no battles he does
00:42:30,00:42:36,share a moderately common name with a great skudget hero but not the same but similar similar
00:42:36,00:42:42,similar yeah great um I was really saved us all a minute of time actually no thank you yeah I
00:42:42,00:42:49,appreciate it I was reading about ways that farmers try to avoid using pesticides and
00:42:49,00:42:55,use nature or whatever they can in order to help their crops and uh one of the methods that's used
00:42:55,00:43:02,is there's an army of ducks that people hire in order to eat all of the pests so quite famously
00:43:02,00:43:07,in Cape Town in South Africa there's a wine estate where they employ around 2000 ducks that every
00:43:07,00:43:14,morning they walk from their little duck homes all the way to um the the vineyard and the ducks
00:43:14,00:43:19,spend a full day there uh just eating all of the worms and all of the why don't they keep the ducks
00:43:19,00:43:23,next to the vineyard so they don't need to walk all the way from their duck well it's the cost of
00:43:23,00:43:26,accommodation isn't it it's you know you can't you've got to commute sometimes and you want to
00:43:26,00:43:32,separate work from personal life as well because yeah they get up at 7 a.m they all march as one uh
00:43:32,00:43:38,to work at 10 30 uh they spend the day eating the snails and the pests um back home by 4 p.m
00:43:38,00:43:42,10 30 till 4 yeah oh bloody hell I think they actually the bosses should be cracking the web
00:43:42,00:43:48,a bit more well they back home by 4 they leave at 7 30 no no no they get up at 7 right they go to
00:43:48,00:43:53,work at 10 30 they're back by 4 so they're knocking off at 2 30 I'd say but here's the thing as well
00:43:53,00:43:58,so these are uh runner ducks and so what it means is that they've got great speed on them so if they
00:43:58,00:44:03,see a snail going for a leaf they could get there before it does an ordinary duck there's no way it
00:44:03,00:44:10,could catch a snail you need a special runner duck so here's the thing though they have to hire along
00:44:10,00:44:17,with the ducks to come with them a bunch of geese who act as bodyguards to the ducks there oh my god
00:44:17,00:44:22,because this is a cartoony oh this is something I've seen before this is this is the old woman
00:44:22,00:44:26,who's wanted to fly some warped version of it who's guarding the geese the old woman who hired a duck
00:44:27,00:44:34,what the fuck she hired a duck so the problem is is that the ducks get spooked really easily if
00:44:34,00:44:39,they're eating the snails and so on let's say an owl comes by right the geese's job is to scare away
00:44:39,00:44:44,the owls and all the other animals that come in that because apparently as soon as a duck sees an
00:44:44,00:44:49,owl it just freaks out and they all go scattering and running away it causes chaos so yeah but here's
00:44:49,00:44:55,the thing it's used for many different kinds of fields and farms uh but the one thing it's not
00:44:55,00:45:01,used for is for tea leaves and it's because you have to pick something that the ducks themselves
00:45:01,00:45:06,aren't going to want to eat and they apparently love tea leaves so I cannot believe the climax of
00:45:06,00:45:12,this story is that tea is the one thing that does not involve this very convoluted process
00:45:12,00:45:16,and the really interesting thing is this is nothing to do with what we're talking about
00:45:16,00:45:21,it is this is a pest control but they can't use it for tea leaves you know what I saved us a minute
00:45:21,00:45:28,earlier am I not talking about robert the roost oh my god no look it's a pest it's tangentially
00:45:28,00:45:41,okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that is
00:45:41,00:45:47,Anna my fact is that the first railway in greenland was built to transport a meteorite
00:45:49,00:45:53,first and and one of the only I think lots of places say the only but James I think you might
00:45:53,00:45:59,have found some other rogue railways in greenland oh yeah found all sorts so there'll be the green
00:45:59,00:46:07,and railway section later but um this is a really interesting story which I found after some seriously
00:46:07,00:46:11,in-depth research actually took me ages to get there but eventually on the back of an innocent
00:46:11,00:46:18,smoothie bottle uh Hannah yeah why are we getting our facts from innocent smoothie bottles look I
00:46:18,00:46:22,read this and I thought because Anna's clearly on a side hustle advertising deal with innocent
00:46:22,00:46:27,smoothie I'm not saying that it's any better or worse than other smoothies but um it wasn't where
00:46:27,00:46:33,the fact came from but it's it led me to it because it said in 1894 an explorer found a meteorite on
00:46:33,00:46:38,the sensibly named meteorite island funny bit of humor from innocent um he decided to take it home
00:46:38,00:46:43,because it's the biggest ever but weighing 58 tons it took three years and a new railway to get it back
00:46:44,00:46:49,while it got there in the end this guy's story has taught us a lot mainly that it's better to stick to
00:46:49,00:46:54,the lighter things in life innocent smoothies have 30 lighter on natural sugar this smoothie is a
00:46:54,00:47:00,lot easier to carry home than a meteorite that's a shoehorn isn't it rock on that's a shoe oh it's
00:47:00,00:47:06,an amazing fact that the brontes all died from drinking graveyard water what that reminds us
00:47:06,00:47:12,are innocent is that actually life is not never ending and you should enjoy every second of it
00:47:12,00:47:18,and why not enjoy the next few seconds by having this delicious innocent smoothie I thought it was
00:47:18,00:47:23,one of the best crowbars I've ever seen have you tried actually have you tried the innocent um graveyard
00:47:23,00:47:30,smoothie it's um it's an acquired taste a lot of body a lot of body anyways I thought that's what the
00:47:30,00:47:36,hell are they talking about that's absolutely loopy um but then no looked looked into it and this was
00:47:36,00:47:44,from an expedition in the 1890s into Greenland it was by the explorer Robert Peary and he was
00:47:44,00:47:49,led by Inuit guides to a meteorite that people have been hearing about for almost a hundred years
00:47:49,00:47:54,um but hadn't quite been able to track down so the Inuits knew where it was and used it a lot as
00:47:54,00:47:59,I'm sure we'll talk about and other Europeans had got there tried to find it eventually he found it
00:47:59,00:48:06,and the biggest piece which is called Anigito was so heavy that he had to construct kind of a
00:48:06,00:48:11,little railroad by laying down lots of timber and then putting steel rail tracks I think it was sort
00:48:11,00:48:16,of two mini bits because you had to build one bit of railroad road to sort of push it up the hill
00:48:16,00:48:22,then they rolled it down the hill to the harbour and then once on the coastline then they had to
00:48:22,00:48:27,build another railroad over a bridge that they constructed to get it onto the boat wow it's
00:48:27,00:48:30,amazing he went to enormous lengths to steal this quite important aspect
00:48:30,00:48:37,that's one way of looking at it yeah yeah and it's not a quick heist is it it's it's quite
00:48:37,00:48:43,noticeable yeah he took all three I think yes I think are they still to this day at the American
00:48:43,00:48:47,Museum of Natural History one of them is the biggest one is in the American Museum of Natural
00:48:47,00:48:52,History yeah and there's tens of tons and this name means tent didn't doesn't it and then he took
00:48:52,00:48:56,the other two slightly smaller ones called dog and woman yeah and um the people there they had
00:48:56,00:49:01,hammer stones and they would chip off bits of the ore and that would allow them to put tips on
00:49:01,00:49:05,their spears and that kind of thing it was the sole source of metal right in yeah yeah yeah
00:49:05,00:49:10,but yeah he didn't he did steal it and um when he got back to New York um he made a lot of money
00:49:10,00:49:18,"off of it he sold it for $40,000 which is roughly 1.3 mil in today's money the equivalent but before"
00:49:18,00:49:23,he did that when the boat docked he'd set it up as like a circus thing where you would come and visit
00:49:23,00:49:27,to see come see the meteorite and he would charge a quarter for every person it just looks like a
00:49:27,00:49:34,rock yeah but it's more exciting than your jar of edna at the zoo but still it's a big rock but 20
00:49:34,00:49:39,"20,000 people went to see that and he charged them a quarter a piece to go and touch it or have a look"
00:49:39,00:49:45,"at it and so that's about $5,000 at the time which again is about $150,000 so it became very rich"
00:49:45,00:49:49,off his stolen item when he sold them he was he was selling them to raise the money for another
00:49:49,00:49:53,journey north that's what he was using the money for yeah he was desperate to get to the north pole
00:49:53,00:49:56,really he was desperate to get to the north pole basically there were claims for a long time that
00:49:56,00:50:02,peary was the first guy to get to the north pole yeah and those claims are not true he did not
00:50:02,00:50:08,make it oh you're saying categorically how are you i'm i mean i am on your side here but yeah well
00:50:08,00:50:13,okay um all right let's put it this way right his triumphant expedition to the north pole as we
00:50:13,00:50:20,call it yeah uh was in 1909 and the evidence is as follows uh the only people who witnessed him are
00:50:20,00:50:24,four iniquate people who were all sworn to secrecy and his man servant Matthew Henson
00:50:24,00:50:29,his diary was inconsistent he didn't record the readings that would have proved where he got to
00:50:29,00:50:34,he also was a 54 year old man with no toes uh due to frostbite he would have had to manage three
00:50:34,00:50:39,times the average speed the expedition had achieved earlier on under less difficult conditions
00:50:39,00:50:43,that record has never been equaled in the history of Arctic exploration he would have had to
00:50:43,00:50:49,travel 70 miles a day no explorer has ever covered this ground over the same number of days um it
00:50:49,00:50:54,it just he didn't get there if he had got there it's not even him who really did it was Matthew
00:50:54,00:51:00,Henson who is his partner who is sort of got shunned from history and from that trip to the
00:51:00,00:51:04,point where he was sort of seen as a man servant they were partners and they were he was an amazing
00:51:04,00:51:08,explorer himself Matthew Henson it was because he was black that he was sort of not given the credit
00:51:10,00:51:13,there's lots of thoughts about whether or not he got there but Wally Herbert is the British
00:51:13,00:51:18,expedition leader who went there to try and use the calculations to see if he managed it
00:51:18,00:51:23,he claims that he didn't but in the process of doing it Wally Herbert then claimed to be the
00:51:23,00:51:30,first person to do it I think Wally Herbert is definitely a legit explorer whether or not his
00:51:30,00:51:34,claim that period didn't make it is true or not is different I think I think he definitely made it
00:51:34,00:51:37,but what's amazing is when you travel and you're trying to get to the north pole the problem is
00:51:37,00:51:42,is that you're on a moving body of land aren't you the ice is just constantly moving so when
00:51:42,00:51:47,Wally Herbert was trying to get there you would take a reading of where you were after an hour
00:51:47,00:51:52,and suddenly you were eight kilometers further away than you were because of the way the ice was
00:51:52,00:51:56,shifting but the thing is like he was what at the very end I remember reading he was something like
00:51:56,00:52:01,was it like 130 meters from the north pole and he was kind of on his hands and knees
00:52:01,00:52:10,but luckily some small fishes had made holes so what are the amazing things with Wally is that he
00:52:10,00:52:14,I think they even passed it at one point and not realized like when they were having a sleep
00:52:14,00:52:19,they sort of just they just like the the drift took them over yeah so they woke up and they
00:52:19,00:52:23,realized that it was achievable to get to in the day so they sent a telegram to the queen
00:52:23,00:52:29,saying your majesty we have got to the north pole and the first british to do it risky yeah
00:52:29,00:52:31,if they haven't actually done that because they hadn't actually done it and the rest of the day
00:52:31,00:52:37,became a chase to get there so that the telegram wasn't alive and they managed it but just they
00:52:37,00:52:41,only just it's good to set yourself these challenges sometimes if you've got a deadline yeah I often
00:52:41,00:52:46,say yes I've researched three of the four facts for this week's show that's all fine but it is in
00:52:46,00:52:51,america it's very controversial because they you know what peary what peary got there in a lot of
00:52:51,00:52:54,people's opinions and to say it opinions take out he didn't make well you're gonna be getting a lot
00:52:54,00:52:58,of emails podcast at qi.com bring it on i'll be surprised if the emails make it to my inbox
00:52:58,00:53:06,i imagine they'll stop about 70 miles short it was all kind of unedifying i think it was that real
00:53:06,00:53:12,desperation for fame and glory and it was so competitive and like you say with henson henson
00:53:12,00:53:17,probably if they did get there henson claimed to have got there first so henson went for a stroll
00:53:17,00:53:21,i think when they're at what they thought was roughly the north pole and then henson came back
00:53:21,00:53:26,this is according to henson's diaries henson came back and was like oh wow so cool i'm pretty sure
00:53:26,00:53:31,i just wandered over to it and i was the first person to be sitting on top of the world what a dick
00:53:31,00:53:39,move just gonna go for a quick uh well then so peary's like what a dick move and so he snuck off
00:53:39,00:53:44,took two of the inuit guides of the four snuck off and found his own way to what was his own
00:53:44,00:53:48,you sneak off in a completely speechless environment that's almost that's more impressive actually to
00:53:48,00:53:53,find a way of sneaking there's one big tree just behind it peary doesn't seem like a great
00:53:53,00:53:58,guy in a number of ways it's because i haven't got that from you that you think that so one of the
00:53:58,00:54:02,other things he did and this this really is the truly shabby thing so he persuaded in 1897 which
00:54:02,00:54:11,was his um that was the meteorite nicking uh trip uh heist um he persuaded six inuit people to
00:54:11,00:54:15,return with him to america kind of so that they could be sort of put on stage as part of a lecture
00:54:15,00:54:22,series um four of them died shortly after arriving uh of tb and the youngest one was called minnick and
00:54:22,00:54:26,he was adopted by an american family minnick was given an american name he was named minnick peary
00:54:26,00:54:32,wallace uh and several years later many years later he uh was at the american museum of natural
00:54:32,00:54:37,history and he came across some bones in the ethnographic department which was his father's
00:54:37,00:54:44,skeleton breaking which peary had simply sold to the museum as a kind of display piece minnick
00:54:44,00:54:49,obviously wanted and fought very hard to have the skeletons returned for a ritual burial uh the
00:54:49,00:54:56,museum refused and um peary eventually paid for minnick to go home but the family's skeletons
00:54:56,00:55:01,weren't released and buried in green until 1993 yeah but did you see that they gave him a fake
00:55:01,00:55:07,burial first yeah so when minnick came over uh and his father died and minnick said i need to
00:55:07,00:55:12,bury him with the proper inuit rituals right um they gave him a bit massive log wearing sort of
00:55:12,00:55:18,big furs disguised as his dad disguised as sort of shoved his head on i put yeah yeah they pretended
00:55:18,00:55:22,it was his dad they were burying i guess maybe you don't get up too close um yeah so he thought he
00:55:22,00:55:26,buried his dad and it was a few years later i think when he was like oh can i tell you about
00:55:26,00:55:31,another railway on greenland because this is all going a bit dark yes yes yes good idea good idea
00:55:31,00:55:35,there's basically a few that have been built and they're mostly like small ones just to transport
00:55:35,00:55:40,fish from you know the fishing place to the place where people live they're not very big you know
00:55:40,00:55:44,it's not like a huge railway going through the country but it's not a tiny one where like carriages
00:55:44,00:55:52,for fish the fish sits in a tiny fish yeah it's not that um but there's a coal railway uh in
00:55:52,00:55:58,greenland and it's on disco island which disco island is the second largest island in greenland
00:55:58,00:56:02,after the main one and it's one of the hundred largest islands in the world but i'd never heard
00:56:02,00:56:09,about until this week disco island can any of you guess yep how disco island got its name
00:56:09,00:56:17,it's in greenland i mean this feels like another fornicans trap doesn't it i mean yeah disco it's
00:56:17,00:56:22,completely circular it's shaped like a desk one theory the people there they'd do the macarena
00:56:22,00:56:28,that's where we got the macarena yes that's not a common theory the also the macarena
00:56:28,00:56:36,light bounces off the snow much like a disco ball very good not a theory uh rounded is a theory
00:56:36,00:56:42,okay another one is that it's short for discovery island another one is that the mountains are
00:56:42,00:56:51,quite flat on it so they look like desks desks but the most common is probably that it was named
00:56:51,00:56:57,after a guy called marmaduke he was an english explorer and waila and that it was originally
00:56:57,00:57:04,called duckies island oh then duck hose island and then dick hose island and then dusk goes island
00:57:04,00:57:10,and eventually disco island wow okay so it's not the next magaloof if anyone's got it on a map
00:57:10,00:57:18,the tickets i got one more fact on peri explorer robert peri brought vaseline to the north pole
00:57:18,00:57:24,to protect his skin from chafing and his mechanical equipment from rusting oh yeah and i found this
00:57:24,00:57:31,fact on a twitter site called at vaseline facts which is yeah which is a great handle unfortunately
00:57:31,00:57:39,it only lasted for three tweets and you got the others um i got yeah but they're not really that
00:57:39,00:57:45,interesting i so the word vaseline derives from the german word wasa water and the greek word
00:57:45,00:57:52,allion yeah olive oil did they do the one about how in south america the movie grease was called
00:57:52,00:57:56,vaseline oh they should have they should have but no they didn't they kind of just ran out after three
00:57:56,00:58:01,in the only interaction that this twitter account at vaseline facts had was just one response to
00:58:01,00:58:06,their tweets which after the one i just told you about um how it got its name uh someone just wrote
00:58:06,00:58:16,back saying din ask and that was and that was from at fuck vaseline facts wow to be honest if i if i'd
