00:00:00,00:00:04,"We run it on QI a few years ago and which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,You have no such thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"He says it right up, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."
00:00:12,00:00:22,Hello and welcome to season two of No Such Thing as a Fish.
00:00:22,00:00:27,This is the QI podcast coming to you from our offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:27,00:00:32,"My name is Dan Trigram, I'm sitting here with Anichesensky, James Harkin and Andy Murray,"
00:00:32,00:00:34,and these are our favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:34,00:00:37,"So in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:40,James.
00:00:40,00:00:45,"Okay, my fact is the Aztecs won necklaces made from popcorn."
00:00:45,00:00:49,"Was it done like, you know the necklaces, the candy necklaces that you have?"
00:00:49,00:00:51,"Yeah, kind of like that on a string."
00:00:51,00:00:52,"Yeah, on a string."
00:00:52,00:00:53,Was it like that?
00:00:53,00:00:55,But was it there so that they could eat the popcorn?
00:00:55,00:00:59,"No, it was there because they used popcorn as like an offering to the gods"
00:00:59,00:01:01,because it was an important crop.
00:01:01,00:01:04,"Wait, did the Aztecs actually pop the corn?"
00:01:04,00:01:05,"Well, did they just eat it as corn?"
00:01:05,00:01:07,"Yes, they heated it up, yeah."
00:01:07,00:01:08,Wow.
00:01:08,00:01:12,"God, I think a popcorn has basically hasn't existed since before the Odin cinema has existed."
00:01:12,00:01:13,Yeah.
00:01:13,00:01:14,And yes.
00:01:14,00:01:16,"It used to not be allowed into cinemas, no."
00:01:16,00:01:20,"Yeah, in the early days, it was you had to buy it outside at a vendor and eat it outside."
00:01:20,00:01:23,"And then when the Great Depression happened,"
00:01:23,00:01:26,"and motion picture sound and all that came and they started selling inside,"
00:01:26,00:01:29,that's when they noticed how popular it was inside of the building.
00:01:29,00:01:32,"What happened was that the first cinemas wanted to be like theatres,"
00:01:32,00:01:35,so they had very beautiful carpets and very beautiful walls and stuff.
00:01:35,00:01:39,"And they thought that if they saw popcorn, people would just tread it into the carpets."
00:01:39,00:01:40,Makes total sense.
00:01:40,00:01:42,"Yeah, that's a ridiculous item to have an cinema."
00:01:42,00:01:45,They used to eat it for breakfast in America.
00:01:45,00:01:48,"They, uh, they mixed it with milk and sugar and cream."
00:01:48,00:01:50,"So it was kind of like a rice crispy, in a way."
00:01:50,00:01:56,"Yeah, popcorn was also marketed originally as pearl or non-perre,"
00:01:56,00:01:58,either French for without equal.
00:01:58,00:01:59,"Not nice, not classy."
00:01:59,00:02:00,Yeah.
00:02:00,00:02:01,Yeah.
00:02:01,00:02:04,"I have a cool thing about popcorn, just popcorn, it's called popcorning."
00:02:04,00:02:09,"This is chain reactions, so it happens in a popcorn bag, I think."
00:02:09,00:02:13,"But 1700 nuclear weapons have in the UK,"
00:02:13,00:02:16,"have design flaws, which could conceivably cause multiple warheads"
00:02:16,00:02:20,"to explode one after the other, which is known as popcorning."
00:02:20,00:02:24,I like the idea of giving like really non-threatening names
00:02:24,00:02:25,to really threatening things.
00:02:25,00:02:27,"Well, mushroom, you know, mushroom platform."
00:02:27,00:02:28,"Well, you hate mushrooms, though."
00:02:28,00:02:31,"Yeah, it's true, I find mushrooms on their own very threatening."
00:02:31,00:02:34,"Do you know that during World War II,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,they tried to ban the production of popcorn?
00:02:37,00:02:38,The one I hate.
00:02:38,00:02:41,"Yeah, to noisy would alert German bombers to cities."
00:02:41,00:02:42,Yeah.
00:02:42,00:02:46,"Uh, they argued that popcorn production should be forbidden"
00:02:46,00:02:48,because it was just non-essential at the time.
00:02:48,00:02:51,"It was like, we got more important things to do than popcorn."
00:02:51,00:02:55,"Uh, but this led to the creation of the National Popcorn Association"
00:02:55,00:02:59,"and they published a patent plate called popcorn is a fighting food,"
00:02:59,00:03:01,which I'll argue that popcorn contained
00:03:01,00:03:04,"twice as many energy units as a pound of steak,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,and it was a morale builder.
00:03:06,00:03:07,[laughs]
00:03:07,00:03:11,Popcorn was the first food to be cooked intentionally by a microwave.
00:03:11,00:03:12,Was it really?
00:03:12,00:03:13,"Yeah, it was."
00:03:13,00:03:16,"The microwave that was discovered by a guy called Percy Spencer,"
00:03:16,00:03:19,"he walked past a magnetron in World War II,"
00:03:19,00:03:22,"and he noticed that the chocolate in his pocket had melted,"
00:03:22,00:03:24,"and so he thought, well, I wonder what that could have been."
00:03:24,00:03:26,"He realized it must have been this machine,"
00:03:26,00:03:28,"and so then he got some popcorn, put it next to the machine,"
00:03:28,00:03:31,"and then it did cook, and that was the first time they ever realized it."
00:03:31,00:03:33,It's the most positive reaction I've ever heard
00:03:33,00:03:35,does someone having chocolate melt in their pocket?
00:03:35,00:03:37,"Yeah, glad that he made the connection"
00:03:37,00:03:38,that you then put the thing in the machine
00:03:38,00:03:40,"as opposed to cooking everything in your pocket,"
00:03:40,00:03:42,just by walking around the next stage.
00:03:42,00:03:45,"Yeah, that could have been how we microwaved everything."
00:03:45,00:03:49,"So on Aztecs, I actually went to the Beyond Eldorado exhibition"
00:03:49,00:03:51,"at the British Museum recently, which was excellent,"
00:03:51,00:03:53,"and I think it might be over now, so sorry,"
00:03:53,00:03:54,I probably shouldn't have mentioned that.
00:03:54,00:03:58,"But if a wealthy Aztec died and was cremated,"
00:03:58,00:03:59,then a dog had to be cremated with them
00:03:59,00:04:02,so that it could guide them through the afterlife.
00:04:02,00:04:05,"Their relationship with their gods, you know,"
00:04:05,00:04:07,"20,000 people were sacrificed."
00:04:07,00:04:09,They did have a human sacrifice.
00:04:09,00:04:09,For a year.
00:04:09,00:04:10,They used to...
00:04:10,00:04:11,"20,000 dogs as well, that means."
00:04:11,00:04:13,"Yeah, that's..."
00:04:13,00:04:15,"They used to take hallucinogens, didn't they?"
00:04:15,00:04:17,The ritual leaders would take hallucinogens
00:04:17,00:04:19,to get closer to the gods.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"And at this exhibition, they have these amazing masks."
00:04:21,00:04:22,"So then they put masks on a certain animal,"
00:04:22,00:04:24,"so they were called Batman, or Batman,"
00:04:24,00:04:26,you'd be Batman if you wore this Batman mask.
00:04:26,00:04:28,And they thought it transformed you into a bat.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"So they'd take a hallucinogenic, put a Batman mask on,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,and I guess just run around the tribe going...
00:04:32,00:04:33,I'm Batman.
00:04:33,00:04:34,I'm Batman.
00:04:34,00:04:38,"They also had Jaguar people, didn't they?"
00:04:38,00:04:40,"Yes, they asked Aztecs to do that, I think."
00:04:40,00:04:42,"They would kill a Jaguar,"
00:04:42,00:04:43,"get inside their flesh,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,and then they would be like the main warriors.
00:04:45,00:04:46,So they're not actually...
00:04:46,00:04:48,"Despite the fact that we call them Aztecs,"
00:04:48,00:04:50,they're not Aztecs.
00:04:50,00:04:51,"Well, they didn't call themselves..."
00:04:51,00:04:52,"Yeah, we've given them that name."
00:04:52,00:04:54,They call themselves Mexico.
00:04:54,00:04:55,That's right.
00:04:55,00:04:57,"Yeah, so how does that happen?"
00:04:57,00:04:58,That we were all cool would still
00:04:58,00:04:59,calling them something they're not.
00:04:59,00:05:01,It feels like another example of good old
00:05:01,00:05:02,western ignorance.
00:05:02,00:05:03,"Yeah, it is."
00:05:03,00:05:06,"The Aztec word for gold, do you know what that is?"
00:05:06,00:05:06,No.
00:05:06,00:05:08,It is...
00:05:08,00:05:09,I don't know if I can pronounce this.
00:05:09,00:05:13,"Teu-quit-lattle, which literally means ""excrement of the gods""."
00:05:13,00:05:14,"Oh, okay."
00:05:14,00:05:16,"The gods pooed it right out,"
00:05:16,00:05:18,"and then they, I guess they offered it my batch of them."
00:05:18,00:05:21,"Well, Montezuma had a nephew called Quit-la-huak,"
00:05:21,00:05:23,which meant plenty of poo.
00:05:23,00:05:24,Or dry-excrement.
00:05:24,00:05:25,Dry-excrement.
00:05:25,00:05:26,Wow.
00:05:26,00:05:27,Montezuma's revenge.
00:05:27,00:05:28,Have you heard of that?
00:05:28,00:05:29,"That's having a dodgy tummy,"
00:05:29,00:05:30,when you travel to Mexico.
00:05:30,00:05:33,So this guy's name is just completely associated with trams.
00:05:33,00:05:37,Montezuma now means lots and lots and lots of experts.
00:05:39,00:05:43,"Speaking of excrement and old American languages, as we were,"
00:05:43,00:05:45,"so Des Moines, you know, the city in Iowa."
00:05:45,00:05:46,Yeah.
00:05:46,00:05:47,Build racism from there.
00:05:47,00:05:48,Is he?
00:05:48,00:05:51,"Oh, well, perhaps he knows that a new linguistic study has been done,"
00:05:51,00:05:52,which shows that the name literally
00:05:52,00:05:54,"probably means ""shit face"","
00:05:54,00:05:55,and it was a mistake.
00:05:55,00:05:56,"So when they were naming it,"
00:05:56,00:05:59,"they asked the Native Americans what the place was called,"
00:05:59,00:06:00,"and they said Des Moines,"
00:06:00,00:06:03,"which was the insulting name that they called their rival tribe,"
00:06:03,00:06:04,"which was ""shit face""."
00:06:04,00:06:05,And now...
00:06:05,00:06:07,"And now that's what it is called ""shit face""."
00:06:07,00:06:07,Oh my god.
00:06:07,00:06:08,So everyone needs to realize...
00:06:08,00:06:11,You could say I'm feeling absolutely demoined at the moment.
00:06:11,00:06:11,I think so.
00:06:11,00:06:12,Let's get going.
00:06:12,00:06:14,Yeah.
00:06:14,00:06:16,And that ruler we were talking about.
00:06:16,00:06:16,Montezuma.
00:06:16,00:06:17,"Yeah, Montezuma."
00:06:17,00:06:19,He had a zoo.
00:06:19,00:06:19,Montezuma.
00:06:19,00:06:20,Hence the name.
00:06:20,00:06:21,"Yeah, Montezuma."
00:06:21,00:06:23,He missed a trick there if it wasn't called that.
00:06:23,00:06:25,He related to Jacob's Zuma by any chance.
00:06:25,00:06:26,I don't know.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Brother I doubt it.
00:06:27,00:06:30,"But he had exotic animals, obviously,"
00:06:30,00:06:33,"but it also include dwarfs, albinos, and hunchbacks."
00:06:33,00:06:35,So a bit of a human zoo.
00:06:35,00:06:36,A bit of a PC nightmare.
00:06:37,00:06:38,All right.
00:06:38,00:06:39,If he was still around.
00:06:39,00:06:40,"If you tried to do that today,"
00:06:40,00:06:41,they wouldn't let you.
00:06:41,00:06:42,Yeah.
00:06:42,00:06:43,"It's a political correctness, gone."
00:06:43,00:06:48,Okay.
00:06:48,00:06:50,Let's move on to fact number two.
00:06:50,00:06:54,"And that comes from you, Chazinski."
00:06:54,00:06:57,"Yes, my fact today is that in 2011,"
00:06:57,00:07:00,China tried to pass over scene from the film Top Gun
00:07:00,00:07:01,as footage of its own Air Force.
00:07:01,00:07:03,That's amazing.
00:07:04,00:07:07,"Yep. It was a state broadcaster, China Central TV,"
00:07:07,00:07:09,"or obviously as we know it, CCTV."
00:07:09,00:07:09,Yep.
00:07:09,00:07:13,And it was a news bulletin in a report about training exercises
00:07:13,00:07:15,that were being undertaken by the Air Force.
00:07:15,00:07:18,And it was showing an example of a successful strike
00:07:18,00:07:18,on an aeroplane.
00:07:18,00:07:21,"And this explosion, and we'll post it on the website"
00:07:21,00:07:21,in slow motion.
00:07:21,00:07:23,"I mean, it's the explosion from Top Gun."
00:07:23,00:07:25,With a straight face reporter going
00:07:25,00:07:27,and this is them successfully blowing up an aeroplane here.
00:07:27,00:07:28,Wow.
00:07:28,00:07:32,"Well, Top Gun was a propaganda movie for America anyway."
00:07:32,00:07:35,It was partly funded by the Pentagon.
00:07:35,00:07:35,Was it?
00:07:35,00:07:38,"Yeah, in order to get people to sign up for the military."
00:07:38,00:07:41,"When it was on, in the cinemas,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,they had recruitment tables in the theatres
00:07:43,00:07:45,so that people could just sign up.
00:07:45,00:07:48,"Yeah, and apparently that was the highest recruitment period"
00:07:48,00:07:49,they've ever had.
00:07:49,00:07:51,Because everyone came out of the cinema just buzzing.
00:07:51,00:07:53,"Just go, ""Girl, America!"""
00:07:53,00:07:56,"And then there was a booth and they were like, ""Yeah!"""
00:07:56,00:07:59,"And then a month later, they find themselves being shot at."
00:07:59,00:08:01,"Yeah, they're like, ""What happened then?"""
00:08:01,00:08:03,I thought this was about a volleyball and showers.
00:08:03,00:08:04,"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:08:04,00:08:05,I have not seen Top Gun.
00:08:05,00:08:07,"No, I mean, so please no spoilers."
00:08:07,00:08:08,Sorry.
00:08:08,00:08:10,"But I have seen the live stage show of it,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,which featured no props except the guys doing planes.
00:08:13,00:08:16,"They held their arms behind me and went, ""Pooh!"""
00:08:16,00:08:17,And that was it. They did all the dogfights.
00:08:17,00:08:18,You're kidding.
00:08:18,00:08:19,It's a very bad hour.
00:08:19,00:08:22,"Talking about the fact that recruitment went up,"
00:08:22,00:08:23,"which I did by 500 percent, I think,"
00:08:23,00:08:25,recruitment for Navy pilots.
00:08:25,00:08:27,"Also, sales of Ray Bans post Top Gun."
00:08:27,00:08:28,This is a bit of a spoiler Andy.
00:08:28,00:08:30,"If you haven't seen it, they wear a lot of Ray Bans."
00:08:30,00:08:31,"Oh, man."
00:08:31,00:08:32,They went up by 40 percent.
00:08:32,00:08:33,Did they? Yeah.
00:08:33,00:08:36,I love it when something influences the market.
00:08:36,00:08:38,"When 50 Shades of Grey came out,"
00:08:38,00:08:41,rope sales and hardware store went through the roof.
00:08:41,00:08:43,"But also, every cultural artifact as I see it with it."
00:08:43,00:08:45,"So there's that, is it's Ben Minalion?"
00:08:45,00:08:47,"There's a classical music piece,"
00:08:47,00:08:49,which is referred to quite a lot in the book.
00:08:49,00:08:51,And sales of that absolutely rocketed.
00:08:51,00:08:53,There was a new story when John Prescott
00:08:53,00:08:56,was found playing Croquet on his lawn.
00:08:56,00:08:59,And the sales of Croquet sets went up by three times.
00:08:59,00:09:00,Wow.
00:09:00,00:09:02,I thought you were going to say they plummeted.
00:09:02,00:09:04,No. Everyone returning their croquet set.
00:09:04,00:09:05,"No, so she think it's bad publicity."
00:09:05,00:09:07,"No, no. Okay, well."
00:09:07,00:09:09,"Well, China has got formal this, haven't they?"
00:09:09,00:09:10,"Because at the Olympics in 2008,"
00:09:10,00:09:14,didn't they have one adorable looking girl singing a song
00:09:14,00:09:15,at the opening ceremony?
00:09:15,00:09:17,And it was revealed that she had not actually
00:09:17,00:09:18,been the one singing.
00:09:18,00:09:20,They hit a slightly less telegenic girl
00:09:20,00:09:22,behind a screen somewhere.
00:09:22,00:09:23,"Maybe locked in an attic,"
00:09:23,00:09:24,just singing into a microphone.
00:09:24,00:09:25,Wonderful.
00:09:25,00:09:27,You mentioned China having formed.
00:09:27,00:09:29,There are a couple of other amusing
00:09:29,00:09:31,Chinese news agencies stories.
00:09:31,00:09:34,"A few years ago, the state news agency published a health report."
00:09:34,00:09:37,And it was illustrated with this X-ray scan of a human head.
00:09:37,00:09:40,But they use an X-ray scan of Homer Simpson's head.
00:09:40,00:09:43,"And if you're looking up, I mean, it's Homer Simpson's head."
00:09:43,00:09:46,"Well, with that one where he has a very, very tiny brain."
00:09:46,00:09:46,"Yeah, exactly."
00:09:46,00:09:49,With two monkeys like picking flames off each other.
00:09:49,00:09:50,"Is the tiny brain huge, everyone?"
00:09:50,00:09:51,"Oh, my God."
00:09:51,00:09:53,I'm just on the Wikipedia page for propaganda
00:09:53,00:09:54,in the People's Republic of China.
00:09:54,00:09:55,And there's nothing there.
00:09:58,00:09:59,"Well, that's, I remember the story."
00:09:59,00:10:02,"When I first started with QI, it was a fact I found."
00:10:02,00:10:07,"It was that when China realized the power of the internet,"
00:10:07,00:10:08,they got really nervous.
00:10:08,00:10:11,"So they hired a man to sort it out,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"gave him a computer, sat in a room."
00:10:13,00:10:14,"He came out at the end of the day going,"
00:10:14,00:10:16,"""This is a bit bigger than we realized."""
00:10:16,00:10:22,"One dude who was meant to literally go through every forum going,"
00:10:22,00:10:23,"""Hey, you guys, stop talking about that."""
00:10:23,00:10:27,There's just been a recruitment drive
00:10:27,00:10:29,in the Chinese military.
00:10:29,00:10:31,And they've changed the rules slightly
00:10:31,00:10:33,to get more people in the army.
00:10:33,00:10:35,So they've introduced new height requirements
00:10:35,00:10:37,"which have been reduced by two centimeters,"
00:10:37,00:10:39,so slightly shorter people can get in.
00:10:39,00:10:41,"They've changed the weight restrictions,"
00:10:41,00:10:44,because actually most people have put on more weight
00:10:44,00:10:46,because of obesity crisis.
00:10:46,00:10:47,"They've reduced eyesight requirements,"
00:10:47,00:10:50,so people who are more short-sighted can now get in.
00:10:50,00:10:52,"And they're allowing people with tattoos,"
00:10:52,00:10:54,which they didn't before.
00:10:54,00:10:54,Wow.
00:10:54,00:10:57,"So the Chinese army will now be very short,"
00:10:57,00:11:00,"fat, tattoos, short-sighted,"
00:11:00,00:11:01,"and probably running the wrong way,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,because they can't see where they're going.
00:11:03,00:11:05,And haven't we just changed the rules
00:11:05,00:11:06,"for the British army reserved,"
00:11:06,00:11:09,"so that you can now have face or neck tattoos,"
00:11:09,00:11:10,neck tattoos sound very painful to me.
00:11:10,00:11:12,I did read a book about a guy who got one tattooed
00:11:12,00:11:15,"in the second world war on the inside of his foreskin,"
00:11:15,00:11:16,"saying, ""Hi, Doc."""
00:11:16,00:11:20,"Yeah, for medical examinations and things like that."
00:11:20,00:11:22,"So there's a real top gun school,"
00:11:22,00:11:25,that supposedly you get a $5 fine
00:11:25,00:11:28,if anyone in staff quotes the movie top gun.
00:11:28,00:11:31,So it's a military training for...
00:11:31,00:11:33,They should call it military planning.
00:11:33,00:11:35,"That saves time, which is vital in the heat of battle."
00:11:35,00:11:38,"You should be a soldier, Andy."
00:11:38,00:11:39,"Top gun school, if you're listening,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,I am free for consultancy work.
00:11:41,00:11:43,"He has tattoos all over his face,"
00:11:43,00:11:47,so I'm not on the inside of his foreskin element.
00:11:47,00:11:49,"But he did in the mirror, so it says, ""Cod."""
00:11:51,00:11:56,"In 2013, India's army spent six months watching Chinese spide drones"
00:11:56,00:11:58,"violating its airspace,"
00:11:58,00:12:00,only to find out that they were actually Jupiter and Venus.
00:12:00,00:12:03,That is embarrassing.
00:12:03,00:12:06,"We were talking about media mistakes,"
00:12:06,00:12:07,and this is just my favourite one.
00:12:07,00:12:11,"In 2008, a Christian website was publishing a story about Tyson Gay,"
00:12:11,00:12:13,"who, you know, the sprinter Tyson Gay."
00:12:13,00:12:16,So this Christian website in America wasn't allowed to use the word gay.
00:12:16,00:12:17,"It had an automated system,"
00:12:17,00:12:19,"which whenever it sold the word gay,"
00:12:19,00:12:22,"changed it to homosexual, so this website published in Huntsville."
00:12:22,00:12:25,We're wearing the Tyson homosexual all the way through.
00:12:25,00:12:27,"Tyson homosexual was a blur and blues,"
00:12:27,00:12:29,"sprinting 100 meters fast, anyone else has."
00:12:29,00:12:32,"It means a lot to me the 25-year-old homosexual said,"
00:12:32,00:12:34,"""I'm glad my body could do it."""
00:12:34,00:12:37,That's fantastic.
00:12:37,00:12:39,"It's called the scum thought problem, isn't it?"
00:12:39,00:12:39,Yeah.
00:12:39,00:12:43,"When computers misrepresent something as being rude,"
00:12:43,00:12:46,"because of the fall at a wedding, the word scum thought."
00:12:46,00:12:49,People living in scum thought couldn't put their addresses into certain
00:12:49,00:12:51,computer systems because it had that word.
00:12:51,00:12:53,"Another place with that problem is a penistone,"
00:12:53,00:12:56,but it's spelt penistone.
00:12:56,00:12:59,What is a penistone I wonder?
00:12:59,00:13:00,Anyone impersonate that?
00:13:00,00:13:03,"Yeah, it's like, um, yeah, exactly."
00:13:03,00:13:05,"You need to bang a fork on it, you're tuning."
00:13:05,00:13:13,"Okay, time for fact number three."
00:13:13,00:13:14,And that is my fact.
00:13:14,00:13:18,"My fact is that in 2003,"
00:13:18,00:13:22,"somebody misplaced the master keys to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,"
00:13:22,00:13:24,"which is the home of the fastest computer in the world,"
00:13:24,00:13:29,and it's a lab where they develop all science and technology for America's national security.
00:13:29,00:13:32,"Due to the loss of these keys, they had to replace the locks,"
00:13:32,00:13:35,"and those locks cost $1,700 to change."
00:13:35,00:13:39,"I mean, that's a good day for a locksmith."
00:13:39,00:13:42,"But that's, that's, I mean, it makes sense when you hear it, really,"
00:13:42,00:13:44,because obviously they've got the best locks in the world.
00:13:44,00:13:46,What's so great about these locks?
00:13:46,00:13:48,"And they're like those ones that, how my mum opens a car,"
00:13:48,00:13:50,where you can click them and open it.
00:13:50,00:13:52,"No, I don't think ten yards away, because that's pretty amazing."
00:13:52,00:13:54,I reckon they're better.
00:13:54,00:13:54,"No, they can't be."
00:13:54,00:13:56,"Yeah, I think they've got a deadbolt on them,"
00:13:56,00:13:58,"because those are really good, those ones."
00:13:58,00:14:01,"You have to have them on your front door to get insurance, top tip."
00:14:01,00:14:02,"They could be like chub locks, they're quite good."
00:14:02,00:14:04,"Chub, it's a nice word as well."
00:14:04,00:14:05,"Chub, yeah."
00:14:05,00:14:07,"Also a fish, of course, either a fish or a lock."
00:14:07,00:14:08,Don't confuse them.
00:14:08,00:14:12,"And a lock, a lock is part of a canal system,"
00:14:12,00:14:15,"which has water, which is also a place where fish can live."
00:14:15,00:14:16,"That's true, yeah."
00:14:16,00:14:18,That's probably where the connection happened.
00:14:18,00:14:20,"A chub block, yeah, yeah."
00:14:20,00:14:21,"Okay, that's enough for that fact, sir."
00:14:21,00:14:25,I feel like no one's taking my fax seriously here.
00:14:25,00:14:27,"Oh no, no, no, we're not."
00:14:27,00:14:31,Have you guys been about Volvo's new plan?
00:14:31,00:14:32,"I think it was only announced this year,"
00:14:32,00:14:36,so they remotely unlock your car and deliver your shopping into it.
00:14:36,00:14:39,"And then leave again, but you'd cool Tesco and be like,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,deliver my shopping to my car.
00:14:41,00:14:43,Click that option on your Tesco online shop.
00:14:43,00:14:46,"They arrive, give your text, you go, okay, yeah, you can unlock it."
00:14:46,00:14:46,Isn't that cool?
00:14:46,00:14:47,Are you just sitting in the office?
00:14:47,00:14:49,Do your online shop go back to your car and it's just there?
00:14:49,00:14:52,"It's a bit, I mean, it sounds like we're heading to sort of like,"
00:14:52,00:14:53,I've ordered takeaway.
00:14:53,00:14:55,"They literally, they come through my front door"
00:14:55,00:14:57,and just put the food in my mouth.
00:14:57,00:15:02,"I have a zip car in London and you open,"
00:15:02,00:15:04,you can open those with your mobile phone.
00:15:04,00:15:05,"Yeah, me too, I always find it incredible."
00:15:05,00:15:09,I have another example of that lock changing disaster.
00:15:09,00:15:12,"Oh yeah, this was a few years ago in 2006,"
00:15:12,00:15:15,"at Felton Young Offender's Institution,"
00:15:15,00:15:18,"they had to spend £250,000 changing the locks."
00:15:18,00:15:20,"Basically, a TV news guru had been in"
00:15:20,00:15:22,and they had filmed a prison key.
00:15:22,00:15:26,"And as a result, all the locks had to be changed."
00:15:26,00:15:29,What in case somebody saw the footage and could recreate that key?
00:15:29,00:15:32,"Okay, somebody took a photo, printed the photo,"
00:15:32,00:15:35,"made it a 3D model, pressed it into a cake of soap."
00:15:35,00:15:38,"You'd have to have a very high definition TV to get that key, right?"
00:15:38,00:15:38,"Yeah, that's true."
00:15:38,00:15:42,That's what also happens on TV when we once put a photograph
00:15:42,00:15:43,of a bank note or something.
00:15:43,00:15:47,"They make you put specimen on it so people can take a photo of the screen,"
00:15:47,00:15:50,print off the photo and then pass it off as money.
00:15:50,00:15:52,"Also, this is so cool."
00:15:52,00:15:54,"Banknotes have little things on them, little circles in patterns"
00:15:54,00:15:58,which stop photocopiers from photocopying them.
00:15:58,00:15:58,It's amazing.
00:15:58,00:16:02,"I read that, but then I got a bank note"
00:16:02,00:16:05,and tried to photocopier on my photocopier and it worked.
00:16:05,00:16:05,Oh.
00:16:05,00:16:06,Ah.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"In September 2012, you could buy a set of"
00:16:09,00:16:14,master keys for New York City on eBay and the newspapers went a bit crazy about it
00:16:14,00:16:16,and said it was a terrorist dream come truth
00:16:16,00:16:21,and it's supposed to be able to help you turn off elevators in public buildings.
00:16:21,00:16:24,"But of course, in order to do that, you'd have to get past"
00:16:24,00:16:27,all of the security to get into the building in the first place.
00:16:27,00:16:28,"Well, this is the thing."
00:16:28,00:16:30,You think that these places would have incredible security.
00:16:30,00:16:35,"So like, number 10 Downing Street has a phenomenal lock system"
00:16:35,00:16:37,in that it has no lock or no door handle.
00:16:37,00:16:39,It's just nothing on the front of their door.
00:16:39,00:16:40,You can only open it from the inside.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"Once you get inside, you can open the door anytime you like."
00:16:43,00:16:43,Yeah.
00:16:43,00:16:45,What happens if everyone goes out?
00:16:45,00:16:46,This is the problem.
00:16:46,00:16:48,That means that that house is never not occupied.
00:16:48,00:16:49,How often do you think that screws up
00:16:49,00:16:51,and David Cameron's left sitting on his doorstep?
00:16:51,00:16:55,"Well, apparently, I don't know how often someone's left outside,"
00:16:55,00:16:59,"but apparently in the first five years that Tony Blair was at Downing Street,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,"37 computers, 4 mobile phones, 2 cameras,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,"a mini display, a video recorder, 4 printers,"
00:17:03,00:17:07,"2 projectors, and a bicycle with stolen from the building."
00:17:07,00:17:07,Wow.
00:17:07,00:17:08,How does that happen?
00:17:08,00:17:09,It's so it's bomb proof.
00:17:09,00:17:11,It's a state of bomb proof metal.
00:17:11,00:17:12,It was originally made of oak.
00:17:12,00:17:14,And then there was an IRA attack.
00:17:14,00:17:18,A mortar was launched into the back garden of number 10 in 1991.
00:17:18,00:17:21,Do you guys remember when Gordon Brown got locked in a toilet
00:17:21,00:17:23,and had to be rescued by Tony Blair?
00:17:23,00:17:26,I think it was in the early 1990s when they went to discuss
00:17:26,00:17:28,the potential leadership in the early 90s
00:17:28,00:17:29,and they were having this meeting.
00:17:29,00:17:30,Gordon Brown went to the Lou.
00:17:30,00:17:32,Tony Blair waited there for 15 minutes.
00:17:32,00:17:32,"I was like, what is going on?"
00:17:32,00:17:33,The phone rang.
00:17:33,00:17:35,He didn't answer it because he wasn't at his own house.
00:17:35,00:17:38,And the answer came on and it was Gordon Brown upstairs going.
00:17:38,00:17:41,"Hello, Tony, I'm stuck in the toilet."
00:17:41,00:17:42,Could you go and get me out?
00:17:42,00:17:45,Is it because the toilet in 10 Downing Street
00:17:45,00:17:46,doesn't have a hand?
00:17:46,00:17:53,"Speaking of stealing things, there was an EU summit in the 2000s"
00:17:53,00:17:55,and the catering staff went on strike
00:17:55,00:17:56,because they weren't being paid.
00:17:56,00:18:00,And so when all the politicians and the admin people
00:18:00,00:18:02,"and whatever went for lunch, there was no staff there."
00:18:02,00:18:05,And they raided the whole thing and stole all the cutlery.
00:18:05,00:18:06,Wow.
00:18:06,00:18:09,Does this maybe explain where all our forks have gone
00:18:09,00:18:10,from the QI office?
00:18:10,00:18:12,I big scandal in the QI office at the moment.
00:18:12,00:18:15,"Supposedly, I've been throwing all the forks into the bin."
00:18:15,00:18:16,That's the proof around.
00:18:16,00:18:17,There is no proof.
00:18:17,00:18:18,What's over here?
00:18:18,00:18:21,It's the proof because you don't remember doing it.
00:18:21,00:18:24,I just want to quickly turn it to this laboratory
00:18:24,00:18:26,which looks after the supercomputers of the world.
00:18:26,00:18:28,"And there was an old fact I remember,"
00:18:28,00:18:30,"which I think James, you found ages ago,"
00:18:30,00:18:32,which was that deep blue was the first computer
00:18:32,00:18:34,to beat a grandmaster at chess.
00:18:34,00:18:35,But it's subsequent career.
00:18:35,00:18:37,"Most people, when you win a major championship,"
00:18:37,00:18:40,there's a lot of glory at book deal and so on.
00:18:40,00:18:44,It now works as a reservationist for a US airline.
00:18:44,00:18:45,So it just deals with reservations.
00:18:45,00:18:47,"Yeah, they split it into two pieces."
00:18:47,00:18:50,One half went to a museum and the other half worked for Panama.
00:18:50,00:18:52,"Wow, American Airlines."
00:18:52,00:18:54,"Wow, I'm glad that doesn't happen with people."
00:18:54,00:18:59,"Actually, like this Carlson is currently in the Oslo museum."
00:18:59,00:19:01,Half is a trolley dolly with Oslo.
00:19:01,00:19:04,I read as well that they've worked out
00:19:04,00:19:07,that if you took all the information on the internet
00:19:07,00:19:10,"and you were to save it, do you know how many blu-ray discs"
00:19:10,00:19:13,it would take to save the entire internet?
00:19:13,00:19:16,"How many, if you fit it all onto blu-ray discs?"
00:19:16,00:19:18,Is there a weirdly small number like three?
00:19:18,00:19:21,"Weirdly it is quite small, 200 million."
00:19:21,00:19:24,"Which is, I think, I think that's quite small actually."
00:19:24,00:19:25,I agree.
00:19:25,00:19:25,Where are you going to put these?
00:19:25,00:19:28,You're going to need a big showing unit.
00:19:28,00:19:31,And the admin will be a nightmare.
00:19:31,00:19:33,And then you're trying to get your favorite cat video.
00:19:34,00:19:36,Why didn't you have a better size these days?
00:19:36,00:19:39,Would you know how many emails are sent per day?
00:19:39,00:19:40,Many millions.
00:19:40,00:19:40,No.
00:19:40,00:19:41,How long has it been going on?
00:19:41,00:19:43,247 billion.
00:19:43,00:19:45,Wow.
00:19:45,00:19:47,The fastest ever internet connection.
00:19:47,00:19:49,"This fact's a few years old, so it probably isn't anymore."
00:19:49,00:19:52,But this was a lady called Sigrid Lothberg.
00:19:52,00:19:56,And she had an internet connection which was 40 gigabytes per second.
00:19:56,00:20:01,"And it was put in by her son who was a Swedish internet legend, Peter Lothberg."
00:20:01,00:20:03,And what did she do with it?
00:20:03,00:20:07,She dried her washing on it because it gave off so much heat
00:20:07,00:20:08,and she didn't know what else to do with it.
00:20:08,00:20:10,So she dried her washing with it.
00:20:10,00:20:10,That's great.
00:20:10,00:20:14,Did you guys know that internet on the moon now is faster than in most parts of rural Britain?
00:20:14,00:20:16,"What, had you get into, like, the..."
00:20:16,00:20:17,They called it broadband.
00:20:17,00:20:18,That's how it was released.
00:20:18,00:20:22,"Wow, I didn't hold your phone up and try to speak to Siri through your helmet."
00:20:22,00:20:23,Yeah.
00:20:23,00:20:26,It'll be very hard to tap your phone properly with those gloves.
00:20:26,00:20:37,"Okay, it's time for the final facts of this episode."
00:20:37,00:20:40,And we head over to Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:20:40,00:20:45,"My fact is, did you know that Ken is officially an accessory to Barbie?"
00:20:45,00:20:48,Brilliant.
00:20:48,00:20:49,I really like that.
00:20:49,00:20:51,He says she's not a feminist icon.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Yeah.
00:20:52,00:20:53,"Yeah, this is very weird."
00:20:53,00:20:58,"Okay, so the Barbie and Ken, original, the original Barbie and Ken, Ken was named after the son"
00:20:58,00:20:59,of the Inventors of Barbie.
00:20:59,00:21:02,"But Barbie was named after their daughter, Barbara."
00:21:02,00:21:02,"Oh, yes."
00:21:02,00:21:05,"She's quite peculiar, a sort of brother sister thing."
00:21:05,00:21:10,"And Ruth, the wife of the couple who invented Barbie and Ken,"
00:21:10,00:21:12,argued for a bulge in his groin.
00:21:12,00:21:14,But the design team refused to put one in.
00:21:14,00:21:19,"Yeah, he's famously bereft underneath those trousers, isn't it?"
00:21:19,00:21:20,Yeah.
00:21:20,00:21:22,There is a trailer trash doll you can buy in America.
00:21:23,00:21:25,It's called Turleine.
00:21:25,00:21:28,It's a pregnant doll from 2005.
00:21:28,00:21:30,And she's one of these talking dolls.
00:21:30,00:21:32,"And her catchphrases include,"
00:21:32,00:21:36,"if the trailers are rockin, don't come a knockin."
00:21:36,00:21:39,And pour me a double and drink him for two.
00:21:39,00:21:40,What?
00:21:40,00:21:42,Does she ever give birth?
00:21:42,00:21:44,In some kind of traumatic night?
00:21:44,00:21:47,"Can you imagine that doll, the giving birth doll?"
00:21:47,00:21:48,They've got to make it.
00:21:48,00:21:52,"Well, they were used for good dolls during brown versus the Board of Education."
00:21:52,00:21:55,"When civil rights legislation was overturned in 1954,"
00:21:55,00:22:00,it was one of the first cases where a Supreme Court cited a social study
00:22:00,00:22:02,in its reasons for making a certain decision.
00:22:02,00:22:06,So this was when America agreed the segregation was a negative thing
00:22:06,00:22:09,and had a negative effect on the people who were subject to it.
00:22:09,00:22:10,"And what they did was, in the experiment,"
00:22:10,00:22:13,they brought black and white dolls to schools that were segregated.
00:22:13,00:22:14,So black schools.
00:22:14,00:22:17,"And they'd show the kids a black doll and a white doll and get them to say,"
00:22:17,00:22:18,"""Which one do you think is a good doll, which is a bad doll?"""
00:22:18,00:22:20,"And all the kids would go, ""Oh, the white one's a good doll."
00:22:20,00:22:21,"I want to play with the white one."""
00:22:21,00:22:23,Because that's what they've brought up to think.
00:22:23,00:22:26,"And then they'd ask them, ""Okay, in which doll do you think is more like you?"""
00:22:26,00:22:28,"And almost all the kids got really, really upset."
00:22:28,00:22:30,Meet them like cried or ran out of the room.
00:22:30,00:22:32,Because suddenly they were identifying themselves with a doll.
00:22:32,00:22:34,They just said was the bad doll.
00:22:34,00:22:38,And that was cited by the Supreme Court when brown versus the Board of Education
00:22:38,00:22:39,came to its conclusion.
00:22:39,00:22:40,"Oh, that is really interesting."
00:22:40,00:22:41,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:41,00:22:44,"Here's another good use for a doll, which is, it's a nice use,"
00:22:44,00:22:47,but perhaps not as worthy as your use.
00:22:47,00:22:49,There was a Chinese guy whose wife had died.
00:22:49,00:22:52,And he became rather attached to his blow-up doll.
00:22:52,00:22:55,And everyone started taking the Mickey out of him a little bit.
00:22:55,00:22:56,And he got very upset.
00:22:56,00:22:58,And so he decided to end it all.
00:22:58,00:23:03,"And eyewitnesses at the scene were horrified to see him plummet from the building,"
00:23:03,00:23:05,holding what they thought was a child.
00:23:05,00:23:07,But it was actually his blow-up doll.
00:23:07,00:23:11,"And he very romantically jumped off the building with his blow-up doll,"
00:23:11,00:23:15,"landed on the doll, the doll exploded, and he survived."
00:23:15,00:23:16,"Oh, wow!"
00:23:16,00:23:17,He murdered him up.
00:23:17,00:23:19,She gave her life for him.
00:23:19,00:23:20,"Exactly, it's romantic."
00:23:20,00:23:21,That's very romantic.
00:23:21,00:23:23,That must have been a horrific moment.
00:23:23,00:23:25,"They went and saw this, what they thought was a child explode."
00:23:25,00:23:29,You can get.
00:23:29,00:23:31,This is slightly controversial.
00:23:31,00:23:32,Dope on a rope.
00:23:32,00:23:36,"Dope on a rope was Saddam Hussein with a noose around his neck,"
00:23:36,00:23:38,which was commemorating his death.
00:23:38,00:23:40,It's from a website called Hero Builders.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"And they've got over 100 satirical figures that you can get,"
00:23:43,00:23:46,including Tony Blair as an action man.
00:23:46,00:23:48,You can get George Bush as a superhero.
00:23:48,00:23:50,Michael Jackson holding a baby over.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"Well, that would be..."
00:23:51,00:23:53,Gordon Brown comes with his own part of Lou.
00:23:53,00:23:59,"That would be the same company, probably, which in 2002,"
00:23:59,00:24:02,were Simon Bin Laden dolls dramatically outsold Tony Blair dolls.
00:24:02,00:24:02,Really?
00:24:02,00:24:04,"I think it was a bit of an embarrassment, yeah."
00:24:04,00:24:04,Really?
00:24:04,00:24:05,Yeah.
00:24:05,00:24:08,"Well, that was not the only firm to make Simon Bin Laden dolls,"
00:24:08,00:24:13,"because in 2005, the CIA made a custom-made Bin Laden action figure,"
00:24:13,00:24:17,"which they were thinking about distributing to children in the Middle East,"
00:24:17,00:24:23,"and the face would peel off and reveal a much scarier red face with demonic eyes, and, you know..."
00:24:23,00:24:23,"Oh, wow!"
00:24:23,00:24:27,So would usage of the toy suddenly Satan would appear?
00:24:27,00:24:27,"Yeah, exactly."
00:24:27,00:24:27,Exactly.
00:24:27,00:24:28,The healing wow.
00:24:28,00:24:28,"Yeah, okay."
00:24:28,00:24:31,So that would apparently put children off.
00:24:31,00:24:34,That would apparently make children support the war on Terremble.
00:24:34,00:24:35,It would put them off dolls.
00:24:35,00:24:36,"It would put them off dolls, yeah."
00:24:36,00:24:38,"Now, kids love that kind of thing, don't they?"
00:24:38,00:24:39,"Yeah, that's true."
00:24:39,00:24:42,"It's like a one-way rubbish transformer, that doll."
00:24:42,00:24:45,"Also, if you didn't explain the toy was going to do that,"
00:24:45,00:24:48,"potentially that was the most costly thing that they've ever done in the CIA,"
00:24:48,00:24:51,with all the recalls of people sending in the toy back going.
00:24:51,00:24:54,"If you realize there was a demon face underneath this, do you see that?"
00:24:54,00:24:55,"Yeah, I'm a packet."
00:24:55,00:24:59,I thought I was as vicious when the CIA was sending dolls.
00:24:59,00:25:05,"Hey, by the way, just with the idea of a Sama being turned into a doll,"
00:25:05,00:25:10,"when I read that story, it made me think about sort of villain merchandise,"
00:25:10,00:25:11,or dictator merchandise.
00:25:11,00:25:17,"Because they always, I just suddenly remembered that people like Saddam Hussein used to publish novels."
00:25:17,00:25:18,"Oh, he did, yeah."
00:25:18,00:25:19,"Yeah, he had four novels."
00:25:19,00:25:23,And two of the novels actually were published in Japan and sold in shops.
00:25:23,00:25:26,And a surprising number of people wrote like Gaddafi wrote a novel.
00:25:26,00:25:28,What was the collection of short stories?
00:25:28,00:25:30,And it was called Escape to Hell.
00:25:30,00:25:32,And so did Kim Il Sung.
00:25:32,00:25:36,"The Turkmen dictator, Sapa Murat Niyazov, wrote a book of his spiritual thoughts,"
00:25:36,00:25:39,which became required reading if you wanted to pass your driving test.
00:25:39,00:25:42,"Oh, that's good."
00:25:42,00:25:44,"Completely, completely barking, man."
00:25:44,00:25:46,There seems to be a genre of dictator lips.
00:25:46,00:25:48,"I think she called it ""dicklet."""
00:25:48,00:25:48,Yeah.
00:25:48,00:25:53,"So I was, yeah, I was trying to find ""dicklet"" on online."
00:25:53,00:25:56,You came up with some terrible Google results.
00:25:56,00:25:58,"Yeah, it's got about a hundred million blue rays of it now."
00:25:58,00:26:03,"But if you go to, if you go to Goodreads,"
00:26:03,00:26:07,"one thing that Goodreads has, so while Twitter has followers and Facebook has likes,"
00:26:08,00:26:10,Goodreads has fans.
00:26:10,00:26:12,You've become a fan of an author.
00:26:12,00:26:13,"Oh, no."
00:26:13,00:26:16,So Kim Il Sung has one fan.
00:26:16,00:26:20,Mousetong has 40 fans.
00:26:20,00:26:22,Mussolini has 20 fans.
00:26:22,00:26:23,Gaddafi has 34 fans.
00:26:23,00:26:24,And Hitler?
00:26:24,00:26:25,Well.
00:26:25,00:26:26,390 fans.
00:26:26,00:26:27,"Oh, right."
00:26:27,00:26:28,Yeah.
00:26:28,00:26:29,Loving his book work.
00:26:29,00:26:31,"Mine Camp, obviously, very popular."
00:26:31,00:26:33,And it's sequel.
00:26:33,00:26:34,How does sequel?
00:26:34,00:26:35,Mine Camp had a sequel?
00:26:35,00:26:40,"sequel to mine Camp in 1935 called ""White Book,"" which literally means second book."
00:26:40,00:26:42,I guess you'd run out of imagination by that.
00:26:42,00:26:43,"Maybe the editors said,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,"""I think we should remove that difficult from the title at all."""
00:26:46,00:26:54,"Okay, so that's it."
00:26:54,00:26:57,"That's another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish Done."""
00:26:57,00:26:59,Cracking start to the new series.
00:26:59,00:27:02,"And if you want to get in touch with any of us about the things that we've said,"
00:27:02,00:27:04,you can get us on our Twitter handles.

00:27:13,00:27:15,"Yep, but if you want to get Anna on Twitter,"
00:27:15,00:27:17,generally #getAnna on Twitter.
00:27:17,00:27:20,"But also, if you head over to qi.com/podcast,"
00:27:20,00:27:23,"we've got our pages up there with all the previous episodes,"
00:27:23,00:27:25,including stuff that will be specifically
00:27:25,00:27:28,"to do with this week's episode, video links,"
00:27:28,00:27:29,"general links to other websites,"
00:27:29,00:27:32,anything that we can think of that kind of is relevant to the episode.
00:27:32,00:27:33,That'll all be on there.
00:27:33,00:27:35,"You can explore the rest of the episodes,"
00:27:35,00:27:38,and also you'll see a button that can show you a way to visitingland.com
00:27:38,00:27:42,"where we've made an entire World Cup podcast called ""International Factful."""
00:27:42,00:27:44,"And, uh, yeah, we're going to be back again next week"
00:27:44,00:27:46,"with more ""No Such Thing as a Fish."""
