00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
 We run it on QI a few years ago and which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.840
 You have no such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.600
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.480
 He says it right up, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:22.800
 Hello and welcome to season two of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.120
 This is the QI podcast coming to you from our offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.000
 My name is Dan Trigram, I'm sitting here with Anichesensky, James Harkin and Andy Murray,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.960
 and these are our favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.040
 So in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.080
 James.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.360
 Okay, my fact is the Aztecs won necklaces made from popcorn.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.440
 Was it done like, you know the necklaces, the candy necklaces that you have?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 Yeah, kind of like that on a string.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.400
 Yeah, on a string.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.200
 Was it like that?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.760
 But was it there so that they could eat the popcorn?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.600
 No, it was there because they used popcorn as like an offering to the gods

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.200
 because it was an important crop.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.000
 Wait, did the Aztecs actually pop the corn?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.680
 Well, did they just eat it as corn?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 Yes, they heated it up, yeah.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.400
 Wow.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.880
 God, I think a popcorn has basically hasn't existed since before the Odin cinema has existed.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.360
 Yeah.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.160
 And yes.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.480
 It used to not be allowed into cinemas, no.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.960
 Yeah, in the early days, it was you had to buy it outside at a vendor and eat it outside.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.040
 And then when the Great Depression happened,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.240
 and motion picture sound and all that came and they started selling inside,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.680
 that's when they noticed how popular it was inside of the building.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.640
 What happened was that the first cinemas wanted to be like theatres,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.840
 so they had very beautiful carpets and very beautiful walls and stuff.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.200
 And they thought that if they saw popcorn, people would just tread it into the carpets.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.160
 Makes total sense.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.800
 Yeah, that's a ridiculous item to have an cinema.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.280
 They used to eat it for breakfast in America.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.400
 They, uh, they mixed it with milk and sugar and cream.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.800
 So it was kind of like a rice crispy, in a way.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.560
 Yeah, popcorn was also marketed originally as pearl or non-perre,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 either French for without equal.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.760
 Not nice, not classy.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.560
 Yeah.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.360
 Yeah.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.960
 I have a cool thing about popcorn, just popcorn, it's called popcorning.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.200
 This is chain reactions, so it happens in a popcorn bag, I think.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.680
 But 1700 nuclear weapons have in the UK,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.800
 have design flaws, which could conceivably cause multiple warheads

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.400
 to explode one after the other, which is known as popcorning.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.000
 I like the idea of giving like really non-threatening names

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.520
 to really threatening things.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.600
 Well, mushroom, you know, mushroom platform.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.800
 Well, you hate mushrooms, though.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.840
 Yeah, it's true, I find mushrooms on their own very threatening.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.240
 Do you know that during World War II,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.040
 they tried to ban the production of popcorn?

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.000
 The one I hate.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.600
 Yeah, to noisy would alert German bombers to cities.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.800
 Yeah.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.720
 Uh, they argued that popcorn production should be forbidden

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.960
 because it was just non-essential at the time.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.520
 It was like, we got more important things to do than popcorn.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.600
 Uh, but this led to the creation of the National Popcorn Association

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.600
 and they published a patent plate called popcorn is a fighting food,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.760
 which I'll argue that popcorn contained

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.800
 twice as many energy units as a pound of steak,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.080
 and it was a morale builder.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.040
 [laughs]

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.440
 Popcorn was the first food to be cooked intentionally by a microwave.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.080
 Was it really?

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.040
 Yeah, it was.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.400
 The microwave that was discovered by a guy called Percy Spencer,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.040
 he walked past a magnetron in World War II,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.320
 and he noticed that the chocolate in his pocket had melted,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.720
 and so he thought, well, I wonder what that could have been.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.320
 He realized it must have been this machine,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.880
 and so then he got some popcorn, put it next to the machine,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.920
 and then it did cook, and that was the first time they ever realized it.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.760
 It's the most positive reaction I've ever heard

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.680
 does someone having chocolate melt in their pocket?

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.200
 Yeah, glad that he made the connection

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.720
 that you then put the thing in the machine

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.880
 as opposed to cooking everything in your pocket,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.560
 just by walking around the next stage.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.840
 Yeah, that could have been how we microwaved everything.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.680
 So on Aztecs, I actually went to the Beyond Eldorado exhibition

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.600
 at the British Museum recently, which was excellent,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.040
 and I think it might be over now, so sorry,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.400
 I probably shouldn't have mentioned that.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.000
 But if a wealthy Aztec died and was cremated,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.520
 then a dog had to be cremated with them

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.400
 so that it could guide them through the afterlife.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.120
 Their relationship with their gods, you know,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.600
 20,000 people were sacrificed.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.040
 They did have a human sacrifice.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.840
 For a year.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.560
 They used to...

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.920
 20,000 dogs as well, that means.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.360
 Yeah, that's...

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.680
 They used to take hallucinogens, didn't they?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.920
 The ritual leaders would take hallucinogens

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.120
 to get closer to the gods.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.040
 And at this exhibition, they have these amazing masks.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.720
 So then they put masks on a certain animal,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.560
 so they were called Batman, or Batman,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.160
 you'd be Batman if you wore this Batman mask.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.240
 And they thought it transformed you into a bat.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.480
 So they'd take a hallucinogenic, put a Batman mask on,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.880
 and I guess just run around the tribe going...

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.680
 I'm Batman.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.400
 I'm Batman.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.720
 They also had Jaguar people, didn't they?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.640
 Yes, they asked Aztecs to do that, I think.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.240
 They would kill a Jaguar,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.520
 get inside their flesh,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.760
 and then they would be like the main warriors.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.720
 So they're not actually...

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.960
 Despite the fact that we call them Aztecs,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.480
 they're not Aztecs.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.600
 Well, they didn't call themselves...

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.960
 Yeah, we've given them that name.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.400
 They call themselves Mexico.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.040
 That's right.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.280
 Yeah, so how does that happen?

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.560
 That we were all cool would still

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.920
 calling them something they're not.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.600
 It feels like another example of good old

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.880
 western ignorance.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.840
 Yeah, it is.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.400
 The Aztec word for gold, do you know what that is?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.880
 No.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.000
 It is...

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.920
 I don't know if I can pronounce this.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.600
 Teu-quit-lattle, which literally means "excrement of the gods".

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.800
 Oh, okay.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.240
 The gods pooed it right out,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.400
 and then they, I guess they offered it my batch of them.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.680
 Well, Montezuma had a nephew called Quit-la-huak,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.360
 which meant plenty of poo.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.640
 Or dry-excrement.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.840
 Dry-excrement.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.320
 Wow.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.520
 Montezuma's revenge.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.480
 Have you heard of that?

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.680
 That's having a dodgy tummy,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.880
 when you travel to Mexico.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.760
 So this guy's name is just completely associated with trams.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.280
 Montezuma now means lots and lots and lots of experts.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.200
 Speaking of excrement and old American languages, as we were,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.760
 so Des Moines, you know, the city in Iowa.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.320
 Yeah.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.520
 Build racism from there.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.080
 Is he?

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.040
 Oh, well, perhaps he knows that a new linguistic study has been done,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.960
 which shows that the name literally

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.880
 probably means "shit face",

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.680
 and it was a mistake.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.880
 So when they were naming it,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.760
 they asked the Native Americans what the place was called,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.640
 and they said Des Moines,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.040
 which was the insulting name that they called their rival tribe,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.240
 which was "shit face".

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.280
 And now...

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.120
 And now that's what it is called "shit face".

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.680
 Oh my god.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.720
 So everyone needs to realize...

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.040
 You could say I'm feeling absolutely demoined at the moment.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.840
 I think so.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.720
 Let's get going.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.240
 Yeah.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.240
 And that ruler we were talking about.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.880
 Montezuma.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.840
 Yeah, Montezuma.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.120
 He had a zoo.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.840
 Montezuma.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.800
 Hence the name.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.920
 Yeah, Montezuma.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.440
 He missed a trick there if it wasn't called that.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.360
 He related to Jacob's Zuma by any chance.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.240
 I don't know.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.120
 Brother I doubt it.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.720
 But he had exotic animals, obviously,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.520
 but it also include dwarfs, albinos, and hunchbacks.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.440
 So a bit of a human zoo.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.800
 A bit of a PC nightmare.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.240
 All right.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.200
 If he was still around.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.320
 If you tried to do that today,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.200
 they wouldn't let you.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.000
 Yeah.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.920
 It's a political correctness, gone.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.960
 Okay.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.960
 Let's move on to fact number two.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.000
 And that comes from you, Chazinski.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.040
 Yes, my fact today is that in 2011,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.080
 China tried to pass over scene from the film Top Gun

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.760
 as footage of its own Air Force.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.440
 That's amazing.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.360
 Yep. It was a state broadcaster, China Central TV,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.440
 or obviously as we know it, CCTV.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.920
 Yep.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.600
 And it was a news bulletin in a report about training exercises

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.760
 that were being undertaken by the Air Force.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.080
 And it was showing an example of a successful strike

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.960
 on an aeroplane.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.200
 And this explosion, and we'll post it on the website

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.840
 in slow motion.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.520
 I mean, it's the explosion from Top Gun.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.520
 With a straight face reporter going

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.920
 and this is them successfully blowing up an aeroplane here.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.560
 Wow.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.800
 Well, Top Gun was a propaganda movie for America anyway.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.440
 It was partly funded by the Pentagon.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.920
 Was it?

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.720
 Yeah, in order to get people to sign up for the military.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.440
 When it was on, in the cinemas,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.760
 they had recruitment tables in the theatres

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.040
 so that people could just sign up.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.080
 Yeah, and apparently that was the highest recruitment period

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.360
 they've ever had.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.520
 Because everyone came out of the cinema just buzzing.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.200
 Just go, "Girl, America!"

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.640
 And then there was a booth and they were like, "Yeah!"

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.680
 And then a month later, they find themselves being shot at.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.280
 Yeah, they're like, "What happened then?"

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.200
 I thought this was about a volleyball and showers.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.240
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.600
 I have not seen Top Gun.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.680
 No, I mean, so please no spoilers.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.160
 Sorry.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.800
 But I have seen the live stage show of it,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.280
 which featured no props except the guys doing planes.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.240
 They held their arms behind me and went, "Pooh!"

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.760
 And that was it. They did all the dogfights.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.720
 You're kidding.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.920
 It's a very bad hour.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.080
 Talking about the fact that recruitment went up,

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.920
 which I did by 500 percent, I think,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.760
 recruitment for Navy pilots.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.920
 Also, sales of Ray Bans post Top Gun.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.800
 This is a bit of a spoiler Andy.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.640
 If you haven't seen it, they wear a lot of Ray Bans.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.440
 Oh, man.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.720
 They went up by 40 percent.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.760
 Did they? Yeah.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.240
 I love it when something influences the market.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.640
 When 50 Shades of Grey came out,

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.680
 rope sales and hardware store went through the roof.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.760
 But also, every cultural artifact as I see it with it.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.760
 So there's that, is it's Ben Minalion?

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.440
 There's a classical music piece,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.440
 which is referred to quite a lot in the book.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.680
 And sales of that absolutely rocketed.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.600
 There was a new story when John Prescott

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.000
 was found playing Croquet on his lawn.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.520
 And the sales of Croquet sets went up by three times.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.560
 Wow.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.560
 I thought you were going to say they plummeted.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.400
 No. Everyone returning their croquet set.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.840
 No, so she think it's bad publicity.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.520
 No, no. Okay, well.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.120
 Well, China has got formal this, haven't they?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.720
 Because at the Olympics in 2008,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.080
 didn't they have one adorable looking girl singing a song

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.360
 at the opening ceremony?

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.520
 And it was revealed that she had not actually

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.320
 been the one singing.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.560
 They hit a slightly less telegenic girl

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.160
 behind a screen somewhere.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.360
 Maybe locked in an attic,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.800
 just singing into a microphone.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.600
 Wonderful.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.280
 You mentioned China having formed.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.280
 There are a couple of other amusing

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.440
 Chinese news agencies stories.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.560
 A few years ago, the state news agency published a health report.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.440
 And it was illustrated with this X-ray scan of a human head.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.000
 But they use an X-ray scan of Homer Simpson's head.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.040
 And if you're looking up, I mean, it's Homer Simpson's head.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.160
 Well, with that one where he has a very, very tiny brain.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.280
 With two monkeys like picking flames off each other.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.480
 Is the tiny brain huge, everyone?

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.280
 Oh, my God.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.520
 I'm just on the Wikipedia page for propaganda

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.880
 in the People's Republic of China.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.920
 And there's nothing there.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.520
 Well, that's, I remember the story.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.880
 When I first started with QI, it was a fact I found.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.600
 It was that when China realized the power of the internet,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.560
 they got really nervous.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.360
 So they hired a man to sort it out,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.200
 gave him a computer, sat in a room.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.960
 He came out at the end of the day going,

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.640
 "This is a bit bigger than we realized."

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.240
 One dude who was meant to literally go through every forum going,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.920
 "Hey, you guys, stop talking about that."

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.760
 There's just been a recruitment drive

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.440
 in the Chinese military.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.040
 And they've changed the rules slightly

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.440
 to get more people in the army.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.680
 So they've introduced new height requirements

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.680
 which have been reduced by two centimeters,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.920
 so slightly shorter people can get in.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.760
 They've changed the weight restrictions,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.240
 because actually most people have put on more weight

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.080
 because of obesity crisis.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.920
 They've reduced eyesight requirements,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.640
 so people who are more short-sighted can now get in.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.800
 And they're allowing people with tattoos,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.160
 which they didn't before.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:54.560
 Wow.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.200
 So the Chinese army will now be very short,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.080
 fat, tattoos, short-sighted,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.680
 and probably running the wrong way,

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.280
 because they can't see where they're going.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.280
 And haven't we just changed the rules

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.720
 for the British army reserved,

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.120
 so that you can now have face or neck tattoos,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.800
 neck tattoos sound very painful to me.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.800
 I did read a book about a guy who got one tattooed

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.600
 in the second world war on the inside of his foreskin,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.400
 saying, "Hi, Doc."

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.480
 Yeah, for medical examinations and things like that.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.480
 So there's a real top gun school,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.760
 that supposedly you get a $5 fine

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.400
 if anyone in staff quotes the movie top gun.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.920
 So it's a military training for...

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.280
 They should call it military planning.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.680
 That saves time, which is vital in the heat of battle.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.720
 You should be a soldier, Andy.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.840
 Top gun school, if you're listening,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.360
 I am free for consultancy work.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.920
 He has tattoos all over his face,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.440
 so I'm not on the inside of his foreskin element.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.200
 But he did in the mirror, so it says, "Cod."

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.720
 In 2013, India's army spent six months watching Chinese spide drones

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.320
 violating its airspace,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.800
 only to find out that they were actually Jupiter and Venus.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.360
 That is embarrassing.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.400
 We were talking about media mistakes,

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.840
 and this is just my favourite one.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.680
 In 2008, a Christian website was publishing a story about Tyson Gay,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.440
 who, you know, the sprinter Tyson Gay.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.480
 So this Christian website in America wasn't allowed to use the word gay.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.840
 It had an automated system,

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.280
 which whenever it sold the word gay,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.640
 changed it to homosexual, so this website published in Huntsville.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.040
 We're wearing the Tyson homosexual all the way through.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.440
 Tyson homosexual was a blur and blues,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.680
 sprinting 100 meters fast, anyone else has.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.480
 It means a lot to me the 25-year-old homosexual said,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.560
 "I'm glad my body could do it."

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.520
 That's fantastic.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.120
 It's called the scum thought problem, isn't it?

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.520
 Yeah.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.040
 When computers misrepresent something as being rude,

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.160
 because of the fall at a wedding, the word scum thought.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.120
 People living in scum thought couldn't put their addresses into certain

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.360
 computer systems because it had that word.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.840
 Another place with that problem is a penistone,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.000
 but it's spelt penistone.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.520
 What is a penistone I wonder?

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.720
 Anyone impersonate that?

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.120
 Yeah, it's like, um, yeah, exactly.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.760
 You need to bang a fork on it, you're tuning.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:13.760
 Okay, time for fact number three.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.800
 And that is my fact.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.000
 My fact is that in 2003,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.160
 somebody misplaced the master keys to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.240
 which is the home of the fastest computer in the world,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.120
 and it's a lab where they develop all science and technology for America's national security.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.080
 Due to the loss of these keys, they had to replace the locks,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.760
 and those locks cost $1,700 to change.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.280
 I mean, that's a good day for a locksmith.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.320
 But that's, that's, I mean, it makes sense when you hear it, really,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.480
 because obviously they've got the best locks in the world.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.080
 What's so great about these locks?

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.640
 And they're like those ones that, how my mum opens a car,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.480
 where you can click them and open it.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.880
 No, I don't think ten yards away, because that's pretty amazing.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.000
 I reckon they're better.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.960
 No, they can't be.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.560
 Yeah, I think they've got a deadbolt on them,

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.160
 because those are really good, those ones.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.040
 You have to have them on your front door to get insurance, top tip.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.880
 They could be like chub locks, they're quite good.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.400
 Chub, it's a nice word as well.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.360
 Chub, yeah.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.280
 Also a fish, of course, either a fish or a lock.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.080
 Don't confuse them.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.640
 And a lock, a lock is part of a canal system,

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.120
 which has water, which is also a place where fish can live.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.400
 That's true, yeah.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.400
 That's probably where the connection happened.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.240
 A chub block, yeah, yeah.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.840
 Okay, that's enough for that fact, sir.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.760
 I feel like no one's taking my fax seriously here.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.520
 Oh no, no, no, we're not.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.680
 Have you guys been about Volvo's new plan?

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.960
 I think it was only announced this year,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.560
 so they remotely unlock your car and deliver your shopping into it.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.600
 And then leave again, but you'd cool Tesco and be like,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.120
 deliver my shopping to my car.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.120
 Click that option on your Tesco online shop.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.000
 They arrive, give your text, you go, okay, yeah, you can unlock it.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.640
 Isn't that cool?

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.440
 Are you just sitting in the office?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.520
 Do your online shop go back to your car and it's just there?

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.000
 It's a bit, I mean, it sounds like we're heading to sort of like,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.120
 I've ordered takeaway.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.600
 They literally, they come through my front door

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.280
 and just put the food in my mouth.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.400
 I have a zip car in London and you open,

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.080
 you can open those with your mobile phone.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.920
 Yeah, me too, I always find it incredible.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.760
 I have another example of that lock changing disaster.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.720
 Oh yeah, this was a few years ago in 2006,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.200
 at Felton Young Offender's Institution,

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.400
 they had to spend £250,000 changing the locks.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.800
 Basically, a TV news guru had been in

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.720
 and they had filmed a prison key.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.640
 And as a result, all the locks had to be changed.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.920
 What in case somebody saw the footage and could recreate that key?

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.400
 Okay, somebody took a photo, printed the photo,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.040
 made it a 3D model, pressed it into a cake of soap.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.080
 You'd have to have a very high definition TV to get that key, right?

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.880
 Yeah, that's true.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.080
 That's what also happens on TV when we once put a photograph

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.600
 of a bank note or something.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.520
 They make you put specimen on it so people can take a photo of the screen,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.560
 print off the photo and then pass it off as money.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.000
 Also, this is so cool.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.960
 Banknotes have little things on them, little circles in patterns

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.000
 which stop photocopiers from photocopying them.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:58.960
 It's amazing.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.080
 I read that, but then I got a bank note

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.280
 and tried to photocopier on my photocopier and it worked.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:05.760
 Oh.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.720
 Ah.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.520
 In September 2012, you could buy a set of

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.240
 master keys for New York City on eBay and the newspapers went a bit crazy about it

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.960
 and said it was a terrorist dream come truth

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.840
 and it's supposed to be able to help you turn off elevators in public buildings.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.320
 But of course, in order to do that, you'd have to get past

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.200
 all of the security to get into the building in the first place.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.160
 Well, this is the thing.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.960
 You think that these places would have incredible security.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.440
 So like, number 10 Downing Street has a phenomenal lock system

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.600
 in that it has no lock or no door handle.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.040
 It's just nothing on the front of their door.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.480
 You can only open it from the inside.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.440
 Once you get inside, you can open the door anytime you like.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:43.920
 Yeah.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.520
 What happens if everyone goes out?

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.160
 This is the problem.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.320
 That means that that house is never not occupied.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.840
 How often do you think that screws up

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.760
 and David Cameron's left sitting on his doorstep?

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.040
 Well, apparently, I don't know how often someone's left outside,

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.120
 but apparently in the first five years that Tony Blair was at Downing Street,

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.920
 37 computers, 4 mobile phones, 2 cameras,

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.920
 a mini display, a video recorder, 4 printers,

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.360
 2 projectors, and a bicycle with stolen from the building.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:07.600
 Wow.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.800
 How does that happen?

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.920
 It's so it's bomb proof.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.840
 It's a state of bomb proof metal.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.960
 It was originally made of oak.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.720
 And then there was an IRA attack.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.960
 A mortar was launched into the back garden of number 10 in 1991.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.920
 Do you guys remember when Gordon Brown got locked in a toilet

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.280
 and had to be rescued by Tony Blair?

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.480
 I think it was in the early 1990s when they went to discuss

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.160
 the potential leadership in the early 90s

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.040
 and they were having this meeting.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.320
 Gordon Brown went to the Lou.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.000
 Tony Blair waited there for 15 minutes.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.960
 I was like, what is going on?

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.680
 The phone rang.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.600
 He didn't answer it because he wasn't at his own house.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.480
 And the answer came on and it was Gordon Brown upstairs going.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.120
 Hello, Tony, I'm stuck in the toilet.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.480
 Could you go and get me out?

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.440
 Is it because the toilet in 10 Downing Street

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.160
 doesn't have a hand?

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:53.680
 Speaking of stealing things, there was an EU summit in the 2000s

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.840
 and the catering staff went on strike

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.960
 because they weren't being paid.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.240
 And so when all the politicians and the admin people

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.560
 and whatever went for lunch, there was no staff there.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.760
 And they raided the whole thing and stole all the cutlery.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.240
 Wow.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.280
 Does this maybe explain where all our forks have gone

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.320
 from the QI office?

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.880
 I big scandal in the QI office at the moment.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.680
 Supposedly, I've been throwing all the forks into the bin.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.880
 That's the proof around.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.840
 There is no proof.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.560
 What's over here?

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.520
 It's the proof because you don't remember doing it.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.640
 I just want to quickly turn it to this laboratory

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.800
 which looks after the supercomputers of the world.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.240
 And there was an old fact I remember,

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.000
 which I think James, you found ages ago,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.640
 which was that deep blue was the first computer

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.400
 to beat a grandmaster at chess.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.760
 But it's subsequent career.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.840
 Most people, when you win a major championship,

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.240
 there's a lot of glory at book deal and so on.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.000
 It now works as a reservationist for a US airline.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.520
 So it just deals with reservations.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.520
 Yeah, they split it into two pieces.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.640
 One half went to a museum and the other half worked for Panama.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.400
 Wow, American Airlines.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.240
 Wow, I'm glad that doesn't happen with people.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.120
 Actually, like this Carlson is currently in the Oslo museum.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.200
 Half is a trolley dolly with Oslo.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.640
 I read as well that they've worked out

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.520
 that if you took all the information on the internet

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.880
 and you were to save it, do you know how many blu-ray discs

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.360
 it would take to save the entire internet?

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.320
 How many, if you fit it all onto blu-ray discs?

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.400
 Is there a weirdly small number like three?

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.360
 Weirdly it is quite small, 200 million.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.000
 Which is, I think, I think that's quite small actually.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.040
 I agree.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:25.920
 Where are you going to put these?

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.400
 You're going to need a big showing unit.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.440
 And the admin will be a nightmare.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.600
 And then you're trying to get your favorite cat video.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.320
 Why didn't you have a better size these days?

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.360
 Would you know how many emails are sent per day?

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.320
 Many millions.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:40.800
 No.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.600
 How long has it been going on?

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.600
 247 billion.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.040
 Wow.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.040
 The fastest ever internet connection.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.360
 This fact's a few years old, so it probably isn't anymore.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.960
 But this was a lady called Sigrid Lothberg.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.800
 And she had an internet connection which was 40 gigabytes per second.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.120
 And it was put in by her son who was a Swedish internet legend, Peter Lothberg.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.440
 And what did she do with it?

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.120
 She dried her washing on it because it gave off so much heat

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.560
 and she didn't know what else to do with it.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.000
 So she dried her washing with it.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.800
 That's great.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.800
 Did you guys know that internet on the moon now is faster than in most parts of rural Britain?

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.320
 What, had you get into, like, the...

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.440
 They called it broadband.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.480
 That's how it was released.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.480
 Wow, I didn't hold your phone up and try to speak to Siri through your helmet.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.280
 Yeah.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.560
 It'll be very hard to tap your phone properly with those gloves.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:37.200
 Okay, it's time for the final facts of this episode.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.320
 And we head over to Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.040
 My fact is, did you know that Ken is officially an accessory to Barbie?

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.160
 Brilliant.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.360
 I really like that.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.200
 He says she's not a feminist icon.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.000
 Yeah.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.360
 Yeah, this is very weird.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.080
 Okay, so the Barbie and Ken, original, the original Barbie and Ken, Ken was named after the son

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.680
 of the Inventors of Barbie.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.080
 But Barbie was named after their daughter, Barbara.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.560
 Oh, yes.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.680
 She's quite peculiar, a sort of brother sister thing.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.240
 And Ruth, the wife of the couple who invented Barbie and Ken,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.080
 argued for a bulge in his groin.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.240
 But the design team refused to put one in.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.200
 Yeah, he's famously bereft underneath those trousers, isn't it?

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.080
 Yeah.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.960
 There is a trailer trash doll you can buy in America.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.200
 It's called Turleine.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.480
 It's a pregnant doll from 2005.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.560
 And she's one of these talking dolls.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.080
 And her catchphrases include,

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.000
 if the trailers are rockin, don't come a knockin.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.440
 And pour me a double and drink him for two.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.240
 What?

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.480
 Does she ever give birth?

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.080
 In some kind of traumatic night?

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.440
 Can you imagine that doll, the giving birth doll?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.640
 They've got to make it.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.880
 Well, they were used for good dolls during brown versus the Board of Education.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.680
 When civil rights legislation was overturned in 1954,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.240
 it was one of the first cases where a Supreme Court cited a social study

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.640
 in its reasons for making a certain decision.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.640
 So this was when America agreed the segregation was a negative thing

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.120
 and had a negative effect on the people who were subject to it.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.800
 And what they did was, in the experiment,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.520
 they brought black and white dolls to schools that were segregated.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.400
 So black schools.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.280
 And they'd show the kids a black doll and a white doll and get them to say,

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.960
 "Which one do you think is a good doll, which is a bad doll?"

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.480
 And all the kids would go, "Oh, the white one's a good doll.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.520
 I want to play with the white one."

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.200
 Because that's what they've brought up to think.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.720
 And then they'd ask them, "Okay, in which doll do you think is more like you?"

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.960
 And almost all the kids got really, really upset.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.640
 Meet them like cried or ran out of the room.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.960
 Because suddenly they were identifying themselves with a doll.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.640
 They just said was the bad doll.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.400
 And that was cited by the Supreme Court when brown versus the Board of Education

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.520
 came to its conclusion.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.960
 Oh, that is really interesting.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.640
 Here's another good use for a doll, which is, it's a nice use,

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.360
 but perhaps not as worthy as your use.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.840
 There was a Chinese guy whose wife had died.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.880
 And he became rather attached to his blow-up doll.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.440
 And everyone started taking the Mickey out of him a little bit.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.640
 And he got very upset.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.400
 And so he decided to end it all.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.760
 And eyewitnesses at the scene were horrified to see him plummet from the building,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.760
 holding what they thought was a child.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.840
 But it was actually his blow-up doll.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.920
 And he very romantically jumped off the building with his blow-up doll,

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.040
 landed on the doll, the doll exploded, and he survived.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.720
 Oh, wow!

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.680
 He murdered him up.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.280
 She gave her life for him.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.720
 Exactly, it's romantic.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.760
 That's very romantic.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.200
 That must have been a horrific moment.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.840
 They went and saw this, what they thought was a child explode.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.760
 You can get.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.040
 This is slightly controversial.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.160
 Dope on a rope.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.240
 Dope on a rope was Saddam Hussein with a noose around his neck,

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.000
 which was commemorating his death.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.560
 It's from a website called Hero Builders.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.360
 And they've got over 100 satirical figures that you can get,

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.320
 including Tony Blair as an action man.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.080
 You can get George Bush as a superhero.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.240
 Michael Jackson holding a baby over.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.760
 Well, that would be...

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.840
 Gordon Brown comes with his own part of Lou.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:59.680
 That would be the same company, probably, which in 2002,

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.640
 were Simon Bin Laden dolls dramatically outsold Tony Blair dolls.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:02.960
 Really?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.480
 I think it was a bit of an embarrassment, yeah.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:04.960
 Really?

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.600
 Yeah.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.560
 Well, that was not the only firm to make Simon Bin Laden dolls,

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.760
 because in 2005, the CIA made a custom-made Bin Laden action figure,

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.600
 which they were thinking about distributing to children in the Middle East,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.040
 and the face would peel off and reveal a much scarier red face with demonic eyes, and, you know...

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:23.600
 Oh, wow!

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.040
 So would usage of the toy suddenly Satan would appear?

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:27.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:27.760
 Exactly.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.240
 The healing wow.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:28.880
 Yeah, okay.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.200
 So that would apparently put children off.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.480
 That would apparently make children support the war on Terremble.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.600
 It would put them off dolls.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.640
 It would put them off dolls, yeah.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.640
 Now, kids love that kind of thing, don't they?

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.280
 Yeah, that's true.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.720
 It's like a one-way rubbish transformer, that doll.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.520
 Also, if you didn't explain the toy was going to do that,

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.800
 potentially that was the most costly thing that they've ever done in the CIA,

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.600
 with all the recalls of people sending in the toy back going.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.640
 If you realize there was a demon face underneath this, do you see that?

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.600
 Yeah, I'm a packet.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.040
 I thought I was as vicious when the CIA was sending dolls.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:05.760
 Hey, by the way, just with the idea of a Sama being turned into a doll,

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:10.240
 when I read that story, it made me think about sort of villain merchandise,

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.760
 or dictator merchandise.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:17.280
 Because they always, I just suddenly remembered that people like Saddam Hussein used to publish novels.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.240
 Oh, he did, yeah.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.680
 Yeah, he had four novels.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.200
 And two of the novels actually were published in Japan and sold in shops.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.800
 And a surprising number of people wrote like Gaddafi wrote a novel.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.800
 What was the collection of short stories?

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.240
 And it was called Escape to Hell.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.160
 And so did Kim Il Sung.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:36.640
 The Turkmen dictator, Sapa Murat Niyazov, wrote a book of his spiritual thoughts,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.680
 which became required reading if you wanted to pass your driving test.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.160
 Oh, that's good.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.800
 Completely, completely barking, man.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.800
 There seems to be a genre of dictator lips.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.160
 I think she called it "dicklet."

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:48.400
 Yeah.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.600
 So I was, yeah, I was trying to find "dicklet" on online.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.400
 You came up with some terrible Google results.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.720
 Yeah, it's got about a hundred million blue rays of it now.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.120
 But if you go to, if you go to Goodreads,

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.600
 one thing that Goodreads has, so while Twitter has followers and Facebook has likes,

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.320
 Goodreads has fans.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.160
 You've become a fan of an author.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.280
 Oh, no.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.080
 So Kim Il Sung has one fan.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.240
 Mousetong has 40 fans.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.160
 Mussolini has 20 fans.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.920
 Gaddafi has 34 fans.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.800
 And Hitler?

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.280
 Well.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.960
 390 fans.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.680
 Oh, right.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.240
 Yeah.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.200
 Loving his book work.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.680
 Mine Camp, obviously, very popular.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.200
 And it's sequel.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.000
 How does sequel?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.120
 Mine Camp had a sequel?

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:40.240
 sequel to mine Camp in 1935 called "White Book," which literally means second book.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.160
 I guess you'd run out of imagination by that.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.440
 Maybe the editors said,

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.320
 "I think we should remove that difficult from the title at all."

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:54.720
 Okay, so that's it.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.760
 That's another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish Done."

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.360
 Cracking start to the new series.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.400
 And if you want to get in touch with any of us about the things that we've said,

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.400
 you can get us on our Twitter handles.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:09.600
 I'm on @tribaland, James, @egshaped, Andy, @andruhunterm,

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.560

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.280
 You can get me on @clikipedia, the QI interviews piece.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.440
 Yep, but if you want to get Anna on Twitter,

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.440
 generally #getAnna on Twitter.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.720
 But also, if you head over to qi.com/podcast,

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.280
 we've got our pages up there with all the previous episodes,

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.440
 including stuff that will be specifically

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.000
 to do with this week's episode, video links,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.600
 general links to other websites,

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.400
 anything that we can think of that kind of is relevant to the episode.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.440
 That'll all be on there.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.040
 You can explore the rest of the episodes,

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.560
 and also you'll see a button that can show you a way to visitingland.com

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.560
 where we've made an entire World Cup podcast called "International Factful."

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.720
 And, uh, yeah, we're going to be back again next week

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.640
 with more "No Such Thing as a Fish."

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.080
 We'll see you then. Good bye.
