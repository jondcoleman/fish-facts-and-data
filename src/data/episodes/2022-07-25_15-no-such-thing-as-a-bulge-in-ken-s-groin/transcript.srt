00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 We run it on QI a few years ago and which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,840
 You have no such thing as a fish.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,600
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,480
 He says it right up, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:22,800
 Hello and welcome to season two of No Such Thing as a Fish.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,120
 This is the QI podcast coming to you from our offices in Covenant Garden.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,000
 My name is Dan Trigram, I'm sitting here with Anichesensky, James Harkin and Andy Murray,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,960
 and these are our favorite facts from the last seven days.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,040
 So in no particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,080
 James.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,360
 Okay, my fact is the Aztecs won necklaces made from popcorn.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,440
 Was it done like, you know the necklaces, the candy necklaces that you have?

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
 Yeah, kind of like that on a string.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,400
 Yeah, on a string.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,200
 Was it like that?

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,760
 But was it there so that they could eat the popcorn?

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,600
 No, it was there because they used popcorn as like an offering to the gods

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,200
 because it was an important crop.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,000
 Wait, did the Aztecs actually pop the corn?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,680
 Well, did they just eat it as corn?

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
 Yes, they heated it up, yeah.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,400
 Wow.

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
 God, I think a popcorn has basically hasn't existed since before the Odin cinema has existed.

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,360
 Yeah.

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,160
 And yes.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,480
 It used to not be allowed into cinemas, no.

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,960
 Yeah, in the early days, it was you had to buy it outside at a vendor and eat it outside.

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,040
 And then when the Great Depression happened,

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,240
 and motion picture sound and all that came and they started selling inside,

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,680
 that's when they noticed how popular it was inside of the building.

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,640
 What happened was that the first cinemas wanted to be like theatres,

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,840
 so they had very beautiful carpets and very beautiful walls and stuff.

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,200
 And they thought that if they saw popcorn, people would just tread it into the carpets.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,160
 Makes total sense.

35
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,800
 Yeah, that's a ridiculous item to have an cinema.

36
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,280
 They used to eat it for breakfast in America.

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,400
 They, uh, they mixed it with milk and sugar and cream.

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,800
 So it was kind of like a rice crispy, in a way.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,560
 Yeah, popcorn was also marketed originally as pearl or non-perre,

40
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
 either French for without equal.

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,760
 Not nice, not classy.

42
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,560
 Yeah.

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,360
 Yeah.

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,960
 I have a cool thing about popcorn, just popcorn, it's called popcorning.

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,200
 This is chain reactions, so it happens in a popcorn bag, I think.

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,680
 But 1700 nuclear weapons have in the UK,

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,800
 have design flaws, which could conceivably cause multiple warheads

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
 to explode one after the other, which is known as popcorning.

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
 I like the idea of giving like really non-threatening names

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
 to really threatening things.

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,600
 Well, mushroom, you know, mushroom platform.

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,800
 Well, you hate mushrooms, though.

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,840
 Yeah, it's true, I find mushrooms on their own very threatening.

54
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,240
 Do you know that during World War II,

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,040
 they tried to ban the production of popcorn?

56
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
 The one I hate.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,600
 Yeah, to noisy would alert German bombers to cities.

58
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,800
 Yeah.

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,720
 Uh, they argued that popcorn production should be forbidden

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,960
 because it was just non-essential at the time.

61
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,520
 It was like, we got more important things to do than popcorn.

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,600
 Uh, but this led to the creation of the National Popcorn Association

63
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,600
 and they published a patent plate called popcorn is a fighting food,

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,760
 which I'll argue that popcorn contained

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,800
 twice as many energy units as a pound of steak,

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,080
 and it was a morale builder.

67
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,040
 [laughs]

68
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,440
 Popcorn was the first food to be cooked intentionally by a microwave.

69
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,080
 Was it really?

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,040
 Yeah, it was.

71
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,400
 The microwave that was discovered by a guy called Percy Spencer,

72
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,040
 he walked past a magnetron in World War II,

73
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,320
 and he noticed that the chocolate in his pocket had melted,

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,720
 and so he thought, well, I wonder what that could have been.

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,320
 He realized it must have been this machine,

76
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,880
 and so then he got some popcorn, put it next to the machine,

77
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,920
 and then it did cook, and that was the first time they ever realized it.

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,760
 It's the most positive reaction I've ever heard

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,680
 does someone having chocolate melt in their pocket?

80
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,200
 Yeah, glad that he made the connection

81
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,720
 that you then put the thing in the machine

82
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,880
 as opposed to cooking everything in your pocket,

83
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,560
 just by walking around the next stage.

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,840
 Yeah, that could have been how we microwaved everything.

85
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,680
 So on Aztecs, I actually went to the Beyond Eldorado exhibition

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,600
 at the British Museum recently, which was excellent,

87
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,040
 and I think it might be over now, so sorry,

88
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,400
 I probably shouldn't have mentioned that.

89
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,000
 But if a wealthy Aztec died and was cremated,

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,520
 then a dog had to be cremated with them

91
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,400
 so that it could guide them through the afterlife.

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,120
 Their relationship with their gods, you know,

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,600
 20,000 people were sacrificed.

94
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
 They did have a human sacrifice.

95
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,840
 For a year.

96
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,560
 They used to...

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,920
 20,000 dogs as well, that means.

98
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,360
 Yeah, that's...

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,680
 They used to take hallucinogens, didn't they?

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,920
 The ritual leaders would take hallucinogens

101
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,120
 to get closer to the gods.

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
 And at this exhibition, they have these amazing masks.

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,720
 So then they put masks on a certain animal,

104
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,560
 so they were called Batman, or Batman,

105
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,160
 you'd be Batman if you wore this Batman mask.

106
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,240
 And they thought it transformed you into a bat.

107
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,480
 So they'd take a hallucinogenic, put a Batman mask on,

108
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,880
 and I guess just run around the tribe going...

109
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,680
 I'm Batman.

110
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,400
 I'm Batman.

111
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,720
 They also had Jaguar people, didn't they?

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,640
 Yes, they asked Aztecs to do that, I think.

113
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,240
 They would kill a Jaguar,

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,520
 get inside their flesh,

115
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,760
 and then they would be like the main warriors.

116
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,720
 So they're not actually...

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,960
 Despite the fact that we call them Aztecs,

118
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,480
 they're not Aztecs.

119
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,600
 Well, they didn't call themselves...

120
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,960
 Yeah, we've given them that name.

121
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,400
 They call themselves Mexico.

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,040
 That's right.

123
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
 Yeah, so how does that happen?

124
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,560
 That we were all cool would still

125
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,920
 calling them something they're not.

126
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,600
 It feels like another example of good old

127
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,880
 western ignorance.

128
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,840
 Yeah, it is.

129
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,400
 The Aztec word for gold, do you know what that is?

130
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,880
 No.

131
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,000
 It is...

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,920
 I don't know if I can pronounce this.

133
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,600
 Teu-quit-lattle, which literally means "excrement of the gods".

134
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
 Oh, okay.

135
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,240
 The gods pooed it right out,

136
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,400
 and then they, I guess they offered it my batch of them.

137
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,680
 Well, Montezuma had a nephew called Quit-la-huak,

138
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,360
 which meant plenty of poo.

139
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,640
 Or dry-excrement.

140
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,840
 Dry-excrement.

141
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,320
 Wow.

142
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,520
 Montezuma's revenge.

143
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,480
 Have you heard of that?

144
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,680
 That's having a dodgy tummy,

145
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,880
 when you travel to Mexico.

146
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,760
 So this guy's name is just completely associated with trams.

147
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,280
 Montezuma now means lots and lots and lots of experts.

148
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,200
 Speaking of excrement and old American languages, as we were,

149
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,760
 so Des Moines, you know, the city in Iowa.

150
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,320
 Yeah.

151
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,520
 Build racism from there.

152
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,080
 Is he?

153
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,040
 Oh, well, perhaps he knows that a new linguistic study has been done,

154
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,960
 which shows that the name literally

155
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,880
 probably means "shit face",

156
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,680
 and it was a mistake.

157
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,880
 So when they were naming it,

158
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,760
 they asked the Native Americans what the place was called,

159
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,640
 and they said Des Moines,

160
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,040
 which was the insulting name that they called their rival tribe,

161
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,240
 which was "shit face".

162
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,280
 And now...

163
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,120
 And now that's what it is called "shit face".

164
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,680
 Oh my god.

165
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,720
 So everyone needs to realize...

166
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,040
 You could say I'm feeling absolutely demoined at the moment.

167
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,840
 I think so.

168
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,720
 Let's get going.

169
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
 Yeah.

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
 And that ruler we were talking about.

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,880
 Montezuma.

172
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,840
 Yeah, Montezuma.

173
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
 He had a zoo.

174
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,840
 Montezuma.

175
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,800
 Hence the name.

176
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,920
 Yeah, Montezuma.

177
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,440
 He missed a trick there if it wasn't called that.

178
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,360
 He related to Jacob's Zuma by any chance.

179
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,240
 I don't know.

180
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,120
 Brother I doubt it.

181
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
 But he had exotic animals, obviously,

182
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,520
 but it also include dwarfs, albinos, and hunchbacks.

183
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,440
 So a bit of a human zoo.

184
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,800
 A bit of a PC nightmare.

185
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,240
 All right.

186
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,200
 If he was still around.

187
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,320
 If you tried to do that today,

188
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,200
 they wouldn't let you.

189
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
 Yeah.

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,920
 It's a political correctness, gone.

191
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,960
 Okay.

192
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
 Let's move on to fact number two.

193
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,000
 And that comes from you, Chazinski.

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,040
 Yes, my fact today is that in 2011,

195
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,080
 China tried to pass over scene from the film Top Gun

196
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,760
 as footage of its own Air Force.

197
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,440
 That's amazing.

198
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,360
 Yep. It was a state broadcaster, China Central TV,

199
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,440
 or obviously as we know it, CCTV.

200
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,920
 Yep.

201
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,600
 And it was a news bulletin in a report about training exercises

202
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,760
 that were being undertaken by the Air Force.

203
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,080
 And it was showing an example of a successful strike

204
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,960
 on an aeroplane.

205
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,200
 And this explosion, and we'll post it on the website

206
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,840
 in slow motion.

207
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,520
 I mean, it's the explosion from Top Gun.

208
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
 With a straight face reporter going

209
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,920
 and this is them successfully blowing up an aeroplane here.

210
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,560
 Wow.

211
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,800
 Well, Top Gun was a propaganda movie for America anyway.

212
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,440
 It was partly funded by the Pentagon.

213
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:35,920
 Was it?

214
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,720
 Yeah, in order to get people to sign up for the military.

215
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,440
 When it was on, in the cinemas,

216
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,760
 they had recruitment tables in the theatres

217
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,040
 so that people could just sign up.

218
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,080
 Yeah, and apparently that was the highest recruitment period

219
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,360
 they've ever had.

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
 Because everyone came out of the cinema just buzzing.

221
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,200
 Just go, "Girl, America!"

222
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,640
 And then there was a booth and they were like, "Yeah!"

223
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,680
 And then a month later, they find themselves being shot at.

224
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,280
 Yeah, they're like, "What happened then?"

225
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,200
 I thought this was about a volleyball and showers.

226
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,240
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

227
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,600
 I have not seen Top Gun.

228
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,680
 No, I mean, so please no spoilers.

229
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,160
 Sorry.

230
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,800
 But I have seen the live stage show of it,

231
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,280
 which featured no props except the guys doing planes.

232
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,240
 They held their arms behind me and went, "Pooh!"

233
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,760
 And that was it. They did all the dogfights.

234
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,720
 You're kidding.

235
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
 It's a very bad hour.

236
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,080
 Talking about the fact that recruitment went up,

237
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,920
 which I did by 500 percent, I think,

238
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,760
 recruitment for Navy pilots.

239
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,920
 Also, sales of Ray Bans post Top Gun.

240
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,800
 This is a bit of a spoiler Andy.

241
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,640
 If you haven't seen it, they wear a lot of Ray Bans.

242
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,440
 Oh, man.

243
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,720
 They went up by 40 percent.

244
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,760
 Did they? Yeah.

245
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,240
 I love it when something influences the market.

246
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,640
 When 50 Shades of Grey came out,

247
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,680
 rope sales and hardware store went through the roof.

248
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,760
 But also, every cultural artifact as I see it with it.

249
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
 So there's that, is it's Ben Minalion?

250
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
 There's a classical music piece,

251
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
 which is referred to quite a lot in the book.

252
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,680
 And sales of that absolutely rocketed.

253
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,600
 There was a new story when John Prescott

254
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
 was found playing Croquet on his lawn.

255
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,520
 And the sales of Croquet sets went up by three times.

256
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,560
 Wow.

257
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
 I thought you were going to say they plummeted.

258
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,400
 No. Everyone returning their croquet set.

259
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,840
 No, so she think it's bad publicity.

260
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,520
 No, no. Okay, well.

261
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,120
 Well, China has got formal this, haven't they?

262
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,720
 Because at the Olympics in 2008,

263
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
 didn't they have one adorable looking girl singing a song

264
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,360
 at the opening ceremony?

265
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,520
 And it was revealed that she had not actually

266
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,320
 been the one singing.

267
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,560
 They hit a slightly less telegenic girl

268
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,160
 behind a screen somewhere.

269
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,360
 Maybe locked in an attic,

270
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
 just singing into a microphone.

271
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,600
 Wonderful.

272
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,280
 You mentioned China having formed.

273
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,280
 There are a couple of other amusing

274
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,440
 Chinese news agencies stories.

275
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,560
 A few years ago, the state news agency published a health report.

276
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,440
 And it was illustrated with this X-ray scan of a human head.

277
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,000
 But they use an X-ray scan of Homer Simpson's head.

278
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,040
 And if you're looking up, I mean, it's Homer Simpson's head.

279
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,160
 Well, with that one where he has a very, very tiny brain.

280
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,880
 Yeah, exactly.

281
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,280
 With two monkeys like picking flames off each other.

282
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,480
 Is the tiny brain huge, everyone?

283
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,280
 Oh, my God.

284
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,520
 I'm just on the Wikipedia page for propaganda

285
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,880
 in the People's Republic of China.

286
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,920
 And there's nothing there.

287
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,520
 Well, that's, I remember the story.

288
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,880
 When I first started with QI, it was a fact I found.

289
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,600
 It was that when China realized the power of the internet,

290
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,560
 they got really nervous.

291
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
 So they hired a man to sort it out,

292
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,200
 gave him a computer, sat in a room.

293
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,960
 He came out at the end of the day going,

294
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,640
 "This is a bit bigger than we realized."

295
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,240
 One dude who was meant to literally go through every forum going,

296
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,920
 "Hey, you guys, stop talking about that."

297
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,760
 There's just been a recruitment drive

298
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,440
 in the Chinese military.

299
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,040
 And they've changed the rules slightly

300
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,440
 to get more people in the army.

301
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,680
 So they've introduced new height requirements

302
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
 which have been reduced by two centimeters,

303
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
 so slightly shorter people can get in.

304
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,760
 They've changed the weight restrictions,

305
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,240
 because actually most people have put on more weight

306
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,080
 because of obesity crisis.

307
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,920
 They've reduced eyesight requirements,

308
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,640
 so people who are more short-sighted can now get in.

309
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
 And they're allowing people with tattoos,

310
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,160
 which they didn't before.

311
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,560
 Wow.

312
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,200
 So the Chinese army will now be very short,

313
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,080
 fat, tattoos, short-sighted,

314
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,680
 and probably running the wrong way,

315
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,280
 because they can't see where they're going.

316
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
 And haven't we just changed the rules

317
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,720
 for the British army reserved,

318
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,120
 so that you can now have face or neck tattoos,

319
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,800
 neck tattoos sound very painful to me.

320
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
 I did read a book about a guy who got one tattooed

321
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,600
 in the second world war on the inside of his foreskin,

322
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,400
 saying, "Hi, Doc."

323
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,480
 Yeah, for medical examinations and things like that.

324
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
 So there's a real top gun school,

325
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,760
 that supposedly you get a $5 fine

326
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,400
 if anyone in staff quotes the movie top gun.

327
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,920
 So it's a military training for...

328
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,280
 They should call it military planning.

329
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,680
 That saves time, which is vital in the heat of battle.

330
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,720
 You should be a soldier, Andy.

331
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,840
 Top gun school, if you're listening,

332
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,360
 I am free for consultancy work.

333
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,920
 He has tattoos all over his face,

334
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,440
 so I'm not on the inside of his foreskin element.

335
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
 But he did in the mirror, so it says, "Cod."

336
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,720
 In 2013, India's army spent six months watching Chinese spide drones

337
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
 violating its airspace,

338
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,800
 only to find out that they were actually Jupiter and Venus.

339
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,360
 That is embarrassing.

340
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,400
 We were talking about media mistakes,

341
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,840
 and this is just my favourite one.

342
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,680
 In 2008, a Christian website was publishing a story about Tyson Gay,

343
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,440
 who, you know, the sprinter Tyson Gay.

344
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,480
 So this Christian website in America wasn't allowed to use the word gay.

345
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,840
 It had an automated system,

346
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,280
 which whenever it sold the word gay,

347
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,640
 changed it to homosexual, so this website published in Huntsville.

348
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,040
 We're wearing the Tyson homosexual all the way through.

349
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,440
 Tyson homosexual was a blur and blues,

350
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,680
 sprinting 100 meters fast, anyone else has.

351
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,480
 It means a lot to me the 25-year-old homosexual said,

352
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,560
 "I'm glad my body could do it."

353
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,520
 That's fantastic.

354
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,120
 It's called the scum thought problem, isn't it?

355
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,520
 Yeah.

356
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,040
 When computers misrepresent something as being rude,

357
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,160
 because of the fall at a wedding, the word scum thought.

358
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,120
 People living in scum thought couldn't put their addresses into certain

359
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,360
 computer systems because it had that word.

360
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,840
 Another place with that problem is a penistone,

361
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,000
 but it's spelt penistone.

362
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,520
 What is a penistone I wonder?

363
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,720
 Anyone impersonate that?

364
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
 Yeah, it's like, um, yeah, exactly.

365
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,760
 You need to bang a fork on it, you're tuning.

366
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:13,760
 Okay, time for fact number three.

367
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,800
 And that is my fact.

368
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,000
 My fact is that in 2003,

369
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,160
 somebody misplaced the master keys to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,

370
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,240
 which is the home of the fastest computer in the world,

371
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,120
 and it's a lab where they develop all science and technology for America's national security.

372
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,080
 Due to the loss of these keys, they had to replace the locks,

373
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,760
 and those locks cost $1,700 to change.

374
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,280
 I mean, that's a good day for a locksmith.

375
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,320
 But that's, that's, I mean, it makes sense when you hear it, really,

376
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,480
 because obviously they've got the best locks in the world.

377
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,080
 What's so great about these locks?

378
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,640
 And they're like those ones that, how my mum opens a car,

379
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,480
 where you can click them and open it.

380
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,880
 No, I don't think ten yards away, because that's pretty amazing.

381
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,000
 I reckon they're better.

382
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,960
 No, they can't be.

383
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,560
 Yeah, I think they've got a deadbolt on them,

384
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,160
 because those are really good, those ones.

385
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,040
 You have to have them on your front door to get insurance, top tip.

386
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,880
 They could be like chub locks, they're quite good.

387
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,400
 Chub, it's a nice word as well.

388
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,360
 Chub, yeah.

389
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,280
 Also a fish, of course, either a fish or a lock.

390
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,080
 Don't confuse them.

391
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,640
 And a lock, a lock is part of a canal system,

392
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,120
 which has water, which is also a place where fish can live.

393
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,400
 That's true, yeah.

394
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
 That's probably where the connection happened.

395
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,240
 A chub block, yeah, yeah.

396
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,840
 Okay, that's enough for that fact, sir.

397
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,760
 I feel like no one's taking my fax seriously here.

398
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,520
 Oh no, no, no, we're not.

399
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,680
 Have you guys been about Volvo's new plan?

400
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,960
 I think it was only announced this year,

401
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,560
 so they remotely unlock your car and deliver your shopping into it.

402
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,600
 And then leave again, but you'd cool Tesco and be like,

403
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,120
 deliver my shopping to my car.

404
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
 Click that option on your Tesco online shop.

405
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,000
 They arrive, give your text, you go, okay, yeah, you can unlock it.

406
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,640
 Isn't that cool?

407
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,440
 Are you just sitting in the office?

408
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,520
 Do your online shop go back to your car and it's just there?

409
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,000
 It's a bit, I mean, it sounds like we're heading to sort of like,

410
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,120
 I've ordered takeaway.

411
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,600
 They literally, they come through my front door

412
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,280
 and just put the food in my mouth.

413
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:02,400
 I have a zip car in London and you open,

414
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,080
 you can open those with your mobile phone.

415
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,920
 Yeah, me too, I always find it incredible.

416
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,760
 I have another example of that lock changing disaster.

417
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,720
 Oh yeah, this was a few years ago in 2006,

418
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,200
 at Felton Young Offender's Institution,

419
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,400
 they had to spend £250,000 changing the locks.

420
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,800
 Basically, a TV news guru had been in

421
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,720
 and they had filmed a prison key.

422
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,640
 And as a result, all the locks had to be changed.

423
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,920
 What in case somebody saw the footage and could recreate that key?

424
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,400
 Okay, somebody took a photo, printed the photo,

425
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,040
 made it a 3D model, pressed it into a cake of soap.

426
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,080
 You'd have to have a very high definition TV to get that key, right?

427
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,880
 Yeah, that's true.

428
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,080
 That's what also happens on TV when we once put a photograph

429
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,600
 of a bank note or something.

430
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,520
 They make you put specimen on it so people can take a photo of the screen,

431
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,560
 print off the photo and then pass it off as money.

432
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,000
 Also, this is so cool.

433
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,960
 Banknotes have little things on them, little circles in patterns

434
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,000
 which stop photocopiers from photocopying them.

435
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,960
 It's amazing.

436
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,080
 I read that, but then I got a bank note

437
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,280
 and tried to photocopier on my photocopier and it worked.

438
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,760
 Oh.

439
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,720
 Ah.

440
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,520
 In September 2012, you could buy a set of

441
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,240
 master keys for New York City on eBay and the newspapers went a bit crazy about it

442
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,960
 and said it was a terrorist dream come truth

443
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,840
 and it's supposed to be able to help you turn off elevators in public buildings.

444
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,320
 But of course, in order to do that, you'd have to get past

445
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,200
 all of the security to get into the building in the first place.

446
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,160
 Well, this is the thing.

447
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,960
 You think that these places would have incredible security.

448
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,440
 So like, number 10 Downing Street has a phenomenal lock system

449
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,600
 in that it has no lock or no door handle.

450
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,040
 It's just nothing on the front of their door.

451
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,480
 You can only open it from the inside.

452
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,440
 Once you get inside, you can open the door anytime you like.

453
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:43,920
 Yeah.

454
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,520
 What happens if everyone goes out?

455
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,160
 This is the problem.

456
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,320
 That means that that house is never not occupied.

457
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,840
 How often do you think that screws up

458
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,760
 and David Cameron's left sitting on his doorstep?

459
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,040
 Well, apparently, I don't know how often someone's left outside,

460
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,120
 but apparently in the first five years that Tony Blair was at Downing Street,

461
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,920
 37 computers, 4 mobile phones, 2 cameras,

462
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
 a mini display, a video recorder, 4 printers,

463
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,360
 2 projectors, and a bicycle with stolen from the building.

464
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:07,600
 Wow.

465
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,800
 How does that happen?

466
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,920
 It's so it's bomb proof.

467
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,840
 It's a state of bomb proof metal.

468
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,960
 It was originally made of oak.

469
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,720
 And then there was an IRA attack.

470
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,960
 A mortar was launched into the back garden of number 10 in 1991.

471
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,920
 Do you guys remember when Gordon Brown got locked in a toilet

472
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,280
 and had to be rescued by Tony Blair?

473
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,480
 I think it was in the early 1990s when they went to discuss

474
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,160
 the potential leadership in the early 90s

475
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,040
 and they were having this meeting.

476
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,320
 Gordon Brown went to the Lou.

477
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,000
 Tony Blair waited there for 15 minutes.

478
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,960
 I was like, what is going on?

479
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,680
 The phone rang.

480
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,600
 He didn't answer it because he wasn't at his own house.

481
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,480
 And the answer came on and it was Gordon Brown upstairs going.

482
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,120
 Hello, Tony, I'm stuck in the toilet.

483
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,480
 Could you go and get me out?

484
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,440
 Is it because the toilet in 10 Downing Street

485
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,160
 doesn't have a hand?

486
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:53,680
 Speaking of stealing things, there was an EU summit in the 2000s

487
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,840
 and the catering staff went on strike

488
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,960
 because they weren't being paid.

489
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,240
 And so when all the politicians and the admin people

490
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,560
 and whatever went for lunch, there was no staff there.

491
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,760
 And they raided the whole thing and stole all the cutlery.

492
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,240
 Wow.

493
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,280
 Does this maybe explain where all our forks have gone

494
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,320
 from the QI office?

495
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,880
 I big scandal in the QI office at the moment.

496
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,680
 Supposedly, I've been throwing all the forks into the bin.

497
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,880
 That's the proof around.

498
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,840
 There is no proof.

499
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,560
 What's over here?

500
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,520
 It's the proof because you don't remember doing it.

501
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,640
 I just want to quickly turn it to this laboratory

502
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,800
 which looks after the supercomputers of the world.

503
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,240
 And there was an old fact I remember,

504
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,000
 which I think James, you found ages ago,

505
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,640
 which was that deep blue was the first computer

506
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,400
 to beat a grandmaster at chess.

507
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,760
 But it's subsequent career.

508
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,840
 Most people, when you win a major championship,

509
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,240
 there's a lot of glory at book deal and so on.

510
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,000
 It now works as a reservationist for a US airline.

511
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,520
 So it just deals with reservations.

512
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
 Yeah, they split it into two pieces.

513
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,640
 One half went to a museum and the other half worked for Panama.

514
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,400
 Wow, American Airlines.

515
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,240
 Wow, I'm glad that doesn't happen with people.

516
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,120
 Actually, like this Carlson is currently in the Oslo museum.

517
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,200
 Half is a trolley dolly with Oslo.

518
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,640
 I read as well that they've worked out

519
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,520
 that if you took all the information on the internet

520
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,880
 and you were to save it, do you know how many blu-ray discs

521
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,360
 it would take to save the entire internet?

522
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,320
 How many, if you fit it all onto blu-ray discs?

523
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,400
 Is there a weirdly small number like three?

524
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,360
 Weirdly it is quite small, 200 million.

525
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,000
 Which is, I think, I think that's quite small actually.

526
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,040
 I agree.

527
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,920
 Where are you going to put these?

528
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,400
 You're going to need a big showing unit.

529
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,440
 And the admin will be a nightmare.

530
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,600
 And then you're trying to get your favorite cat video.

531
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
 Why didn't you have a better size these days?

532
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,360
 Would you know how many emails are sent per day?

533
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,320
 Many millions.

534
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,800
 No.

535
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,600
 How long has it been going on?

536
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
 247 billion.

537
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,040
 Wow.

538
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
 The fastest ever internet connection.

539
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,360
 This fact's a few years old, so it probably isn't anymore.

540
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,960
 But this was a lady called Sigrid Lothberg.

541
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,800
 And she had an internet connection which was 40 gigabytes per second.

542
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,120
 And it was put in by her son who was a Swedish internet legend, Peter Lothberg.

543
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,440
 And what did she do with it?

544
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,120
 She dried her washing on it because it gave off so much heat

545
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,560
 and she didn't know what else to do with it.

546
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,000
 So she dried her washing with it.

547
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,800
 That's great.

548
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,800
 Did you guys know that internet on the moon now is faster than in most parts of rural Britain?

549
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,320
 What, had you get into, like, the...

550
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,440
 They called it broadband.

551
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,480
 That's how it was released.

552
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,480
 Wow, I didn't hold your phone up and try to speak to Siri through your helmet.

553
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,280
 Yeah.

554
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,560
 It'll be very hard to tap your phone properly with those gloves.

555
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:37,200
 Okay, it's time for the final facts of this episode.

556
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,320
 And we head over to Andrew Hunter Murray.

557
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,040
 My fact is, did you know that Ken is officially an accessory to Barbie?

558
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,160
 Brilliant.

559
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,360
 I really like that.

560
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,200
 He says she's not a feminist icon.

561
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,000
 Yeah.

562
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,360
 Yeah, this is very weird.

563
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,080
 Okay, so the Barbie and Ken, original, the original Barbie and Ken, Ken was named after the son

564
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,680
 of the Inventors of Barbie.

565
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,080
 But Barbie was named after their daughter, Barbara.

566
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,560
 Oh, yes.

567
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,680
 She's quite peculiar, a sort of brother sister thing.

568
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,240
 And Ruth, the wife of the couple who invented Barbie and Ken,

569
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
 argued for a bulge in his groin.

570
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,240
 But the design team refused to put one in.

571
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,200
 Yeah, he's famously bereft underneath those trousers, isn't it?

572
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,080
 Yeah.

573
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,960
 There is a trailer trash doll you can buy in America.

574
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,200
 It's called Turleine.

575
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,480
 It's a pregnant doll from 2005.

576
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,560
 And she's one of these talking dolls.

577
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,080
 And her catchphrases include,

578
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,000
 if the trailers are rockin, don't come a knockin.

579
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,440
 And pour me a double and drink him for two.

580
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,240
 What?

581
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,480
 Does she ever give birth?

582
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
 In some kind of traumatic night?

583
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,440
 Can you imagine that doll, the giving birth doll?

584
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,640
 They've got to make it.

585
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,880
 Well, they were used for good dolls during brown versus the Board of Education.

586
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,680
 When civil rights legislation was overturned in 1954,

587
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,240
 it was one of the first cases where a Supreme Court cited a social study

588
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,640
 in its reasons for making a certain decision.

589
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,640
 So this was when America agreed the segregation was a negative thing

590
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,120
 and had a negative effect on the people who were subject to it.

591
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,800
 And what they did was, in the experiment,

592
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,520
 they brought black and white dolls to schools that were segregated.

593
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,400
 So black schools.

594
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,280
 And they'd show the kids a black doll and a white doll and get them to say,

595
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,960
 "Which one do you think is a good doll, which is a bad doll?"

596
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,480
 And all the kids would go, "Oh, the white one's a good doll.

597
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,520
 I want to play with the white one."

598
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
 Because that's what they've brought up to think.

599
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,720
 And then they'd ask them, "Okay, in which doll do you think is more like you?"

600
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,960
 And almost all the kids got really, really upset.

601
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,640
 Meet them like cried or ran out of the room.

602
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,960
 Because suddenly they were identifying themselves with a doll.

603
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
 They just said was the bad doll.

604
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,400
 And that was cited by the Supreme Court when brown versus the Board of Education

605
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,520
 came to its conclusion.

606
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,960
 Oh, that is really interesting.

607
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

608
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,640
 Here's another good use for a doll, which is, it's a nice use,

609
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,360
 but perhaps not as worthy as your use.

610
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,840
 There was a Chinese guy whose wife had died.

611
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,880
 And he became rather attached to his blow-up doll.

612
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,440
 And everyone started taking the Mickey out of him a little bit.

613
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,640
 And he got very upset.

614
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,400
 And so he decided to end it all.

615
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,760
 And eyewitnesses at the scene were horrified to see him plummet from the building,

616
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
 holding what they thought was a child.

617
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,840
 But it was actually his blow-up doll.

618
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,920
 And he very romantically jumped off the building with his blow-up doll,

619
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,040
 landed on the doll, the doll exploded, and he survived.

620
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,720
 Oh, wow!

621
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,680
 He murdered him up.

622
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,280
 She gave her life for him.

623
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,720
 Exactly, it's romantic.

624
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,760
 That's very romantic.

625
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,200
 That must have been a horrific moment.

626
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,840
 They went and saw this, what they thought was a child explode.

627
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,760
 You can get.

628
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,040
 This is slightly controversial.

629
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,160
 Dope on a rope.

630
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,240
 Dope on a rope was Saddam Hussein with a noose around his neck,

631
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,000
 which was commemorating his death.

632
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,560
 It's from a website called Hero Builders.

633
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,360
 And they've got over 100 satirical figures that you can get,

634
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,320
 including Tony Blair as an action man.

635
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,080
 You can get George Bush as a superhero.

636
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,240
 Michael Jackson holding a baby over.

637
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,760
 Well, that would be...

638
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,840
 Gordon Brown comes with his own part of Lou.

639
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,680
 That would be the same company, probably, which in 2002,

640
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,640
 were Simon Bin Laden dolls dramatically outsold Tony Blair dolls.

641
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:02,960
 Really?

642
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,480
 I think it was a bit of an embarrassment, yeah.

643
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:04,960
 Really?

644
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,600
 Yeah.

645
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,560
 Well, that was not the only firm to make Simon Bin Laden dolls,

646
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,760
 because in 2005, the CIA made a custom-made Bin Laden action figure,

647
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,600
 which they were thinking about distributing to children in the Middle East,

648
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,040
 and the face would peel off and reveal a much scarier red face with demonic eyes, and, you know...

649
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,600
 Oh, wow!

650
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,040
 So would usage of the toy suddenly Satan would appear?

651
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,760
 Yeah, exactly.

652
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:27,760
 Exactly.

653
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,240
 The healing wow.

654
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,880
 Yeah, okay.

655
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,200
 So that would apparently put children off.

656
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
 That would apparently make children support the war on Terremble.

657
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,600
 It would put them off dolls.

658
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,640
 It would put them off dolls, yeah.

659
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
 Now, kids love that kind of thing, don't they?

660
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,280
 Yeah, that's true.

661
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,720
 It's like a one-way rubbish transformer, that doll.

662
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,520
 Also, if you didn't explain the toy was going to do that,

663
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,800
 potentially that was the most costly thing that they've ever done in the CIA,

664
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,600
 with all the recalls of people sending in the toy back going.

665
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,640
 If you realize there was a demon face underneath this, do you see that?

666
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,600
 Yeah, I'm a packet.

667
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,040
 I thought I was as vicious when the CIA was sending dolls.

668
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:05,760
 Hey, by the way, just with the idea of a Sama being turned into a doll,

669
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,240
 when I read that story, it made me think about sort of villain merchandise,

670
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,760
 or dictator merchandise.

671
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,280
 Because they always, I just suddenly remembered that people like Saddam Hussein used to publish novels.

672
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,240
 Oh, he did, yeah.

673
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,680
 Yeah, he had four novels.

674
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,200
 And two of the novels actually were published in Japan and sold in shops.

675
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,800
 And a surprising number of people wrote like Gaddafi wrote a novel.

676
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
 What was the collection of short stories?

677
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,240
 And it was called Escape to Hell.

678
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,160
 And so did Kim Il Sung.

679
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,640
 The Turkmen dictator, Sapa Murat Niyazov, wrote a book of his spiritual thoughts,

680
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,680
 which became required reading if you wanted to pass your driving test.

681
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,160
 Oh, that's good.

682
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,800
 Completely, completely barking, man.

683
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
 There seems to be a genre of dictator lips.

684
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,160
 I think she called it "dicklet."

685
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,400
 Yeah.

686
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,600
 So I was, yeah, I was trying to find "dicklet" on online.

687
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,400
 You came up with some terrible Google results.

688
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,720
 Yeah, it's got about a hundred million blue rays of it now.

689
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,120
 But if you go to, if you go to Goodreads,

690
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,600
 one thing that Goodreads has, so while Twitter has followers and Facebook has likes,

691
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,320
 Goodreads has fans.

692
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,160
 You've become a fan of an author.

693
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,280
 Oh, no.

694
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,080
 So Kim Il Sung has one fan.

695
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,240
 Mousetong has 40 fans.

696
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,160
 Mussolini has 20 fans.

697
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,920
 Gaddafi has 34 fans.

698
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,800
 And Hitler?

699
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,280
 Well.

700
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,960
 390 fans.

701
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,680
 Oh, right.

702
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,240
 Yeah.

703
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,200
 Loving his book work.

704
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,680
 Mine Camp, obviously, very popular.

705
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,200
 And it's sequel.

706
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,000
 How does sequel?

707
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,120
 Mine Camp had a sequel?

708
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,240
 sequel to mine Camp in 1935 called "White Book," which literally means second book.

709
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,160
 I guess you'd run out of imagination by that.

710
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,440
 Maybe the editors said,

711
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,320
 "I think we should remove that difficult from the title at all."

712
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:54,720
 Okay, so that's it.

713
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,760
 That's another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish Done."

714
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,360
 Cracking start to the new series.

715
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,400
 And if you want to get in touch with any of us about the things that we've said,

716
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
 you can get us on our Twitter handles.

717
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,600
 I'm on @tribaland, James, @egshaped, Andy, @andruhunterm,

718
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,560
 and Anna.

719
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,280
 You can get me on @clikipedia, the QI interviews piece.

720
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,440
 Yep, but if you want to get Anna on Twitter,

721
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,440
 generally #getAnna on Twitter.

722
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,720
 But also, if you head over to qi.com/podcast,

723
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,280
 we've got our pages up there with all the previous episodes,

724
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,440
 including stuff that will be specifically

725
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,000
 to do with this week's episode, video links,

726
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
 general links to other websites,

727
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,400
 anything that we can think of that kind of is relevant to the episode.

728
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,440
 That'll all be on there.

729
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,040
 You can explore the rest of the episodes,

730
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,560
 and also you'll see a button that can show you a way to visitingland.com

731
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,560
 where we've made an entire World Cup podcast called "International Factful."

732
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,720
 And, uh, yeah, we're going to be back again next week

733
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,640
 with more "No Such Thing as a Fish."

734
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,080
 We'll see you then. Good bye.
