00:00:00,00:00:04,Hi everyone and welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish
00:00:04,00:00:10,Which is one of my favorite episodes that we did in the Soho theater in our summer run
00:00:10,00:00:16,"No offense to our other guests who are all amazing as well, but I really really love this episode with Hannah Fry"
00:00:16,00:00:22,Now you'll probably remember Hannah. She was on no such thing as a fish earlier this year. She's a mathematician
00:00:22,00:00:29,She's written a load of books that are definitely worth getting if you're even slightly into in fact whether you're interested in maths or not
00:00:29,00:00:33,"She makes a subject come alive, but the very important thing"
00:00:33,00:00:37,I also have to tell you is that Hannah has a new podcast. It's called
00:00:37,00:00:42,Uncharted and would you believe it it is a podcast about graphs?
00:00:42,00:00:48,You know those famously visual things in a very unvisual medium
00:00:48,00:00:53,"But like everything that Hannah is involved in of course, it's absolutely brilliant"
00:00:53,00:01:00,It's not just her reading out numbers or saying upbeat line downing line curly line all that kind of stuff
00:01:00,00:01:06,It's actually stories about human behavior. It's about discovery. It's just an absolutely brilliant podcast
00:01:06,00:01:13,I very very highly recommend you tune into that like I say called Uncharted and it's wherever you get your podcast
00:01:13,00:01:20,"Anyway, very much. Hope you enjoy the show as much as we enjoyed making it all there is to say is on with the podcast"
00:01:20,00:01:22,Oh
00:01:22,00:01:42,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Soho theater
00:01:47,00:01:54,My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin Andrew Hunter Murray and Hannah Frye and once again
00:01:54,00:02:00,We have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here
00:02:00,00:02:04,We go starting with fact number one and that is Andy
00:02:04,00:02:11,My fact is that if this conversation had one extra person it would be substantially less funny. Oh
00:02:11,00:02:16,Which extra person are you thinking of?
00:02:16,00:02:23,"Well this no anyone that's a thing. Yeah, so really any any extra person even if it was"
00:02:23,00:02:25,Alan Carr
00:02:25,00:02:31,Like even someone as funny even Alan Carr right wouldn't make this conversation
00:02:31,00:02:36,"The original chatty man. Yeah, that's interesting. You said just think just think of someone's funny"
00:02:36,00:02:39,"And he would say hit there. He was a funny guy. He's funny guy. Well, he wouldn't be if he was here"
00:02:39,00:02:47,So that's or he would but we wouldn't basically this is a this is a theory about the maximum number of people who can have a good conversation
00:02:47,00:02:51,So it's about it's a it's about when you're out or you're so you're with friends or family or whoever
00:02:51,00:02:57,And it's a theory by Robin Dunbar. Who's an anthropologist and he's an evolutionary psychologist
00:02:57,00:03:00,He's best known for the idea of Dunbar's number
00:03:00,00:03:03,Which is that most people have a social circle of about 150 people
00:03:04,00:03:09,And he has been working on this idea and he says if the if five people are in a conversation
00:03:09,00:03:14,"Or if there are four people at a fifth joins the amount of laughter drops dramatically, right? Wow"
00:03:14,00:03:18,"And obviously this is a slightly artificial. Well, it's very quiet when no one laughs"
00:03:18,00:03:23,But basically it's if what if there's what if there's 200 people
00:03:23,00:03:29,"Yeah, if a fifth person joins a group either it becomes two conversations almost immediately"
00:03:29,00:03:33,"Yeah, you get this one person starts monologuing bit like now and"
00:03:33,00:03:36,And that that also doesn't lead to love it
00:03:36,00:03:39,It's really interesting because he said that like four is the right number
00:03:39,00:03:42,"But if you have a dinner party, then it's kind of okay to have eight people"
00:03:42,00:03:48,You kind of want to stay in those four eight twelve and that made me think the last supper
00:03:48,00:03:50,13
00:03:50,00:03:55,Is that what was happening Judas was just sat there couldn't make any conversation. He's like fuck this. I'm going
00:03:55,00:04:00,"Oh, do you think he made it like a real killer joke and no one laughed. Oh, okay. Fuck this. I'm killing that guy"
00:04:01,00:04:06,"Does that mean so six is wrong, right? You don't you don't want six people. I guess I'm funny for six. That's good"
00:04:06,00:04:09,"I get yeah, yeah, how many are in Monty Python again? Oh"
00:04:09,00:04:14,"Yeah, true. Yeah, I just have strong opinions about Dunbar. Oh, okay"
00:04:14,00:04:22,"This maybe strong is too strongly stated, but I I I'm raising an internal eyebrow about this"
00:04:22,00:04:24,I think great make it an external eyebrow
00:04:24,00:04:30,"Wait, wait, tell us more about your internal eyebrows"
00:04:30,00:04:32,I
00:04:32,00:04:38,"Just outwardly I look calm inwardly. Yeah, I'm quizzical, but yeah, go okay the hundred and fifty number"
00:04:38,00:04:44,That he's famous for so the way that they got that was that they looked at the social groups of primates
00:04:44,00:04:49,And then they looked at the size of brains measure the size of brains of the average human and the size of brains of primates
00:04:49,00:04:53,And then they just had loads of dots on a graph and they just drew a line through and were like hundred and fifty
00:04:53,00:04:55,Which is I would say not how you do science
00:04:59,00:05:03,"So is he but is he respected in the field or is he someone that's sort of it's like, okay"
00:05:03,00:05:08,You've called it a bit too early here. So I don't know that much about this four four five laughter thing
00:05:08,00:05:11,"Yeah, tell me more about their research methods. Oh, wow, that was so"
00:05:11,00:05:15,"That was incredible. Oh god, I"
00:05:15,00:05:21,Think it was I think they were observing people in the fields. They would observe groups of conversations happening
00:05:21,00:05:26,"Yeah, I can't remember if they recruited them or if they know they did it just they they had like a party happening"
00:05:26,00:05:28,They would kind of just scientists with a
00:05:28,00:05:31,Maybe that's why people weren't laughing so some creepy
00:05:31,00:05:36,the other thing they did is that they looked at lots of movies and
00:05:36,00:05:41,Lots of different things to see when you've got a movie how many people are in those conversations
00:05:41,00:05:44,So they looked at sex in the city love actually pride and prejudice
00:05:44,00:05:49,League of their own which apparently is a movie. I thought there was a sports paddle show
00:05:49,00:05:54,They were talking about but apparently is a movie Tom Hanks. Gina Davis. Sure. Yeah
00:05:55,00:06:03,"Freddie, but they noticed that in those lots of people it was like just groups of four that were chatting all the time"
00:06:03,00:06:04,And they looked at Shakespeare as well
00:06:04,00:06:06,And they found that in Shakespeare
00:06:06,00:06:11,It was never usually more than four and one thing that they also found is if you're gossiping about someone
00:06:11,00:06:13,Then actually it's better to be in a group of three
00:06:13,00:06:17,And the reason being that you only have the brain space to be in a group of four people
00:06:17,00:06:20,But if you're gossiping then that person is the fourth person
00:06:23,00:06:29,"Again, that's what the study says whether that's true and I like that and the idea was that if you so all the four of us"
00:06:29,00:06:33,We're talking and we're also trying to imagine what the other three are hearing
00:06:33,00:06:37,But we're also if we're listening we're also trying to understand what the other person's saying
00:06:37,00:06:40,"Yeah, and it's harder to do that with five people than with four"
00:06:40,00:06:46,"Yeah, so for instance if you had the sentence James knew that Andy thought that Dan wanted ice cream"
00:06:46,00:06:50,That's kind of a sentence as relatively easy to understand. Yeah
00:06:51,00:06:57,If you were to say that Hannah believed that James knew that Andy thought that Dan wanted ice cream
00:06:57,00:07:01,It suddenly becomes way more difficult to understand. Oh my god. Do you think you did though?
00:07:01,00:07:07,"I could just ask that without I didn't understand that. Yeah, I didn't understand that at all. Any of it? No"
00:07:07,00:07:13,And the other thing I suggested was that and I think this is where the research may be a bit stretched
00:07:13,00:07:19,Is that SAS patrols and surgical teams do best when there are four members of the team because that makes the communications easier
00:07:19,00:07:21,Although that's separate to the laughter thing as in
00:07:22,00:07:26,I don't know the SAS patrols laugh a lot. That would be me as an SAS guy
00:07:26,00:07:32,Heading into a building full of terrorists. Do you know what? There's actually four of you already. So I'm just gonna sit this one out guys
00:07:32,00:07:36,It'll go better trust me. I was reading a bit about conversations generally
00:07:36,00:07:39,"Oh, yeah, and there's this amazing book watching the English by Kate Fox"
00:07:39,00:07:44,"Oh, yeah, she sort of walked around all of the UK just ease dropping in on conversations"
00:07:44,00:07:50,And one of the bits of research that she discovered was that 94% of British respondents admit to having conversed about the weather
00:07:50,00:07:52,In the past six hours
00:07:52,00:07:59,"Well, 38% said that they've had talked about it in the past 60 minutes"
00:07:59,00:08:05,So she worked out that that means that almost any moment in this country at least a third of the population is either
00:08:05,00:08:10,Talking about the weather or has already done so and or is about to
00:08:10,00:08:16,I know you mean but it depends when she did her study because if it was just after it snowed for instance
00:08:16,00:08:19,"And everyone's gonna be talking about the weather. Yeah, if it's in the middle of the night"
00:08:19,00:08:21,I know there's weather in the night
00:08:21,00:08:25,But there is there is there is less. I think I'd say that yeah
00:08:25,00:08:29,But she she makes that point that in places like Finland
00:08:29,00:08:35,They just never talk about the weather if it's wintertime and you're snowed in so much that tunnels are actually dug to get you to the shops
00:08:35,00:08:40,What you actually do is just sit with someone just in silence because you're like we don't need to talk about the weather
00:08:40,00:08:42,We know what the fucking weather is like it's
00:08:42,00:08:46,"Yeah, the rules according to Kate Fox there are rules about talking about the weather"
00:08:46,00:08:52,The first rule is you always have to introduce the topic as a question like raining again
00:08:52,00:08:57,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a very Aussie way of talking as well"
00:08:57,00:09:03,It is yeah like inflection just kind of gives you an opportunity for it to either be a question or a statement and the respondent
00:09:03,00:09:06,Can decide what it was?
00:09:06,00:09:12,"Cricket again for instance. Yeah, but the other thing is that when people say that to you"
00:09:12,00:09:14,You're not supposed to ever disagree
00:09:14,00:09:19,"So if someone ever does a question about the weather to you, you should know it's really rude to say no, it's not raining"
00:09:19,00:09:25,I do that all the time. I do that. I do that all the time. It's drizzling or
00:09:25,00:09:30,"It's spitting. Yeah, it's not raining. I do that constantly"
00:09:30,00:09:33,That's so weird because you are the most English person I know as well
00:09:33,00:09:39,"Well, I have a strict categorization system in my head, but also I pride myself on not you know not giving up in the face of rain"
00:09:39,00:09:40,So I will say
00:09:40,00:09:44,"Sort of yeah, there was one really amazing study with a you know"
00:09:44,00:09:46,If you're looking at the the weather forecast and it says oh tomorrow
00:09:46,00:09:50,There's a 40% chance of rain they went and actually asked people what they thought that that meant
00:09:50,00:09:53,"Oh, yeah, and actually like so for me it seems like okay"
00:09:53,00:09:57,"Well, you know you really replay the day ten times and four times it will rain and six times it won't run"
00:09:57,00:09:59,That's because it sort of seems quite obvious
00:09:59,00:10:02,"But when they did this survey loads of people were like, okay"
00:10:02,00:10:08,"It means that 40% of the land is that's a you know, so if it's like London 40% of London will be covered in"
00:10:09,00:10:15,As an alternative but then the most common response was that like it would be 40% rain
00:10:15,00:10:18,So is in like if a hundred was maximum rain
00:10:18,00:10:22,I feel like it's more like 25% rain
00:10:22,00:10:31,"That's amazing and there is this thing about when conversations end and whether you want them to or not no, yeah"
00:10:31,00:10:34,so there's a
00:10:34,00:10:36,Psychologist I think he's a researcher called Adam Mastroianni
00:10:36,00:10:41,And he was at a black-tide party and he looked around the room and he thought I wonder how many of these people are
00:10:41,00:10:44,In conversations. They just don't want to be in any more
00:10:44,00:10:49,"Because it's hard to judge isn't it the end of a conversation, you know, you'll have a conversation one person will try to disengage"
00:10:49,00:10:51,You're still talking and the yeah
00:10:51,00:10:54,God it's happening
00:10:54,00:10:58,And they said so he and his colleagues they surveyed hundreds of people they put them on a room with each other
00:10:58,00:11:03,They got to talk and said when the conversation ends you can leave
00:11:03,00:11:06,"Yeah, but they didn't say I don't think they said this is when the conversation will end"
00:11:06,00:11:12,"Yeah, the conversation lengths weren't 50% longer than most people wanted them to be in general"
00:11:12,00:11:18,"Okay, and although 10% of people ended the conversations even though they wanted to keep talking, but they were worried about being boring"
00:11:18,00:11:25,Everyone was having a nice time and they just thought I better so basically 98% of people don't think the conversations are the right length
00:11:25,00:11:27,Okay
00:11:29,00:11:35,Does that mean if I'm chatting to someone in a party I should stop early or I should carry on going
00:11:35,00:11:40,Depends what they're doing
00:11:40,00:11:42,Signals out there
00:11:42,00:11:48,They're looking at you. Are they sitting down? Are they slowly backing away?
00:11:48,00:11:53,"Yawning yeah, and do you hear Hannah you've written books and"
00:11:53,00:11:59,You've you've written about famous characters from history who we do know some of the voices of and some of that
00:11:59,00:12:03,We don't say like I don't know an old scientist like Robert Boyle or something like that
00:12:03,00:12:09,Do you hear their voices in your head when you're writing the dialogue you're copying out on the book?
00:12:09,00:12:14,"Not for Boyle, but there is one person. Oh, I do do this for"
00:12:14,00:12:19,Appropriate but I'm gonna do it anyway
00:12:19,00:12:24,"It's that guy called Francis Galton. Oh, yeah, Galton. Yeah, yeah, Francis Galton. He"
00:12:25,00:12:32,"Was like, I mean an amazing statistician like loads of the work that we use now says comes from his thing regression to the mean"
00:12:32,00:12:35,That was his idea loads of stuff about population stuff
00:12:35,00:12:42,And the thing is that Francis Galton was so intent on collecting statistics about the human body and about humans because he was a
00:12:42,00:12:48,"Massive eugenicist. Yes. Yeah, and like total white supremacist like really just a not nice guy"
00:12:48,00:12:51,The thing about him though is that he was from Birmingham
00:12:54,00:12:59,"You have to imagine yeah, yeah, he's talking about white supremacy in a Bramley accent"
00:12:59,00:13:08,We've mentioned him a few times so one of the eugenicist things he did was he did a beauty map of Britain
00:13:08,00:13:12,Didn't he where he went round sort of with a little clicker going? Oh hot hot hot
00:13:12,00:13:16,"She's really nice. Yeah. Yeah, she's really fit"
00:13:20,00:13:25,The word he has though for like ugly is horrible. I can't remember these it's like repugnant
00:13:25,00:13:33,And he had a hat that he designed that had a flap on it because he thought he was so clever
00:13:33,00:13:40,"His head was overheating. So he was like better. Let's American. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, interesting guy"
00:13:40,00:13:44,"You haven't persuaded me about Dunbar's number, by the way, you know the hundred and fifty one neither of them"
00:13:44,00:13:49,"I'm not even the four. No, but aren't you enjoying so it means you're not joining this conversation, baby"
00:13:49,00:13:52,You you really wish Alan car was here to learn things a bit
00:13:52,00:13:55,"Well, you know, I think there's room for a fifth person"
00:13:55,00:14:01,There are some really nice things about friendships though about connections. So especially when you look at the network that's created
00:14:01,00:14:04,So there was like a lot of work in this in the in the 90s
00:14:04,00:14:10,Something called the friendship paradox especially and it really came into being when social networks came back
00:14:10,00:14:16,You can actually test this out empirically. So the friendship paradox basically says that your friends are more popular than you
00:14:17,00:14:19,"Okay, and that maybe"
00:14:19,00:14:25,But this actually this works for everyone
00:14:25,00:14:32,"98% of people is that their friends are more popular than them. So yeah, how is how is that possible?"
00:14:32,00:14:37,"Yes, so it's possible in the same way that almost everybody on earth has an above average number of arms"
00:14:37,00:14:44,"Yes, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right. So not like not by much not by much exactly not by much"
00:14:44,00:14:51,"But the thing about so if you look at like Twitter networks, for example, you get some people who have like a hundred million followers, right?"
00:14:51,00:14:58,"Whereas the vast majority of us have like, you know, very few and so when you kind of look at the mean like the average number of friends across"
00:14:58,00:15:03,Everybody almost everyone is below that threshold because there are some people who really draw the numbers
00:15:03,00:15:08,But there's some really interesting things that happen when you look at how this plays out kind of in person
00:15:08,00:15:12,So not on a social network and there's a brilliant story about this company in Hungary
00:15:13,00:15:15,And this company were having all of these problems
00:15:15,00:15:20,They had these three different offices and they were having to downsize they were like gonna make loads of people redundant
00:15:20,00:15:25,So all these like horrible rumors flying around like vicious stuff about how many people gonna lose their jobs
00:15:25,00:15:33,And so the company decided to try and map out the friendship networks inside the company to see what was going on with these rumors
00:15:33,00:15:35,So they asked everybody
00:15:35,00:15:40,"Oh, give me the name of one person who you go to but if you want advice or information giving them one person"
00:15:40,00:15:44,"Yeah, and then they're like map the network. And so in the same ways with social networks"
00:15:44,00:15:52,"There was like most people had hardly any friends, right? Like one or two, but there was one person who had like a huge number of connections"
00:15:52,00:15:57,And it turned out this person was the safety officer for the company
00:15:57,00:16:02,He's got to be the CEO surely the directors and managers. No one cared what they had to say basically
00:16:02,00:16:06,But this safety officer so he was like going around to all of these different places
00:16:07,00:16:12,Training people on you know the rules and just bringing all the juicy gossip with him as he went
00:16:12,00:16:19,So do they sack him so that was the option right you can get rid of him and then cure the problem
00:16:19,00:16:22,"Also, no more safety in the company"
00:16:22,00:16:30,What they actually did which I think is much more clever is they gave him a pay rise and then used him to spread out the secrets that they wanted
00:16:33,00:16:39,"That's a star's way of doing it, isn't it? Oh my god, we need to move on by the way to our next factor"
00:16:39,00:16:42,"Okay, just a quick thing on going back to conversations"
00:16:42,00:16:42,Yep
00:16:42,00:16:47,So there was some research done at the University of Rocklav in Poland
00:16:47,00:16:52,And they looked at loads of different people from different countries and they saw them in conversation
00:16:52,00:16:56,And they worked out the distance where people felt they were comfortable talking to someone
00:16:56,00:17:02,"So how far away you are from someone when you're talking yeah, they found that in the UK at the preferred"
00:17:02,00:17:09,Distance if you're talking to a stranger is 99 centimeters which is about the wingspan of a tourney owl
00:17:09,00:17:16,"I was I was struggling to envisage 99 centimeters, but now you put it in owl terminology"
00:17:16,00:17:24,"Yeah, if you if you're from Argentina or Norway, they're the closest they like to hang out more close to each other when they're talking"
00:17:24,00:17:29,"Okay, they like to be about 40 centimeters between them. That's the wingspan of an arctic turn"
00:17:31,00:17:36,"And if you're in Romania, yeah, then they're the furthest away if you're speaking to someone in Romania"
00:17:36,00:17:41,They want to be 140 centimeters between you and that's the same as a wingspan of a great skewer
00:17:41,00:17:50,It's just it's just facts. It's just like if you want to know the skewer the bird not the skewer there
00:17:50,00:17:53,Because that would be a great skewer
00:17:53,00:17:56,Imagine the kebab you can fit on that
00:17:58,00:18:04,"Okay, what can I very quickly tell you one last thing one last thing we can start it and I'll let you know when I wanted to"
00:18:04,00:18:13,Very recent this thing happened last year or so there was a guy on reddit who was you know
00:18:13,00:18:15,I'm ready you write to each other and you answer each other's questions
00:18:15,00:18:19,And it's like it's a very community-based and he was having a really hard time interacting with people
00:18:19,00:18:24,He spent about a year writing responses to other people's messages and he got nothing back
00:18:24,00:18:27,You know you get you get sort of points and scores and things like that
00:18:27,00:18:29,You got absolutely nothing back anyway
00:18:29,00:18:35,It turned out he discovered after a year that he had mistakenly been blocked and nobody else on reddit could see anything
00:18:35,00:18:38,He had written for a year
00:18:38,00:18:43,And he'd been answering incredibly specific questions. He answered someone's cry for help and
00:18:43,00:18:47,"And he got absolutely no responses to it. He thought wow, okay"
00:18:47,00:18:50,I was like that thing with the the Horniman Museum in South London
00:18:50,00:18:53,They weren't getting emails for ages
00:18:53,00:18:57,They had no idea why and it turned out that a new system had put on their computer system
00:18:57,00:19:00,And it was to filter out any rude words and the
00:19:00,00:19:08,Mistakened it for Horniman when that's not coming through
00:19:08,00:19:20,"We need to move on to fact number two and that is Hannah. Oh, that's me. Okay fake diamond rings are better than real ones"
00:19:20,00:19:27,"Fact well my wife is in tonight and there's something fake diamond rings. Yeah, I think they're better"
00:19:27,00:19:31,"I think they're better. Oh, I think they're better. No, sorry dangerous subject"
00:19:31,00:19:40,"Something to say about this objectively okay, so here's the thing right you want diamonds, right? Why do people like diamonds?"
00:19:40,00:19:46,They're sparkly sure they're rare sure they're expensive. They've got great thermal conductivity
00:19:46,00:19:48,And
00:19:48,00:19:55,That last one I accept they do have the highest level of productivity that I agree and the thing is on every metric
00:19:55,00:19:59,"There's something else that does better, right? So sparkliness. There's another sort of"
00:19:59,00:20:08,"Substitute diamond called mossomite, right much sparklier interesting. Okay, you get like a greater display of the spectral colors and"
00:20:08,00:20:14,"Expensive right there is other things that are more expensive. Also, they artificially inflate the prices bit kind"
00:20:14,00:20:16,be
00:20:16,00:20:21,"Exactly and then sort of big you can grow grow them in the lab that makes better, right?"
00:20:21,00:20:23,"You know big ones, but the thing is right"
00:20:23,00:20:30,So the real reason why I think that the other ones the fake ones are better is because there's this sort of diamond substitute called
00:20:30,00:20:36,Zircon right and there's like a lab-grown version of it called cubic zircona that you get in like Elizabeth Duke
00:20:36,00:20:43,"And the thing about Zircon, that's so that's a shop. Oh, yeah, it's sorry. That's a do you not buy your jewelry in Argos?"
00:20:44,00:20:46,I
00:20:46,00:20:52,Probably wondering why I brought you here today. Well great news open the catalogue
00:20:52,00:20:55,"No, a cheaper page, please"
00:20:55,00:21:03,"Elizabeth Duke, sorry. Okay. All right, so I want you to imagine a sort of 1999 Elizabeth Duke ring"
00:21:03,00:21:05,"Okay, this is I think this I think is better"
00:21:05,00:21:08,So Zircon
00:21:08,00:21:14,It is naturally occurring and the way that it naturally occurs is when it forms it makes like this jail
00:21:14,00:21:20,So this the crystal structure is like they're almost perfect cubes with a sort of stretched in one direction
00:21:20,00:21:25,"All right, and they're formed in such a way that they can trap atoms of uranium inside them"
00:21:25,00:21:31,"Okay, like literally uranium inside a jail and the thing about uranium is that it decays okay decays interled"
00:21:31,00:21:33,But it does it at a very
00:21:34,00:21:41,Predictable rate so if you find a lump of Zircon in the ground and you open up and you count you see that there's a certain number of
00:21:41,00:21:45,Uranium and certain number of lead inside you know how old that zircon is right cool
00:21:45,00:21:49,So there was some zircon that was created at the beginning of the earth
00:21:49,00:21:58,right 4.4 billion years ago and that is how we know how old the earth is because they found this really really old zircon in
00:21:58,00:22:05,These hills in Australia and then went through counted up how many lead atoms there were how many uranium and that's how we know
00:22:05,00:22:10,How old the earth is and that I think is much better than a sparkly rock. Can you get that one in August?
00:22:10,00:22:15,So I think you can get them in some joy shots like the they both contain zirconium
00:22:15,00:22:21,"Cubic zircon and zircon, but the other thing is like the gold band so you can't make gold on earth"
00:22:21,00:22:24,There's no way to like make gold. We just have what we have
00:22:24,00:22:28,We just have what we have it was forged in stars when they were colliding together
00:22:28,00:22:34,So I just I love the idea that you go in that nineteen ninety nine ring. It's like and that's where your engagement ring
00:22:34,00:22:36,Came in at 20 quid
00:22:36,00:22:37,"No, you're right"
00:22:37,00:22:43,You've got you've got a ring that is the birth of the solar system and so the the origins of earth which is extraordinary
00:22:43,00:22:45,When did diamonds come about then later?
00:22:52,00:22:59,Zircon's us zircon is that so hang on zircon is the mineral right and the metal is zirconium and
00:22:59,00:23:06,Zirconium is not well known and it's used in the nuclear industry and for a few other things and braces for your teeth and tennis rackets
00:23:06,00:23:10,"Interestingly, some tennis rackets have a bit anyway"
00:23:10,00:23:16,But zircon's almost they're indestructible aren't they and that's why yeah finding these incredibly ancient ones
00:23:16,00:23:22,So they can be washed down a whole river and they won't chip and they can be heated to sixteen hundred degrees Celsius and
00:23:22,00:23:26,Nothing happens to them and so that's why they're the sort of pieces of evidence for
00:23:26,00:23:33,4.4 billion years ago. It's just we know they still exist in exactly the same form. That is don't really change
00:23:33,00:23:39,"Yeah, there are some diamonds like so most diamonds are made in the earth in the middle of the earth right in these things called"
00:23:39,00:23:42,Kimberlite pipes due to the pressure of the earth and they're created
00:23:42,00:23:48,But there are some diamonds like the largest one ever found which is called Sergio. I was found
00:23:48,00:23:50,Sorry
00:23:50,00:23:59,Named after a guy called Sergio boge's the Cavalio found it
00:23:59,00:24:03,It's basically not like the diamonds you have like on your rings and stuff like that
00:24:03,00:24:05,It's what's called a carbonado
00:24:05,00:24:13,But it is a diamond and we're not sure how it came about you find them in only two places really on earth in Brazil and the Central African Republic
00:24:13,00:24:19,Weird they're not near each other. The thing is they used to be near each other before all of the continents came about
00:24:19,00:24:24,So we think they might have landed on earth in this area before the continents split
00:24:24,00:24:28,"And if that is true, then they might have been made in supernovas"
00:24:28,00:24:34,"They're pretty cool, but they're not very shiny. You can use them in like drill bits and stuff like that"
00:24:34,00:24:36,But you can't really put them on two rings
00:24:36,00:24:42,"A lot a lot of diamond is used for drill parts, right? Oh, yeah, most of it is found in construction sites"
00:24:43,00:24:45,"Conductivity, yeah, is that what it is?"
00:24:45,00:24:48,"Well partly yeah, because you want to like wick away the heat if you're drilling"
00:24:48,00:24:54,"So it so it gets hot as you're drilling and then it's yeah, but it like conducts it away and it conducts it away"
00:24:54,00:25:01,"Wow, because Robert Boyle we mentioned him before didn't he do a thing where he used to he attempted to basically turn diamonds into hot water bottles"
00:25:01,00:25:06,At least that was one experiment that he don't raise your internal eyebrows at me
00:25:07,00:25:12,Would they not be not be more like cold water bottles if they're conducting
00:25:12,00:25:18,"So, yeah, maybe it's a cold water bottle because he was trying to okay excellently raised eyebrows"
00:25:18,00:25:24,He tried to yeah cool down a warm bit of his body and bed at night. He thought that that would be a way of
00:25:24,00:25:32,"Expensive way to do it. Yeah, it is yeah, you can get a cheaper hot water bottle or a cold water bottle at Argos"
00:25:32,00:25:33,I suppose
00:25:33,00:25:35,So this is just this is not a funny thing at all
00:25:35,00:25:41,It's just I find it interesting is that the reason earth is able to support life is partly because of plate tectonics
00:25:41,00:25:47,Which no other planet we've observed has right us because we haven't got very good details on many other planets partly
00:25:47,00:25:50,But basically earth has plates which move and they fracture and they collide
00:25:50,00:25:55,And it means that bits of the inside can get to the outside in the form of magma or whatever
00:25:55,00:25:59,It is and that means that you have oxygen forming or it means you have carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
00:25:59,00:26:03,"You know, it's it's the relationship that makes it all possible for"
00:26:03,00:26:06,Frost will be here thinking about that. Wow
00:26:06,00:26:15,"That is very cool. Yeah, have the three of you heard of little oozy virt the wrapper. Yeah, is it really a wrapper? Yeah"
00:26:15,00:26:22,"Oh, why is a musician? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so he has a diamond which supposedly is worth 24 million dollars"
00:26:22,00:26:27,"Oh, yeah, so worried about it being burgled from him that he had it implanted into his forehead"
00:26:27,00:26:35,"Yeah, and if you look at photos online, no, honestly, it's there is about little oozy virt is he thinks his brain is so big that this"
00:26:35,00:26:37,Just cools it down
00:26:37,00:26:44,"But he if you see a photo, it's quite it's quite large and it's quite embedded as well in in his forehead"
00:26:44,00:26:49,Come on. How I want to know the mechanics. I don't know because it was almost stolen from him at a gig
00:26:49,00:26:53,"Oh, really when he went crowdsurfing because he made it a massive target in the middle of his forehead"
00:26:54,00:26:57,But it's so just okay
00:26:57,00:27:03,"It's just a brief tangent about diamond theft because okay, right the biggest diamond ever found was called the Cullen and the two"
00:27:03,00:27:08,"Cullen and Sakurai was dug up in 1905 in South Africa, and it was given to the Royal family the British Royal when you say given"
00:27:08,00:27:10,We're talking about that
00:27:10,00:27:14,It ended up in the hands of the British Royal family
00:27:14,00:27:19,And it was huge right was 3000 carats is a bit
00:27:19,00:27:23,And it's it was so huge basically they had to find a way of getting it to the Royal family
00:27:23,00:27:25,So what they did was it could have just left it
00:27:25,00:27:29,They could have dismantled the monarchy. I know they didn't do any of these things
00:27:29,00:27:37,"Yeah, we could all be leaving a more sensible life now, but we are where we are so"
00:27:37,00:27:41,They got armed guards and they had a huge great escort for it for it
00:27:41,00:27:45,"And they they put it you know they put in a big old sealed casket. Yeah, the casket on a train to Cape Town"
00:27:45,00:27:52,Loaded onto a Royal Navy ship in a massive safe huge security everywhere ship sails back to the UK
00:27:53,00:27:59,That was a decoy and the real journey of the diamond was put in Princess Anne's head
00:27:59,00:28:18,The real the real thing is is amazing it was put in a normal box and just put by registered post
00:28:18,00:28:23,"No, yeah, really. I know it doesn't that say a lot about the postal system. Hmm"
00:28:23,00:28:29,They just sent a three put a three shilling stamp on this diamond and just put it in a box and posted it wow
00:28:29,00:28:34,"They always ask you if there's anything worth anything in there. Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah"
00:28:34,00:28:39,"Yeah, they fit isn't that an incredible decoy. That's really only your friend had done that then"
00:28:39,00:28:43,"Well, yeah, and they took it out of his head during the crowdsurf and he managed to recover it"
00:28:43,00:28:46,Imagine if if Charles had to have that put in his head
00:28:47,00:28:51,As part of the coronation would have livened up an otherwise dull ceremony. Yeah
00:28:51,00:29:03,Penny Mordant is using the sword
00:29:03,00:29:06,So gently in size
00:29:06,00:29:10,One way that you can make diamonds
00:29:11,00:29:19,These are nano diamonds and a guy called wu Zhong Zhou from St. Andrew's University has noticed that if you burn a candle
00:29:19,00:29:27,Then the carbon which is burning there makes these nano diamonds about 1.5 million of them every second
00:29:27,00:29:31,Right are made and obviously they're really really tiny. There's not what you could do about it
00:29:31,00:29:36,He wonders that maybe in the future we might be able to somehow get them to coalesce and make new diamonds whether we will or not
00:29:36,00:29:41,I don't know but I was reading about nano diamonds and there's an amazing thing that they've just done
00:29:41,00:29:48,They've made tiny thermometers using nano diamonds and they use quantum mechanics to be able to tell the temperature of something
00:29:48,00:29:52,And they managed to work out that nematode worm had a fever
00:29:52,00:29:55,Wow
00:29:55,00:30:01,He's one of these tiny diamonds isn't that amazing and then did they give it another tiny diamond as a hot water bottle?
00:30:03,00:30:08,Take the day off. It's incredible. It's like amazing the opposite though
00:30:08,00:30:12,"I think it was no was yeah, but it's around and maybe it was like it's around the boil time"
00:30:12,00:30:14,"Okay, where they were just obsessed with burning stuff, right?"
00:30:14,00:30:18,So I think this is like the whole kind of turning gold and you know all the alchemy stuff
00:30:18,00:30:23,And then they decided to burn a diamond right to see what what would happen?
00:30:23,00:30:28,And they successfully managed to make it disappear into thin air because basically it just went to carbon dioxide
00:30:29,00:30:35,"Nothing else. Ah, so I've kind of destroyed it, but I can't the idea that you would do that burn a diamond next to a tree"
00:30:35,00:30:40,The tree takes in all the carbon and then basically you've got yourself a diamond tree same carbon
00:30:40,00:30:43,"So, you know"
00:30:43,00:30:48,"Swallowing diamonds is that a thing well not well. Yes, is it to smuggle them?"
00:30:48,00:30:53,It's well that there are a few different reasons that people have swallowed them over the years basically
00:30:53,00:30:54,Sometimes it's to steal them
00:30:54,00:31:02,There was a rash of cases in the last few years of people just doing a quick switcheroo in a diamond shop and then swallowing the diamond and running away
00:31:02,00:31:06,"Oh, wow being caught and you know, and they very rarely get away with it basically"
00:31:06,00:31:10,But one thing happened to an American woman called Jenna Evans in 2019
00:31:10,00:31:14,She had just got engaged very exciting had a diamond ring very exciting
00:31:14,00:31:18,Then in her sleep she took the ring off and swallowed it
00:31:18,00:31:21,Because she was having a bad dream
00:31:21,00:31:26,About she said she was on a train and there were some bad guys on the train and she had to keep the ring safe
00:31:26,00:31:31,"Oh, no in her sleep. She took the ring off and swallowed it. Wow. And did they retrieve it? They retrieved it"
00:31:31,00:31:37,"Yeah, they they went to hospital. They x-rayed her. It's a very clear x-ray of a really nice looking diamond ring"
00:31:37,00:31:41,And they said it will be unwise to let this proceed and did she
00:31:41,00:31:47,"Excrete it. No, I think they went in and I did they think they went in and got it because they said it will be unwise"
00:31:47,00:31:50,To it would be unsafe to my damage the ring
00:31:50,00:31:52,Am I telling you?
00:31:52,00:32:10,"It is time for fact number three and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that in 16th century Italy"
00:32:10,00:32:16,Jewels often took place where the chosen weapon was very hard maths questions
00:32:16,00:32:23,"That is so good isn't that amazing? Yeah, and it's and it is totally true"
00:32:23,00:32:29,So this was quite often it was people who were university professors professional mathematicians
00:32:29,00:32:36,You might say wasn't much job security in those days. You kind of had to kind of you know get jobs where you could
00:32:36,00:32:38,"If you were in a job, you might not stay there for long"
00:32:38,00:32:44,So one way to get your name out there was to publicly challenge a more famous mathematician to a duel
00:32:45,00:32:49,And you would go to a church or to a town hall square or something like that
00:32:49,00:32:54,And you'd have like 30 mass problems and they'd have 30 mass problems and there might be a crowd
00:32:54,00:33:01,Maybe a lot of people there and then you just sit there like the countdown numbers around just
00:33:01,00:33:07,30 is such a big number. It's like an exam. They knew even bigger numbers than that
00:33:12,00:33:17,It sounds incredible it is incredible you couldn't you couldn't set something that you couldn't answer precisely
00:33:17,00:33:21,"Yeah, because you wouldn't know if they got it right or so they challenge you they say this can't be done"
00:33:21,00:33:25,And so quite often it would happen if a new person had worked out a new bit of maths
00:33:25,00:33:30,You would challenge someone knowing that there's no way they could work this out because you just worked it out yourself
00:33:30,00:33:33,And it would prove that you'd worked out and use bit of maths
00:33:33,00:33:38,But hang on so you're only allowed to challenge someone a question which you know the answer to yourself
00:33:38,00:33:43,"That means that when you turn up at the duel you've basically already won. No, because you've got their 30 questions"
00:33:43,00:33:45,So you say so you think you've sent it. Sorry
00:33:45,00:33:50,"Jewels those two yeah, I thought both you both of you were sitting the same exam paper and you"
00:33:50,00:33:57,"Okay, but also though, there's no algebra at this point. There's no sort of like nice neat equation"
00:33:57,00:34:04,"So these they're set in words. So like, you know, there's horrendous math problems, which is like Jim and Joe have three"
00:34:04,00:34:09,It's like it's like the worst version of that. It's like a train leaves Leo's station
00:34:09,00:34:15,"This side did they ever use examples where the answer unfortunately had to be like your mama is a you know, like"
00:34:15,00:34:21,The answer is my son is a dick
00:34:21,00:34:26,But you know that kind of thing if that if those existed then they haven't been kept in history
00:34:26,00:34:31,I'm sorry did they start with a few easy ones at the beginning just to get the crowd going like what is six times nine?
00:34:31,00:34:34,And then have to build up from there. You know what I bet they did
00:34:34,00:34:39,I don't know. How do you might know my vicious? I think that I went to town on each other
00:34:39,00:34:44,But there was it was it was cubics a lot like so as an equation where you have like a number cubed
00:34:44,00:34:49,"Which were really valuable because I mean, there's no calculators right at this point"
00:34:49,00:34:56,"And so if you wanted to calculate interest rates, then you need these the solutions to these equations"
00:34:56,00:35:03,But there was there was a few like very particularly famous characters. So there's a guy called Cardano who?
00:35:04,00:35:09,Had a like long-standing feud with another returning guy called Tartaglia
00:35:09,00:35:13,And Tartaglia got very annoyed with Cardano because he
00:35:13,00:35:18,Accused him of publishing an equation that Tartaglia had known the answer to
00:35:18,00:35:22,And so challenged him to a duel and I think Cardano refused didn't he well
00:35:22,00:35:28,I think Cardano he kind of refused but he had a second like one of his students and said well
00:35:28,00:35:32,One of my students could do it because Cardano was really famous at the time
00:35:32,00:35:37,He was a famous astrologer a bit later. He actually got put in prison for doing a horoscope of Jesus Christ
00:35:37,00:35:44,He was really really famous and he thought it wasn't really worth him. Sorry. I really reacted like that was a crazily
00:35:44,00:35:47,controversial thing to do now
00:35:47,00:35:53,"Okay, yeah in the time it was yeah pretty amazing the other thing as well as"
00:35:53,00:35:56,It was high stakes for these things because if you lost
00:35:56,00:36:02,Your reputation was damaged you were you were seen as someone who was not capable of doing great math
00:36:02,00:36:06,And it kind of just ruined you if you won there might be a monetary prize or
00:36:06,00:36:09,Alternatively the loser had to buy you dinner
00:36:09,00:36:14,30 times for every every single one that you got right yeah in a local tavern
00:36:14,00:36:21,They'd have to foot the bill no matter what you order Tartaglia actually was famous at the time for he'd done a few of these
00:36:21,00:36:23,challenges and won them all and
00:36:23,00:36:28,"He'd turned down the dinners like they'd offered him these 30 banquets and he said no, I don't need that"
00:36:28,00:36:34,I just I'm happy to show them an amazing mathematician. That's pretty pretty cocky. It's pretty amazing. Um Cardano second though
00:36:34,00:36:37,Ferrara isn't it? He
00:36:37,00:36:41,He was like fine. Okay. You know what I'll see you I'll do I'll do your 30 questions
00:36:41,00:36:46,"But by this time he'd worked out how to solve any equation to the power of four, right?"
00:36:46,00:36:49,Hang on level up
00:36:49,00:36:54,So he just said all 30 questions as to the power for and I told you I had no idea how to solve them
00:36:54,00:36:59,So he got beaten it's so it must we're talking about it like it's it might kind of been very exciting to watch
00:36:59,00:37:04,But actually the idea of a duel where you have you could like your opponent might have invented a new kind of gun
00:37:04,00:37:06,Yeah
00:37:06,00:37:09,You have to have a new kind of gun and it's tomorrow and you know
00:37:09,00:37:14,I think we should bring it back. I think the next two potential Prime Minister candidates. They should
00:37:14,00:37:18,One end of damage
00:37:18,00:37:23,I would love to see Liz Truss tried to solve a cubic equation
00:37:24,00:37:30,"Um, that's not the best math school though. The best story about a math school is about gal war. Um, do you know about gal?"
00:37:30,00:37:38,"Okay, so he's this really young French mathematician and he was absolutely amazing"
00:37:38,00:37:42,He was what he was looking at Quintic so equations to the power of five level up
00:37:42,00:37:49,"Anyway, he was absolutely amazing, but he was also a proper flirt. So he was"
00:37:50,00:37:53,having an affair with this soldiers fiance
00:37:53,00:37:59,And in like the the the soldier came in and was like how dare you so go. I was like fine
00:37:59,00:38:04,"I'll challenge you to a duel, but he really wanted to finish his theory like his math theory"
00:38:04,00:38:07,So he went home that night. He's like 1920 years old
00:38:07,00:38:12,He went home that night and he stayed up all night trying to finish gal war theory and like writing on this piece of paper
00:38:12,00:38:15,And we still have the piece of paper and all the way through it's like this
00:38:15,00:38:19,Unbelievable mathematics that kind of still stands today is like the father of group theory
00:38:19,00:38:22,"And and he finished right? He finished the theory, right?"
00:38:22,00:38:26,"He keeps going all the like the muffin muffin, right? And it's like oh in the morning"
00:38:26,00:38:29,I will die and then he goes off me and he loses in the duel. Oh
00:38:29,00:38:35,"Yeah, and honestly the math is like really good. That's also he wasn't he wasn't bluffing"
00:38:35,00:38:38,We'll fill this bit in later after dual promise. It works
00:38:41,00:38:47,He was part of the revolution right and he thought that if he died in the duel
00:38:47,00:38:54,There would be a big funeral and all of his mates would use that funeral as chance to kind of rise up against the government
00:38:54,00:38:59,So sure enough he did die in the duel and everyone kind of got to the funeral and everyone was there very sad
00:38:59,00:39:01,And I like when are we gonna do it when are we gonna do it?
00:39:01,00:39:06,And then halfway through news was passed around that one of Napoleon's marshals had just died
00:39:06,00:39:11,And so next week there was going to be an even bigger funeral and so they went oh fuck it. Let's do it then
00:39:11,00:39:17,And did they do it did the French Revolution happen. Yeah
00:39:17,00:39:23,It's quite interesting question isn't it really when you think about it
00:39:23,00:39:30,"Yeah, just on duels. Yeah, so the last duel to happen in France"
00:39:31,00:39:38,"Happened after the first seven Beatles albums were released. Really? Yeah, the guys who fought it two French politicians"
00:39:38,00:39:44,There was a mayor of Marseille and another politician who was called René Riviera. It was in 1967. It was filmed
00:39:44,00:39:50,"They they fought with swords in a private house. Wow, and they could have heard they could have heard revolver by that point"
00:39:50,00:39:56,"Stunning how much Sergeant Pepper which was out later. So who's at the eighth album? Yeah, Sergeant Pepper. Okay, good"
00:39:56,00:40:00,Was it legal though for them to do it like if one of them had killed the other would they have gone to jail?
00:40:00,00:40:01,I think they were because
00:40:01,00:40:08,1967 I think the reason I think they were fighting in a private house because it was probably a bit legally iffy by that point
00:40:08,00:40:14,"Yeah, I think actually a bit earlier than that they outlawed Jules and yeah, probably yeah. Yeah, I'm speaking of the Beatles there was"
00:40:14,00:40:21,"You know so Patty Boyd Patty Boyd. Um, she was married to George Harrison"
00:40:21,00:40:26,"Thank you, and then she left George Harrison to be married to Eric Clapton and"
00:40:26,00:40:33,They had an affair and it was a big it was a big thing and he wrote George Harrison wrote something about Patty Boyd that song something
00:40:33,00:40:37,"Oh, yeah, and Laila was written about Patty Boyd as well by Eric Clapton"
00:40:37,00:40:44,So she is part of two major songs as the muse the inspiration and if you're gonna if you're gonna say they didn't if you could say
00:40:44,00:40:48,They had a duel. I'm so excited where they had to turn up with a new chord each. Yeah
00:40:48,00:40:51,completely so one night
00:40:51,00:40:57,George Harrison's at home and Eric Clapton turns up drunk and they have a jewel. No a guitar jewel
00:40:57,00:41:03,Stop it. Nothing is said a guitar is handed to Eric Clapton and according to Patty Boyd for two hours
00:41:03,00:41:09,They sat silently just riffing at each other back and forth said nothing and Clapton
00:41:09,00:41:14,Even though he's drunk as hell still just absolutely wiped the floor with Harrison. Wow. Isn't that cool?
00:41:14,00:41:18,There was a guitar off between Harrison and Clapton. It's less cool than it sounds
00:41:18,00:41:22,I think if you had to be there just watching these two drunk blokes play the guitar at each other
00:41:22,00:41:27,I think it would have been amazing
00:41:27,00:41:32,"In the 19th century in Germany, it became quite cool to have been in jewels"
00:41:32,00:41:39,"To such an extent that if you were a man with a scar on your face, you were considered to be good marriageable material"
00:41:39,00:41:43,The idea was you've been in a duel so you had honor
00:41:43,00:41:47,You've managed to someone had cut you but you still managed to get through it
00:41:47,00:41:49,So you must be hardcore kind of person
00:41:49,00:41:56,And it was to such an extent that men would deliberately nick their faces with razors and then bathe the cut in wine
00:41:56,00:42:00,So that it didn't heal properly so they made them look like they've been in a duel
00:42:00,00:42:03,It's kind of interesting because there was a
00:42:03,00:42:10,2009 study that found that women favor men with facial scars for short-term relationships today
00:42:11,00:42:16,"Short-term relationships. Yeah, yeah, yeah, as in the bad boy. He's got a scar"
00:42:16,00:42:23,Don't know if it's true. There was also a study saying to say I got a head injury in my first week of university
00:42:23,00:42:27,Which led to some superficial scarring and I can assure you it's not true
00:42:27,00:42:34,It doesn't say how short-term the relationship's like doesn't matter
00:42:34,00:42:39,"I've got great countervailing data, okay, well"
00:42:39,00:42:40,Here's another
00:42:40,00:42:42,Here's another study which counteracts it
00:42:42,00:42:48,There was a study done where they looked at people with scars and people without scars
00:42:48,00:42:54,And they found that if you have a scar people are more likely to stand about a foot a further away from you
00:42:54,00:42:56,And that's about wingspan
00:42:56,00:43:06,"What a thrush a thrush a thrush has got a one-foot wingspan. Yeah, approximately"
00:43:06,00:43:09,I'm more impressed by that than anything else you said
00:43:09,00:43:17,"Just 30 to 32 centimeters, but you look at a thrush. You think that's nothing. Yeah. Yeah, but you think it's a wing on both sides"
00:43:17,00:43:22,"Yeah, that's true. I think I've not in fact all the way through your early bit. I didn't understand what a wingspan was"
00:43:22,00:43:25,All the way through you've been standing half the distance
00:43:25,00:43:29,Let me tell you about these scars
00:43:29,00:43:36,I was reading about jewels and I found a cool thing that was almost a weird little nugget
00:43:37,00:43:39,So I'm gonna do it as a quiz question
00:43:39,00:43:43,So there was a jewel that happened in July 1806 between two people mr.
00:43:43,00:43:46,Ho worth and Lord Barrymore Ho worth just before doing the jewel
00:43:46,00:43:51,This is with pistols takes his clothes off entirely except for his underpants for the jewel
00:43:51,00:43:55,Why is it the same reason why?
00:43:55,00:44:00,The IRA make you take your trousers off before they kneecap you. Sorry. Oh
00:44:00,00:44:04,Interesting
00:44:04,00:44:12,"I'm doubly confused now. I've got I've got a theory. Yeah, so he his skin was"
00:44:12,00:44:19,Like woodland colored like he looked like a jungle and so it was camouflage for the duel
00:44:19,00:44:23,"Yes, and so the the the other guy in the dual could only see a pair of underpants floating around. Yes"
00:44:23,00:44:26,No
00:44:26,00:44:32,"But like yes, what an idea right but not that. No, of course not. Can we go back to Hannah's IRA thing?"
00:44:32,00:44:39,Maybe his clothes were big because of the era when this was whenever it was and it would make him a smaller target to take his clothes off
00:44:39,00:44:44,"That's good. No, so what it was. I don't think we finished guessing them. Oh, sorry"
00:44:44,00:44:48,"No, what it was is that?"
00:44:48,00:44:53,This is according to the theories of the time. It might actually be true. I'm not sure but if you were shot with clothes
00:44:53,00:44:56,The the clothing might go into the bullet wings
00:45:00,00:45:02,So what is it? Okay
00:45:02,00:45:08,But so the wound will be infected with whatever disease is sitting on the clothing that you have dirty bacteria
00:45:08,00:45:12,Whatever and so therefore it could get stuck into the wound exactly
00:45:12,00:45:15,So he stood more of a chance if he was hit by the bullet
00:45:15,00:45:20,Naked surviving it than he did if he had the clothes on so we should always strip
00:45:20,00:45:24,"I think that happened a relatively not all the time, but it did happen from time to time"
00:45:24,00:45:31,There was in the 1890s. There was a movement by women saying that it's not fair that whenever people bespurched my reputation
00:45:31,00:45:34,I have to get a man involved to do the dueling for me
00:45:34,00:45:39,And so they decided they wanted to do the dueling themselves and in Lichtenstein
00:45:39,00:45:46,Princess Pauline von Matanik fought a duel with Countess Anastasia Kielmansek
00:45:46,00:45:50,And it was over a disagreement over a flower arrangement
00:45:51,00:45:57,"And again, they were topless and the reason they were topless is because they didn't want their clothing to be infected"
00:45:57,00:46:04,"I'm not like that. Yeah, but and you're saying the IRA did that. Yeah, well, so it's like maybe I made this up"
00:46:04,00:46:08,"No, I think it's nice. You don't hear many people these days willing to speak up for the IRA"
00:46:08,00:46:15,"I think that's really good. And I think it's brave. Yeah. Yeah, I regret it. I regret it"
00:46:16,00:46:25,It is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact
00:46:25,00:46:29,My fact this week is that boxer Chris Eubank
00:46:29,00:46:37,Once lobbied to cancel a championship match just hours before it began because he believed his opponent had been hypnotized
00:46:37,00:46:44,To feel no pain and also so that he could see punches coming at him three times slower than normal
00:46:45,00:46:50,"I mean, this is Chris Eubank. He's the champion of boxing at this point"
00:46:50,00:46:53,"Yeah, he was he was in a match against Steve Collins Steve Collins"
00:46:53,00:47:01,Basically used mind games against you bank to make him believe that he had super powers through the benefit of hypnosis
00:47:01,00:47:04,So he said the hypnosis meant that no matter how much you hit me
00:47:04,00:47:05,It's just not gonna register
00:47:05,00:47:08,But the other thing that he said was if you throw a punch at me
00:47:08,00:47:13,I'm gonna be like spider-man in that scene in the canteen where it just comes super slow
00:47:13,00:47:20,"Right, and I'm gonna be able to just dodge everything and it freaked Chris Eubank out so much that literally hours before he was"
00:47:20,00:47:26,Desperately trying to get out despite being the absolute dominant boxer in the match. Did they end up having the match?
00:47:26,00:47:28,"Yeah, they did and you banged lost. Oh"
00:47:28,00:47:35,"Yeah, he lost it worked basically he was and he talks about it years later saying that when they have their first way in and"
00:47:35,00:47:37,This was first said to him
00:47:37,00:47:41,And there were other things that were said but he said that's when I lost the match all the way back then
00:47:42,00:47:44,"Psychologically, I was done. I just couldn't match it"
00:47:44,00:47:48,He tried to do everything that he could when he got to the to the actual event itself
00:47:48,00:47:55,This guy Collins came out. He had a hoodie on he had headphones in and he was listening to the rocky theme tune the whole time
00:47:55,00:47:58,You bank comes in on a motorcycle trying to look all cool
00:47:58,00:48:05,He's got Tina Turner simply the best playing out loud the whole time this guy. He's got his eyes closed sat in the corner of the ring
00:48:05,00:48:09,He's giving him nothing all the intimidation tactics are not working and that throws you bank as well
00:48:09,00:48:13,"I just think I can't do this. Wow. Yeah, that's amazing. Thank you very much, James"
00:48:13,00:48:17,That's amazing they could make such a big difference though
00:48:17,00:48:20,It's the one thing that came to mind immediately for me is the
00:48:20,00:48:24,"Koshnoy versus Karpov chess game. Oh, yeah"
00:48:24,00:48:30,"Yeah, one of them had defected away from the Soviet Union the other one hadn't it was a big thing about"
00:48:30,00:48:37,You know who was the best the West or the East and Koshnoy thought that Karpov's assistant was hypnotizing him
00:48:37,00:48:41,To such an extent that this guy who was called Zuka
00:48:41,00:48:45,He thought he was hypnotizing him by staring at him the whole way through
00:48:45,00:48:48,Obviously everyone was staring at him the whole way through because they were watching the game
00:48:48,00:48:54,But he said that he wasn't allowed to sit on the first two rows and they made him sit at the back of the room because he was
00:48:54,00:48:55,"Sure, it was gonna happen"
00:48:55,00:48:58,He still thinks to this day that he was being hypnotized and couldn't play chess
00:48:58,00:49:02,It was a good reason as well because this guy that was supposedly his job
00:49:02,00:49:05,He would come in and he would he would mentally get inside your head
00:49:05,00:49:10,"But the truth was he did get inside his head. Yeah, didn't he just didn't do it in the way that he was suggesting"
00:49:10,00:49:12,"Oh, the player that was worried about the hypnosis"
00:49:12,00:49:14,He had dark sunglasses on because he thought that might deflect it
00:49:14,00:49:19,He had his partner sit next to him and they would she was tickling him and kicking him the whole time
00:49:19,00:49:22,"Yeah, trying to break the gaze and then the"
00:49:22,00:49:29,It was crazy. He he he he brought in three monks to come
00:49:29,00:49:37,"Sorry, it was two monks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, three would be overkill. Oh, no stick to the two and four no laughs to be seen"
00:49:37,00:49:45,And they they meditated and that helped him to regain a it was something like a four one deficit in the games
00:49:45,00:49:50,"Because it was six games in total the monks helped him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was it was mad that man"
00:49:50,00:49:55,I'm caution I lost but he still today thinks it happened because he thinks that Magnus Carlson
00:49:55,00:49:59,Who's the greatest chess player who ever lived he thinks that he must be hypnotizing people
00:49:59,00:50:03,He's the only reason he can beat so many people because people blunder against them
00:50:03,00:50:07,So but that idea of in chess of like it being psyching out your opponent being a big part of it
00:50:07,00:50:11,"I mean Kasparov used to do that as well, right like Gary Kasparov that the really amazing guy"
00:50:11,00:50:13,So he would do this thing where he would take his watch off
00:50:13,00:50:18,And you put it down the table while he was playing you and then you just sort of play along and then
00:50:18,00:50:21,At the point where he was like I'm done toying with you now
00:50:21,00:50:26,He'd pick his watch up and he would put it return it to his wrist and that would be like your cue to say like you're done like
00:50:26,00:50:35,But then when he played against the computer obviously none of those tricks worked but IBM they deliberately put in a bit
00:50:35,00:50:37,They they put in an extra bit of the code
00:50:37,00:50:43,So Kasparov knew that the computer was like calculating the number of potential options
00:50:43,00:50:46,There were and he knew that like calculations took time
00:50:46,00:50:52,"So the longer time it took the harder the calculation was working, but IBM deliberately put in a random amount of extra time"
00:50:52,00:50:55,Before the computer would give its response
00:50:55,00:51:01,So Kasparov was sitting there trying to think about what the computer knew and it completely psyched him out
00:51:01,00:51:06,And he says now I mean I think all the grandmasters say that he was still at that moment still better than the machine
00:51:06,00:51:12,"Yeah, he lost it because he allowed the machine to psych him out. Yeah, right. That is incredible the mind games of sport"
00:51:12,00:51:14,Yeah are fascinating
00:51:15,00:51:20,Hypnosis though. I I always thought it was a bit of a dubious territory and it sounds like there is a bit more science behind it
00:51:20,00:51:25,Then we possibly give it credit as I don't know. It's kind of a bit that you're doing it to yourself
00:51:25,00:51:30,"Yes, and some people are more and less susceptible to hypnotism, but some people are really susceptible to it"
00:51:30,00:51:34,People at home can't see that Andy's moving his hands quite a lot in my direction when he's saying this
00:51:34,00:51:36,Which I think you might be trying something
00:51:36,00:51:42,But you know that it is illegal to do any hypnosis on television or radio in the UK
00:51:43,00:51:47,Off-com will stop you from doing that really the reason is you can hypnotize people over
00:51:47,00:51:56,Television and radio and one of the ways that they see how suggestible someone is is by playing them tapes and seeing if it affects them
00:51:56,00:51:59,But off-com does not regulate podcasts
00:51:59,00:52:04,Close the doors
00:52:04,00:52:08,You are feelings you will buy 20 copies of Andy's book
00:52:08,00:52:12,You better say you are feeling very sleepy. We're worried one of the people are
00:52:13,00:52:18,"Um, no, they banned it in the 40s because I'd let this is a report from the New York Times about hypnosis being banned"
00:52:18,00:52:23,I'm quoting here the BBC experimented with a television program featuring a British hypnotist today
00:52:23,00:52:28,But dropped the idea quickly when four of the six judges went into a trance
00:52:28,00:52:36,It was when you had to audition for TV shows basically and apparently the judge like this hypnotist was so good that the judges fell asleep
00:52:37,00:52:43,Random studio employee fell asleep the TV announcer fell asleep every one fell asleep and when they were woken up
00:52:43,00:52:47,"They said well, he's too good. We can't put him on TV. We can't do it"
00:52:47,00:52:50,"Hypnotize the whole country. It would be a nightmare. So yeah, yeah"
00:52:50,00:52:55,"But why didn't he just hypnotize them into thinking he'd been a bit shit, but basically fine"
00:52:55,00:52:58,And then the power he could have had
00:52:58,00:53:04,You do wonder because like when you hear people like Darren Brown who can do it and Paul McKenna
00:53:04,00:53:07,Do they have the power to do it within their day-to-day life?
00:53:07,00:53:13,And is that ethical and it turns out Paul McKenna did use it once he's admitted to it and he says I felt very bad
00:53:13,00:53:19,"I'm never gonna do it again. What do you do? Well, he used his power to make his girlfriend at the time like curry"
00:53:19,00:53:29,"She's so fair she didn't like curry. Oh, that's his book as it is is badly selling fifth book, isn't it? I can make you like curry"
00:53:32,00:53:34,"Wow, so what that is unethical it is unethical"
00:53:34,00:53:36,He said he'd never would do that again
00:53:36,00:53:40,"He felt really bad for it, but he just really liked curry and she didn't and it was really getting in the way of the relationship"
00:53:40,00:53:43,"If that's the worst misuse of his powers, he's ever made I'm a Dutchman"
00:53:43,00:53:45,I can't believe that
00:53:45,00:53:49,"Because you just would get on the bus wouldn't you and say I've paid and that would be it, you know"
00:53:49,00:53:52,It's not that quick. I try that every day
00:53:52,00:54:00,"It's not Jediism it takes minutes doesn't it it takes like seven minutes. I don't know. Well, yeah the bus will wait, won't it?"
00:54:01,00:54:07,You just pretend you're looking for your change all the time swinging that watch
00:54:07,00:54:11,Bus crash today because the driver for some reason thought he was a chicken
00:54:11,00:54:17,"Have any of you guys ever been hypnotized? I'd never know. Yeah, I did I did happen"
00:54:17,00:54:22,"Yeah, so it was me and my co-host and they tried to hypnotize us both and it didn't work on me at all"
00:54:22,00:54:27,But it did work on him and I just there's a little bit minute is what it was making
00:54:28,00:54:33,"I just don't believe people. I just sort of do think it's a bit faking. Yeah, no"
00:54:33,00:54:38,"I well you have to you have to persuade yourself. I think you're you're you're definitely part of the equation, aren't you?"
00:54:38,00:54:41,Maybe that's how they say it works right is that you are actually doing it yourself
00:54:41,00:54:47,"But you're just allowing yourself. They're helping you along the way. Yeah, well, and you didn't believe you didn't believe"
00:54:47,00:54:55,"But they say yeah, they supposedly used it during the Civil War and other other war. Yeah. Yeah English or American"
00:54:56,00:54:58,"American, I believe sorry. Sorry"
00:54:58,00:55:06,"Sorry, I was so aggressive that I just think we should be specific when we say the Civil War. Yeah. Yeah, there are so many countries"
00:55:06,00:55:08,I think I yeah
00:55:08,00:55:15,I just think every time every time we use the words of the Civil War to be the American one
00:55:15,00:55:18,"Yeah, yeah, a little bit of ironically I think you're not being very civil"
00:55:18,00:55:24,"Being very aggressive. No, so, you know remember Naysby is all I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah"
00:55:25,00:55:30,We could have got rid of them we did get rid of them they came back
00:55:30,00:55:41,"Sorry, go on. Oh, no, I was just checking if anyone was sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. So yeah, I'm during the"
00:55:41,00:55:44,the Civil War the Civil War
00:55:44,00:55:51,"Hypnosis was used on patients because it's been found in in I mean, maybe it is a bit dubious"
00:55:51,00:55:56,But it is also a bit psychosomatic if you were hypnotized prior to surgery when they didn't have the proper meds
00:55:56,00:56:02,They could hypnotize you into thinking that you could be in a in a less painful place and they found that surgery
00:56:02,00:56:09,Works way better when people believe that it's going to be better for them in recovery periods and so on if hypnosis is used beforehand
00:56:09,00:56:11,"Well, they do in childbirth as well. Don't they there's like the whole sort of"
00:56:11,00:56:20,"But what particularly famous case in the 1800s, I think Dr. Ellison who had two sisters 15 and 17"
00:56:20,00:56:24,He had epilepsy and he was trying to hypnotize them into being better
00:56:24,00:56:28,But then it was like so impressed with how well he was able to mesmerize them
00:56:28,00:56:33,"He like started sticking needles in their necks. Oh, and then turned it into a show"
00:56:33,00:56:40,"Do you say they were his sisters? No, they were just they were sisters. Sorry. Okay. I was about to say brothers"
00:56:40,00:56:42,"No, wow"
00:56:42,00:56:48,"Was that around mid 19th century? I think so. Yeah, because that was a big there was this like hinge moment before they discovered proper"
00:56:48,00:56:50,anesthesia like real chemical stuff where
00:56:50,00:56:57,Hypnotism seemed to work and there was a doctor called James Esdale who worked in British India
00:56:57,00:57:01,It was a Scottish doctor who's in India at the time and there were a lot of men at the time who had
00:57:01,00:57:06,"Hydroceals of the scrotum. So if you're not familiar with this, it's where your scrotum"
00:57:06,00:57:10,It's really painful and it's it's like a slight tube. It's kind of tumor
00:57:10,00:57:14,It's full of bodily fluids and they can grow and it can be really uncomfortable for ages
00:57:14,00:57:19,And but it was a painful operation to deal with it and patients would just put up with the
00:57:19,00:57:26,Discomfort for years rather than have the pain of the operation one man was using his testicle as a writing desk because it was that big
00:57:26,00:57:43,"Yeah, but what I'm sorry what I'm trying to say is that you know, he used mesmerism to operate on and robbed this guy of his writing desk"
00:57:44,00:57:51,"But it was a it was a it was a big success because he was using mesmerism and the post-operation death rate plummeted and you know, so"
00:57:51,00:57:56,I know the weirdest we work situation
00:57:56,00:58:02,"Dear Maria, I'll write to you again from my usual place"
00:58:02,00:58:05,My name is right nut
00:58:05,00:58:08,You know Peter Jackson of Lord of the Rings
00:58:08,00:58:13,"Yeah, can you guess why he consulted about getting himself put it through a deep hypnotic?"
00:58:13,00:58:19,"Okay, so sometimes people do it if they're scared of something was he scared of Hobbits? He was"
00:58:19,00:58:26,"Deep hobbophobia. No, it's not that it's related to Lord of the Rings though. Oh, is it related to rings?"
00:58:26,00:58:30,"It's like yeah, he'd swallowed the ring of true power and he needed"
00:58:30,00:58:34,"Yeah, no, I love this. He said this a couple years ago, right?"
00:58:34,00:58:38,He wanted to be hypnotized into forgetting that he had made the Lord of the Rings films
00:58:38,00:58:41,So that he could watch them like a normal person
00:58:41,00:58:45,Because they're so good
00:58:45,00:58:52,He said that that's wonderful. Wow. Can you believe that he said he said it was such a loss for me
00:58:52,00:58:58,"Not to be able to experience them like everyone else was yeah, wow. I watched them. I was feeling sleepy"
00:58:58,00:59:03,Stephen Fry did it once he needed it for a work reason
00:59:03,00:59:09,So he was doing his a bit of frying Laurie with you Laurie and there was a sketch that they wrote where he needed to sing
00:59:09,00:59:16,He wrote about this in his autobiography Moab is my wash pot and he has a pathological fear of singing out loud
00:59:16,00:59:18,To anyone could be one person in a room. He just can't do it
00:59:18,00:59:22,but he felt he needed to do it for the sketch and so he went to a hypnotist and
00:59:22,00:59:29,So he writes that basically it was quite embarrassing for him because in order to get it to the point
00:59:29,00:59:32,Where he could be triggered into being hypnotized
00:59:32,00:59:37,"He needed a key word and the key word was the lead-in line but the lead-in line was hit it, bitch"
00:59:37,00:59:45,So he had multiple sessions with a therapist so I'm going when you hear the words hit it bitch
00:59:45,00:59:52,"Sing and yeah, and I think he was worried for a while that like anytime he heard that you know"
00:59:52,00:59:54,"Oh, yeah, cuz Stephen Fry hears that phrase a lot"
00:59:54,00:59:58,I don't know what his personal life is like
00:59:58,01:00:00,I'm just
01:00:00,01:00:10,"Okay, I need a wrap us up guys that is it that is all of our facts"
