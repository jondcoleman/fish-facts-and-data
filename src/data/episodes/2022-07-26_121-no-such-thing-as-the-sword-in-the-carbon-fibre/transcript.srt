00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Aniches Zinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in a particular order,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 here we go, starting with you, Chuzinsky.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 My fact this week is that the reason Merlin isn't called "Murden"

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 is to avoid confusion with a 12th century word for feces.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 That's amazing.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Yeah, so the wizard Merlin of "Sword in the Stone" fame,

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 he would have been called "Murden"

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 and so the story is that Merlin was originally created in the form we know him

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 by Jeffrey of Monmouth, who was sort of

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 a Norman Welsh guy in the 12th century.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And he based the character of Merlin on this Welsh medieval mythical figure called "Murden"

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 M-Y-R-D-I-N. But because he has sort of Norman origins,

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 because he was from the Nebility probably, and so a lot of people were speaking French

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 in his social circles,

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 it was thought that Merlin would be really easily confused with Merlin,

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 which is the same as it is today,

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 which is the word for pooh.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 It feels like he's missed a chance for a lot of puns and poo jokes, doesn't it?

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 By changing that name, he's lost a lot of his joke material.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Yes, he could have been the chalcer of his time.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I just don't know if that was the style he was going for.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Okay, do you know that in the 17th century the word "Murden" was English?

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Yes, really!

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 It was just a common English word for pooh "Murden"

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 and then it just kind of disappeared in the 18th century.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And now it's kind of everyone knows it's just a French word.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Speaking of people, his name's meant feces.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Montezuma of the Aztecs had an nephew whose name meant plenty of excrement.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 What was his name?

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 It was cuida chwac.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 They had guacamole, didn't they, which means testicle sauce.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 An avocado means testicles as well.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Exactly, yes.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Are the things that mean testicles, orchid?

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Yes, yeah.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I have another Merlin fact, probably my favorite Merlin fact.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 He was sorted into a house at Hogwarts.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Neither of these things is real.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Exactly, I thought someone might pick me up on this, but neither of these things are real.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 The big JK Rowling website, it was revealed that Merlin was a student of the school of Hogwarts.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And he was sorted into one of the four schools.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And he was sorted into Slytherin.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 So Merlin is a Slytherin.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Wow.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 This is weird because you said yesterday that you'd found an amazing thing on Merlin that you love.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 It's the best thing I've ever found, yeah.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Well, so I was reading about him later on.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And I found something and I thought, I bet this is what Dan's found.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 It's so interesting.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And this really shows how disconnected you and I are.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 The thing I thought is that he's so Merlin in the original myth is a ledge to have been buried in this particular place.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 That's sort of a crossover between two rivers.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 So the river Tweed and a little stream called Palsail Burn.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And in the legends, it was written that if ever the Palsail Burn and the Tweed were to meet at the place of Merlin's final resting place,

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 these two rivers were to suddenly collide, then England and Scotland would have the same monarch.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And this prediction is in medieval text.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And on the exact day that James the 6th of Scotland and James the 1st of England was crowned in 1603,

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 the banks of the River Tweed broke and it flooded into the Palsail Burn and they met.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 No.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Isn't that weird?

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 I smell PR happening.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Yeah.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 It might be that I didn't check it off in the banks broken.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 It might be that they just broke every single winter.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 But I definitely know they broke in 1603 on that precise day according to whom.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 The 17th century Malcolm tucking character.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Speaking of PR though, I was talking to Greg Jenner and Greg Jenner, who's been on our show a number of times.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Historian.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Historian, Horrible History's official chief nerd.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And he was telling me about a publicity stunt as well.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So this was back in the 12th century, the Glastonbury Abbey Burn Down and all the pilgrims stopped going to it.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 So it was soon after that that the abbot found the body of King Arthur in his grave.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And suddenly all the pilgrims started returning on mass.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And so Greg was saying that this is one of the earliest examples of a publicity stunt

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 where they just needed people to return.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 So King Arthur is one of the original publicity stunt.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Yeah, I think what happened was it burnt down and they were like to Henry the 2nd Oak and we have some more money to build out.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 So we don't have any, but maybe just maybe if you look closely, you might be able to find the body of King Arthur.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And they went, okay, we'll have a lock and sure enough the very next day they found it.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Wow.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 What a weird coincidence.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 It's amazing.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 It's such a short time as well.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Incredible.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Okay, so this is something that I thought you would like down.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 So the Holy Grail, which is kind of an Arthurian legend as well.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 It's based probably on an adaptation of an old Welsh story about the cauldron of Anwin.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Okay.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Which was owned by a guy called Bran the Blessed.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 No.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Yeah.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And if he was a giant, a Welsh giant called Bran the Blessed.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Wow.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And if you go into his Wikipedia page, it says, "Do not confuse him with Brian Blessed."

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 It's amazing.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 You can understand why you would.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Yeah.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 That's incredible.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Do we know any more about him or is it just that?

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Well, the soul saw his Wikipedia page, but I didn't read any of it.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And he was real, was he?

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 No, he was a giant.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Oh my god.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 But then is Brian Blessed real?

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 It's the point I'm making.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Who appears more real?

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Also, do you know what the name of the sword and the stone was?

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I'm going to say Excalibur and you're looking at me like it's wrong.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It's wrong, I'm afraid.

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 According to Mallory and according to basically everyone, the sword and the stone doesn't have a name.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 And then Arthur loses it.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And then he gets his Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake, which is a different sword.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Okay.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Who eventually traps Merlin for all of eternity.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 That's how Merlin meets his demise.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 It was stone.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 In some stone as well, right?

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Yeah.

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Everything's always been stuck in stone in these days.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Yeah, they didn't have carbon fiber, they didn't have plastics.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 They had to use what they had basically.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Yeah.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 All the hell was stone.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Actually, just on Arthurian legend.

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Yeah.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I think, I don't know if Andy will know this, but I had no idea about this.

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 I thought it was really interesting.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 So Arthurian legends are referred to as the matter of Britain.

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 So this is this whole body of medieval literature, which is called the matter of Britain.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And there are three matters in medieval times.

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 There's the matter of Britain, the matter of France, and the matter of Rome.

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And these are just the three big bits of literature.

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 So matter of Britain's Arthur, the matter of France is the stories of Charlemagne.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And the matter of Rome is like all-awesome Roman ancient literature.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 So the matter of Rome is absolutely winning.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And the guy who named these was a French poet who was called Baudel.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And I was thinking when I was reading this, oh, cool.

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 We are one of the three great tripods of medieval literature.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And his description of them was that France is character.

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 The matter of France is characterised by voire or truth.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Rome is characterised by sage-ness or wisdom or knowledge.

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And the matter of Britain is characterised by being vain et pleson,

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 to mean frivolous, pleasant, but completely false.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Funny you say wise, because that's where the word wizard comes from.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Is it?

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 The wizard part comes from wise.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And I think the idea was that maybe in the olden days,

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 wise people could see the future, I think that might be okay.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Can I quickly talk about modern day wizards?

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Yeah.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Okay, so pagans and druids, those are the sort of modern day torch holders

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 of the whole wizarding world, I would say.

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And interesting news in the world of pagan news,

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 which is that now pagans, there's about a million in the UK,

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 300 of whom are in prison.

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Prisoned pagans, prisoned wizards are now allowed to have a wand in jail.

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 That's a new ruling that's just been made.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Because it's respecting their religious beliefs.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 So what they have to do is they can go into the yard and get some twigs

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 and bring them back.

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And then they kind of just pimp up the twigs a bit.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And then that's their wand that they're allowed to have.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I think I might start a new religion which has a skeleton key as a holy symbol.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 This article says they've toned down all of the rituals

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 because what they're also in theory should be having is a flaming torch with them

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 as part of the religion.

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And we're cool to let the flaming torch bit go if we can have the twigs.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 How many wizards are in prison?

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 300.

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 300?

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Are they all in the same--

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 No, it's not as good.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 [LAUGHTER]

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I don't actually think it does show respects for their religion.

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Because what basically you're saying when you tell wizards that they're allowed

187
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 to have their wand in prison is that you definitely don't believe

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 their wand has any capacity to help them.

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 [LAUGHTER]

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 I have one last thing which is about modern day wizards,

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 which is there is a school in California which is open and has been open for 10 years.

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 It's the world's only registered wizard academy.

193
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 It's got 735 students.

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Half of whom will be in prison at 10 years.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 [LAUGHTER]

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And it was set up by a guy called Oberon-Zell Ravenhart

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 and he himself is a wizard.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 But the school is up and running.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 You can go to their website.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 They have like latest news is that the school is now.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 It's called the Grey School of Wizardry.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 They're now on second life so you can attend it on second life as well.

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 They have a list of their staff.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 It includes people called Silver Main, Swift Rabbit, Frogs Dancing, Earth Drum,

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 MA, Apollionus, BS, MS, PhD.

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 BS is a bit odd.

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 [LAUGHTER]

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And Silver Lock.

209
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And so yeah, you can--

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Well, these people just they started out as accountants or postmen

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 and they got so much mockery for their names that they ended up being forced

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 into the wizarding profession, do you think?

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Yeah, I don't know.

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I don't know who does it.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And one more modern wizard who's great is the Real King Arthur.

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Who's back?

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 This is a guy he was formally called John Rothwell before he realised

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 that he was King Arthur a few years ago.

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 He's the battle chief-ton of the council of British Truid orders.

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 There's quite a good interview with him in Vice.

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And the Vice Guy asked him things like how hard was it to pull the sword from the stone

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 to which he answered very, very, very hard.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 [LAUGHTER]

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 So that was legit.

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 [LAUGHTER]

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 They tried to trick him with that trick question.

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 [LAUGHTER]

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 What he got it straight away?

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Not today.

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Hang on, hang on.

231
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 The whole point of the sword in the stone was that it comes out easily

232
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 if you're the King of England.

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 [LAUGHTER]

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 They did trick him.

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

236
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 OK, and it's time to move on to fact number two.

237
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And that is James.

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 OK, my fact this week is that tea leaves sometimes flow upstream

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 from the cup to the pot.

240
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I don't believe it.

241
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 If I was ever going to call nonsense on anything, never mind King Arthur, you agree.

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I can't hate it.

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 [LAUGHTER]

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 This sounds amazing.

245
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 It is incredible.

246
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 It was discovered by a guy called Sebastian Bianchini in 2008.

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 He was at the University of Havana.

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And he was pouring hot water from a pot which was just water

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 into a cup which had some tea leaves, some matte tea leaves.

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And as he poured it, he had his nice cup of tea.

251
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 And then he looked in the pot.

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And there were tea leaves there.

253
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And he didn't understand why.

254
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And he went to a physicist at the University of Havana.

255
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And they kind of did some experiments.

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 But then they kind of, they never published a findings

257
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 because they thought everyone would laugh at them.

258
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 But it seems true.

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 It seems like it's a real thing.

260
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Oh my God.

261
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 This is one of those things that you could actually demonstrate.

262
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Like, you could just demonstrate.

263
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Why would people laugh?

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 But they think probably it was a trick.

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And he had some tea leaves in there all along.

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It's like a darren brown style.

267
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 You'd never be able to make any tea.

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 The leaves would constantly be fleeing into the pot.

269
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 So it's not all of them.

270
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 It's some of them.

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And it's due to this thing called the Marringoni Effect,

272
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 which is a mixture of surface tension

273
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 and a little bit of capillary action.

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And surface tension basically we're talking about pure water

275
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 and not pure water.

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And the particles want to travel up towards a pure water.

277
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And people didn't think it could happen with something

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 as big as tea leaves, but actually it can happen.

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And yeah, how big of a leaf are we talking?

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 We're talking this stuff is called matati.

281
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And it's usually like little,

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 they're almost like little bits of sawdust, aren't they?

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Yeah, it's really small.

284
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 It's very crumbly.

285
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Smaller than normal tea leaves.

286
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Wow.

287
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Yeah.

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 But actually when things run quite small scale,

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 they can do things that don't normally happen for bigger things.

290
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 So like, for instance, capillary action only really works

291
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 for really small kind of thin tubes,

292
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 which is that water goes up the tube against gravity.

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And that wouldn't happen on normal tube,

294
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 but it happens with very thin tubes.

295
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And that's how plants can get the water from the ground

296
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 into their leaves.

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Yeah.

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Okay.

299
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Did you read the guy who commented,

300
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 someone who commented at the bottom of this study?

301
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And he said,

302
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 "This article reminded me of when I once made the mistake

303
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 of expectorating into a toilet.

304
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And the result was an immediate,

305
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 accurate taste in my mouth.

306
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Apparently the chemicals in there had traveled several feet

307
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 up my stream of saliva.

308
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 But that was a theory then.

309
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Reliably disgusting.

310
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 It is quite disgusting.

311
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 But the scientist acknowledged that that could be a possibility,

312
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 although it said it might be quite unlikely that chemicals

313
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 could flow that way backwards."

314
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 So are we saying that when you go to the Lou in some ways,

315
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 the Lou goes to you?

316
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Oh, yeah.

317
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I mean, it's not very much.

318
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 It's not all of it.

319
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 It's not like you come out of the toilet.

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 The toilet is completely empty of water.

321
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I'm so bloated out of that.

322
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Well, isn't there that thing that all men are scared of,

323
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 that Amazonian fish, where the room has always been.

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 But it will swim up your urine stream.

325
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 We should quickly explain that, shouldn't we?

326
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 It's a canteroo.

327
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 It's like a mini little catfish.

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 I think it's in the catfish family.

329
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Yes.

330
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And the theory is you would be in the water and you'd be urinating.

331
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And it gets attracted to the urine stream.

332
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And then it follows it and then goes into your penis

333
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 and sticks its spines out and gets stuck there

334
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 and can be extremely painful.

335
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And there's been one or two stories in the medical literature

336
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 of it happening.

337
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But most people think probably it's not true.

338
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Yeah. And I have to say you say a little fish.

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 I've seen one in the Natural History Museum.

340
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 That's not a little fish.

341
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 That is.

342
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Remember when we went to?

343
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Yeah.

344
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Yeah. That was, I mean, no, but that's big.

345
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Like, it's not like a...

346
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 No, it wasn't.

347
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 You know that whale in the front lobby.

348
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Yeah.

349
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 It wasn't that one.

350
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Okay. Then I miss red label.

351
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 But it's about an inch out to you.

352
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Yeah.

353
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 I know, but still, the idea of that going A up a stream,

354
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 you know, it's not...

355
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 It's like a teapot stream urine.

356
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 It's not a fixed...

357
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Well, mine's not like a pig.

358
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 This was apparently the only means of preventing it

359
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 according to one piece of 19th century medical literature

360
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 because this room has been around for about 200 years

361
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 that they'll do this.

362
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 The only means of preventing it from reaching your bladder

363
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 where it causes inflammation and ultimately death

364
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 is to instantly amputate the penis.

365
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 This isn't when you get your visa to go to the Amazon

366
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 and you have to have it done as it prevented it.

367
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Yeah.

368
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Yeah.

369
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Just a shot in your arm.

370
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And let's just get that off show.

371
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I'm pretty sure that this has completely been debunked

372
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 as an idea.

373
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 The candero.

374
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Going from you standing on the bank, having a pit.

375
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So the idea is it could, let's say,

376
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 it could possibly happen while you're bathing.

377
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Exactly.

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Perhaps, and it just follows the warmth of the water or whatever.

379
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 But the idea that you're standing on the side of a river

380
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 peeing down and then it jumps like a sovereignty of penis.

381
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Yeah.

382
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 I'm pretty sure that got that out.

383
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 I was reading about the first ever book written about tea.

384
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 It's an old Chinese text and it's the first ever collection

385
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 of a book on tea.

386
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 It's called Cha-ching.

387
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 No.

388
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Cha, the Chinese word, and Qing, which I actually don't know

389
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 what that word is.

390
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 But the eye Qing is a fortune telling book, isn't it?

391
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Yes.

392
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Oh yeah, maybe it was fortune telling through T-Lews book.

393
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 You know, India, what the mythology of how tea came about in India is.

394
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 What?

395
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Did it get found by a goat herd or is that coffee maybe?

396
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 No.

397
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 So it was about 1,900 years ago and it was a priest named Bodhidhama.

398
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And he was trying to connect with Zen Buddhism and the idea

399
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 that he was going to do that was seven-year sleepless contemplation

400
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 of Buddha.

401
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 He found himself in the fifth year, again quite drowsy.

402
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 And needed to cure that.

403
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And so he quickly grabbed some leaves off a tree and started chewing them.

404
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 And then he thought it was fantastic.

405
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And that just got him through that extra two years.

406
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 He really put them up for that final push.

407
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And in China, they have an idea that it was an emperor called Nanshen,

408
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 who was, as well as being the emperor, he's a scholar and herbalist.

409
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And while he was out in the field on maybe I guess a walk or something,

410
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 he was having a hot cup of water and some leaves blew into his cup.

411
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And he spelt it away.

412
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 That smells quite nice.

413
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 I love it.

414
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 It's so interesting.

415
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Pretty much everything has an origin myth where it's discovered by...

416
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 It's widespread, isn't it?

417
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Which just seems to be the humans have this innate preference

418
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 for that kind of discovery rather than someone who really knew what they were doing

419
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 and had studied the field and were working really hard on it for years.

420
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Because we all want to believe that we could do it.

421
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 So the British introduced tea to India, which sounds lunatic.

422
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Or rather popularized it in India.

423
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 So it was already native.

424
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 But it was not a thing that was grown in large quantities though.

425
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 It wasn't big.

426
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 But then in the 19th century Britain needed an alternative to the Chinese tea monopoly.

427
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And so that's why India is now this great tea nation.

428
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Because we got it in the 17th century I think.

429
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Was it Charles II's wife?

430
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 I think came over and brought tea.

431
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And then everyone thought it was like this terrible...

432
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 So there's a lot of misogyny and xenophobia.

433
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Basically it was a foreign thing that women drank.

434
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And also it gave women a reason for getting together and men obviously thought that was a terrible idea.

435
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 It's the Lamborghini of its day basically.

436
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Lamborghini was discovered actually when...

437
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 That was walking across a field with some carbonated water.

438
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And a passing bird dropped and brought something great into it.

439
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 So can I just bring it back to your main headline fact for a second?

440
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So you haven't seen a video of this being done.

441
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 No.

442
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 I couldn't find one.

443
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Surely we should be doing that.

444
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 We should be filming that or getting someone listening to like let's see this.

445
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Let's see...

446
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Okay so it's specifically Matati.

447
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Yeah.

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Which is this South American tea which is...

449
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 It's quite a big thing over there isn't it?

450
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 You've been to America.

451
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Yeah and I've got a few friends who live there and it's pretty much all they do.

452
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 I'm amazed they get any work done there.

453
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 But yeah there's a really strict ritual around Matati which is that the way you drink it is you fill up a kettle of boiling water

454
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 and then you pour it onto all these hubs and you keep on topping it up and up.

455
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 So you can keep drinking your one Matati for hours but two very important things you have to do and people get extremely angry if you don't do them.

456
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 When it's usually you hand it around so it's a real sociable thing.

457
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It's a very much a community thing drinking Matati.

458
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And when you hand it to someone you have to look them in the eye because that's part of your saying I'm giving this to you.

459
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And you have to give it to them with a straw pointing towards them.

460
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 So it comes with this metal straw.

461
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 And if you don't give it to them with a straw pointing you are kicked out of the country.

462
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 No it sounds like it's from bitter experience.

463
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Just on tea.

464
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 So I think a lot of people think that you shouldn't re-boil a kettle.

465
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 If you boil the water once you should use that to make tea and then the water is sort of no good for making tea after that.

466
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And if you re-boil it is bad. And the theory is that all the oxygen leaches out of the water.

467
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 But the thing is when you boil a kettle it leaches off the first time you boil a kettle.

468
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 So whenever you make a tea you don't have a choice you have to make it without all that lovely bonus oxype.

469
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Do you know what I do now?

470
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 If I have a shirt that needs ironing I start boiling a kettle and as it reaches boiling point I take the lid off and all the steam comes up.

471
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 But because you've taken the lid off it never fully boils so the kettle is confused it thinks it's still boiling so it keeps going.

472
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 So I steam my entire shirt and it steams really quickly. You can do a whole shirt in about a minute.

473
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 I haven't done it on my shirt today.

474
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I'm looking at your shirt.

475
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 It's that time it's so crazy today.

476
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Listening at home.

477
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Damn there's one wrinkle now.

478
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Why don't we put tea bags in the kettle as it boils?

479
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 That's always confused.

480
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Someone might want coffee.

481
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Why would you put tea bags in the kettle?

482
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Because I noticed that the British love to leave in a pot tea and let it mull.

483
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 When I reckon the intense boiling that's going on would absolutely make it just the most intense tea.

484
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 You could rewrite the book on tea.

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 You could be cha-ching the sequel.

486
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 There was a famous quote by Einstein where he said that his best ever idea was to put an egg in his soup while it was cooking

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 so that his egg and his soup could cook at the same time.

488
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 See?

489
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Me and Einstein are on the same thinking level here.

490
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 You're shoving a shirt.

491
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 He's got a tea bag in it.

492
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Over it.

493
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 I'm holding it over it.

494
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 All that needs in his house is one kettle and it does everything.

495
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 If I need to make some toast, I just put it in the kettle.

496
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I don't need a hot water bottle.

497
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I just hug the kettle.

498
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

499
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 My fact this week is that butchers in ancient Egypt wore high heels.

500
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Okay.

501
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I think I'm pretty sure it's correct to say that that's the oldest example of high heels that we have.

502
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Why would they wear high heels?

503
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Because apparently it was to do with the slaughtering of the animals.

504
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 So when they were killing all the animals, they would find that the floor would be blood drenched.

505
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 They didn't want to get their feet completely stained.

506
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 So the high heels just made it a more pleasant walking process for them.

507
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 So yeah, but then people did wear high heels back then outside of butchers.

508
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 But I think butchers were known specifically.

509
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 That was the footwear of the job.

510
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Yeah, it wasn't you saw someone in heels and you went up, that's a butcher.

511
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 No, exactly.

512
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 But you might for a second think you'd make a good butcher.

513
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Because you know how to rock those heels.

514
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 And men and women wore them obviously back then.

515
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Well, I thought that they had been invented in the ninth century, right, in Persia.

516
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Yeah, I thought that as well.

517
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Which is where and the reason they were invented there, I think it might have been a separate invention,

518
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 was so that men could fire arrows while on horseback.

519
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 It was a Persian archers.

520
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And basically if you wedge your feet into these stirrups using a pair of high heels,

521
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 you can stand up in the stirrups and you can fire more steadily from there while you're riding a horse.

522
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 You know the Persians are responsible for a huge period of terrible art in Egypt.

523
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 What?

524
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Yeah, so the Persians, the Persians took over at about 525 BC or at least during 525 BC,

525
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 they were running Egypt.

526
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And so what they did was all the artists who were in Egypt, who were doing all the,

527
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 all of the caskets, all the wall art and so on, they basically deported them.

528
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 So it just left Egypt with terrible artists.

529
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And that you can see all these examples, this whole period of just bad art where people are trying to now be the artist

530
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 and they're just getting it really just slightly cartoonishly wrong.

531
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Are you sure they didn't just go there, they wanted to give the Egyptians a bad rep.

532
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 So the Persians did a whole bunch of kind of fakes really crappy drawings.

533
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Look how bad these guys are.

534
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 They also played board games, I didn't know that.

535
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And Tutankham, there's even that period, those drawings where you can just see them playing board games.

536
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Really, yeah.

537
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 What do we know what we do, we know the names of the games, we don't know the rules, they still debate the exact rules

538
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 over some of the games, but there's like shackle versus dog.

539
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 There's a game that has a name.

540
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 A shack, no.

541
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 No, no, versus artifacts.

542
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Should we do a bit on butchers before we move on?

543
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Yeah, sure.

544
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 So according to the Butchers Guild website that I was reading,

545
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 the earliest kind of butchery that they have was from a Florida sinkhole from 12,000 years ago.

546
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 And it was a butchered giant sloth.

547
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Whoa, yeah.

548
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Butchers was hanging in a little shop window somewhere in a sinkhole.

549
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 How do we know it's been actually?

550
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 I reckon they will have found bits of cutting on the bones.

551
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Wow.

552
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Because if you have a butchered carcass, you can see where they've cut deliberately to get this piece of meat away.

553
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Yeah.

554
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 But it didn't say on the website, so I'm not 100% sure.

555
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And also in that sinkhole, they found a sharpened stick and a tortoise.

556
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Do we think the tortoise was the one that butchered the sloth?

557
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 [LAUGHTER]

558
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Did you know?

559
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 I didn't realise that one of the theories about Tutankhamoon died was that he got eaten by a hippopotamus.

560
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Yeah.

561
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 That's an actual thing.

562
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 No, I don't think that is right.

563
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Well, no, no, that he got killed by it.

564
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 He got killed by it and he didn't get eaten.

565
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Because he's buried in a very unconventional way, so he's missing.

566
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 That's a hippopotamus on the end of his body.

567
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 [LAUGHTER]

568
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 No, he's missing his heart.

569
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 It looks like something's committed some kind of horrific injury to him, whereby it's consumed his heart.

570
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 They put him in jars.

571
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Unless there's something where his heart used to be saying the hippo took this.

572
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 I think he was embalmed without his heart anywhere, so usually the heart would be there.

573
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And the heart was missing.

574
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And obviously, I was completely jumped at the heart's missing.

575
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Is it a hippo?

576
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 What sort of freaky vampire hippo is this?

577
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 With surgical precision, move someone's heart.

578
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 [LAUGHTER]

579
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 So I think he's going back for more.

580
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Like the evil guy from Teppla Doom, but a hippo.

581
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 This is one of the ancient Egyptian ball games that play with hungry hungry hippos.

582
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 [LAUGHTER]

583
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Look, the source does specify a handful of Egyptologists believe this, so.

584
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 I've seen it in a bunch of places.

585
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Yeah, it's thought because hunting big animals like that was popular and there are pictures of cartoon come in doing things like that in his tomb.

586
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And he, that's a theory, guys.

587
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 It's a theory.

588
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 It's a theory.

589
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 I just have one last thing I was reading about laundry men of ancient Egypt.

590
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 They would take all the clothes from people's houses.

591
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Then they would leave little tokens that they would draw the picture of the clothes they took.

592
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Oh, leave it with you.

593
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 So it's like, we have these items.

594
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Make sure that they come back.

595
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 What do they do after all of Egypt's good artists were removed?

596
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 [LAUGHTER]

597
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 They couldn't tell which item they draw.

598
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Exactly.

599
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 But they would go down to the Nile and they would wash all their clothes.

600
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And one of the hazards of being a laundry man back in ancient Egypt was that it was likely that you were going to be eaten by a crocodile

601
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 because they hung around on the bank so much.

602
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Oh, wow.

603
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 They must have been delighted when cattle were invented.

604
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 [LAUGHTER]

605
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 You don't see any crease shirts in any hieroglyphs there.

606
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 [LAUGHTER]

607
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

608
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 My fact is that there is a fish called the Amazonian wood eating catfish.

609
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 But it is unable to digest wood.

610
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 [LAUGHTER]

611
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 OK.

612
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 It is catfish, though.

613
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 It is a catfish.

614
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Yeah, it was discovered a few years ago, about 2010.

615
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And we've known for a while that there are loads of catfish which sort of suck wood.

616
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 [LAUGHTER]

617
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 The candero.

618
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Oh, dear.

619
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 They're called suck mouth almond catfish.

620
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And they scrape wood with their teeth to get organic material off it.

621
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 And they're algae and bacteria and things that don't found clean to wood in rivers.

622
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 But this new fish, it literally eats the wood and it digests the biological material on the wood

623
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 and it living inside the wood.

624
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 And then it excretes the wood for us later.

625
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 So it has the most painful bathroom visit about twice a day, is it?

626
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Yeah.

627
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And it absorbs all the organic products and the tiny animals that live on the wood.

628
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And it has special spoon shaped teeth as well.

629
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 And it's just, I think it's amazing that this thing eats wood and then gets rid of all the wood.

630
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Apparently, it's really hard to fish for them because they don't go for bait.

631
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 But that a lot of fishing rods are made out of wood so you could hold onto them.

632
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 That's true.

633
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Throw the--

634
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 [LAUGHTER]

635
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Go in the opposite way, you're right.

636
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Do you know how you do catch them?

637
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 You listen out for them because they make this rasping noise which is them going on the wood that they're eating.

638
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Yeah. But this is the weird thing. We can't digest wood.

639
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 But I think the reason for this, I might be wrong about this, but I think it is that we don't have organisms in our gut

640
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 which produce the enzyme cellulase, right?

641
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So wood pulp is cellulose.

642
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 And if you have the enzyme cellulase, you can digest it.

643
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Yeah.

644
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 So my question is if we did inject somebody with those organisms which do produce cellulase,

645
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 would we be able to digest trees?

646
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 In other words, you'd be able to do it just in like a probiotic. You wouldn't have to inject it into anyone.

647
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Hey, why have we done this?

648
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 I bet you've got-- you know those grows looking smoothies, you sometimes be in the office.

649
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 I bet there's cellulase in one of those. Try chewing on a twig after that.

650
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 I think really you could do, but actually it's easier to get the calories out of a cream cake

651
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 than it is to get it out of a stick even if you do have cellulase.

652
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Yeah, I'm sure.

653
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Is there any species of tree that we do eat?

654
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 I know broccoli is not a tree, but it kind of looks like one.

655
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 No, but we did use to eat bark.

656
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Well, our ancestors used to eat bark. So they discovered this quite recently.

657
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 So it could rillers and also chimp sometimes chew on bark.

658
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Like I said, are really far back ancestors.

659
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Super far, before humans were actually a thing.

660
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 It was another hominid.

661
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 I think it was the astralopithecus sediba, which is a two-million-year-old ancestor of humans.

662
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 And they recently found some with bark stuck in its teeth.

663
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And so yeah, we used to chew on that.

664
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 This is another Tutankhamun hippohart mystery.

665
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 That sounds more like they invented the toothpick.

666
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Yeah.

667
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 What a brilliant rival theory.

668
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 You should write to the archaeologists.

669
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Some tribes might use sticks for cleaning their teeth, wouldn't they?

670
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 I think they have things you can chew on.

671
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Yeah.

672
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Isn't cinnamon made out of bark?

673
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Cinnamon sticks.

674
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Don't we get aspirin from powdered bark?

675
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Do we?

676
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Originally, yeah.

677
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 So we're eating a lot more wood than we realise.

678
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I like, you know, ants can't, most ants can't really digest solid food

679
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 because they've got that really tiny waste.

680
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 They've got like smaller waste than Marilyn Monroe.

681
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 So they have to liquefied their food before they digest it.

682
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 I don't know any of that.

683
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 What?

684
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Ants can't digest lumps of food because...

685
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 No, I can imagine they can't eat like a doughnut because it's bigger than that one.

686
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 But are you saying they can't have any kind of solid soil?

687
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 They liquefy it.

688
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 And the way that they liquefy it is they feed it to their lava first.

689
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 So their lava can digest solid food, can eat solid food.

690
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 So what ants do is they have the lava and they will put it into their lava's mouths.

691
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And the lava will eat this food and their stomachs or their bodies will release the enzymes

692
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 required to break it down into a more palatable smoothie-type form.

693
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And then they'll regurgitate it and give it to their parents.

694
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 So they're using the lava like a blender?

695
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Yeah.

696
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And also, and also like a plate because some of the lava,

697
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 they don't, the lava don't even eat it.

698
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Some of the lava just secrete the enzymes onto the top of their stomachs.

699
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 So the worker ants come back with solid food, drops the bit of food onto the lava's stomach.

700
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 The lava knows it just has to lie there, let it digest, then the ant comes back a bit later

701
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 and eats it off the lava's stomach.

702
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 Catfish stuff?

703
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Yeah.

704
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 So catfish can, they can hunt in the dark by detecting the changes in acidity in water

705
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 because their whiskers have got this special kind of sensor for acid.

706
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 So you can tell if something's a bit more acid or a bit less acid

707
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 and they can find things using that.

708
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Just one more thing on a really cool species of wood eating creature

709
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 that's also underwater is a crab.

710
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 So there's this kind of crab which the only thing it can eat is wood

711
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 and yet it lives at the bottom of the ocean so it can live up to 1.5 kilometres underwater

712
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 right in the ocean.

713
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Are there not many trees?

714
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Not a lot of trees at all.

715
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 So there is nothing in its habitat that grows that it can possibly eat

716
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 and it has to rely on wood falling into the water.

717
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Yeah, I mean, that is, yeah, it is a matter that you grow up in an environment

718
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 where there's nothing for you to eat.

719
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 I imagine how annoying that would be.

720
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 So they have to literally just wait for trunks to find their way

721
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 and then suddenly that's their meal as a community for the next.

722
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Yeah.

723
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 And often trees break down as they get further and further to sea

724
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 so you'll get little scraps of wood.

725
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Or a shipwreck.

726
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Yeah.

727
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Some of them do live on shipwrecks.

728
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Yeah.

729
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 All of that must be bliss when a huge shipwreck.

730
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Titanic was the best moment in their history.

731
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Not really made out of that.

732
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 There's an upside down catfish.

733
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 What?

734
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 It's found in central Congo and they're notable because they swim upside down

735
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 because they feed on insects on the surface of the water.

736
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 So they kind of just kind of backstroke their way through and just wrap them off the surface.

737
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 And there are even ancient Egyptian paintings of them upside down.

738
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 But now I think maybe it's just a battle drum.

739
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Yeah.

740
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 My help catfish.

741
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Okay, that's it.

742
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 That's all of our facts.
