00:00:12,00:00:16,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:16,00:00:20,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:20,00:00:24,"My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Aniches Zinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:24,00:00:28,"and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:28,00:00:32,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in a particular order,"
00:00:32,00:00:36,"here we go, starting with you, Chuzinsky."
00:00:36,00:00:40,"My fact this week is that the reason Merlin isn't called ""Murden"""
00:00:40,00:00:44,is to avoid confusion with a 12th century word for feces.
00:00:44,00:00:46,That's amazing.
00:00:46,00:00:50,"Yeah, so the wizard Merlin of ""Sword in the Stone"" fame,"
00:00:50,00:00:52,"he would have been called ""Murden"""
00:00:52,00:00:56,and so the story is that Merlin was originally created in the form we know him
00:00:56,00:01:00,"by Jeffrey of Monmouth, who was sort of"
00:01:00,00:01:04,a Norman Welsh guy in the 12th century.
00:01:04,00:01:08,"And he based the character of Merlin on this Welsh medieval mythical figure called ""Murden"""
00:01:08,00:01:12,"M-Y-R-D-I-N. But because he has sort of Norman origins,"
00:01:12,00:01:16,"because he was from the Nebility probably, and so a lot of people were speaking French"
00:01:16,00:01:18,"in his social circles,"
00:01:18,00:01:20,"it was thought that Merlin would be really easily confused with Merlin,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,"which is the same as it is today,"
00:01:22,00:01:26,which is the word for pooh.
00:01:26,00:01:30,"It feels like he's missed a chance for a lot of puns and poo jokes, doesn't it?"
00:01:30,00:01:34,"By changing that name, he's lost a lot of his joke material."
00:01:34,00:01:38,"Yes, he could have been the chalcer of his time."
00:01:38,00:01:40,I just don't know if that was the style he was going for.
00:01:40,00:01:44,"Okay, do you know that in the 17th century the word ""Murden"" was English?"
00:01:44,00:01:46,"Yes, really!"
00:01:46,00:01:48,"It was just a common English word for pooh ""Murden"""
00:01:48,00:01:50,and then it just kind of disappeared in the 18th century.
00:01:50,00:01:54,And now it's kind of everyone knows it's just a French word.
00:01:54,00:01:58,"Speaking of people, his name's meant feces."
00:01:58,00:02:06,Montezuma of the Aztecs had an nephew whose name meant plenty of excrement.
00:02:06,00:02:08,What was his name?
00:02:08,00:02:10,It was cuida chwac.
00:02:10,00:02:16,"They had guacamole, didn't they, which means testicle sauce."
00:02:16,00:02:20,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:20,00:02:22,An avocado means testicles as well.
00:02:22,00:02:24,"Exactly, yes."
00:02:24,00:02:26,"Are the things that mean testicles, orchid?"
00:02:26,00:02:28,"Yes, yeah."
00:02:28,00:02:32,"I have another Merlin fact, probably my favorite Merlin fact."
00:02:32,00:02:36,He was sorted into a house at Hogwarts.
00:02:36,00:02:38,Neither of these things is real.
00:02:38,00:02:42,"Exactly, I thought someone might pick me up on this, but neither of these things are real."
00:02:42,00:02:46,"The big JK Rowling website, it was revealed that Merlin was a student of the school of Hogwarts."
00:02:46,00:02:48,And he was sorted into one of the four schools.
00:02:48,00:02:50,And he was sorted into Slytherin.
00:02:50,00:02:52,So Merlin is a Slytherin.
00:02:52,00:02:54,Wow.
00:02:54,00:02:56,This is weird because you said yesterday that you'd found an amazing thing on Merlin that you love.
00:02:56,00:02:58,"It's the best thing I've ever found, yeah."
00:02:58,00:03:00,"Well, so I was reading about him later on."
00:03:00,00:03:02,"And I found something and I thought, I bet this is what Dan's found."
00:03:02,00:03:04,It's so interesting.
00:03:04,00:03:06,And this really shows how disconnected you and I are.
00:03:06,00:03:16,The thing I thought is that he's so Merlin in the original myth is a ledge to have been buried in this particular place.
00:03:16,00:03:18,That's sort of a crossover between two rivers.
00:03:18,00:03:22,So the river Tweed and a little stream called Palsail Burn.
00:03:22,00:03:34,"And in the legends, it was written that if ever the Palsail Burn and the Tweed were to meet at the place of Merlin's final resting place,"
00:03:34,00:03:39,"these two rivers were to suddenly collide, then England and Scotland would have the same monarch."
00:03:39,00:03:42,And this prediction is in medieval text.
00:03:42,00:03:49,"And on the exact day that James the 6th of Scotland and James the 1st of England was crowned in 1603,"
00:03:49,00:03:56,the banks of the River Tweed broke and it flooded into the Palsail Burn and they met.
00:03:56,00:03:57,No.
00:03:57,00:03:58,Isn't that weird?
00:03:58,00:04:00,I smell PR happening.
00:04:00,00:04:02,Yeah.
00:04:02,00:04:05,It might be that I didn't check it off in the banks broken.
00:04:05,00:04:07,It might be that they just broke every single winter.
00:04:07,00:04:12,But I definitely know they broke in 1603 on that precise day according to whom.
00:04:12,00:04:15,The 17th century Malcolm tucking character.
00:04:15,00:04:21,"Speaking of PR though, I was talking to Greg Jenner and Greg Jenner, who's been on our show a number of times."
00:04:21,00:04:22,Historian.
00:04:22,00:04:25,"Historian, Horrible History's official chief nerd."
00:04:25,00:04:27,And he was telling me about a publicity stunt as well.
00:04:27,00:04:33,"So this was back in the 12th century, the Glastonbury Abbey Burn Down and all the pilgrims stopped going to it."
00:04:33,00:04:39,So it was soon after that that the abbot found the body of King Arthur in his grave.
00:04:39,00:04:42,And suddenly all the pilgrims started returning on mass.
00:04:42,00:04:46,And so Greg was saying that this is one of the earliest examples of a publicity stunt
00:04:46,00:04:48,where they just needed people to return.
00:04:48,00:04:50,So King Arthur is one of the original publicity stunt.
00:04:50,00:04:55,"Yeah, I think what happened was it burnt down and they were like to Henry the 2nd Oak and we have some more money to build out."
00:04:55,00:05:01,"So we don't have any, but maybe just maybe if you look closely, you might be able to find the body of King Arthur."
00:05:01,00:05:05,"And they went, okay, we'll have a lock and sure enough the very next day they found it."
00:05:05,00:05:06,Wow.
00:05:06,00:05:07,What a weird coincidence.
00:05:07,00:05:08,It's amazing.
00:05:08,00:05:09,It's such a short time as well.
00:05:09,00:05:10,Incredible.
00:05:10,00:05:12,"Okay, so this is something that I thought you would like down."
00:05:12,00:05:17,"So the Holy Grail, which is kind of an Arthurian legend as well."
00:05:17,00:05:23,It's based probably on an adaptation of an old Welsh story about the cauldron of Anwin.
00:05:23,00:05:24,Okay.
00:05:24,00:05:27,Which was owned by a guy called Bran the Blessed.
00:05:27,00:05:28,No.
00:05:28,00:05:29,Yeah.
00:05:29,00:05:32,"And if he was a giant, a Welsh giant called Bran the Blessed."
00:05:32,00:05:33,Wow.
00:05:33,00:05:37,"And if you go into his Wikipedia page, it says, ""Do not confuse him with Brian Blessed."""
00:05:37,00:05:39,It's amazing.
00:05:39,00:05:41,You can understand why you would.
00:05:41,00:05:42,Yeah.
00:05:42,00:05:43,That's incredible.
00:05:43,00:05:44,Do we know any more about him or is it just that?
00:05:44,00:05:47,"Well, the soul saw his Wikipedia page, but I didn't read any of it."
00:05:47,00:05:49,"And he was real, was he?"
00:05:49,00:05:50,"No, he was a giant."
00:05:50,00:05:51,Oh my god.
00:05:51,00:05:53,But then is Brian Blessed real?
00:05:53,00:05:54,It's the point I'm making.
00:05:54,00:05:55,Who appears more real?
00:05:55,00:05:59,"Also, do you know what the name of the sword and the stone was?"
00:05:59,00:06:03,I'm going to say Excalibur and you're looking at me like it's wrong.
00:06:03,00:06:04,"It's wrong, I'm afraid."
00:06:04,00:06:09,"According to Mallory and according to basically everyone, the sword and the stone doesn't have a name."
00:06:09,00:06:10,And then Arthur loses it.
00:06:10,00:06:14,"And then he gets his Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake, which is a different sword."
00:06:14,00:06:15,Okay.
00:06:15,00:06:18,Who eventually traps Merlin for all of eternity.
00:06:18,00:06:20,That's how Merlin meets his demise.
00:06:20,00:06:21,It was stone.
00:06:21,00:06:22,"In some stone as well, right?"
00:06:22,00:06:23,Yeah.
00:06:23,00:06:24,Everything's always been stuck in stone in these days.
00:06:24,00:06:27,"Yeah, they didn't have carbon fiber, they didn't have plastics."
00:06:27,00:06:29,They had to use what they had basically.
00:06:29,00:06:30,Yeah.
00:06:30,00:06:31,All the hell was stone.
00:06:31,00:06:33,"Actually, just on Arthurian legend."
00:06:33,00:06:34,Yeah.
00:06:34,00:06:36,"I think, I don't know if Andy will know this, but I had no idea about this."
00:06:36,00:06:37,I thought it was really interesting.
00:06:37,00:06:42,So Arthurian legends are referred to as the matter of Britain.
00:06:42,00:06:46,"So this is this whole body of medieval literature, which is called the matter of Britain."
00:06:46,00:06:48,And there are three matters in medieval times.
00:06:48,00:06:51,"There's the matter of Britain, the matter of France, and the matter of Rome."
00:06:51,00:06:53,And these are just the three big bits of literature.
00:06:53,00:06:59,"So matter of Britain's Arthur, the matter of France is the stories of Charlemagne."
00:06:59,00:07:02,And the matter of Rome is like all-awesome Roman ancient literature.
00:07:02,00:07:04,So the matter of Rome is absolutely winning.
00:07:04,00:07:08,And the guy who named these was a French poet who was called Baudel.
00:07:08,00:07:10,"And I was thinking when I was reading this, oh, cool."
00:07:10,00:07:13,We are one of the three great tripods of medieval literature.
00:07:13,00:07:16,And his description of them was that France is character.
00:07:16,00:07:20,The matter of France is characterised by voire or truth.
00:07:20,00:07:24,Rome is characterised by sage-ness or wisdom or knowledge.
00:07:24,00:07:29,"And the matter of Britain is characterised by being vain et pleson,"
00:07:29,00:07:32,"to mean frivolous, pleasant, but completely false."
00:07:32,00:07:37,"Funny you say wise, because that's where the word wizard comes from."
00:07:37,00:07:38,Is it?
00:07:38,00:07:40,The wizard part comes from wise.
00:07:40,00:07:43,"And I think the idea was that maybe in the olden days,"
00:07:43,00:07:47,"wise people could see the future, I think that might be okay."
00:07:47,00:07:49,Can I quickly talk about modern day wizards?
00:07:49,00:07:50,Yeah.
00:07:50,00:07:55,"Okay, so pagans and druids, those are the sort of modern day torch holders"
00:07:55,00:07:57,"of the whole wizarding world, I would say."
00:07:57,00:08:00,"And interesting news in the world of pagan news,"
00:08:00,00:08:03,"which is that now pagans, there's about a million in the UK,"
00:08:03,00:08:05,300 of whom are in prison.
00:08:05,00:08:10,"Prisoned pagans, prisoned wizards are now allowed to have a wand in jail."
00:08:10,00:08:12,That's a new ruling that's just been made.
00:08:12,00:08:15,Because it's respecting their religious beliefs.
00:08:15,00:08:18,So what they have to do is they can go into the yard and get some twigs
00:08:18,00:08:19,and bring them back.
00:08:19,00:08:22,And then they kind of just pimp up the twigs a bit.
00:08:22,00:08:24,And then that's their wand that they're allowed to have.
00:08:24,00:08:30,I think I might start a new religion which has a skeleton key as a holy symbol.
00:08:30,00:08:33,This article says they've toned down all of the rituals
00:08:33,00:08:37,because what they're also in theory should be having is a flaming torch with them
00:08:37,00:08:39,as part of the religion.
00:08:39,00:08:42,And we're cool to let the flaming torch bit go if we can have the twigs.
00:08:42,00:08:43,How many wizards are in prison?
00:08:43,00:08:44,300.
00:08:44,00:08:45,300?
00:08:45,00:08:46,Are they all in the same--
00:08:46,00:08:47,"No, it's not as good."
00:08:47,00:08:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:49,00:08:53,I don't actually think it does show respects for their religion.
00:08:53,00:08:56,Because what basically you're saying when you tell wizards that they're allowed
00:08:56,00:09:00,to have their wand in prison is that you definitely don't believe
00:09:00,00:09:02,their wand has any capacity to help them.
00:09:02,00:09:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:05,00:09:07,"I have one last thing which is about modern day wizards,"
00:09:07,00:09:12,which is there is a school in California which is open and has been open for 10 years.
00:09:12,00:09:14,It's the world's only registered wizard academy.
00:09:14,00:09:17,It's got 735 students.
00:09:17,00:09:20,Half of whom will be in prison at 10 years.
00:09:20,00:09:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:22,00:09:26,And it was set up by a guy called Oberon-Zell Ravenhart
00:09:26,00:09:28,and he himself is a wizard.
00:09:28,00:09:29,But the school is up and running.
00:09:29,00:09:30,You can go to their website.
00:09:30,00:09:33,They have like latest news is that the school is now.
00:09:33,00:09:34,It's called the Grey School of Wizardry.
00:09:34,00:09:37,They're now on second life so you can attend it on second life as well.
00:09:37,00:09:39,They have a list of their staff.
00:09:39,00:09:43,"It includes people called Silver Main, Swift Rabbit, Frogs Dancing, Earth Drum,"
00:09:43,00:09:46,"MA, Apollionus, BS, MS, PhD."
00:09:46,00:09:47,BS is a bit odd.
00:09:47,00:09:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:48,00:09:49,And Silver Lock.
00:09:49,00:09:51,"And so yeah, you can--"
00:09:51,00:09:54,"Well, these people just they started out as accountants or postmen"
00:09:54,00:09:57,and they got so much mockery for their names that they ended up being forced
00:09:57,00:09:59,"into the wizarding profession, do you think?"
00:09:59,00:10:00,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:10:00,00:10:01,I don't know who does it.
00:10:01,00:10:05,And one more modern wizard who's great is the Real King Arthur.
00:10:05,00:10:06,Who's back?
00:10:06,00:10:09,This is a guy he was formally called John Rothwell before he realised
00:10:09,00:10:11,that he was King Arthur a few years ago.
00:10:11,00:10:14,He's the battle chief-ton of the council of British Truid orders.
00:10:14,00:10:16,There's quite a good interview with him in Vice.
00:10:16,00:10:21,And the Vice Guy asked him things like how hard was it to pull the sword from the stone
00:10:21,00:10:24,"to which he answered very, very, very hard."
00:10:24,00:10:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:26,00:10:27,So that was legit.
00:10:27,00:10:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:28,00:10:31,They tried to trick him with that trick question.
00:10:31,00:10:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:32,00:10:33,What he got it straight away?
00:10:33,00:10:34,Not today.
00:10:34,00:10:35,"Hang on, hang on."
00:10:35,00:10:38,The whole point of the sword in the stone was that it comes out easily
00:10:38,00:10:40,if you're the King of England.
00:10:40,00:10:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:41,00:10:43,They did trick him.
00:10:43,00:10:46,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:10:46,00:10:49,"OK, and it's time to move on to fact number two."
00:10:49,00:10:50,And that is James.
00:10:50,00:10:54,"OK, my fact this week is that tea leaves sometimes flow upstream"
00:10:54,00:10:56,from the cup to the pot.
00:10:56,00:10:57,I don't believe it.
00:10:57,00:11:00,"If I was ever going to call nonsense on anything, never mind King Arthur, you agree."
00:11:00,00:11:01,I can't hate it.
00:11:01,00:11:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:02,00:11:03,This sounds amazing.
00:11:03,00:11:04,It is incredible.
00:11:04,00:11:10,It was discovered by a guy called Sebastian Bianchini in 2008.
00:11:10,00:11:12,He was at the University of Havana.
00:11:12,00:11:16,And he was pouring hot water from a pot which was just water
00:11:16,00:11:20,"into a cup which had some tea leaves, some matte tea leaves."
00:11:20,00:11:22,"And as he poured it, he had his nice cup of tea."
00:11:22,00:11:23,And then he looked in the pot.
00:11:23,00:11:24,And there were tea leaves there.
00:11:24,00:11:25,And he didn't understand why.
00:11:25,00:11:28,And he went to a physicist at the University of Havana.
00:11:28,00:11:30,And they kind of did some experiments.
00:11:30,00:11:33,"But then they kind of, they never published a findings"
00:11:33,00:11:35,because they thought everyone would laugh at them.
00:11:35,00:11:37,But it seems true.
00:11:37,00:11:38,It seems like it's a real thing.
00:11:38,00:11:39,Oh my God.
00:11:39,00:11:42,This is one of those things that you could actually demonstrate.
00:11:42,00:11:43,"Like, you could just demonstrate."
00:11:43,00:11:44,Why would people laugh?
00:11:44,00:11:46,But they think probably it was a trick.
00:11:46,00:11:48,And he had some tea leaves in there all along.
00:11:48,00:11:49,It's like a darren brown style.
00:11:49,00:11:51,You'd never be able to make any tea.
00:11:51,00:11:55,The leaves would constantly be fleeing into the pot.
00:11:55,00:11:56,So it's not all of them.
00:11:56,00:11:57,It's some of them.
00:11:57,00:12:00,"And it's due to this thing called the Marringoni Effect,"
00:12:00,00:12:02,which is a mixture of surface tension
00:12:02,00:12:04,and a little bit of capillary action.
00:12:04,00:12:08,And surface tension basically we're talking about pure water
00:12:08,00:12:09,and not pure water.
00:12:09,00:12:14,And the particles want to travel up towards a pure water.
00:12:14,00:12:16,And people didn't think it could happen with something
00:12:16,00:12:19,"as big as tea leaves, but actually it can happen."
00:12:19,00:12:21,"And yeah, how big of a leaf are we talking?"
00:12:21,00:12:23,We're talking this stuff is called matati.
00:12:23,00:12:25,"And it's usually like little,"
00:12:25,00:12:28,"they're almost like little bits of sawdust, aren't they?"
00:12:28,00:12:29,"Yeah, it's really small."
00:12:29,00:12:30,It's very crumbly.
00:12:30,00:12:31,Smaller than normal tea leaves.
00:12:31,00:12:32,Wow.
00:12:32,00:12:33,Yeah.
00:12:33,00:12:36,"But actually when things run quite small scale,"
00:12:36,00:12:40,they can do things that don't normally happen for bigger things.
00:12:40,00:12:43,"So like, for instance, capillary action only really works"
00:12:43,00:12:45,"for really small kind of thin tubes,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,which is that water goes up the tube against gravity.
00:12:48,00:12:50,"And that wouldn't happen on normal tube,"
00:12:50,00:12:51,but it happens with very thin tubes.
00:12:51,00:12:54,And that's how plants can get the water from the ground
00:12:54,00:12:55,into their leaves.
00:12:55,00:12:56,Yeah.
00:12:56,00:12:57,Okay.
00:12:57,00:12:58,"Did you read the guy who commented,"
00:12:58,00:13:00,someone who commented at the bottom of this study?
00:13:00,00:13:01,"And he said,"
00:13:01,00:13:04,"""This article reminded me of when I once made the mistake"
00:13:04,00:13:06,of expectorating into a toilet.
00:13:06,00:13:08,"And the result was an immediate,"
00:13:08,00:13:09,accurate taste in my mouth.
00:13:09,00:13:11,Apparently the chemicals in there had traveled several feet
00:13:11,00:13:13,up my stream of saliva.
00:13:13,00:13:15,But that was a theory then.
00:13:15,00:13:16,Reliably disgusting.
00:13:16,00:13:17,It is quite disgusting.
00:13:17,00:13:20,"But the scientist acknowledged that that could be a possibility,"
00:13:20,00:13:22,although it said it might be quite unlikely that chemicals
00:13:22,00:13:24,"could flow that way backwards."""
00:13:24,00:13:27,"So are we saying that when you go to the Lou in some ways,"
00:13:27,00:13:29,the Lou goes to you?
00:13:29,00:13:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:30,00:13:32,"I mean, it's not very much."
00:13:32,00:13:34,It's not all of it.
00:13:34,00:13:36,It's not like you come out of the toilet.
00:13:36,00:13:38,The toilet is completely empty of water.
00:13:38,00:13:41,I'm so bloated out of that.
00:13:41,00:13:45,"Well, isn't there that thing that all men are scared of,"
00:13:45,00:13:48,"that Amazonian fish, where the room has always been."
00:13:48,00:13:50,But it will swim up your urine stream.
00:13:50,00:13:52,"We should quickly explain that, shouldn't we?"
00:13:52,00:13:53,It's a canteroo.
00:13:53,00:13:55,It's like a mini little catfish.
00:13:55,00:13:56,I think it's in the catfish family.
00:13:56,00:13:57,Yes.
00:13:57,00:14:00,And the theory is you would be in the water and you'd be urinating.
00:14:00,00:14:04,And it gets attracted to the urine stream.
00:14:04,00:14:07,And then it follows it and then goes into your penis
00:14:07,00:14:10,and sticks its spines out and gets stuck there
00:14:10,00:14:12,and can be extremely painful.
00:14:12,00:14:15,And there's been one or two stories in the medical literature
00:14:15,00:14:16,of it happening.
00:14:16,00:14:18,But most people think probably it's not true.
00:14:18,00:14:20,Yeah. And I have to say you say a little fish.
00:14:20,00:14:22,I've seen one in the Natural History Museum.
00:14:22,00:14:23,That's not a little fish.
00:14:23,00:14:24,That is.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Remember when we went to?
00:14:25,00:14:26,Yeah.
00:14:26,00:14:27,"Yeah. That was, I mean, no, but that's big."
00:14:27,00:14:28,"Like, it's not like a..."
00:14:28,00:14:29,"No, it wasn't."
00:14:29,00:14:31,You know that whale in the front lobby.
00:14:31,00:14:32,Yeah.
00:14:32,00:14:33,It wasn't that one.
00:14:33,00:14:35,Okay. Then I miss red label.
00:14:35,00:14:36,But it's about an inch out to you.
00:14:36,00:14:37,Yeah.
00:14:37,00:14:40,"I know, but still, the idea of that going A up a stream,"
00:14:40,00:14:42,"you know, it's not..."
00:14:42,00:14:44,It's like a teapot stream urine.
00:14:44,00:14:45,It's not a fixed...
00:14:45,00:14:47,"Well, mine's not like a pig."
00:14:47,00:14:50,This was apparently the only means of preventing it
00:14:50,00:14:52,according to one piece of 19th century medical literature
00:14:52,00:14:54,because this room has been around for about 200 years
00:14:54,00:14:55,that they'll do this.
00:14:55,00:14:58,The only means of preventing it from reaching your bladder
00:14:58,00:15:00,where it causes inflammation and ultimately death
00:15:00,00:15:02,is to instantly amputate the penis.
00:15:02,00:15:04,This isn't when you get your visa to go to the Amazon
00:15:04,00:15:06,and you have to have it done as it prevented it.
00:15:06,00:15:07,Yeah.
00:15:07,00:15:09,Yeah.
00:15:09,00:15:11,Just a shot in your arm.
00:15:11,00:15:14,And let's just get that off show.
00:15:14,00:15:17,I'm pretty sure that this has completely been debunked
00:15:17,00:15:18,as an idea.
00:15:18,00:15:19,The candero.
00:15:19,00:15:23,"Going from you standing on the bank, having a pit."
00:15:23,00:15:25,"So the idea is it could, let's say,"
00:15:25,00:15:27,it could possibly happen while you're bathing.
00:15:27,00:15:28,Exactly.
00:15:28,00:15:31,"Perhaps, and it just follows the warmth of the water or whatever."
00:15:31,00:15:34,But the idea that you're standing on the side of a river
00:15:34,00:15:38,peeing down and then it jumps like a sovereignty of penis.
00:15:38,00:15:39,Yeah.
00:15:39,00:15:41,I'm pretty sure that got that out.
00:15:41,00:15:45,I was reading about the first ever book written about tea.
00:15:45,00:15:48,It's an old Chinese text and it's the first ever collection
00:15:48,00:15:49,of a book on tea.
00:15:49,00:15:51,It's called Cha-ching.
00:15:51,00:15:53,No.
00:15:53,00:15:57,"Cha, the Chinese word, and Qing, which I actually don't know"
00:15:57,00:15:58,what that word is.
00:15:58,00:16:00,"But the eye Qing is a fortune telling book, isn't it?"
00:16:00,00:16:01,Yes.
00:16:01,00:16:04,"Oh yeah, maybe it was fortune telling through T-Lews book."
00:16:04,00:16:07,"You know, India, what the mythology of how tea came about in India is."
00:16:07,00:16:08,What?
00:16:08,00:16:11,Did it get found by a goat herd or is that coffee maybe?
00:16:11,00:16:12,No.
00:16:12,00:16:17,"So it was about 1,900 years ago and it was a priest named Bodhidhama."
00:16:17,00:16:22,And he was trying to connect with Zen Buddhism and the idea
00:16:22,00:16:25,that he was going to do that was seven-year sleepless contemplation
00:16:25,00:16:26,of Buddha.
00:16:26,00:16:29,"He found himself in the fifth year, again quite drowsy."
00:16:29,00:16:31,And needed to cure that.
00:16:31,00:16:34,And so he quickly grabbed some leaves off a tree and started chewing them.
00:16:34,00:16:36,And then he thought it was fantastic.
00:16:36,00:16:38,And that just got him through that extra two years.
00:16:38,00:16:41,He really put them up for that final push.
00:16:41,00:16:46,"And in China, they have an idea that it was an emperor called Nanshen,"
00:16:46,00:16:49,"who was, as well as being the emperor, he's a scholar and herbalist."
00:16:49,00:16:54,"And while he was out in the field on maybe I guess a walk or something,"
00:16:54,00:16:58,he was having a hot cup of water and some leaves blew into his cup.
00:16:58,00:16:59,And he spelt it away.
00:16:59,00:17:00,That smells quite nice.
00:17:00,00:17:01,I love it.
00:17:01,00:17:02,It's so interesting.
00:17:02,00:17:07,Pretty much everything has an origin myth where it's discovered by...
00:17:07,00:17:09,"It's widespread, isn't it?"
00:17:09,00:17:12,Which just seems to be the humans have this innate preference
00:17:12,00:17:15,for that kind of discovery rather than someone who really knew what they were doing
00:17:15,00:17:18,and had studied the field and were working really hard on it for years.
00:17:18,00:17:21,Because we all want to believe that we could do it.
00:17:21,00:17:26,"So the British introduced tea to India, which sounds lunatic."
00:17:26,00:17:29,Or rather popularized it in India.
00:17:29,00:17:31,So it was already native.
00:17:31,00:17:34,But it was not a thing that was grown in large quantities though.
00:17:34,00:17:35,It wasn't big.
00:17:35,00:17:40,But then in the 19th century Britain needed an alternative to the Chinese tea monopoly.
00:17:40,00:17:44,And so that's why India is now this great tea nation.
00:17:44,00:17:47,Because we got it in the 17th century I think.
00:17:47,00:17:49,Was it Charles II's wife?
00:17:49,00:17:52,I think came over and brought tea.
00:17:52,00:17:55,And then everyone thought it was like this terrible...
00:17:55,00:17:57,So there's a lot of misogyny and xenophobia.
00:17:57,00:17:59,Basically it was a foreign thing that women drank.
00:17:59,00:18:07,And also it gave women a reason for getting together and men obviously thought that was a terrible idea.
00:18:07,00:18:10,It's the Lamborghini of its day basically.
00:18:10,00:18:13,Lamborghini was discovered actually when...
00:18:13,00:18:19,That was walking across a field with some carbonated water.
00:18:19,00:18:22,And a passing bird dropped and brought something great into it.
00:18:22,00:18:26,So can I just bring it back to your main headline fact for a second?
00:18:26,00:18:28,So you haven't seen a video of this being done.
00:18:28,00:18:29,No.
00:18:29,00:18:30,I couldn't find one.
00:18:30,00:18:31,Surely we should be doing that.
00:18:31,00:18:34,We should be filming that or getting someone listening to like let's see this.
00:18:34,00:18:35,Let's see...
00:18:35,00:18:37,Okay so it's specifically Matati.
00:18:37,00:18:38,Yeah.
00:18:38,00:18:40,Which is this South American tea which is...
00:18:40,00:18:42,It's quite a big thing over there isn't it?
00:18:42,00:18:43,You've been to America.
00:18:43,00:18:46,Yeah and I've got a few friends who live there and it's pretty much all they do.
00:18:46,00:18:48,I'm amazed they get any work done there.
00:18:48,00:18:55,But yeah there's a really strict ritual around Matati which is that the way you drink it is you fill up a kettle of boiling water
00:18:55,00:18:59,and then you pour it onto all these hubs and you keep on topping it up and up.
00:18:59,00:19:06,So you can keep drinking your one Matati for hours but two very important things you have to do and people get extremely angry if you don't do them.
00:19:06,00:19:09,When it's usually you hand it around so it's a real sociable thing.
00:19:09,00:19:12,It's a very much a community thing drinking Matati.
00:19:12,00:19:17,And when you hand it to someone you have to look them in the eye because that's part of your saying I'm giving this to you.
00:19:17,00:19:20,And you have to give it to them with a straw pointing towards them.
00:19:20,00:19:22,So it comes with this metal straw.
00:19:22,00:19:27,And if you don't give it to them with a straw pointing you are kicked out of the country.
00:19:27,00:19:31,No it sounds like it's from bitter experience.
00:19:31,00:19:33,Just on tea.
00:19:33,00:19:36,So I think a lot of people think that you shouldn't re-boil a kettle.
00:19:36,00:19:42,If you boil the water once you should use that to make tea and then the water is sort of no good for making tea after that.
00:19:42,00:19:47,And if you re-boil it is bad. And the theory is that all the oxygen leaches out of the water.
00:19:47,00:19:52,But the thing is when you boil a kettle it leaches off the first time you boil a kettle.
00:19:52,00:19:57,So whenever you make a tea you don't have a choice you have to make it without all that lovely bonus oxype.
00:19:57,00:19:59,Do you know what I do now?
00:19:59,00:20:06,If I have a shirt that needs ironing I start boiling a kettle and as it reaches boiling point I take the lid off and all the steam comes up.
00:20:06,00:20:11,But because you've taken the lid off it never fully boils so the kettle is confused it thinks it's still boiling so it keeps going.
00:20:11,00:20:16,So I steam my entire shirt and it steams really quickly. You can do a whole shirt in about a minute.
00:20:16,00:20:18,I haven't done it on my shirt today.
00:20:18,00:20:20,I'm looking at your shirt.
00:20:20,00:20:22,It's that time it's so crazy today.
00:20:22,00:20:24,Listening at home.
00:20:24,00:20:27,Damn there's one wrinkle now.
00:20:27,00:20:31,Why don't we put tea bags in the kettle as it boils?
00:20:31,00:20:33,That's always confused.
00:20:33,00:20:36,Someone might want coffee.
00:20:36,00:20:38,Why would you put tea bags in the kettle?
00:20:38,00:20:43,Because I noticed that the British love to leave in a pot tea and let it mull.
00:20:43,00:20:48,When I reckon the intense boiling that's going on would absolutely make it just the most intense tea.
00:20:48,00:20:50,You could rewrite the book on tea.
00:20:50,00:20:53,You could be cha-ching the sequel.
00:20:53,00:21:02,There was a famous quote by Einstein where he said that his best ever idea was to put an egg in his soup while it was cooking
00:21:02,00:21:05,so that his egg and his soup could cook at the same time.
00:21:05,00:21:06,See?
00:21:06,00:21:09,Me and Einstein are on the same thinking level here.
00:21:09,00:21:11,You're shoving a shirt.
00:21:11,00:21:13,He's got a tea bag in it.
00:21:13,00:21:14,Over it.
00:21:14,00:21:15,I'm holding it over it.
00:21:15,00:21:20,All that needs in his house is one kettle and it does everything.
00:21:20,00:21:24,"If I need to make some toast, I just put it in the kettle."
00:21:24,00:21:26,I don't need a hot water bottle.
00:21:26,00:21:28,I just hug the kettle.
00:21:28,00:21:36,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact."
00:21:36,00:21:42,My fact this week is that butchers in ancient Egypt wore high heels.
00:21:42,00:21:43,Okay.
00:21:43,00:21:50,I think I'm pretty sure it's correct to say that that's the oldest example of high heels that we have.
00:21:50,00:21:52,Why would they wear high heels?
00:21:52,00:21:56,Because apparently it was to do with the slaughtering of the animals.
00:21:56,00:22:01,"So when they were killing all the animals, they would find that the floor would be blood drenched."
00:22:01,00:22:03,They didn't want to get their feet completely stained.
00:22:03,00:22:08,So the high heels just made it a more pleasant walking process for them.
00:22:08,00:22:11,"So yeah, but then people did wear high heels back then outside of butchers."
00:22:11,00:22:14,But I think butchers were known specifically.
00:22:14,00:22:15,That was the footwear of the job.
00:22:15,00:22:18,"Yeah, it wasn't you saw someone in heels and you went up, that's a butcher."
00:22:18,00:22:19,"No, exactly."
00:22:19,00:22:22,But you might for a second think you'd make a good butcher.
00:22:22,00:22:25,Because you know how to rock those heels.
00:22:25,00:22:28,And men and women wore them obviously back then.
00:22:28,00:22:33,"Well, I thought that they had been invented in the ninth century, right, in Persia."
00:22:33,00:22:34,"Yeah, I thought that as well."
00:22:34,00:22:38,"Which is where and the reason they were invented there, I think it might have been a separate invention,"
00:22:38,00:22:41,was so that men could fire arrows while on horseback.
00:22:41,00:22:44,It was a Persian archers.
00:22:44,00:22:48,"And basically if you wedge your feet into these stirrups using a pair of high heels,"
00:22:48,00:22:53,you can stand up in the stirrups and you can fire more steadily from there while you're riding a horse.
00:22:53,00:22:59,You know the Persians are responsible for a huge period of terrible art in Egypt.
00:22:59,00:23:00,What?
00:23:00,00:23:06,"Yeah, so the Persians, the Persians took over at about 525 BC or at least during 525 BC,"
00:23:06,00:23:08,they were running Egypt.
00:23:08,00:23:12,"And so what they did was all the artists who were in Egypt, who were doing all the,"
00:23:12,00:23:17,"all of the caskets, all the wall art and so on, they basically deported them."
00:23:17,00:23:20,So it just left Egypt with terrible artists.
00:23:20,00:23:25,"And that you can see all these examples, this whole period of just bad art where people are trying to now be the artist"
00:23:25,00:23:28,and they're just getting it really just slightly cartoonishly wrong.
00:23:28,00:23:31,"Are you sure they didn't just go there, they wanted to give the Egyptians a bad rep."
00:23:31,00:23:35,So the Persians did a whole bunch of kind of fakes really crappy drawings.
00:23:35,00:23:38,Look how bad these guys are.
00:23:38,00:23:40,"They also played board games, I didn't know that."
00:23:40,00:23:45,"And Tutankham, there's even that period, those drawings where you can just see them playing board games."
00:23:45,00:23:46,"Really, yeah."
00:23:46,00:23:51,"What do we know what we do, we know the names of the games, we don't know the rules, they still debate the exact rules"
00:23:51,00:23:54,"over some of the games, but there's like shackle versus dog."
00:23:54,00:23:56,There's a game that has a name.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"A shack, no."
00:23:57,00:23:59,"No, no, versus artifacts."
00:23:59,00:24:01,Should we do a bit on butchers before we move on?
00:24:01,00:24:02,"Yeah, sure."
00:24:02,00:24:06,"So according to the Butchers Guild website that I was reading,"
00:24:06,00:24:14,"the earliest kind of butchery that they have was from a Florida sinkhole from 12,000 years ago."
00:24:14,00:24:17,And it was a butchered giant sloth.
00:24:17,00:24:19,"Whoa, yeah."
00:24:19,00:24:23,Butchers was hanging in a little shop window somewhere in a sinkhole.
00:24:23,00:24:25,How do we know it's been actually?
00:24:25,00:24:29,I reckon they will have found bits of cutting on the bones.
00:24:29,00:24:30,Wow.
00:24:30,00:24:36,"Because if you have a butchered carcass, you can see where they've cut deliberately to get this piece of meat away."
00:24:36,00:24:37,Yeah.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"But it didn't say on the website, so I'm not 100% sure."
00:24:39,00:24:43,"And also in that sinkhole, they found a sharpened stick and a tortoise."
00:24:43,00:24:46,Do we think the tortoise was the one that butchered the sloth?
00:24:46,00:24:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:51,00:24:52,Did you know?
00:24:52,00:24:56,I didn't realise that one of the theories about Tutankhamoon died was that he got eaten by a hippopotamus.
00:24:56,00:24:57,Yeah.
00:24:57,00:24:58,That's an actual thing.
00:24:58,00:25:00,"No, I don't think that is right."
00:25:00,00:25:02,"Well, no, no, that he got killed by it."
00:25:02,00:25:04,He got killed by it and he didn't get eaten.
00:25:04,00:25:07,"Because he's buried in a very unconventional way, so he's missing."
00:25:07,00:25:09,That's a hippopotamus on the end of his body.
00:25:09,00:25:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:11,00:25:13,"No, he's missing his heart."
00:25:13,00:25:18,"It looks like something's committed some kind of horrific injury to him, whereby it's consumed his heart."
00:25:18,00:25:20,They put him in jars.
00:25:20,00:25:24,Unless there's something where his heart used to be saying the hippo took this.
00:25:24,00:25:28,"I think he was embalmed without his heart anywhere, so usually the heart would be there."
00:25:28,00:25:29,And the heart was missing.
00:25:29,00:25:31,"And obviously, I was completely jumped at the heart's missing."
00:25:31,00:25:32,Is it a hippo?
00:25:32,00:25:34,What sort of freaky vampire hippo is this?
00:25:34,00:25:37,"With surgical precision, move someone's heart."
00:25:37,00:25:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:38,00:25:41,So I think he's going back for more.
00:25:41,00:25:44,"Like the evil guy from Teppla Doom, but a hippo."
00:25:44,00:25:48,This is one of the ancient Egyptian ball games that play with hungry hungry hippos.
00:25:48,00:25:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:50,00:25:54,"Look, the source does specify a handful of Egyptologists believe this, so."
00:25:54,00:25:56,I've seen it in a bunch of places.
00:25:56,00:26:03,"Yeah, it's thought because hunting big animals like that was popular and there are pictures of cartoon come in doing things like that in his tomb."
00:26:03,00:26:06,"And he, that's a theory, guys."
00:26:06,00:26:07,It's a theory.
00:26:07,00:26:08,It's a theory.
00:26:08,00:26:12,I just have one last thing I was reading about laundry men of ancient Egypt.
00:26:12,00:26:15,They would take all the clothes from people's houses.
00:26:15,00:26:19,Then they would leave little tokens that they would draw the picture of the clothes they took.
00:26:19,00:26:20,"Oh, leave it with you."
00:26:20,00:26:21,"So it's like, we have these items."
00:26:21,00:26:23,Make sure that they come back.
00:26:23,00:26:26,What do they do after all of Egypt's good artists were removed?
00:26:26,00:26:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:27,00:26:29,They couldn't tell which item they draw.
00:26:29,00:26:30,Exactly.
00:26:30,00:26:33,But they would go down to the Nile and they would wash all their clothes.
00:26:33,00:26:39,And one of the hazards of being a laundry man back in ancient Egypt was that it was likely that you were going to be eaten by a crocodile
00:26:39,00:26:41,because they hung around on the bank so much.
00:26:41,00:26:42,"Oh, wow."
00:26:42,00:26:44,They must have been delighted when cattle were invented.
00:26:44,00:26:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:45,00:26:48,You don't see any crease shirts in any hieroglyphs there.
00:26:48,00:26:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:51,00:26:55,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy."
00:26:55,00:27:00,My fact is that there is a fish called the Amazonian wood eating catfish.
00:27:00,00:27:03,But it is unable to digest wood.
00:27:03,00:27:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:04,00:27:05,OK.
00:27:05,00:27:06,"It is catfish, though."
00:27:06,00:27:07,It is a catfish.
00:27:07,00:27:10,"Yeah, it was discovered a few years ago, about 2010."
00:27:10,00:27:15,And we've known for a while that there are loads of catfish which sort of suck wood.
00:27:15,00:27:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:17,00:27:18,The candero.
00:27:18,00:27:19,"Oh, dear."
00:27:19,00:27:22,They're called suck mouth almond catfish.
00:27:22,00:27:26,And they scrape wood with their teeth to get organic material off it.
00:27:26,00:27:30,And they're algae and bacteria and things that don't found clean to wood in rivers.
00:27:30,00:27:38,"But this new fish, it literally eats the wood and it digests the biological material on the wood"
00:27:38,00:27:40,and it living inside the wood.
00:27:40,00:27:43,And then it excretes the wood for us later.
00:27:43,00:27:47,"So it has the most painful bathroom visit about twice a day, is it?"
00:27:47,00:27:48,Yeah.
00:27:48,00:27:52,And it absorbs all the organic products and the tiny animals that live on the wood.
00:27:52,00:27:55,And it has special spoon shaped teeth as well.
00:27:55,00:28:00,"And it's just, I think it's amazing that this thing eats wood and then gets rid of all the wood."
00:28:00,00:28:05,"Apparently, it's really hard to fish for them because they don't go for bait."
00:28:05,00:28:08,But that a lot of fishing rods are made out of wood so you could hold onto them.
00:28:08,00:28:09,That's true.
00:28:09,00:28:10,Throw the--
00:28:10,00:28:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:11,00:28:13,"Go in the opposite way, you're right."
00:28:13,00:28:15,Do you know how you do catch them?
00:28:15,00:28:21,You listen out for them because they make this rasping noise which is them going on the wood that they're eating.
00:28:21,00:28:25,Yeah. But this is the weird thing. We can't digest wood.
00:28:25,00:28:31,"But I think the reason for this, I might be wrong about this, but I think it is that we don't have organisms in our gut"
00:28:31,00:28:34,"which produce the enzyme cellulase, right?"
00:28:34,00:28:36,So wood pulp is cellulose.
00:28:36,00:28:39,"And if you have the enzyme cellulase, you can digest it."
00:28:39,00:28:40,Yeah.
00:28:40,00:28:46,"So my question is if we did inject somebody with those organisms which do produce cellulase,"
00:28:46,00:28:48,would we be able to digest trees?
00:28:48,00:28:52,"In other words, you'd be able to do it just in like a probiotic. You wouldn't have to inject it into anyone."
00:28:52,00:28:53,"Hey, why have we done this?"
00:28:53,00:28:56,"I bet you've got-- you know those grows looking smoothies, you sometimes be in the office."
00:28:56,00:29:00,I bet there's cellulase in one of those. Try chewing on a twig after that.
00:29:00,00:29:07,"I think really you could do, but actually it's easier to get the calories out of a cream cake"
00:29:07,00:29:11,than it is to get it out of a stick even if you do have cellulase.
00:29:11,00:29:12,"Yeah, I'm sure."
00:29:12,00:29:14,Is there any species of tree that we do eat?
00:29:14,00:29:16,"I know broccoli is not a tree, but it kind of looks like one."
00:29:16,00:29:18,"No, but we did use to eat bark."
00:29:18,00:29:22,"Well, our ancestors used to eat bark. So they discovered this quite recently."
00:29:22,00:29:25,So it could rillers and also chimp sometimes chew on bark.
00:29:25,00:29:27,"Like I said, are really far back ancestors."
00:29:27,00:29:29,"Super far, before humans were actually a thing."
00:29:29,00:29:31,It was another hominid.
00:29:31,00:29:37,"I think it was the astralopithecus sediba, which is a two-million-year-old ancestor of humans."
00:29:37,00:29:39,And they recently found some with bark stuck in its teeth.
00:29:39,00:29:41,"And so yeah, we used to chew on that."
00:29:41,00:29:44,This is another Tutankhamun hippohart mystery.
00:29:44,00:29:47,That sounds more like they invented the toothpick.
00:29:47,00:29:49,Yeah.
00:29:49,00:29:51,What a brilliant rival theory.
00:29:51,00:29:53,You should write to the archaeologists.
00:29:53,00:29:56,"Some tribes might use sticks for cleaning their teeth, wouldn't they?"
00:29:56,00:29:58,I think they have things you can chew on.
00:29:58,00:29:59,Yeah.
00:29:59,00:30:01,Isn't cinnamon made out of bark?
00:30:01,00:30:02,Cinnamon sticks.
00:30:02,00:30:05,Don't we get aspirin from powdered bark?
00:30:05,00:30:06,Do we?
00:30:06,00:30:07,"Originally, yeah."
00:30:07,00:30:09,So we're eating a lot more wood than we realise.
00:30:09,00:30:12,"I like, you know, ants can't, most ants can't really digest solid food"
00:30:12,00:30:15,because they've got that really tiny waste.
00:30:15,00:30:17,They've got like smaller waste than Marilyn Monroe.
00:30:17,00:30:20,So they have to liquefied their food before they digest it.
00:30:20,00:30:21,I don't know any of that.
00:30:21,00:30:22,What?
00:30:22,00:30:25,Ants can't digest lumps of food because...
00:30:25,00:30:29,"No, I can imagine they can't eat like a doughnut because it's bigger than that one."
00:30:29,00:30:32,But are you saying they can't have any kind of solid soil?
00:30:32,00:30:33,They liquefy it.
00:30:33,00:30:36,And the way that they liquefy it is they feed it to their lava first.
00:30:36,00:30:40,"So their lava can digest solid food, can eat solid food."
00:30:40,00:30:45,So what ants do is they have the lava and they will put it into their lava's mouths.
00:30:45,00:30:50,And the lava will eat this food and their stomachs or their bodies will release the enzymes
00:30:50,00:30:53,required to break it down into a more palatable smoothie-type form.
00:30:53,00:30:55,And then they'll regurgitate it and give it to their parents.
00:30:55,00:30:57,So they're using the lava like a blender?
00:30:57,00:30:58,Yeah.
00:30:58,00:31:02,"And also, and also like a plate because some of the lava,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,"they don't, the lava don't even eat it."
00:31:04,00:31:07,Some of the lava just secrete the enzymes onto the top of their stomachs.
00:31:07,00:31:12,"So the worker ants come back with solid food, drops the bit of food onto the lava's stomach."
00:31:12,00:31:16,"The lava knows it just has to lie there, let it digest, then the ant comes back a bit later"
00:31:16,00:31:18,and eats it off the lava's stomach.
00:31:18,00:31:19,Catfish stuff?
00:31:19,00:31:20,Yeah.
00:31:20,00:31:27,"So catfish can, they can hunt in the dark by detecting the changes in acidity in water"
00:31:27,00:31:31,because their whiskers have got this special kind of sensor for acid.
00:31:31,00:31:34,So you can tell if something's a bit more acid or a bit less acid
00:31:34,00:31:36,and they can find things using that.
00:31:36,00:31:39,Just one more thing on a really cool species of wood eating creature
00:31:39,00:31:42,that's also underwater is a crab.
00:31:42,00:31:45,So there's this kind of crab which the only thing it can eat is wood
00:31:45,00:31:49,and yet it lives at the bottom of the ocean so it can live up to 1.5 kilometres underwater
00:31:49,00:31:50,right in the ocean.
00:31:50,00:31:51,Are there not many trees?
00:31:51,00:31:52,Not a lot of trees at all.
00:31:52,00:31:55,So there is nothing in its habitat that grows that it can possibly eat
00:31:55,00:31:58,and it has to rely on wood falling into the water.
00:31:58,00:32:01,"Yeah, I mean, that is, yeah, it is a matter that you grow up in an environment"
00:32:01,00:32:03,where there's nothing for you to eat.
00:32:03,00:32:05,I imagine how annoying that would be.
00:32:05,00:32:09,So they have to literally just wait for trunks to find their way
00:32:09,00:32:12,and then suddenly that's their meal as a community for the next.
00:32:12,00:32:13,Yeah.
00:32:13,00:32:16,And often trees break down as they get further and further to sea
00:32:16,00:32:18,so you'll get little scraps of wood.
00:32:18,00:32:19,Or a shipwreck.
00:32:19,00:32:20,Yeah.
00:32:20,00:32:21,Some of them do live on shipwrecks.
00:32:21,00:32:22,Yeah.
00:32:22,00:32:25,All of that must be bliss when a huge shipwreck.
00:32:25,00:32:27,Titanic was the best moment in their history.
00:32:27,00:32:29,Not really made out of that.
00:32:29,00:32:32,There's an upside down catfish.
00:32:32,00:32:34,What?
00:32:34,00:32:39,It's found in central Congo and they're notable because they swim upside down
00:32:39,00:32:42,because they feed on insects on the surface of the water.
00:32:42,00:32:46,So they kind of just kind of backstroke their way through and just wrap them off the surface.
00:32:46,00:32:50,And there are even ancient Egyptian paintings of them upside down.
00:32:50,00:32:53,But now I think maybe it's just a battle drum.
00:32:53,00:32:54,Yeah.
00:32:54,00:32:58,My help catfish.
00:32:58,00:32:59,"Okay, that's it."
00:32:59,00:33:00,That's all of our facts.
