 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Aniches Zinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in a particular order,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 here we go, starting with you, Chuzinsky.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 My fact this week is that the reason Merlin isn't called "Murden"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 is to avoid confusion with a 12th century word for feces.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 That's amazing.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Yeah, so the wizard Merlin of "Sword in the Stone" fame,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 he would have been called "Murden"

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 and so the story is that Merlin was originally created in the form we know him

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 by Jeffrey of Monmouth, who was sort of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 a Norman Welsh guy in the 12th century.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 And he based the character of Merlin on this Welsh medieval mythical figure called "Murden"

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 M-Y-R-D-I-N. But because he has sort of Norman origins,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 because he was from the Nebility probably, and so a lot of people were speaking French

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 in his social circles,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 it was thought that Merlin would be really easily confused with Merlin,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 which is the same as it is today,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 which is the word for pooh.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 It feels like he's missed a chance for a lot of puns and poo jokes, doesn't it?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 By changing that name, he's lost a lot of his joke material.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Yes, he could have been the chalcer of his time.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 I just don't know if that was the style he was going for.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Okay, do you know that in the 17th century the word "Murden" was English?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Yes, really!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 It was just a common English word for pooh "Murden"

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 and then it just kind of disappeared in the 18th century.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 And now it's kind of everyone knows it's just a French word.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Speaking of people, his name's meant feces.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Montezuma of the Aztecs had an nephew whose name meant plenty of excrement.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 What was his name?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 It was cuida chwac.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 They had guacamole, didn't they, which means testicle sauce.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 An avocado means testicles as well.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Exactly, yes.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Are the things that mean testicles, orchid?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Yes, yeah.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 I have another Merlin fact, probably my favorite Merlin fact.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 He was sorted into a house at Hogwarts.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Neither of these things is real.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Exactly, I thought someone might pick me up on this, but neither of these things are real.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 The big JK Rowling website, it was revealed that Merlin was a student of the school of Hogwarts.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 And he was sorted into one of the four schools.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And he was sorted into Slytherin.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 So Merlin is a Slytherin.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Wow.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 This is weird because you said yesterday that you'd found an amazing thing on Merlin that you love.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 It's the best thing I've ever found, yeah.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Well, so I was reading about him later on.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 And I found something and I thought, I bet this is what Dan's found.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 It's so interesting.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 And this really shows how disconnected you and I are.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 The thing I thought is that he's so Merlin in the original myth is a ledge to have been buried in this particular place.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 That's sort of a crossover between two rivers.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 So the river Tweed and a little stream called Palsail Burn.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And in the legends, it was written that if ever the Palsail Burn and the Tweed were to meet at the place of Merlin's final resting place,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 these two rivers were to suddenly collide, then England and Scotland would have the same monarch.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 And this prediction is in medieval text.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 And on the exact day that James the 6th of Scotland and James the 1st of England was crowned in 1603,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 the banks of the River Tweed broke and it flooded into the Palsail Burn and they met.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 No.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Isn't that weird?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 I smell PR happening.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Yeah.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 It might be that I didn't check it off in the banks broken.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 It might be that they just broke every single winter.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 But I definitely know they broke in 1603 on that precise day according to whom.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 The 17th century Malcolm tucking character.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Speaking of PR though, I was talking to Greg Jenner and Greg Jenner, who's been on our show a number of times.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Historian.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Historian, Horrible History's official chief nerd.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And he was telling me about a publicity stunt as well.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 So this was back in the 12th century, the Glastonbury Abbey Burn Down and all the pilgrims stopped going to it.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 So it was soon after that that the abbot found the body of King Arthur in his grave.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 And suddenly all the pilgrims started returning on mass.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 And so Greg was saying that this is one of the earliest examples of a publicity stunt

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 where they just needed people to return.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 So King Arthur is one of the original publicity stunt.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Yeah, I think what happened was it burnt down and they were like to Henry the 2nd Oak and we have some more money to build out.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 So we don't have any, but maybe just maybe if you look closely, you might be able to find the body of King Arthur.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And they went, okay, we'll have a lock and sure enough the very next day they found it.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Wow.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 What a weird coincidence.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 It's amazing.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 It's such a short time as well.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Incredible.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Okay, so this is something that I thought you would like down.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 So the Holy Grail, which is kind of an Arthurian legend as well.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 It's based probably on an adaptation of an old Welsh story about the cauldron of Anwin.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Okay.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Which was owned by a guy called Bran the Blessed.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 No.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Yeah.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 And if he was a giant, a Welsh giant called Bran the Blessed.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Wow.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 And if you go into his Wikipedia page, it says, "Do not confuse him with Brian Blessed."

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 It's amazing.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 You can understand why you would.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Yeah.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 That's incredible.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Do we know any more about him or is it just that?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Well, the soul saw his Wikipedia page, but I didn't read any of it.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 And he was real, was he?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 No, he was a giant.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Oh my god.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 But then is Brian Blessed real?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 It's the point I'm making.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Who appears more real?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Also, do you know what the name of the sword and the stone was?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 I'm going to say Excalibur and you're looking at me like it's wrong.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 It's wrong, I'm afraid.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 According to Mallory and according to basically everyone, the sword and the stone doesn't have a name.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 And then Arthur loses it.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And then he gets his Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake, which is a different sword.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Okay.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Who eventually traps Merlin for all of eternity.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 That's how Merlin meets his demise.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 It was stone.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 In some stone as well, right?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Yeah.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Everything's always been stuck in stone in these days.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Yeah, they didn't have carbon fiber, they didn't have plastics.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 They had to use what they had basically.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Yeah.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 All the hell was stone.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Actually, just on Arthurian legend.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Yeah.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 I think, I don't know if Andy will know this, but I had no idea about this.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 I thought it was really interesting.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 So Arthurian legends are referred to as the matter of Britain.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 So this is this whole body of medieval literature, which is called the matter of Britain.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 And there are three matters in medieval times.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 There's the matter of Britain, the matter of France, and the matter of Rome.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 And these are just the three big bits of literature.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 So matter of Britain's Arthur, the matter of France is the stories of Charlemagne.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And the matter of Rome is like all-awesome Roman ancient literature.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 So the matter of Rome is absolutely winning.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 And the guy who named these was a French poet who was called Baudel.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 And I was thinking when I was reading this, oh, cool.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 We are one of the three great tripods of medieval literature.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 And his description of them was that France is character.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 The matter of France is characterised by voire or truth.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Rome is characterised by sage-ness or wisdom or knowledge.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 And the matter of Britain is characterised by being vain et pleson,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 to mean frivolous, pleasant, but completely false.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Funny you say wise, because that's where the word wizard comes from.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 Is it?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 The wizard part comes from wise.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 And I think the idea was that maybe in the olden days,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 wise people could see the future, I think that might be okay.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Can I quickly talk about modern day wizards?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Yeah.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Okay, so pagans and druids, those are the sort of modern day torch holders

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 of the whole wizarding world, I would say.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 And interesting news in the world of pagan news,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 which is that now pagans, there's about a million in the UK,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 300 of whom are in prison.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Prisoned pagans, prisoned wizards are now allowed to have a wand in jail.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 That's a new ruling that's just been made.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Because it's respecting their religious beliefs.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 So what they have to do is they can go into the yard and get some twigs

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 and bring them back.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 And then they kind of just pimp up the twigs a bit.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 And then that's their wand that they're allowed to have.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 I think I might start a new religion which has a skeleton key as a holy symbol.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 This article says they've toned down all of the rituals

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 because what they're also in theory should be having is a flaming torch with them

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 as part of the religion.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 And we're cool to let the flaming torch bit go if we can have the twigs.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 How many wizards are in prison?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 300.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 300?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Are they all in the same--

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 No, it's not as good.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 I don't actually think it does show respects for their religion.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Because what basically you're saying when you tell wizards that they're allowed

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 to have their wand in prison is that you definitely don't believe

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 their wand has any capacity to help them.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 I have one last thing which is about modern day wizards,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 which is there is a school in California which is open and has been open for 10 years.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 It's the world's only registered wizard academy.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 It's got 735 students.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Half of whom will be in prison at 10 years.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And it was set up by a guy called Oberon-Zell Ravenhart

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 and he himself is a wizard.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 But the school is up and running.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 You can go to their website.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 They have like latest news is that the school is now.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 It's called the Grey School of Wizardry.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 They're now on second life so you can attend it on second life as well.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 They have a list of their staff.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 It includes people called Silver Main, Swift Rabbit, Frogs Dancing, Earth Drum,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 MA, Apollionus, BS, MS, PhD.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 BS is a bit odd.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 And Silver Lock.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 And so yeah, you can--

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Well, these people just they started out as accountants or postmen

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 and they got so much mockery for their names that they ended up being forced

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 into the wizarding profession, do you think?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 I don't know who does it.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 And one more modern wizard who's great is the Real King Arthur.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Who's back?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 This is a guy he was formally called John Rothwell before he realised

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 that he was King Arthur a few years ago.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 He's the battle chief-ton of the council of British Truid orders.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 There's quite a good interview with him in Vice.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And the Vice Guy asked him things like how hard was it to pull the sword from the stone

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 to which he answered very, very, very hard.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 So that was legit.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 They tried to trick him with that trick question.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 What he got it straight away?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Not today.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Hang on, hang on.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 The whole point of the sword in the stone was that it comes out easily

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 if you're the King of England.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 They did trick him.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 OK, and it's time to move on to fact number two.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 And that is James.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 OK, my fact this week is that tea leaves sometimes flow upstream

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 from the cup to the pot.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 I don't believe it.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 If I was ever going to call nonsense on anything, never mind King Arthur, you agree.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 I can't hate it.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 This sounds amazing.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 It is incredible.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 It was discovered by a guy called Sebastian Bianchini in 2008.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 He was at the University of Havana.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And he was pouring hot water from a pot which was just water

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 into a cup which had some tea leaves, some matte tea leaves.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 And as he poured it, he had his nice cup of tea.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 And then he looked in the pot.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 And there were tea leaves there.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 And he didn't understand why.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 And he went to a physicist at the University of Havana.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 And they kind of did some experiments.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 But then they kind of, they never published a findings

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 because they thought everyone would laugh at them.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 But it seems true.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 It seems like it's a real thing.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 Oh my God.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 This is one of those things that you could actually demonstrate.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Like, you could just demonstrate.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 Why would people laugh?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 But they think probably it was a trick.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 And he had some tea leaves in there all along.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 It's like a darren brown style.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 You'd never be able to make any tea.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 The leaves would constantly be fleeing into the pot.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 So it's not all of them.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 It's some of them.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 And it's due to this thing called the Marringoni Effect,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 which is a mixture of surface tension

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 and a little bit of capillary action.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 And surface tension basically we're talking about pure water

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 and not pure water.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 And the particles want to travel up towards a pure water.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 And people didn't think it could happen with something

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 as big as tea leaves, but actually it can happen.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 And yeah, how big of a leaf are we talking?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 We're talking this stuff is called matati.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 And it's usually like little,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 they're almost like little bits of sawdust, aren't they?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Yeah, it's really small.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 It's very crumbly.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Smaller than normal tea leaves.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Wow.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Yeah.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 But actually when things run quite small scale,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 they can do things that don't normally happen for bigger things.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 So like, for instance, capillary action only really works

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 for really small kind of thin tubes,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 which is that water goes up the tube against gravity.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 And that wouldn't happen on normal tube,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 but it happens with very thin tubes.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 And that's how plants can get the water from the ground

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 into their leaves.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Yeah.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Okay.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Did you read the guy who commented,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 someone who commented at the bottom of this study?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 And he said,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 "This article reminded me of when I once made the mistake

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 of expectorating into a toilet.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 And the result was an immediate,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 accurate taste in my mouth.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Apparently the chemicals in there had traveled several feet

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 up my stream of saliva.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 But that was a theory then.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 Reliably disgusting.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 It is quite disgusting.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 But the scientist acknowledged that that could be a possibility,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 although it said it might be quite unlikely that chemicals

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 could flow that way backwards."

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 So are we saying that when you go to the Lou in some ways,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 the Lou goes to you?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 I mean, it's not very much.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 It's not all of it.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 It's not like you come out of the toilet.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 The toilet is completely empty of water.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 I'm so bloated out of that.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Well, isn't there that thing that all men are scared of,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 that Amazonian fish, where the room has always been.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 But it will swim up your urine stream.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 We should quickly explain that, shouldn't we?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 It's a canteroo.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 It's like a mini little catfish.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 I think it's in the catfish family.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Yes.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And the theory is you would be in the water and you'd be urinating.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And it gets attracted to the urine stream.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 And then it follows it and then goes into your penis

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 and sticks its spines out and gets stuck there

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 and can be extremely painful.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 And there's been one or two stories in the medical literature

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 of it happening.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 But most people think probably it's not true.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Yeah. And I have to say you say a little fish.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 I've seen one in the Natural History Museum.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 That's not a little fish.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 That is.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Remember when we went to?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Yeah.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Yeah. That was, I mean, no, but that's big.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Like, it's not like a...

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 No, it wasn't.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 You know that whale in the front lobby.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Yeah.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 It wasn't that one.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Okay. Then I miss red label.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 But it's about an inch out to you.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Yeah.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 I know, but still, the idea of that going A up a stream,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 you know, it's not...

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 It's like a teapot stream urine.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 It's not a fixed...

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Well, mine's not like a pig.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 This was apparently the only means of preventing it

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 according to one piece of 19th century medical literature

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 because this room has been around for about 200 years

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 that they'll do this.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 The only means of preventing it from reaching your bladder

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 where it causes inflammation and ultimately death

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 is to instantly amputate the penis.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 This isn't when you get your visa to go to the Amazon

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 and you have to have it done as it prevented it.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Yeah.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Yeah.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Just a shot in your arm.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 And let's just get that off show.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 I'm pretty sure that this has completely been debunked

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 as an idea.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 The candero.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Going from you standing on the bank, having a pit.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 So the idea is it could, let's say,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 it could possibly happen while you're bathing.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Exactly.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 Perhaps, and it just follows the warmth of the water or whatever.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 But the idea that you're standing on the side of a river

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 peeing down and then it jumps like a sovereignty of penis.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Yeah.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 I'm pretty sure that got that out.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 I was reading about the first ever book written about tea.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 It's an old Chinese text and it's the first ever collection

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 of a book on tea.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 It's called Cha-ching.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 No.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Cha, the Chinese word, and Qing, which I actually don't know

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 what that word is.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 But the eye Qing is a fortune telling book, isn't it?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Yes.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 Oh yeah, maybe it was fortune telling through T-Lews book.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 You know, India, what the mythology of how tea came about in India is.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 What?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Did it get found by a goat herd or is that coffee maybe?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 No.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 So it was about 1,900 years ago and it was a priest named Bodhidhama.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 And he was trying to connect with Zen Buddhism and the idea

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 that he was going to do that was seven-year sleepless contemplation

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 of Buddha.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 He found himself in the fifth year, again quite drowsy.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 And needed to cure that.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 And so he quickly grabbed some leaves off a tree and started chewing them.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 And then he thought it was fantastic.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 And that just got him through that extra two years.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 He really put them up for that final push.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 And in China, they have an idea that it was an emperor called Nanshen,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 who was, as well as being the emperor, he's a scholar and herbalist.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 And while he was out in the field on maybe I guess a walk or something,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 he was having a hot cup of water and some leaves blew into his cup.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 And he spelt it away.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 That smells quite nice.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 I love it.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 It's so interesting.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Pretty much everything has an origin myth where it's discovered by...

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 It's widespread, isn't it?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 Which just seems to be the humans have this innate preference

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 for that kind of discovery rather than someone who really knew what they were doing

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 and had studied the field and were working really hard on it for years.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Because we all want to believe that we could do it.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 So the British introduced tea to India, which sounds lunatic.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Or rather popularized it in India.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 So it was already native.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 But it was not a thing that was grown in large quantities though.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 It wasn't big.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 But then in the 19th century Britain needed an alternative to the Chinese tea monopoly.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 And so that's why India is now this great tea nation.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Because we got it in the 17th century I think.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Was it Charles II's wife?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 I think came over and brought tea.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 And then everyone thought it was like this terrible...

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 So there's a lot of misogyny and xenophobia.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 Basically it was a foreign thing that women drank.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 And also it gave women a reason for getting together and men obviously thought that was a terrible idea.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 It's the Lamborghini of its day basically.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Lamborghini was discovered actually when...

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 That was walking across a field with some carbonated water.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 And a passing bird dropped and brought something great into it.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 So can I just bring it back to your main headline fact for a second?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 So you haven't seen a video of this being done.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 No.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 I couldn't find one.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Surely we should be doing that.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 We should be filming that or getting someone listening to like let's see this.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Let's see...

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Okay so it's specifically Matati.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Yeah.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 Which is this South American tea which is...

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 It's quite a big thing over there isn't it?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 You've been to America.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Yeah and I've got a few friends who live there and it's pretty much all they do.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 I'm amazed they get any work done there.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 But yeah there's a really strict ritual around Matati which is that the way you drink it is you fill up a kettle of boiling water

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 and then you pour it onto all these hubs and you keep on topping it up and up.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 So you can keep drinking your one Matati for hours but two very important things you have to do and people get extremely angry if you don't do them.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 When it's usually you hand it around so it's a real sociable thing.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 It's a very much a community thing drinking Matati.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 And when you hand it to someone you have to look them in the eye because that's part of your saying I'm giving this to you.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 And you have to give it to them with a straw pointing towards them.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 So it comes with this metal straw.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 And if you don't give it to them with a straw pointing you are kicked out of the country.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 No it sounds like it's from bitter experience.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Just on tea.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 So I think a lot of people think that you shouldn't re-boil a kettle.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 If you boil the water once you should use that to make tea and then the water is sort of no good for making tea after that.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 And if you re-boil it is bad. And the theory is that all the oxygen leaches out of the water.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 But the thing is when you boil a kettle it leaches off the first time you boil a kettle.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 So whenever you make a tea you don't have a choice you have to make it without all that lovely bonus oxype.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Do you know what I do now?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 If I have a shirt that needs ironing I start boiling a kettle and as it reaches boiling point I take the lid off and all the steam comes up.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 But because you've taken the lid off it never fully boils so the kettle is confused it thinks it's still boiling so it keeps going.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 So I steam my entire shirt and it steams really quickly. You can do a whole shirt in about a minute.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 I haven't done it on my shirt today.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 I'm looking at your shirt.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 It's that time it's so crazy today.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Listening at home.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Damn there's one wrinkle now.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Why don't we put tea bags in the kettle as it boils?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 That's always confused.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 Someone might want coffee.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Why would you put tea bags in the kettle?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Because I noticed that the British love to leave in a pot tea and let it mull.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 When I reckon the intense boiling that's going on would absolutely make it just the most intense tea.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 You could rewrite the book on tea.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 You could be cha-ching the sequel.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 There was a famous quote by Einstein where he said that his best ever idea was to put an egg in his soup while it was cooking

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 so that his egg and his soup could cook at the same time.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 See?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Me and Einstein are on the same thinking level here.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 You're shoving a shirt.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 He's got a tea bag in it.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 Over it.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 I'm holding it over it.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 All that needs in his house is one kettle and it does everything.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 If I need to make some toast, I just put it in the kettle.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 I don't need a hot water bottle.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 I just hug the kettle.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 My fact this week is that butchers in ancient Egypt wore high heels.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Okay.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 I think I'm pretty sure it's correct to say that that's the oldest example of high heels that we have.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Why would they wear high heels?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 Because apparently it was to do with the slaughtering of the animals.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 So when they were killing all the animals, they would find that the floor would be blood drenched.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 They didn't want to get their feet completely stained.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 So the high heels just made it a more pleasant walking process for them.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 So yeah, but then people did wear high heels back then outside of butchers.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 But I think butchers were known specifically.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 That was the footwear of the job.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Yeah, it wasn't you saw someone in heels and you went up, that's a butcher.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 No, exactly.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 But you might for a second think you'd make a good butcher.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Because you know how to rock those heels.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 And men and women wore them obviously back then.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Well, I thought that they had been invented in the ninth century, right, in Persia.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 Yeah, I thought that as well.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Which is where and the reason they were invented there, I think it might have been a separate invention,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 was so that men could fire arrows while on horseback.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 It was a Persian archers.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 And basically if you wedge your feet into these stirrups using a pair of high heels,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 you can stand up in the stirrups and you can fire more steadily from there while you're riding a horse.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 You know the Persians are responsible for a huge period of terrible art in Egypt.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 What?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 Yeah, so the Persians, the Persians took over at about 525 BC or at least during 525 BC,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 they were running Egypt.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 And so what they did was all the artists who were in Egypt, who were doing all the,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 all of the caskets, all the wall art and so on, they basically deported them.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 So it just left Egypt with terrible artists.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 And that you can see all these examples, this whole period of just bad art where people are trying to now be the artist

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 and they're just getting it really just slightly cartoonishly wrong.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Are you sure they didn't just go there, they wanted to give the Egyptians a bad rep.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 So the Persians did a whole bunch of kind of fakes really crappy drawings.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 Look how bad these guys are.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 They also played board games, I didn't know that.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 And Tutankham, there's even that period, those drawings where you can just see them playing board games.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 Really, yeah.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 What do we know what we do, we know the names of the games, we don't know the rules, they still debate the exact rules

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 over some of the games, but there's like shackle versus dog.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 There's a game that has a name.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 A shack, no.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 No, no, versus artifacts.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Should we do a bit on butchers before we move on?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 Yeah, sure.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 So according to the Butchers Guild website that I was reading,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 the earliest kind of butchery that they have was from a Florida sinkhole from 12,000 years ago.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 And it was a butchered giant sloth.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 Whoa, yeah.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Butchers was hanging in a little shop window somewhere in a sinkhole.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 How do we know it's been actually?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 I reckon they will have found bits of cutting on the bones.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Wow.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Because if you have a butchered carcass, you can see where they've cut deliberately to get this piece of meat away.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Yeah.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 But it didn't say on the website, so I'm not 100% sure.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 And also in that sinkhole, they found a sharpened stick and a tortoise.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Do we think the tortoise was the one that butchered the sloth?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Did you know?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 I didn't realise that one of the theories about Tutankhamoon died was that he got eaten by a hippopotamus.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Yeah.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 That's an actual thing.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 No, I don't think that is right.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Well, no, no, that he got killed by it.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 He got killed by it and he didn't get eaten.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Because he's buried in a very unconventional way, so he's missing.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 That's a hippopotamus on the end of his body.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 No, he's missing his heart.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 It looks like something's committed some kind of horrific injury to him, whereby it's consumed his heart.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 They put him in jars.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Unless there's something where his heart used to be saying the hippo took this.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 I think he was embalmed without his heart anywhere, so usually the heart would be there.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And the heart was missing.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 And obviously, I was completely jumped at the heart's missing.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Is it a hippo?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 What sort of freaky vampire hippo is this?

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 With surgical precision, move someone's heart.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 So I think he's going back for more.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Like the evil guy from Teppla Doom, but a hippo.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 This is one of the ancient Egyptian ball games that play with hungry hungry hippos.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Look, the source does specify a handful of Egyptologists believe this, so.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 I've seen it in a bunch of places.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Yeah, it's thought because hunting big animals like that was popular and there are pictures of cartoon come in doing things like that in his tomb.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 And he, that's a theory, guys.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 It's a theory.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 It's a theory.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 I just have one last thing I was reading about laundry men of ancient Egypt.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 They would take all the clothes from people's houses.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 Then they would leave little tokens that they would draw the picture of the clothes they took.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Oh, leave it with you.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 So it's like, we have these items.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Make sure that they come back.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 What do they do after all of Egypt's good artists were removed?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 They couldn't tell which item they draw.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 Exactly.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 But they would go down to the Nile and they would wash all their clothes.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 And one of the hazards of being a laundry man back in ancient Egypt was that it was likely that you were going to be eaten by a crocodile

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 because they hung around on the bank so much.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Oh, wow.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 They must have been delighted when cattle were invented.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 You don't see any crease shirts in any hieroglyphs there.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 My fact is that there is a fish called the Amazonian wood eating catfish.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 But it is unable to digest wood.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 OK.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 It is catfish, though.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 It is a catfish.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Yeah, it was discovered a few years ago, about 2010.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 And we've known for a while that there are loads of catfish which sort of suck wood.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 The candero.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Oh, dear.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 They're called suck mouth almond catfish.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 And they scrape wood with their teeth to get organic material off it.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 And they're algae and bacteria and things that don't found clean to wood in rivers.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 But this new fish, it literally eats the wood and it digests the biological material on the wood

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 and it living inside the wood.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 And then it excretes the wood for us later.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 So it has the most painful bathroom visit about twice a day, is it?

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Yeah.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 And it absorbs all the organic products and the tiny animals that live on the wood.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 And it has special spoon shaped teeth as well.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 And it's just, I think it's amazing that this thing eats wood and then gets rid of all the wood.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 Apparently, it's really hard to fish for them because they don't go for bait.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 But that a lot of fishing rods are made out of wood so you could hold onto them.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 That's true.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Throw the--

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 Go in the opposite way, you're right.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 Do you know how you do catch them?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 You listen out for them because they make this rasping noise which is them going on the wood that they're eating.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Yeah. But this is the weird thing. We can't digest wood.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 But I think the reason for this, I might be wrong about this, but I think it is that we don't have organisms in our gut

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 which produce the enzyme cellulase, right?

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 So wood pulp is cellulose.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 And if you have the enzyme cellulase, you can digest it.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Yeah.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 So my question is if we did inject somebody with those organisms which do produce cellulase,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 would we be able to digest trees?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 In other words, you'd be able to do it just in like a probiotic. You wouldn't have to inject it into anyone.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 Hey, why have we done this?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 I bet you've got-- you know those grows looking smoothies, you sometimes be in the office.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 I bet there's cellulase in one of those. Try chewing on a twig after that.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 I think really you could do, but actually it's easier to get the calories out of a cream cake

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 than it is to get it out of a stick even if you do have cellulase.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Yeah, I'm sure.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Is there any species of tree that we do eat?

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 I know broccoli is not a tree, but it kind of looks like one.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 No, but we did use to eat bark.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Well, our ancestors used to eat bark. So they discovered this quite recently.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 So it could rillers and also chimp sometimes chew on bark.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 Like I said, are really far back ancestors.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 Super far, before humans were actually a thing.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 It was another hominid.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 I think it was the astralopithecus sediba, which is a two-million-year-old ancestor of humans.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 And they recently found some with bark stuck in its teeth.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 And so yeah, we used to chew on that.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 This is another Tutankhamun hippohart mystery.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 That sounds more like they invented the toothpick.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Yeah.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 What a brilliant rival theory.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 You should write to the archaeologists.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Some tribes might use sticks for cleaning their teeth, wouldn't they?

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 I think they have things you can chew on.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Yeah.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Isn't cinnamon made out of bark?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 Cinnamon sticks.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Don't we get aspirin from powdered bark?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Do we?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 Originally, yeah.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 So we're eating a lot more wood than we realise.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 I like, you know, ants can't, most ants can't really digest solid food

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 because they've got that really tiny waste.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 They've got like smaller waste than Marilyn Monroe.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 So they have to liquefied their food before they digest it.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 I don't know any of that.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 What?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Ants can't digest lumps of food because...

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 No, I can imagine they can't eat like a doughnut because it's bigger than that one.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 But are you saying they can't have any kind of solid soil?

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 They liquefy it.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 And the way that they liquefy it is they feed it to their lava first.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 So their lava can digest solid food, can eat solid food.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 So what ants do is they have the lava and they will put it into their lava's mouths.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 And the lava will eat this food and their stomachs or their bodies will release the enzymes

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 required to break it down into a more palatable smoothie-type form.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 And then they'll regurgitate it and give it to their parents.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 So they're using the lava like a blender?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Yeah.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 And also, and also like a plate because some of the lava,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 they don't, the lava don't even eat it.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 Some of the lava just secrete the enzymes onto the top of their stomachs.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 So the worker ants come back with solid food, drops the bit of food onto the lava's stomach.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 The lava knows it just has to lie there, let it digest, then the ant comes back a bit later

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 and eats it off the lava's stomach.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 Catfish stuff?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Yeah.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 So catfish can, they can hunt in the dark by detecting the changes in acidity in water

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 because their whiskers have got this special kind of sensor for acid.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 So you can tell if something's a bit more acid or a bit less acid

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 and they can find things using that.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 Just one more thing on a really cool species of wood eating creature

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 that's also underwater is a crab.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 So there's this kind of crab which the only thing it can eat is wood

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 and yet it lives at the bottom of the ocean so it can live up to 1.5 kilometres underwater

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 right in the ocean.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 Are there not many trees?

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Not a lot of trees at all.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 So there is nothing in its habitat that grows that it can possibly eat

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 and it has to rely on wood falling into the water.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 Yeah, I mean, that is, yeah, it is a matter that you grow up in an environment

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 where there's nothing for you to eat.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 I imagine how annoying that would be.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 So they have to literally just wait for trunks to find their way

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 and then suddenly that's their meal as a community for the next.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Yeah.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 And often trees break down as they get further and further to sea

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 so you'll get little scraps of wood.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 Or a shipwreck.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 Yeah.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Some of them do live on shipwrecks.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 Yeah.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 All of that must be bliss when a huge shipwreck.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 Titanic was the best moment in their history.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Not really made out of that.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 There's an upside down catfish.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 What?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 It's found in central Congo and they're notable because they swim upside down

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 because they feed on insects on the surface of the water.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 So they kind of just kind of backstroke their way through and just wrap them off the surface.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 And there are even ancient Egyptian paintings of them upside down.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 But now I think maybe it's just a battle drum.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Yeah.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 My help catfish.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 Okay, that's it.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 That's all of our facts.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
