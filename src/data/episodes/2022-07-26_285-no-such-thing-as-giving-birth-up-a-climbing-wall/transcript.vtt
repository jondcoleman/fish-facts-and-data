00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish. Before we begin, we have a very big announcement, Andy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.500
 That is right. The news is this. We are publishing the Book of the Year 2019 at the end of October.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.000
 It's going to be a brand new book full of the most insane, wonderful, weird, brilliant things that have happened across the world this year.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 And even better, there is zero Brexit.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 That's right. We've had any potential mention of Brexit redacted within the book itself.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 We have a very special competition, don't we? So if you pre-order the book, then you can win an amazing prize.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.000
 And that prize is another copy of the book. However, it's a very special copy because we're going to keep it in the office.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 And we're going to scribble all over it and make silly jokes and just do lots of drawings and it'll be it's a unique prize that only you will have.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 It is. It's a window into our life in the office that you wish that you'd never opened. Once you see how sorted and corrupt the whole thing is.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 But that's what you're going to get. You're going to get those doodles around the Book of the Year and it really has been so much fun to write this year.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 There's been lots of incredible news that you will have missed because we've been overwhelmed with all this Brexit, Malaki.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 A man called Bud Weiser was arrested when he was trespassing a Bud Weiser factory. That was just incredible. Five guys were arrested at five guys this year.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Yeah, it's packed with just all the silliest stories from the news of the year.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 So if you want to enter the competition, you just need to go to the book of the year.co.uk and all the details are there.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 One more thing. We will be doing some live shows around this book.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 So if you want to come and see us live and hear all about the whole world, except for Brexit, then come and see us and details of that you can find at nosuchthingsaffish.com.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Okay, on with the show.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Andy.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 My fact is that Major League Baseball has an official mud.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 She's quite cool.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 What do they do with this mud?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 They rub it on their balls.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Okay. And this is from a great article in Sports Illustrated, which you read for the articles.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 I read for the articles. I genuinely do.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 So it's a profile of this man called Jim Bintliffe and he spends his life, basically, harvesting mud.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 He's one of the world's only paid professional mud farmers.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Do you think there are a lot of amateurs?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 No, you're right.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 No, I think no, because you're not allowed to enter the mud at the Olympics if you are professional.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 So a lot of people remain amateurs.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 He's a shooter's chance at that.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 It's true.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 But he's doing very well, isn't he?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Well, kind of, yeah. So the Major League Baseball, they need 240,000 baseballs per season.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 And every single one has to have the shine taken off it so that the picture can grip it better.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 And he has this secret location where he harvest buckets of mud.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And he won't tell anyone. He won't tell anyone at all.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 So, for example, he didn't even tell his wife until he'd been married for five years.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 And they'd had two children together.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Not even after the first child, did he think it's probably okay to tell my daughter?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 It's true, not wonder why he kept coming back with muddy shoes and stuff.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 It's covered in filth, yeah.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Well, she knows that he does it, presumably, but she doesn't know the location.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Is that right?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Yeah, yeah, there's a particular bit of the Delaware River.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 And he's the third generation of his family doing this job.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Yeah, I think there's this authority, it doesn't matter.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 It's mad.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 And he has these, so he goes and collects it all at once, right?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 So he'll go to the source, the secret source.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And then he'll come back with a thousand pounds in weight of mud and store it over the winter

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 and then sell it to the baseball.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Yeah, he cleans it as well.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 You don't want dirty mud, do you?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 No way.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 So he lets it sit and then he dilutes it.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 And he strains it for six weeks and he drains it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 And he has to be nice and smooth.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 And he used to just sell it in some buckets.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 But now he sells it in little plastic containers.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 But it is handmade mud, as it were.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 And he has alibis for if people actually catch him in the act of doing it.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 So he just makes stuff up, like he needs it for his rose bushes or for bee stings,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 poison ivy and so on.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 But how is no one following him to find out where this location is?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Well, I think probably no one really cares.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 It's probably it.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Because surely what it is is basically he has the monopoly over this mud.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 And he could probably get it from somewhere else and no one's ever going to say anything.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 That's true.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Or someone else could put the same mud in a pot without the brand.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 And they probably won't be able to sell it for as much.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 But it's not a market that people are dying to get into.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Yeah, that's why I'm saying I guess.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 He doesn't earn a lot from it, it's very interesting.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Considering he's caught up the market basically.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 He makes about $20,000 a year in total from it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Oh my god.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 I know.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 I know.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Actually, baseball must be in the billions and billions of dollars they make every year.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 So every team basically orders about four cans.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 And sorry, do we know why the team need the specific mud?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Why aren't they getting elsewhere?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 It's really good stuff.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 The main reason this isn't going to answer your question.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 But just to say the reason why you need it is because it's really hard to throw a brand new leather ball.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Because it'll just slip out of your hands.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 And actually what happened was back at the start of the last century someone actually died.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Because a picture through it and without the roughness you can't control it.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 And he threw it and it just hit someone in the head and they died.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 And so from then on they decided they needed something to rough it up.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 Oh my god, the Jim Bindliffe is saving lives every baseball season.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Yeah.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Yeah, let's say that.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 Amazing.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And as you say, the generations that this has gone through, it's amazing.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 So it was started by Lena Blackburn and Lena died in 1968.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 So he handed it to his friend then John Hass.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 And this is where the family comes into it.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 The three generations.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 John Hass then gave it to his son-in-law who's got a fantastic name.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Burns Bindliffe.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 And then Burns Bindliffe gave it to one of his nine children who was now Jim.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 One of his nine children.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 And also he said I was the only one of the nine children who expressed any interest in the family.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 My business.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Everyone else left the state for some reason.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 They all moved.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 They had eight children.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 They kept on saying come on surely we don't need to have another.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 Can you just take on the family business?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 I think he's got one of his daughters interested in the trade now.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 So it might hit generation four.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Oh no, has he hit adolescence yet?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 I can imagine sort of a ten-year-old finding that really cool.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And by the time you're 18 you think actually down I'm going to be an actress.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 There's another trick for helping your grip.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 So this is for holding basal bats as well.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 There's many tricks to help you have a firmer grip.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 One of them is, and this is Donbay, quite a few players, is to piss on your own hands.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 No.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Yeah, this is an actual thing.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 So there was a news report recently from a Pittsburgh pirate's picture called Jameson Tylon.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And he had to go off I think during a match because of a cut in his middle finger.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 It was really bad.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 It was a great grip and cut.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 So he was told, why not pee on your hands?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 That's going to happen, isn't it?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 It will sting, but it might get you back on the pitch.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 More like the piss-boat pirates.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 More like that, yeah.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Now there's no definitive truth about that.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Wait a minute.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 So can I just ask, you're saying not to help you pitch.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 You're doing it to stop the cut from, is that right?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 In this case, they thought that the pee might heal the finger.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 But generally, if you want to toughen your hands, you should piss.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 It's a magic piss that just heals wounds instantly.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 According to baseball players, we all do.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Right.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Just we into an empty nivia pot and it's basically the same.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 I think a few have done that because George Pissada, who was a catcher.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 So George what other?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 George Pissada.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 George Pissada.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Oh, sorry.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And it's not normative determinism, it's perfectly normal.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 So he's a catcher and Moises Allu is a hitter and they both avoid the calluses because you get calluses if you play baseball a lot.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Right.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 By urinating on their hands.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Sorry, I'm still a bit perplexed about the function of urinating on his.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Is it to help you hold the bat?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 It's a moisturiser, basically.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Right.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Wow.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 And so they haven't heard of any moisturizers that are commercially available.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 But if you did get commercial moisturiser and you held onto the bat, it might slip out of your hand.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 So I suppose maybe it moisturises without making it slipping.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Yeah, possibly.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 We can only speculate.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 I notice you're always dropping your microphone whenever we're doing stage shows, so maybe this is something you could do.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Sure, sure, sure.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 I just need a modesty screen at the side of the stage.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 You are allowed to put pine tar on your bat as well.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 So it's tar from a pine tree.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 So you're allowed to put it on the handle bit of your bat so that the bat doesn't fly out of your hands.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 And that's another safety thing.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 Because you don't want to just have people throwing their bats all over the bat.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 In American football, you're not allowed to put sticky things on your gloves, but people often do or often have them being caught.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 So that you can kind of, someone throws a ball at you or to you, sorry.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And then you jump up to catch it.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 And then it almost just touches one of your fingers and somehow you manage to catch it.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 And that's explicitly against the rules, but people have done it over the years.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 But what happens when you go to kick it and you try to drop the ball and it's just attached to your hands?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 You go to shake hands for the opposition after the game or something.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Just something about baseball in the olden days.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 So until 1887, so baseball started like start of the 19th century, but until 1887,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 when you came up to bat or whatever the baseball term is as a hitter to bat,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 then you could request a high or low ball.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 So we asked the pitcher to put it where you wanted it.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 Can you put it between my upper thigh and my lower thigh please or whatever and they had to do that?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Wow.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 Yeah, it makes it easier, isn't it?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 It does.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 It's actually quite a lot harder for the pitcher to aim it there.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 That's amazing.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 I mean they do still have to hit it in that little zone, in your hitting zone, don't they?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 Yes.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 I always think that's a bit weird.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Well, you can't just throw it in the opposite direction to where he was just standing.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Or 100 meters in the air above the head.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 That's why my game's never caught on.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Some stuff on mud.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Oh yeah.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Yeah.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 So in the 19th century mud in the UK was a really big problem, especially in the cities like London.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 And it was always said that you could tell an Englishman abroad because he would be the one wearing turned up trousers.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Not really.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 And it wasn't a fashion.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 It was because if you didn't turn up your trousers, you get mud on them.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 See.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 When people see hipsters now, when foreigners see hipsters, they think it's just because we live knee-deep in mud.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 They think, oh yes, I was thinking you might be a time traveler from 19th century London, but you're probably right.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Maybe the hipsters all are that.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 A lot of their features do speak to that.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Oh, I've got one really cool mud thing.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Do you guys know about the mud pot of California?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Nope.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 So this is this amazing thing.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 It's a geyser basically, but it's a bubbling mud geyser.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 And it's called the Nyland Geyser.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 And it's just at the southern end of the San Andreas fault.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 And it remained totally still, as you'd expect from a geyser, until about 11 years ago when it started suddenly moving.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 And then it got faster and faster.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 And by 2015, this kind of geyser, this mud volcano called the mud pot, was moving at 10 meters a year and increasing in speed.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 At one point, it moved 18 meters in a single day.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 So this mud volcano is just encroaching across America.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 It's getting closer and closer to the Union Pacific Railway tracks.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 And so they've had to build this massive wall.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 They built a wall that was 23 meters high by 37 long to try and stop it.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 And it didn't stop it at all.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 It's just gone underneath the wall.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Oh.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 And it's got out the other side.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 And it's still encroaching on the railway track.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 No one knows how to stop it.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 They've tried everything.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 I have heard of that.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 They call it the slowest moving emergency in America.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 I think it's technically a national emergency.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 It is technically a national emergency.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Sounds like it'd be a great B movie.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Well, it's like the blob.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 The blob, yeah.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Yes.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Yeah, it's dying for a Hollywood film producer.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Pick it up.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 I like the way you said it's kind of encroaching across America when actually it's gone about 20 meters towards some train tracks.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 It's gradual, but it will happen.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 Yeah, you have to look up for those gradual things.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Exactly.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 You know, keep your eyes peeled for the encroaching mud.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 I have a fact about mud and sport, actually, but a different sport completely.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 So mud has changed the shape of football players.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 And so it's soccer players were talking.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 Yeah, yes.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 So soccer players these days have much less mud to contend with.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 Right?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 True.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Because there used to be lots of pitches which were called mud baths.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 You know, it just gets churned up and it's just a nightmare.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Yeah.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 So since they've had fewer pitches like that, which are just basically swamps,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 the shape of football has been changing.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 And so you used to have to be just very muscular to deal with those conditions.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 You know, just to run in that.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 But now they're getting taller and leaner because they're just having to run a lot on this pristine grass that they're now going on the pitches.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 So that has literally changed their shapes.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Interesting.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 So Wayne Rooney is one of the last of his kind in many ways.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 He is.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Yes, he would have done well in those swamps, wouldn't he?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 Yeah.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 I mean, I'm not saying he looks like track.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 I'm just saying that he's a very strong man.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Exactly.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Yeah.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Yeah.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 I mean, he does look like track.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 He does a bit.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Yeah.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 And that is Chazinski.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 My fact this week is that in Brazil, women through C section parties were guests

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 served champagne and canopies while watching the host have a caesarian section through a viewing window.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Wow.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 That's a party.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 It's insane.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 From the home of parties as well, Brazil.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 I know.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 They have the greatest parties in Brazil.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Well, but I think if you're the originator of parties, then you always have to think outside of the box

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 and do things that seem insane to the rest of us.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 But these will be normal in 50 years.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Exactly. They're just experimenting with the next great party craze.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 They serve the canopies, but with a thick lid over them that you have to cut through and gradually extract

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 like a sausage roll at a time from.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 That's what I would do.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 I would theme it like that.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Good call.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Yeah.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 You should be involved in Caesarian party planning.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 Yeah.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 I think you'd be a welcome addition.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 So this is the thing that happens.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 It's quite a big deal.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 Caesarian is in Brazil.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 It's a bit of a data symbol.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 It's slightly about wealth and there was a very common.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 So 56% of all births now are Caesarians and 33%.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Our elective Caesarian.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 So people have just chosen to do that.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And that's compared to in the UK, I think, only 10% are elective.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 And even so, that's like the highest in Europe.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 And so it's a big deal because you are welcoming.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 And you're human to the world.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 So friends and family go to the hospital with the person who's going to give birth.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 And there's a gallery that's specially built for the purpose very often.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 So in São Paulo, I think there are a few of these.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 And they even have frosted windows.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 And then the windows turn transparent at the moment of birth.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 So cool.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 You don't have to watch all the boring stuff like the being injected and having a panic attack.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 But you do get to see the baby emerging.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 I would think you would turn them translucent or opaque for the moment of birth itself.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 And it is a beautiful thing.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 You don't see that.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 So I've been in the room for a Caesarian section.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 My wife had one with our son and Lee.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 That wasn't the one you were there for.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 No.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 But what they do is, so obviously you don't see everything that's going on.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 They have a big sheet that hangs above the tummy.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 And you're on the other side of it with the top half of your wife.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 It's a bit like a magic trick.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Do you pick the half of your wife that you are there with?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Yeah, you can.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 I pick the top half.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 No, it's good.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 I should have picked the left half.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 And then the baby comes up.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 And you'd see the baby once it's been removed, come up through the top.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And I imagine that's the same with these viewing windows.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 I think you can't do the whole thing happen.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 But it's not, I mean, I was reading a very funny entry in the Harvard Guide to Women's Health,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 which is just a very detailed description of all the ways you can give birth.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 And one of them says, a screen is usually placed between the woman's upper and lower body,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 so she does not have to view her internal organs.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 I feel like we're missing the most amazing bit of this story.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 I didn't realize we had windows that could go from frosted to translucent.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 That is the most amazing bit of the story.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 That's extraordinary.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 It's just a beautiful, wonderful thing, isn't it?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 You never really know until you see a window go from opaque to translucent.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Really what a wonderful, wonderful thing it is.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 In the very sadly, in the poor hospitals in Brazil,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 they just have lots of nurses who breathe incessantly on the window.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 And then they wipe them clear.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 You know in the really rich hospitals,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 you can change the furniture in the hospital suite if it clashes

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 with the decorations that you've got planned.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 There are quite opulent ones.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Oh wow.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Fair enough.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 They're actually designing a new one, I think, in São Paulo,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 which is going to be a 22-story high maternity ward.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 And it's going to happen.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 A very tall woman giving birth.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Or who intend to sort of project their baby up to the air?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 No, this is going to have a wine cellar and a ballroom.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Very cool.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 There's one woman on the planet, and I think only one woman

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 who has given herself a caesarian.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Okay.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Wow.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 I know.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 She's a lady called Inez Ramirez Perez.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 She's Mexican.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 And this was in the year 2000.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 She had six children already.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 So she had given birth before.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 And her husband was at a restaurant,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 which didn't have a phone, unfortunately.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 So she decided, right, I'm just going to go for it.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 And she literally cut into her abdomen to give birth to the baby.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 Wow.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 She had experienced butchering animals apparently.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 So she sort of, she knew what she was doing.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 That's amazing.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 But she drank pure alcohol, didn't she?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 To numb the pain.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Yeah.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 What was wrong with the olds?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Through the vagina.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Normal exit.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Well, sometimes that doesn't work out.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Okay.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 For various reasons.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 Yes.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 So I don't know why she, I think it, I don't know if this was her first choice.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Yes.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 It probably wasn't her first choice.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 No.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Give herself a stare at her home.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 She probably tried the vagina thing first.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 You're right.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 But she didn't.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Considered that maybe.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Maybe she did this.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Maybe she did this.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 If she did this as area, then she looked down and thought, oh, what's that thing?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 I've already got an opening down there.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Oh, I'm such a mug.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 You were saying, someone was saying that she had a history in agriculture.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Butchering.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Yeah.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Sorry.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Well, actually the first known woman to survive a C section was the wife of a pig cast writer.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Jacob Nufa.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 And that was in the 1500s.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 It's the first documented account we have.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 And apparently his job of castrating pigs helps him to know a lot about anatomy.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 And he managed to take the baby out and then sew her up and she was fine.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 So he did it.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Yeah.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 And she had five more children including a set of twins afterwards.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Wow.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Although the source I saw it in did say some source is questioning the reliability of this story.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Oh.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Because it was first written about nearly a century after it happened.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 But it's usually accepted as the first C section where the women survived.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 This whole sort of craze of having relatives and friends what she giving birth.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 So that isn't a new thing at all.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 It was done, we know it was done in France in 1778, Marie Antoinette.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 She had a whole crowd come bursting through the door as soon as it was announced that she was giving birth.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And it was almost crushed to death. They were holding up bits of wall.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 What?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Yeah. So when she was giving birth 200 people ended up being in the bed chamber.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 That's stressful.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 To witness the event.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 Yeah.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 So there was an obstetrician yelled out the queen is going to give birth.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 And that's when the hordes of people started coming in.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 But this happened all the time.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 So Queen Mary in England, the wife of James II, she was giving birth in 1688.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 And that was what the century before.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 And there were 67 people in the room which she thought was far too many.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 She actually asked, she was so embarrassed that she asked the king to put his wig over her face.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Is that the bitch she wanted to hide?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Well, I guess it meant she didn't have to look at the 67 people in the room.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 Yeah.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 And if you put it on the other part, then the baby's going to come out with a hilarious wig on its head.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Well, that would be amazing.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 There was an interesting theory about the conspiracy theory was born off the back of this.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 And this was put out by the Protestants.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 They thought that the baby was still born and that another baby had been snuck in.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 And that's why you would have people who saw the birth, right?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Because then you knew that it wasn't going to be, you knew that it was a proper birth.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 But despite the 67 people in the room, there were theories put around that the baby had died and then been replaced by the baby of a nursing maid.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 And all of the having a wig over your face while you're giving birth still didn't gill off the conspiracy theory.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 There was a theory that had been smuggled in in a warming pan, which was like a hot water bottle equipment.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 And as a result, there was a tradition where you would have to have someone sort of witness that the actual royal baby was the royal baby.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 So when Queen Elizabeth II was born or current Queen, that was part of the thing.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 There was someone standing outside.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Isn't that like the whole section?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 So it would now be sedged, Javid, just sort of lingering in the room.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 I thought that was for all royal babies.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Sorry, is it not?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 I think there's a quite a lot.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 So I thought that it stopped though.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 I thought it stopped with, well, it did stop.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 But the home secretary was there.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 Not the sedged, Javid.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 The then home secretary was there when Queen Elizabeth was born.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 And then in 1948, she herself was pregnant.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 And they were debating, should we invite the home secretary?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 We've been a long guest list already.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Do we have the seating space?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 So she wasn't involved in, she was then Princess Elizabeth.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 And she was not involved in the discussion.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 It was the King, George VI, talking to his personal secretary, saying,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 "Shall we have the home secretary along?"

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 And Elizabeth said, "I think we should have him along eventually."

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 She was piped up and said, "No, it's important."

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 So they invited him.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 But then, awkwardness of organisms, though the King's secretary, his private secretary,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 bumped into the Canadian High Commissioner.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 And the Canadian High Commissioner said, "Oh, here there's going to be a baby.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 I assume you're inviting representatives of all the Dominions."

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 What?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 And then, so that meant there would then have to be seven ministers

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 who would probably be sitting in the corridor outside.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 They wouldn't actually be in the room.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 But they decided, no, we can't have everybody.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 So it just was a party that got out of hand, basically.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Wow.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 So that's when they said, "No, no more home secretary."

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 So you did get to go.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Do you know that there's no good reason why we will give birth lying down?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 And I know a lot of people don't.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 There are various different positions.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 But the established position for thousands of years was in a chair.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 So a birthing chair.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 And you see birthing chairs since 1450 BC.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 So they've been around for like 3,500 years.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 And it does make sense.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 A bit of gravity helping.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 Yeah.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Precisely. And it's actually kind of more comfortable.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 Is there a hole in the chair?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Yeah.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 That's even clever, actually.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 I know.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 They look like a toilet seat, but quite an all-nate, nice toilet seat.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Because you don't want to sit on an actual toilet seat while you're giving birth.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 And apparently it replaced the tradition of sitting on your partner's lap

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 or your birthing partner's lap while you were giving birth.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Oh.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Which I think sometimes people find useful.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 And lying down, there's no particular reason that's any better at all.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 The only reason lying down was introduced was in the late 19th century,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 which is this big change in childbirth practice when it went from being a female thing to a male thing.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 So traditionally men just weren't in the room at all.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Oh, sorry, right.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Sorry.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 I thought it was still a people thing.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Oh, you've got a real shut coming.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Yeah.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Right through that.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 You're right through me.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 But just to add a sort of modern birthing,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 I don't want to make a sweeping statement about this,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 but from what we were told and from people I know who give birth,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 it's not really.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 It's kind of a Hollywood thing that you think people give birth on their back these days.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 Most are sitting up.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Most of these beds are put into a sit-up position.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 And that's how birth is happening.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 Yeah.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 You turn to see that propped up, I think, in films, even.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 But it wasn't thought that you would do it without your legs on the ground,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 sitting on your wooden chair.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 And the only reason then you were put on a bed and leaning back a bit is

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 because birthing, change your being a female thing to a male thing,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 where a male doctor was let in because females weren't doctors.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 And then they had to see inside the vagina to see what was going on.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 So it's just to make it easier for the doctor that they can see right up inside you.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 It's actually quite fun when you go into rooms these days because it looks a bit like an escape room.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 They have like, you love escape rooms.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 I mean, you and James, you...

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 And there is an ultimate escape happening for the little guy inside.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 It's like, escape the womb.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 Yeah.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 Escape rooms, exactly.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 And they have bits on the wall that if you imagine you were climbing a wall,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 a rock climb wall, they have that so that women can hold on to it.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 They just need to move around and do...

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 Right.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 They have bouncy balls everywhere.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Was that the NHS building?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 They had the climbing wall.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 They don't have a...

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Yeah, she gave birth, 20 feet up.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 Wow, and you had actually a baseball backstop to catch the baby, didn't you?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 Have you had a sub fumigating?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 No, but let's guess what it is.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Okay.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Fumigation is something to do with smoke.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Yep.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 And sub means below.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Yeah.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 So smoke below yourself.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 Pretty close.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 Is it blowing smoke up a woman's bottom to get the baby to come out of the vagina?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 I mean, it's...

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 I think the pie halves.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Charlie, that's not how biology works.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 It's not how biology works.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 You're absolutely right.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 But it's kind of...

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 It's not so far off weirdly.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 So this is an Anglo-Saxon thing where you have a pregnant lady

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 and you want her to give birth.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 So you get a load of disgusting stuff,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 like capoo and shavings of horses who's in fish eyes.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 And you burn all of these on a big fire,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 and then you bring in the mother to be.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 And the idea is that her womb is so disgusted by the smell

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 that it contracts and it pushes the baby out.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Wow, do we think it maybe works in some way?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 I don't know.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Imagine at the time they did.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 I imagine at the end of it they went.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 And that, my friends, is how biology works.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 Wow.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 Yeah, I don't know if it worked.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 I can't think of how it might, but...

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 I guess a strong physical reaction might be smelling salt,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 but for a womb.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 And then you would wretch some of your muscles.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Yeah.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 It might make your muscles contract.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Let's not try to justify sort of 2,000 year old barbaric practices.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 You never know who's going to start bringing them back in.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 I'm a feminist, but I really love the old.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 You plume up the vagina.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that when Samuel Johnson visited Paris,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 he worried that his French wasn't good enough,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 so he spent the whole time speaking and Latin.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 So this is Samuel Johnson of Dictionary Fame.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 And this is from an article in Oxford University Press,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 which is more about why elitist politicians,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Riesmog,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 often drop Latin into their conversations.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 And it's a by a guy called Gordon Campbell,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 who is a fellow in Renaissance studies at the University of Leicester.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 So we'll get onto Samuel Johnson later.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 But basically what he's saying is that during the Renaissance,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 this became a really, really common thing all over Europe,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 and it's what kind of brought rich Europeans together.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 And quite ironically now, it's the British politicians

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 who aren't particularly keen on Europe

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 who are often dropping Latin into conversation.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 And it all comes from the fact that the old British universities

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 had this kind of pro-European stance.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Well, the Renaissance was all about a revival of classical...

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 Everything, classical, everything.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 That's why Renaissance, it was the rebirth, wasn't it?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 ...of that era.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 It was kind of throwing out the Middle Ages and saying

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 "We want to co-bat to the classical times."

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 Yeah, and so he actually spoke Latin or by his account?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 Or was this by Boswell's account?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 It was by Boswell's account.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Yeah, of course, we can't trust everything that he said.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 But it's like his official biography.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 So it's where we get most of our information about Johnson.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 And he said that while he did go into France and spoke Latin

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 with what he called wonderful fluency and elegance,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 his English pronunciation meant that no one understood the word he was saying anyway.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 I read a blog called Latin Language Blog.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 It's someone who just loves writing about modern day usage

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 as well as old.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And he did a list of people who are alive today who can speak Latin,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 sort of a list of people you wouldn't expect of who could.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 You know, Penn and Teller, the magicians.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 Yeah.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 There's the silent one and there's the one who...

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 The silent one can speak every language on earth.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 Yeah.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 But he just never says anything.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 Exactly.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 It is actually him who can do Latin.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 He's not silent.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 That's the thing.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 He's just trying in his head to work out the right verb ending.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Tom Hiddleston, who is Loki in the Thor series and the Avengers series.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 And Loki's a Latin word.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Exactly.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Yeah.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Is it Norse?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 No.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 As in Loki, as in the place like a...

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 Sorry.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Yeah.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 Come on.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 You actually studied Latin.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Yeah.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 I just didn't realize that you were speaking about him in the...

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 No, I'm not sure if I could do accusative.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 And then two more.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Robocop, the person who played Robocop.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Yeah.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 Peter Weller.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 He teaches Roman and Renaissance art.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 And he supposedly can write or he studied Latin.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 And lastly, 50,000 people in Finland.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Oh, you buried the lead there.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 What do you mean?

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 Well, Finland, there's a lot of people who do...

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 In fact, a thing that we're writing in our upcoming book is about how a radio show there used to do news bulletins in Latin.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 And it's because there are 50,000 people there who can understand what's being said.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Samuel Johnson?

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 Yeah.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 So Samuel Johnson was a great character really and quite a lovable guy.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 He had all sorts of habits that I didn't know about.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 So most famous, obviously, for his dictionary, maybe the most influential dictionary ever in the English language.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 But as a person, he had these strange ticks.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 So he had really ritualized movements.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 So, for instance, when he was walking through a door before he did so, he had to do this weird whirling and twisting motion.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 And then perform multiple ritualized gesticulations.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 And then, apparently, going to someone who knew him, as soon as he'd finished, he would give a sudden spring

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 and make such an extensive stride over the threshold as if he were trying to wager how far he could stride.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 And this was what he would do repeatedly.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 He was very, very superstitious, or some people speculated now he had OCD or something.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 Some people think he might have had Tourette.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 Some people think he had Tourette to talk to himself a lot.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 He used to collect orange peels.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 Did he?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 Yeah, no one fully knew why.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 They think probably medicinal purposes.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 There might have been a craze or an idea that it could have helped you in some sort of...

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 But we don't really know, but we do know he collected orange peels.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 It could just be this slightly obsessive tendency he had.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Yeah, touching every lamp post as he walked on Fleet Street.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Lots of things like that.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 Did he?

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 Yeah.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 It's hard to know if he just did that once or twice.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 Or if he collected an orange peel once.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Or if he was Europe's foremost orange peel collector.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 I mean, we just don't know.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 I was reading his dictionary.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Great.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 I was reading someone who's read his dictionary.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 It was an article by them.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 But there's quite a few fun definitions in there that I never appreciated.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 So, for example, Sock was something put between the shoe and the foot.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Very sort of basic description.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 But then he would say stuff like for Lizard, he would describe that the definition would be an animal resembling a serpent with legs attached to it.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Like just sort of...

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 That tells me what a lizard is.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Exactly. And my favorite one, Euronator, what do you think he defined a Euronator as a baseball player?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Very good grip.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Yes!

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 No, it was a diver.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Someone who searches underwater and a diver was a Euronator back in the day.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 Is that right?

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Yeah, so in this context, this article says, "Euronator derives from Euronai, a Latin word to mean to dive."

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 There are lots of words that didn't get into the dictionary.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 In his dictionary?

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 Yeah, so you know there's a whole black adder episode about him leaving out the word sausage.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 Yes.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 So he only has 42,000 words in his dictionary, which is obviously massive and a huge labour of love.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 But at the time, the English language had between 250 and 300,000 words.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 So he missed out loads of biggies, which were in big use.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Like nemesis, banknotes, zinc, euphemism.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Yeah, I can see the look on your face as you go down this list and you're thinking, "Was big use the right phrase?"

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 Was the biggie here?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 Amos, Amos didn't get it.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Amos?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 That's a biggie.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Yeah.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Zenky would think he would do because you think he'd be struggling for sex.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Well, there were no X words in his dictionary.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 We're there.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 He just completely missed the letter.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Really?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 And that was actually something of an improvement because previous English dictionaries missed WX and Y altogether.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Yeah, so he actually, he was improving by improving.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 Missed W.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Yeah, that's a big letter.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 That is quite a big letter.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Yeah.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 That's an enormous letter.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Yeah.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 Well, I and J were combined in Johnson's dictionary.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 Yeah.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 They were all modelled up.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 But that's true in the old English, isn't it?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 It was more recent that J became a letter.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 So maybe they spelled the W words with a U or with a V.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 Yes, yeah.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 You mentioned Blackadder as well.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 So in the episode of Blackadder, there's a big joke.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 So Samuel Johnson's in the episode, he's just finished his dictionary.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 And Blackadder tries to pick out words that aren't in there.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 And the thing he picks out famously in the episode is Ardvark.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Yeah.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Ardvark's not in there.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 And it wasn't in Johnson's dictionary.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 But it's not a word he missed out because it didn't enter the language until the year after he died.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Oh.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Yeah.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 Just a few more words that are in that book in the dictionary.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 And that's Eferus, which means producing ducks.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Nice.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 OK.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Don't know what that means.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 What that's about.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 He had a thing about ducks.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 He wrote a poem about ducks.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 Or a short-- I think he did a very easy word to rhyme with, isn't it?

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 It is.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 And he had a filthy mind.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 He also was one of the reasons-- one of the reasons the dictionary was so famous.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 And such a transitor in the dictionary world was because he was the first person to use citations.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Do you use quotations as examples of where words could be used?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 And he used these really imaginatively.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 So for fart, the word fart, it was written as fart, noun, wind from behind.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 And then with the poem by a guy called John Suckling, who I hadn't heard of, which goes,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 "Love is the fart of every heart.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 It pains a man when tears kept close and others doth offend when tears let loose."

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 That's a great-- it's a lovely poem.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 It's a lovely poem.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 That's good.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Suckling was great.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 I'll see.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 He was one of a group called the Cavalier Puppets, who were active around the time of the Civil War.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 And they were royalists, obviously.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 But they all had great names like Suckling and Lovelace and Carey, and they had all these very romantic names.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Just one more thing on Samuel Johnson.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Yeah.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 He was such a nice guy.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 So I had no idea that he lived in this kind of commune that he built up of people who were destitute

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 and suffering in life.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 So he had all these friends from various walks of life.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 He lived with a blind woman called Mrs. Williams, who actually he would take to various places,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 until he looked after and he funded her life.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 He lived with someone called Robert Levette, who was basically his best friend in life,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 who was a guy who was sort of a-- claimed to be a doctor, but worked as a waiter in Paris,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 and Eve's dropped on doctor's conversations and become kind of an apothecary.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 And what he was doing, he had Francis Barber, who was sort of like a son to him, really,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 but he was a black boy.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 And this was in the mid 1700s, and Johnson left all of his money and his property to him.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 And that was quite controversial, and the other people who lived with him thought,

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 "You know, how come you're treating him like one of us, like one equal level?"

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 And Johnson would say, "If he ever needed anything, Johnson would insist that he Johnson would go out and get it,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 and would never let anyone tell Barber to go out and get it."

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 And yeah, he sort of collected these people who were treated badly by society,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 lived with them all, funded all of their lives, apparently very rude to people of his own social standing,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 but anyone who had suffered in life, he took them in.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 Very cool. That's nice.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 He had a patron who did not patronise him very well, his patron gave him £10 once, and that was it.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 Wow. I know.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 I would say that is quite patronising. It is.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 My fact this week is that YouTube was created because one of its founders couldn't find an online video of Janet Jackson's breast being exposed at the Super Bowl halftime show.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 That's amazing. So what I find really interesting about YouTube is it's not that old.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 No, right? It's not. Maybe that's just me being old.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 But it's like there was quite a lot of internet before YouTube came along, and it's amazing because it just seems like it was ubiquitous your whole life.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 2005, that's when we got YouTube, and so the Super Bowl was in 2004.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 There was this big moment, I don't know if you guys remember it, but it was a big moment.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 It lasted a very quick, the timing of it is so tiny of how much time.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 It's time, her nipple spent on screen, but it's 9/16 of a second. I know that through looking it up, not through quickly looking it up.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Not on your VHS pause.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 But yeah, so it was one of the co-founders who was called Jawid Karim, who was looking for this video, couldn't find it until there needs to be a better way of it.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 Now there was a second reason YouTube was created. There are three creators in total, the other two are Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, and they both were trying to upload a video when they were at a dinner party.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 And found that impossible to do as well. So the three of them got together and said there has to be a better way about this, and that is how YouTube came about.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 It's not the only effect that Super Bowl moment had.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 So I think lots of people were surprised by what they'd seen, and they wanted to find a way of watching it again.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 So Tivo subscriptions, where you could pause and rewind TV, they jumped exponentially, and the DVR, where you could record things from TV on a hard drive into your home, that became a thing as well.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 So yeah, there were other consequences, but YouTube is probably the biggest by a long way.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 Yeah, the first video ever on YouTube was by this guy, Java Karim, and it was called Me at the Zoo. It lasted 18 seconds, and it's just him in front of some elephants saying the cool thing about these guys is they have really, really, really long trunks.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 Pretty much, and then he goes, he doesn't do it in a Bolton accent. And then he goes, that's pretty much all there is to say.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 And if you think about the historical things, like the first things like come here, what's and I need you or whatever, you know, the first things that have ever been said in various media, and that was the first thing that was ever said on YouTube.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 Yeah, and all it makes me think is he's not a man after our hearts, because that is absolutely not all there is to say about elephants.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 No, no, they have big ears as well. He is. He has no social media though, like a lot of them. So Java Karim has no social media at all, I don't think, except for his YouTube sort of site where would you call it when you have a YouTube profile?

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 It's a channel channel, thank you. YouTube channel where I think he's only ever posted that one video, and I think he dangled the prospect of another video in the last year or so, and people are very excited about that.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 They show them the giraffes. They have really, really, really long tongues. You didn't think I was going to say that, did you?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 But yeah, actually, he did return to the comments page of that video a while ago to make a big point as well, because he's one of the three owners that kind of stepped back from it.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 He really knew that he was part of the ownership of it until it was sold, and then it suddenly emerged that this guy was getting a huge cut of it. People obviously knew it, but they weren't the Zuckerberg names that were associated with it.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 Chen and Hurley, I don't actually know that well either, but people did recognize them as the creators. And it was the fact that they tried to change the comments on YouTube to be that you have to have a Google account in order to do it.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 A Google plus account, you could only comment then, and he didn't have one, so he left a comment under his first video, the first ever video published on YouTube to say, "What the fuck is this? I don't have."

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 He was the f-word, really?

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 I mean, considering they bought Google bought YouTube after them for $1.65 billion.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 And he made something like $67 million off it?

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 Yeah, it feels like it's the least he can do. Let them do that.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 It's amazing. It was about 20 months from the first video being uploaded to being sold for $1.00 billion, it was huge.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 And initially, there was so little on there that you couldn't pick what videos you wanted to watch.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 It just played them automatically to you.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 How was that?

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 So, like, because let's say there's a hundred videos, you just had to cycle through the hundreds, right?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 Yeah, basically.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 And there was so few on there that he, Curian, put up lots of videos which he'd taken of 747s taking off and landing,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 because there was just nothing on the site. There were so few videos there, they posted adverts on Craigslist in LA and Las Vegas,

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 offering women $20 to put videos of themselves on the website, partly because they thought it would be a dating website.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 They did, so it was meant to be a sort of follow-on from hotornot.com, which I can't believe is that old.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 This was the follow-on from that, but do you remember that site?

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 I don't remember that, no.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 Oh, wow.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 Not just the answer.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 So, hotornot.com was basically where you could upload photos of people, and then other people could rate how hotornot they were.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 It was not very woke, and neither was the idea that conceived YouTube.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 So, that was when they first came up with the idea of YouTube, was when they thought,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 "Well, let's make a video version of this," because hotornot was revolutionary in a way.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 We had no idea about it at the time, but I think it was basically the first instance that anyone could upload their own content and share and range of this content.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 Isn't it amazing that we had Facebook initially started with Zuckerberg doing the thing where it compared female university students.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 Face and mash.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 It started out as a man.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 I think that was partly inspired by hotornot as well.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 Right.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 So, hotornot helped us spawn these two huge things.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 Yeah, but then do you remember at ages ago on the podcast, we did the fact that IMDB was set up originally to log actresses with beautiful eyes.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 So, all of these big things that we have are actually these...

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 Poor men.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 Well, when they put up the advert on Craigslist asking women to put up videos of themselves for $20 each, not a single woman replied.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 And it was not hugely successful at first just because there was so little on there, and it only got big.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 They went to a Silicon Valley party and they met a former PayPal executive, because the other two founders used to work for PayPal.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 And he said, "This sounds interesting. Tell me more about it."

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 So, they went to the bedroom of the host of this party, they turned on his PC, and they watched every single video on YouTube, which at the time took half an hour.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 How long do you think that would take now?

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 It would probably be like the end of the solar system, right?

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 I think it's something like they upload 100 hours of footage.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 People upload 100 hours of footage every minute.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 So, I'm really bothered.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 So, actually it would go on forever.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Forever, yeah.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 It would be a very different party.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 I was reading, they did a list of which countries watch YouTube most per day.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 So annoyed myself, I didn't get a timestamp on this, so I can't tell you what year this was.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 But I assume it must be recent, at least since 2005.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 I'm sure.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 What country do you think came at the top of the list?

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 Is it absolute hours or is it per person?

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 90 million daily views is what the...

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 Indonesia?

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 I wouldn't say China.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 Maybe big country.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Lots of people.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 Saudi Arabia.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Whoa.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 Yeah, came at the top of the list.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 Wow.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Because it said there were so many restrictions on other websites there.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 They don't get Facebook, Twitter.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 Right.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 This is their place for entertainment.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 This is where they go.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Well, it is the third biggest channel in the UK.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 As in, you've got BBC One, ITV.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 And then the next biggest one is YouTube.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 And the next biggest one is Netflix.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 And then you've got Channel 4 and Channel 5 and BBC 2 and all that kind of thing.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 Really?

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Yep.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 So the average British...

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 The average British adult watches 34 minutes of YouTube a day compared to 37 minutes of ITV and 48 minutes of BBC One.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 And I reckon if you went to under 30s, then it might be number one or number two.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 Yeah.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Number three.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 Have you guys heard of petite tube?

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 No.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 Can you guess what it is?

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 Okay.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 It's not a creepy thing.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 It's a small version of YouTube.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 This is a petite, doesn't it?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 Yeah, kind of.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Is it a YouTube just for Philip Pettit, the guy who climbs across...

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 Go back one.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 I'll give you a closer with your progress.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 So it's...

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 Is it only really, really?

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 So it's videos of really small things like Thimbles.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 That's really...

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 Like Thimbles, Thimbles are small.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 That's a personal thing.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 Let's get one of those giant Thimbles there these days.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 No, it's... Okay.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 Over a third of YouTube videos have fewer than 10 views in total.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 Ah.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 Right?

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 So there is a website called Pettit, which only links onto videos which have had no views at all.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 And I...

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 And you can click and refresh.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 And there are quite a few...

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 That's a really nice idea.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 Most of them are just clips of, like family birthday parties or somebody filming their kid for 10 seconds.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 But, though, you know, how to pronounce indelicate.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 I clicked on.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 There's a clip of a pony eating grass for 10 seconds.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 But these things will no longer be on that site right now.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 Because you've watched it.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 I think they get taken off.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 Although a couple of them had two or three views.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 So I thought I might have been played.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 I mean, it's quite sweet and quite weird.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 But also they are very, very boring.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 Yeah.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 Unsurprisingly.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 You know how YouTube has a lot of meme stars, you know, internet meme stars.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 Yeah.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 So let's say one that died this year, Grumpy Cat, for example.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 Keyboard Cat was a big YouTube star.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 Yeah, we own our keyboard cat.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 So it's quite a big thing.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 The paws are going up and down on a keyboard as if they're playing it.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Yeah.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 And then there's music in the background.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 It looks like it's the one with the stiff limbs.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 Yeah, but it's not really playing a piano.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 Yeah.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 But keyboard cat is dead.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 What?

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 Yes.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 He died or she died.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 In 1987.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 No.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 18 years before YouTube was invented.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 What?

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 No.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 I'm amazed by this and I only just heard of keyboard.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 This is like the sixth sense of cat videos.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 That's amazing.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 What do you mean?

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 Yeah.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 So how has this cat appeared on YouTube?

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 The video was taken in 1984.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 The year I was born and it was uploaded in 2007.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 So it's like basically in 10 years time if they invent a new kind of medium where there's holograms that appear on tables and entertain you.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 And then Dan is the most famous hologram entertainer because they use some of the videos that you've done.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 And you become massively famous, but you're, well actually...

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 When did Dan die?

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 Dan's got seven years to live with the scenario.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 I'm going to say you don't look so well today.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 That's something that I don't feel it.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 I think you'll admit that similarly got out of control James.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 From the start it was over ambitious.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 Okay, that is it.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000

 Do go there.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 It's a very exciting time to be there.

 Lots of things going on.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 New book.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 Lots of tours.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 Get tickets for that.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
