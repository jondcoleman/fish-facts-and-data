17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:38,760
 from on with the podcast.

18
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,800
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

19
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,500
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

20
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,360
 with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Sarah Pascoe and once again we have gathered

21
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,800
 around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,000
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Sarah.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,660
 Okay, my fact is that the man who invented Pringles was buried in a Pringles can.

24
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:22,840
 He was tiny. He was very small, you've seen him, the guy with the moustache on the wrong

25
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,560
 face. He doesn't have a body. They employed four but they only needed one. So they passed

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,760
 him like in a relay race. He was the baton, yes.

27
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,040
 So I should add he wanted to be buried in a Pringles can because I think he was very

28
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,160
 proud and actually it's quite an interesting story I think. So the back story is for this,

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,940
 in 1968 Pringles went on sale, advertised as Pringles Newfangled Potato Chips. That

30
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,420
 was their full name, they're not called that anymore because of one of the five Pringles

31
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,460
 dramas that I'm going to be telling you about which doesn't even include being buried in

32
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:03,340
 a Pringles can. So back story, 1939 I don't know if you know there was quite a big war

33
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,020
 and crisps were deemed non-essential and they stopped making them. They brought them back

34
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,760
 after the war and they were rubbish. They were really greasy, apparently there was loads

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,020
 of air in the bags and all the crisps were broken.

36
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,020
 This war sounds horrible.

37
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:20,440
 I know. And that was the worst thing that happened to anyone. So people really moaned

38
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,800
 about the crisps. I'm sure they had other things to also moan about but they were like

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,480
 we're miserable, let us have cheap tasty snacks. And so Proctor and Gamble they started trying

40
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,280
 to invent something better. In 1956 they employed a chemist and mathematician Frederick T. Bauer

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,260
 to invent a new kind of potato chip that was more palatable. He spent two years inventing

42
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,180
 a saddle shaped, the mathematical term is hyperbolic paraboloid, a saddle shaped chip

43
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,300
 that would go in a tubular can, which meant there would be no air in it and they wouldn't

44
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,300
 get broken but they tasted rubbish. So he got moved on to.

45
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,020
 Why the saddle shape? Because you could just do a round in the same tube. You could absolutely

46
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,340
 fit that in. I wonder what it gave you.

47
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,120
 No, they're not stronger. Are they maybe stronger? They might be.

48
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,000
 They're stronger than a flat for sure. Okay, and if they have to be that thin.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 There's quite a lot of buildings made in that shape for instance. There's a velodrome

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,960
 in London, Constance. That's one. Name ten. Name ten Pringle buildings.

51
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,200
 I don't think I could name ten buildings under this kind of pressure.

52
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,560
 No, you're right. You're right. But quite often in buildings you'll have odd shapes

53
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,680
 and it will be to do with strength and support and something. Maybe it was just aesthetically

54
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,060
 pleasing for a mathematician to sort of go this shape will fit together.

55
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,500
 I can give you a reason why they're stronger because they just thought of one.

56
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,540
 I only want nine more. It's because they have two arches. So you know an arch is a strong

57
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:47,500
 shape. Now a Pringle has two arches. One goes in one direction and the other one goes in

58
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,700
 the opposite direction. And so you've got two arches which are both strong and they're

59
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,020
 both fighting against each other. So it makes it super strong.

60
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,740
 That's really cool. Can I ask you a question because you seem

61
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,820
 to know a lot about this. Is that the same with feet?

62
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,280
 Yeah, that's exactly the same with feet. So that's why feet.

63
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,760
 Oh, so there's your second Pringle shape.

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,800
 That's why feet are so delicious.

65
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,860
 Yeah. Okay, so they made one that was disgusting.

66
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,920
 Yeah, so he made one that was disgusting but it fitted together really neatly. So he was

67
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,920
 moved to a different snack. I couldn't find out which snack he was moved to.

68
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
 Right.

69
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,760
 But he was moved somewhere else. But then a couple of years later they came back to

70
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,040
 his idea. Val was granted the painting in 1971 and they came up with a new recipe which

71
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,980
 was paste of dehydrated potatoes, rice, corn and wheat. They used a cookie cutter to make

72
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,460
 them that shape flat and then they put them on a saddle thing that Bower had invented to

73
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,460
 give them the shape.

74
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,900
 Oh, I didn't know there was a saddle shape that they sat on to be baked to it.

75
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,900
 I guess that is the saddle.

76
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,900
 Yeah, that's the saddle.

77
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,900
 The Pringle is the drocky.

78
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
 Exactly.

79
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,900
 Riding that saddle.

80
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,900
 Yeah.

81
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,900
 Yeah.

82
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,580
 So lots and lots of work. And he didn't just invent Pringles, he also invented freeze-dried

83
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,940
 ice cream that other snacks were always popular.

84
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,300
 He was really proud of his freeze-dried ice cream, wasn't he?

85
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,300
 Yeah, of course. We didn't get buried in one.

86
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,280
 Is that like astronaut ice cream, the freeze-dried?

87
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,160
 Basically it's just add milk. And then you have ice cream.

88
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,460
 Well, you have to freeze it as well.

89
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,440
 You have to freeze it and add milk. I'm not exactly sure what was remaining after that.

90
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,960
 That's the same as making instant coffee. I think that's completely fair enough because

91
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,480
 you have to pour hot water in it.

92
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 Yeah.

93
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
 Yeah.

94
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,880
 I like that we don't know who the original Pringle was because the original was Pringle's

95
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,500
 newfangled potato chips and it was Pringle's apostrophe 's.

96
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,660
 Oh, yes. There's a few theories.

97
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,660
 Mr. Pringle, you know.

98
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,700
 There's a few theories, but they're all really boring.

99
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
 Yeah, yeah.

100
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,340
 I did think, oh, maybe this will be juicy. And it's like, oh, there's a guy called Mark

101
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:40,460
 Pringle who's named as one of the people on the patent. And two people lived on Pringle

102
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,460
 Road.

103
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,460
 Yeah.

104
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,460
 They weren't at the factory.

105
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,340
 But they were going to call them Winkles, weren't they?

106
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,340
 Were they?

107
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,900
 Yeah. I think they paid an advertising company to say, "What should we call this thing?"

108
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,560
 And the advertising company came back and said, "Let's call them Winkles."

109
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
 Wow.

110
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,920
 And they thought, "No, that sounds a bit like a willy."

111
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
 It's a bad seller.

112
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,640
 Can I just quickly say, Frederick was cremated and then his ashes were put in there.

114
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
 Oh, yeah.

115
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
 He wasn't buried.

116
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
 Yeah.

117
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,720
 Oh, everyone listening knew that, I think.

118
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
 Yeah.

119
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 I did.

120
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
 I did.

121
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
 But I really liked that it was only most of him got into the tube.

122
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
 Yeah.

123
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,720
 I think there was a lot of him after the cremation. So the overflow went in an urn classic.

124
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
 Yes.

125
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,260
 I've got most of it out of the tube. But his son, Larry, was interviewed in Time Magazine

126
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,260
 all about it after he died.

127
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,260
 Yeah.

128
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,260
 When did he die? About 2008, I think.

129
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,260
 2008, exactly.

130
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,980
 Yeah. And he was interviewed by Time Magazine because that's, you know, it's important stuff.

131
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,060
 And he said, Larry Bauer said, "My siblings and I briefly debated what flavour to use,

132
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,740
 but I said, 'Look, we need to use the original.'"

133
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
 Yeah.

134
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
 Which I think is fair.

135
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,740
 Yeah.

136
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,740
 Not the original original, which tasted like shit.

137
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,480
 I've written a list of all some of the Pringle flavours in his book, and these are, a lot

138
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,320
 of them are special, so they weren't out in every country all the time.

139
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
 Right.

140
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,600
 But here's some. "Shout if you like it. Ketchup, zesty lime and chilli, chilli, cheese dog,

141
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,080
 pizza-licious, buffalo wing, low-fat, jalapeno, honey mustard, cheesy fries."

142
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,440
 Oh, low-fat. Was that a flavour?

143
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
 Low-fat flavour.

144
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
 Oh.

145
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,440
 "Onion blossom, scream and deal pickle, pumpkin pie spice, soft-shelled crab, shrimp, which

146
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,500
 was pink, seaweed, which was green, blueberry, hazelnut, lemon, sesame, mushroom soup, eggs

147
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,060
 Benedict and hot, diggity dog."

148
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,060
 Oh, diggity.

149
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,060
 That's my one.

150
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,060
 Thank you.

151
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,060
 I'll have hot, diggity dog.

152
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,060
 Thank you.

153
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,180
 Imagine if someone comes to you at the Pringle's restaurant and has to go through all those.

154
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,180
 Yeah.

155
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,100
 Every single person's going to order hot, diggity dog, aren't they?

156
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,100
 Yeah, exactly.

157
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,100
 Well, one of the smaller Pringle dramas, and I was so impressed by this.

158
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,100
 Yeah.

159
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
 They've had two flavours recalled because of salmonella.

160
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,100
 No.

161
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,100
 Which is amazing.

162
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,260
 It was something with such a low food content.

163
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
 Wow.

164
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,500
 I don't know if there wasn't that.

165
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
 Yeah.

166
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,900
 Cheeseburger and taco night were both taken off the show.

167
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
 Very nice.

168
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
 Salmonella.

169
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,220
 Well, did you know that of all these flavours, quite a few of them are vegan options.

170
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,220
 Oh, they were vegan.

171
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,220
 Yeah.

172
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,220
 So, has that changed now?

173
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,220
 One of the dramas.

174
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,220
 Oh.

175
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,220
 Drama number.

176
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,220
 I hope you're counting at home.

177
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,380
 I've got it as drama number four.

178
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,880
 Pringle's added milk.

179
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
 Oh.

180
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,100
 And apparently from the articles online, vegans were in uproar, but I know quite a few vegans.

181
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
 Right.

182
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,580
 They just choose other snacks now.

183
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,580
 Right.

184
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,580
 Yeah, yeah.

185
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,580
 You're vegan, aren't you?

186
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
 Yeah.

187
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
 How many Pringles can you have?

188
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,580
 Can you have the original?

189
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,580
 You can't have any.

190
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,580
 You can't have any.

191
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,580
 Look, they added milk to it as they used to be plant-based.

192
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,580
 Every single one.

193
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,580
 Right.

194
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,300
 And something to do with the adhesion of the flavour, it's in that textured, hydrolyzed

195
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
 vegetable protein.

196
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
 Oh.

197
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
 I've got another controversy.

198
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,300
 Oh.

199
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
 What was it?

200
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
 What was it, Pringles?

201
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
 I'm saying dramas.

202
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
 Pringles dramas.

203
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,300
 Yeah.

204
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
 Because I don't want them to sue me.

205
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,300
 Okay.

206
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
 Because I've had too many court cases.

207
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
 Wait, wait, wait.

208
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
 Let's try and put...

209
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
 I say Sarah does have this.

210
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
 Yeah, definitely.

211
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,300
 Yeah.

212
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,700
 This is... it's a rumour that went around.

213
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
 Oh.

214
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
 And it's about Bauer himself.

215
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
 Oh.

216
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
 It sort of relates to the fact, actually.

217
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
 Oh, okay.

218
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,700
 Okay.

219
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,340
 Was the Pringles creator cremated and sold to customers?

220
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,340
 Oh.

221
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,340
 And is he vegan?

222
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,340
 I wonder if it's not vegan.

223
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,340
 Yeah.

224
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,340
 Every single can.

225
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,340
 Humans in it.

226
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,340
 Yeah.

227
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
 No, it's the answer.

228
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
 Imagine.

229
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
 The answer is no.

230
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,340
 Yeah, yeah.

231
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,340
 Snopes did a pretty quick debunk of that one.

232
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,340
 Right.

233
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,220
 But that did the rounds on the internet a while after he died.

234
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,220
 Okay.

235
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,220
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,860
 It would be, because you know how they always say that in every glass of water, like two

237
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,460
 of the molecules had been weed out by Julius Caesar or something?

238
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,460
 Yes.

239
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,460
 I wonder how many...

240
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,540
 If you put one of his molecules in each crisp, that still wouldn't be that many, right?

241
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,540
 No.

242
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,260
 I would eat it if I knew that there was one molecule, which is such a small amount of

243
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,940
 the founder, and it's kind of a tribute in a way.

244
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,940
 Right.

245
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,940
 Would you...

246
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
 I would just pay more for it.

247
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,940
 Oh, no, I wouldn't pay more for it.

248
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,340
 I'm too skin-flinty to pay bonus for the friend recognition.

249
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,900
 I so would pay more for it.

250
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,400
 That's exactly the kind of thing I'd buy.

251
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,540
 It's like how I tried to buy a Frisbee that had the ashes of the Frisbee creator inside.

252
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,300
 Yeah, they did arrange, the family did arrange a Frisbee infused with the ashes.

253
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,180
 And that was the guy who invented the Frisbee.

254
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,180
 Yeah.

255
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,180
 Was it just as a tribute?

256
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,180
 Yeah.

257
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,180
 They put it in a load of different limited edition Frisbees.

258
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,180
 Yeah, yeah.

259
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,180
 And there was limited edition.

260
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
 I don't know.

261
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,180
 It's just as a fun thing.

262
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,180
 That's fun, isn't it?

263
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,180
 It's making me think, if I want to be buried in an interesting way, I'm going to have to

264
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,180
 invent something.

265
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,180
 Yeah.

266
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,620
 Otherwise, people are never going to want to eat me.

267
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,780
 One of your DVDs, maybe.

268
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,780
 Yeah.

269
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,780
 Something associate.

270
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
 Yeah.

271
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
 If I do a Netflix special and then they have to show my autopsy.

272
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
 Something like that.

273
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,780
 Yeah.

274
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
 Would you pay extra for that?

275
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,780
 Yeah.

276
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,780
 Yeah.

277
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,780
 For the one Amazon Prime.

278
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,780
 I'll buy that.

279
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,780
 So Pringle Guy.

280
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,780
 Oh, yeah.

281
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,780
 Pringle Man.

282
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
 Oh, Fred.

283
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,780
 Mr. Pringle.

284
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
 Mr. Pringle.

285
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
 Oh, that's fun.

286
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,780
 Has a first name.

287
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,780
 Yes.

288
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,780
 Well, this is drama number five.

289
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,780
 Oh.

290
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
 This is the final drama.

291
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,780
 And it's maybe the best drama actually.

292
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
 Do you think?

293
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,780
 I think it's the juiciest drama.

294
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
 Oh, well, you talk about it.

295
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
 Yeah.

296
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,780
 Yeah.

297
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,780
 The juiciest drama.

298
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,780
 Well, you take the lead here.

299
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,780
 I'll go through the boring dramas.

300
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
 Yes.

301
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
 And then let's come on to this one.

302
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,780
 Okay.

303
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,780
 Well, let's hold back.

304
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
 I don't want us to, yeah.

305
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,780
 Okay.

306
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
 Shall I do a drama which I'm not sure you'll have?

307
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,780
 Okay.

308
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,780
 Great.

309
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,780
 Sarah.

310
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,480
 This is Simon Lee, 28, who was stopped by security in Asda after they mistook a bulge

311
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,780
 in his pants for a can of Pringles.

312
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,780
 Wow.

313
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,780
 This is a part of the Metro.

314
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,780
 I'd still go to see a doctor.

315
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
 That's on my list of Simon Lee dramas.

316
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,780
 Not Pringles.

317
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
 Oh, my God.

318
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,780
 What was it?

319
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,780
 It was just a fold in his pants.

320
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,220
 So Simon Lee, 28 said, looking back, I could see the funny side.

321
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,780
 It was just a cock up, no pun intended.

322
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:20,780
 And the spokesperson from Asda said, no colleagues at this store are aware of this incident.

323
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,780
 What?

324
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,780
 So it wasn't an official member of staff.

325
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,780
 It feels like he might have made it up and the Metro reported it.

326
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,780
 But I don't want to get sued by Simon Lee, 28.

327
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,780
 So let's call it a drama.

328
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,780
 Yeah.

329
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,780
 I think there's definitely a drama.

330
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,780
 Yeah.

331
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,780
 So here's the legal dramas.

332
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:44,780
 Drama number one, the US FDA in 1975 ruled that Pringles were not potato chips because

333
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,780
 they're not from sliced potato, which is what people expect from potato chips.

334
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,780
 So they couldn't call themselves the newfangled potato chips.

335
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,780
 They could say they were potato chips made from dried potatoes.

336
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,780
 They thought that was too long and then they changed their name to crisps.

337
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,780
 Yes.

338
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,780
 I found that really interesting.

339
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,780
 I think we might put it on this season of QI of like what do Americans call this and

340
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,780
 put some Pringles on.

341
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,780
 Try and get the forfeit of chips.

342
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,780
 Also, you know, you can't call them crisps.

343
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,780
 Oh, really?

344
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,780
 Because this was the next court case.

345
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,780
 In this country, though.

346
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,780
 In this country.

347
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,780
 And also then it got overruled.

348
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,780
 So I actually don't know what you can call that.

349
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:22,780
 It would be clangers going off all the time because the next court case in 2008, Proctor

350
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,780
 and Gamble lawyers successfully argued that they're not even crisps, even though it said

351
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,780
 crisps on the packet.

352
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,780
 They won it.

353
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,780
 The potato content is only 42%.

354
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,780
 They argued and they said their shape is not found in nature.

355
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,780
 Which I love.

356
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,780
 It's so.

357
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,780
 Does no one get their feet out and say what are you calling that?

358
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,780
 God, those are good lawyers.

359
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,780
 So they were doing this to avoid paying VAT on crisps.

360
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,780
 Yes.

361
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,780
 But then I think it went to appeal.

362
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,780
 I think it went to the highest court in the land, which was then the appeal court.

363
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,780
 Yes.

364
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,780
 And I think the judges there ruled that, no, that's ridiculous.

365
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,780
 So you have to pay your tax.

366
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,780
 And I think it cost them about 100 million quid.

367
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,780
 And they'd already paid it because they knew they were going to lose.

368
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
 Right.

369
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,780
 So they did that.

370
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,780
 Like, hey, we've been paying it proactively all of this time.

371
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,780
 Because I think it's, I mean, tax dodging isn't a nice thing for a company to be very

372
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,780
 publicly doing.

373
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,780
 Yeah.

374
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,780
 And we're not suggesting that Pringles did that.

375
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,780
 No, they didn't.

376
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
 That's what I'm saying.

377
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,780
 Oh yes.

378
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,780
 Sorry.

379
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,780
 If they did want to send us somewhere, they're discussing someone in the front door.

380
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,780
 Because we can't even eat.

381
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,780
 Ash infused, please.

382
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,780
 It was at the time, the appeal court, Lord Justice Jacob.

383
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
 I just like this thing he said.

384
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,780
 He said there is more than enough potato content for it to be a reasonable view that it is

385
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
 made from potato.

386
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,780
 Wow.

387
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
 Yeah.

388
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,780
 Good old fashioned legal.

389
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,780
 58% then.

390
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,780
 Flowers.

391
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,780
 So sort of wheat, corn.

392
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,780
 Got it.

393
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,780
 It's a number of delicious other palatable ingredients that are legal.

394
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,780
 Agreed.

395
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,780
 Yeah.

396
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,780
 So I think the funnest drama.

397
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,780
 So some people, because they weren't.

398
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,780
 This is actually number two.

399
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:03,780
 So people trace their popularity back to an advert in the 80s.

400
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,780
 Because originally in the 60s and 70s they were flop.

401
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
 People didn't really eat them.

402
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,780
 But then Brad Pitt was in an advert them.

403
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
 Was he?

404
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,780
 Yes.

405
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,780
 Brad Pitt didn't add.

406
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,780
 You can go and watch it on YouTube, which I really recommend.

407
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,780
 Because it's really fun.

408
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,780
 It's fun, but it's also just a young Brad Pitt.

409
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
 Is it sexy?

410
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,780
 He's so sexy.

411
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
 Oh, okay.

412
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,780
 It's about theft.

413
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,780
 So I'm going to disagree with Andy.

414
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,780
 I'm going to throw some Pringles down his pants.

415
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,780
 Sneak straight out of Asda.

416
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,780
 What period Pitt are we talking in?

417
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,780
 Proto Pitt.

418
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,780
 Proto Pitt is very young actor.

419
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,780
 It's his first break.

420
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,780
 Although apparently he was 27 in the ad.

421
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,780
 So it took him a while to get his big break.

422
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,780
 It's really inspirational.

423
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
 It's not too great later.

424
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,780
 Well, actually, I'd argue it's Pringles.

425
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
 Yeah.

426
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,780
 Well, I think without the Pringles ad he probably wouldn't have got Thelma and Louise.

427
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,780
 Well, most actors at the beginning will survive off those kind of jobs.

428
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
 Pringles.

429
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,780
 Well, that's what the thing in the advert is.

430
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,780
 You've got these boys in a car and all of them are wearing their sort of swimmers.

431
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
 And they're driving.

432
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,780
 But oh my God, they've all got a tube of Pringles that's empty.

433
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,780
 Like they've run out of Pringles.

434
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,780
 Oh, no.

435
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,780
 But then they use the Pringles cans as like binoculars.

436
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,780
 And they see three hot chicks in their swimmers also driving in a car.

437
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
 But they've got like a whole sack of Pringles with them.

438
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,780
 Oh, wow.

439
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,780
 So they all get out by the side of the road and they dance while eating Pringles.

440
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,780
 Pringles orgy.

441
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,780
 Yeah.

442
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,780
 But then the girls turn around and the guys have stolen not only all of the remaining Pringles,

443
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,780
 but their car.

444
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,780
 Oh, wow.

445
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,780
 Because they just drive off in their car.

446
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,780
 Okay.

447
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,780
 Once you twerk, you can't stop.

448
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,780
 So let's come back to the final drama.

449
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,780
 Here we go.

450
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,780
 The name of Mr. P.

451
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,780
 Mr. P.

452
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,780
 Mr. P.

453
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,780
 So it suddenly got revealed that he does have a first name.

454
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,780
 No, his name is Julius.

455
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,780
 Julius Pringle.

456
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,780
 And people loved this, including Pringles.

457
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,780
 So Pringles tweeted it.

458
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,780
 It was on one of the American talk shows.

459
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,780
 People were really excited, like, oh my God, guess what that guy's name is?

460
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,780
 It's Julius Pringle.

461
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
 And then...

462
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,780
 Well, it's a sort of early day Wikipedia hoax, basically.

463
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,780
 Someone went into the Pringles page on Wikipedia, edited it in.

464
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,780
 Someone saw that, that got passed around.

465
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,780
 So two students in Chicago, they were watching American football.

466
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,780
 One of the players was called Julius.

467
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,780
 One of them asked the other, what do you think the Pringles guy's called?

468
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,780
 And he said Julius Pringle.

469
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,780
 They thought it was so funny.

470
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,780
 One of them went into Wikipedia and changed it.

471
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,780
 The other one was a moderator, went in and backed it up.

472
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,780
 And so all of this can be proven as well, because they've still got the same sort of app name.

473
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,780
 So Justin Shillock, Platypus222.

474
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,780
 There's records of him changing it on Wikipedia and on Twitter.

475
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,780
 There was a previous Facebook group where he was called Boris Pringle.

476
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,780
 They went in and changed it to Julius Pringle, so that it was backed up everywhere.

477
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,780
 And when Pringles was sold, Kellogg's just went back to the Wikipedia.

478
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,780
 They said Procter & Gamble would never have fallen for it.

479
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,780
 They knew that they hadn't called him Julius Pringle, but they just...

480
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,780
 Yeah, they said it's fine. It'll be Julius.

481
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,780
 There is a theory who Mr Pringle is.

482
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,780
 What it is is there was one other person who was involved in the initial concept of Pringles in the making of it.

483
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,780
 And it was a science fiction writer, a guy called Gene Wolfe, who writes pretty incredible sci-fi novels.

484
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,780
 I actually haven't heard any of the titles before, but they seem to be really well regarded.

485
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,780
 And he was responsible for developing the machine that cooks.

486
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,780
 I don't know if he invented the saddle. I think that must have been Bauer.

487
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,780
 But he did the machine.

488
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,780
 And if you look at a photo of Gene Wolfe, some people have noticed that he's got the parted hair.

489
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,780
 He's got the big mustache.

490
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,780
 No body.

491
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,780
 He's got zero body.

492
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,780
 And he looks very Pringles.

493
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,780
 Is that right?

494
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,780
 Oh, interesting.

495
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,780
 But that's a tiny theory. I'll admit it. It's one person's theory. I haven't seen it.

496
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,780
 Well, every theory starts with one.

497
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
 Exactly.

498
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,780
 You know, relativity started with, you know...

499
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
 Is that what... is that true?

500
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
 Yeah.

501
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,780
 Is that what's standing on the shoulders of giant speeders?

502
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,780
 Yeah.

503
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,780
 Did you know that Julius Pringle, because we might as well call him that now,

504
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,780
 he once shaved off his mustache for my Vemba.

505
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,780
 Did he?

506
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
 What did he look like?

507
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,780
 He shaved it for my Vemba.

508
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,780
 Yeah, yes, the opposite, but to raise money for my Vemba.

509
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,780
 So he just had a white round face on the Pringles.

510
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,780
 Because is he a potato?

511
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,780
 He shouldn't legally be, but is he...

512
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,780
 Maybe he's 42% potato.

513
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,780
 Yeah.

514
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,780
 His dad was a potato.

515
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,780
 His mum was some corn powder.

516
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780
 Yeah.

517
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,780
 Do you want to hear a...

518
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,780
 This isn't a drama.

519
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,780
 It doesn't even merit the name drama, but I just...

520
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,780
 I read a bit of a spicy takedown of Pringles.

521
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,780
 Oh, yeah.

522
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,780
 And this was on the website SiriusEats.com, so you know it's pucker.

523
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,780
 The author wrote, "I've creepily watched a lot of folks eat Pringles

524
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,780
 and can say with absolutely no authority that most people pop them in their mouths

525
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,780
 oriented as an upside-down saddle."

526
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,780
 Right?

527
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780
 So you're putting that...

528
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
 Now, this mostly makes sense because it's the way they come out of the tube

529
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,780
 and you get all the flavour on your tongue.

530
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,780
 But the more enjoyable way is to eat them flipped over

531
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,780
 so that you're working with a crispy saddle for your tongue.

532
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,780
 I'm confused about which...

533
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,780
 When you eat a Pringle, are you popping it on your tongue like a saddle?

534
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,780
 I see, yeah.

535
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,780
 Or are you popping it the other way out?

536
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,780
 I do it the other way because of a retainer I had as a kid

537
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,780
 and it feels like it slots into the top of your mouth quite nicely.

538
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,780
 You do have taste buds at the top of your mouth as well.

539
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,780
 That's powerful.

540
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,780
 Not that many.

541
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,780
 Oh, yeah, definitely.

542
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,780
 You don't taste any of the hot, diggity delt.

543
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,780
 It was you guys who said there were taste buds on testicles.

544
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,780
 That's how I eat them.

545
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,780
 They're just that they're a nice little saddle for the testicles.

546
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,780
 The next time that guy was in Asda.

547
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,780
 He was just showing them down there.

548
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,780
 If you're under the shoplift, put them in individually.

549
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,780
 Delicious shoplifting.

550
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:22,780
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

551
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,780
 Okay, my fact this week is that the world's first IVF clinic

552
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,780
 was opened in a town called Bourne.

553
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,780
 I love it.

554
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
 Brilliant.

555
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,780
 I love it.

556
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,780
 We never heard that.

557
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,780
 I couldn't believe it.

558
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,780
 I couldn't believe I'd never heard it.

559
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:41,780
 So this was, we're talking 1978, the first IVF baby, Louise Brown in Oldham.

560
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,780
 And just after it happened, the NHS kind of refused to support the service.

561
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,780
 So it's really controversial, you know, we might get to it later,

562
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,780
 but a lot of people did not like the idea at all.

563
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,780
 Can I quickly ask, is it more or less controversial than Mr Pringle's first name?

564
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,780
 I'm not sure how many dramas we're going to get to in IVF.

565
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,780
 But yeah, so the NHS wouldn't support them and they didn't know what to do.

566
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,780
 They had to find a building where they could start up their own clinic.

567
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,780
 And they found this old Jacobean manor called Bourne Hall,

568
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,780
 which I think is in Cambridgeshire.

569
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,780
 And they started the IVS centre there and, you know, many thousands of babies were born there.

570
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,780
 And it's just fun names.

571
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,780
 So where did it say Bourne is?

572
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,780
 I think it's in Cambridgeshire.

573
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,780
 But there's another nice coincidence, which is that the first IVF baby born was Louise Brown.

574
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,780
 And Brown is, with one letter different, an anagram for Bourne,

575
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,780
 except of course that she was born in Oldham, which is somewhere else.

576
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780
 And what's the opposite of old in Oldham?

577
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,780
 Young, what are babies?

578
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,780
 Oh my God.

579
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,780
 Come on, it's all coming together, I think.

580
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,780
 See, sometimes you go sit back and just watch the magic.

581
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,780
 Beautiful.

582
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,780
 Yeah, she's a pretty amazing character, Louise Brown,

583
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,780
 because she's become the spokesperson really for what a success it is.

584
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,780
 And she goes all over the world basically doing conferences.

585
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,780
 So does her sister, because her sister, who was also an IVF baby, was the 40th born baby.

586
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,780
 And then the first ever person to have a baby off the back of being an IVF baby as well.

587
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,780
 Her sister had children first, did she?

588
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,780
 Yeah, but Louise Brown did as well.

589
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,780
 Yeah, because I think it's hard enough being sort of a middle child, let alone.

590
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,780
 Yeah, your eldest sibling's like, oh my God, a medical miracle, aren't you?

591
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,780
 How do you as well, did they?

592
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,780
 One thing about Bourne, it's called Bourne House.

593
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,780
 Bourne Hall, sorry.

594
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,780
 They were there, the pioneers of IVF, partly thanks to the Daily Mail.

595
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,780
 Were they?

596
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,780
 It's a very interesting thing, so yeah.

597
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,780
 You're always talking about how much you love the Daily Mail.

598
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,780
 I didn't cram it in again.

599
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,780
 Every episode we edit out an extended round about how great the Daily Mail is.

600
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:57,780
 But the pioneers, specifically two doctors called Steptoe and Edwards,

601
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,780
 the editor of the Daily Mail got in touch and promised help,

602
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,780
 and helped them to look for premises.

603
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,780
 And the Mail originally purchased Bourne Hall, the Jacobean House,

604
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,780
 and they appointed architects and surveyors, because it needed lots of work

605
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,780
 to turn it from a crumbling manor house into an IVF clinic.

606
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,780
 But then in 1979 they pulled out, because apparently the venture was too risky.

607
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,780
 So it's not an unblemished success story for the Daily Mail, unlike most of them.

608
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,780
 And then Steptoe and Edwards raised money and bought it themselves.

609
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,780
 And Jean Purdy as well.

610
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,780
 We've got to bring her into the story, because she has been left off.

611
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,780
 I'm not saying Andy, you're leaving her out, but you did.

612
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,780
 And I think it's time to bring Jean Purdy back into the story permanently.

613
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,780
 She was a pretty amazing character, and by all accounts,

614
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,780
 this wouldn't have happened without her, to the point where many people see her as the nurse who was working on it.

615
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,780
 Therefore, if a plaque was ever put up about them, it would have the two names of the doctors,

616
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,780
 and then she would be linked into and all the supporting staff.

617
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,780
 And famously Edwards, the doctor who was still alive,

618
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,780
 absolutely was refusing to have anything to do with it unless they put Purdy's name on it,

619
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,780
 saying that "I feel strongly about the inclusion of the names of the people who helped with the conception of Louise Brown.

620
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,780
 I feel especially about Jean Purdy, who travelled to Oldham with me for ten years

621
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,780
 and contributed as much as I did to the project.

622
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,780
 Indeed, I regard her as an equal contributor to Patrick Steptoe and myself."

623
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,780
 And there was a point when Jean Purdy's mum got ill, and they just stopped everything,

624
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,780
 because they couldn't do it without her for months.

625
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,780
 So she was so integral to this thing.

626
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,780
 Andy.

627
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:36,780
 But because she wasn't a doctor, that's why people overlook the fact that she was involved in the whole process.

628
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,780
 She was the one who was located in the first place.

629
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,780
 And then she died before they gave the Nobel Prize, so she wasn't allowed to get a Nobel Prize, because you can't if you're dead.

630
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,780
 And Steptoe as well, right? So it was just Edwards who ended up collecting it.

631
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,780
 And it was controversial, wasn't it?

632
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,780
 It was sort of like everyone, particularly within the religious faction,

633
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,780
 sort of thought, "Are you going to give birth to a soulless baby?"

634
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,780
 Well, I did IVF, and they still now, because there's two different kinds of IVF.

635
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,780
 You have Ixie, which is where your partner for some reason has low sperm count or substandard sperm.

636
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,780
 There's probably a better term for it than substandard.

637
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:15,780
 If your partner's got really weird sperms, then what they do is they pair them up rather than letting the sperm swim and choose.

638
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,780
 And when they do that, they say, "Obviously some people have real problems with that,

639
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,780
 because it doesn't allow the accident of nature for them to choose."

640
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,780
 So even within IVF, there are still frontiers where people go, "Oh, that's so clinical."

641
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,780
 Wow, yeah.

642
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,780
 They're interesting.

643
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,780
 I mean, I can't believe they're real, these things, but what are they?

644
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
 They're micro-sringes.

645
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,780
 I'm going to get them all micro-needles, which they use to inject a single sperm into the centre of an egg.

646
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,780
 It's not just introducing them anymore.

647
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,780
 Well, they do both. I think they do both.

648
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,780
 Do they make a needle that's small enough to inject an individual sperm?

649
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,780
 Probably with microscopes.

650
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,780
 Probably.

651
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,780
 Actually, no, sir.

652
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,780
 I think it's an old craftsman called Luigi, who's got a very steady hand.

653
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,780
 I think that's it.

654
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,780
 Yeah, so when she was born, she was called the test tube baby.

655
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,780
 And she was made in a test tube or something.

656
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,780
 It's a petri dish, yeah.

657
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,780
 So test tube is the term that's the media throughout there, which we've all kind of kept going.

658
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,780
 But yeah, it's petri dishes.

659
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,780
 And she was saying that there was all that stuff, so she's going to have no soul.

660
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,780
 Are they making Frankenbabies, all that sort of stuff.

661
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
 But there was a lot of love as well.

662
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,780
 And a lot of people were writing anonymous letters in, just sending them support.

663
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,780
 Or when she returned to her hometown after coming out of hospital,

664
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,780
 the streets were blocked and lined with people from her town and a hundred reporters on the streets.

665
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,780
 And they all stood out there like it was like the Queen coming.

666
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,780
 You know, you know, it was a huge showing.

667
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,780
 And one of the people who was standing in the crowd was a young boy called Wesley Mollander,

668
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,780
 who would go on to become a bouncer.

669
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,780
 And then one day, Louise Brown's husband.

670
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,780
 Oh, really?

671
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
 Yeah.

672
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,780
 I'm not going to say you wouldn't let her ring soon exactly.

673
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,780
 I'm sorry, you need a soul if you could.

674
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
 It'd be so great to be like Louise Brown.

675
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,780
 Six and a half, I believe, if I remember exactly when we had that parade.

676
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,780
 But yeah, he was seven years old at the time, watching his future wife be brought home.

677
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,780
 That was crazy.

678
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,780
 Well, the birth was completely met.

679
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,780
 The police officers lining the corridor in hospital where Louise Brown's mum gave birth,

680
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,780
 because it was so controversial.

681
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:24,780
 And the birth had to be filmed to show there was actual documentary evidence that this baby belongs to this mother and is real.

682
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,780
 She had the baby.

683
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,780
 It's Louise herself when she was a newborn.

684
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,780
 You know, they normally have what do they do about five tests when you newborn baby just to make sure.

685
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,780
 Oh, the ears, the eyes, the colour of the skin.

686
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,780
 Yeah, Louise Brown had to have 60 tests before her mum could hold her.

687
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,780
 Wow.

688
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,780
 It's really just testing absolutely every aspect to make sure this is a completely healthy baby.

689
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,780
 It's the first time you would be a bit like, oh my God, this can't just be, it can't just be flipping made of human, have we?

690
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,780
 Yes.

691
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,780
 Yeah, part of you would be like double checks that everything's there.

692
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,780
 And it is an incredible thing.

693
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,780
 People who don't go through IVF, I know they think about it as like very medicalised,

694
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,780
 but when you have your embryo transfer, you watch it on an ultrasound.

695
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:12,780
 So you see the little globule of water that contains the embryo sort of being inserted inside you and your partner can be there and they give you an ultrasound picture.

696
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,780
 So like with our son Theodore, we've known him since he was five days old.

697
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,780
 Wow.

698
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,780
 Wow.

699
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,780
 Yeah, so actually I feel really romantic about it as well.

700
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,780
 As well as like that, oh my God, it's so incredible, they can help you.

701
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,780
 Also, it's really smooth running now.

702
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,780
 Yeah.

703
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:33,780
 Sorry, when you have that process you described, is the old Italian craftsman, is he in the room?

704
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,780
 Well, he has to be.

705
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,780
 Yeah, yeah, sorry.

706
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,780
 Where's that needle?

707
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,780
 Only he has the dexterous fingers that can pick the needle out of you.

708
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,780
 It will be sad when he dies.

709
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:48,780
 And he wants to be buried in a tiny needle.

710
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,780
 Steptoe was in a shipwreck.

711
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,780
 Was he?

712
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,780
 Was he?

713
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,780
 Yeah, and a proper full-off shipwreck.

714
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,780
 So he was born in 1913 and he was a naval surgeon during the Second World War.

715
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,780
 Uh-oh, he was the right age for that.

716
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,780
 And his ship was off Crete and the Germans captured it, well they sunk it, captured it and he became a prisoner of war.

717
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,780
 Right.

718
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:12,780
 And then he helped other prisoners escape while he was in a German prisoner of war camp in Crete.

719
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,780
 Cool.

720
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,780
 And then he was put in solitary confinement for that.

721
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,780
 Oh, okay.

722
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,780
 What a life.

723
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,780
 Sounds great.

724
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,780
 Yeah.

725
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
 Some more things on conception in general.

726
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
 Yeah.

727
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:27,780
 So, Elizabeth Christine was a wife of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, and they wanted a male heir.

728
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,780
 And they decided to do that.

729
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:35,780
 They prescribed her a gluttonous diet, large amounts of alcohol, and to spend all day looking at erotic paintings of men.

730
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
 Oh, wow.

731
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,780
 She was like, "All right, if you think it'll work."

732
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,780
 Wow.

733
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:52,780
 People say a thing now, which I don't think is based on that much evidence, but about the gender of the sperm making a difference at how fast they swim.

734
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:58,780
 So, like, early in your ovulation if you want a boy, and late in the ovulation if you want a girl.

735
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,780
 Oh, right.

736
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,780
 Yeah.

737
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,780
 What cause females sperm are slower swimmers?

738
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:07,780
 Oh, they live longer or something. There's something to do with the weight. I don't think it's based on that much evidence.

739
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,780
 Right.

740
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,780
 It's like one of those old wives' tales when people like you.

741
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,780
 So, we're going to get down here when people like you just be clear.

742
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,780
 And also, the old thing about wearing boxes or briefs or that thing.

743
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
 Oh, yeah.

744
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:27,780
 There was a recent study and they found there was no appreciable difference in scrotal temperature in men who were briefs and boxes.

745
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:34,780
 Although, the NHS kind of says, even though it doesn't seem to affect sperm quantity, you may want to wear loose-fitting underwear.

746
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:40,780
 So, the NHS kind of, you know, heads their bets a little bit, but according to the studies, it doesn't make any difference.

747
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,780
 But they do say the thing about hot baths and showers is a thing that...

748
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,780
 Well, that would, like, a hot bath would change the temperature.

749
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,780
 Change your core body temperature.

750
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,780
 Right.

751
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,780
 I guess the thing is that testicles are really clever at removing themselves from the body when they need to cool down a little bit.

752
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,780
 And I think they thought with pants it would mean they couldn't do that because they'd be stuck there.

753
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,780
 But with a bath being so much hotter, I mean, they can't jump out.

754
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,780
 What you need is one of those bath rests.

755
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,780
 You know the things that go across the bath for reading the book on cats?

756
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,780
 Yeah.

757
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,780
 Or for a tray of food.

758
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,780
 There'll be someone in the bath right now that's going to this podcast.

759
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,780
 Just tie across a little net and put the nuts in there.

760
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,780
 Yeah.

761
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,780
 That helps.

762
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:24,780
 I don't know. Because these guys know this, but when we were trying for our third child,

763
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:30,780
 my wife went to a acupuncturist because she thought we weren't conceiving.

764
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,780
 And she said, "Does your husband take hot baths?"

765
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,780
 Yeah.

766
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,780
 And she said, "Yeah, because I love hot baths."

767
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,780
 She said, "Well, that's the problem. It's his fault. It's all his fault."

768
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,780
 And then she booked me a sperm test, the acupuncturist, just booked it for me.

769
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,780
 And Finella was like, "Well, you've got to go."

770
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,780
 So I went and I did the thing, and I was furious that I was going to do this thing off the back of the acupuncturist.

771
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,780
 Then I wrote to them and said, "Where are my results?"

772
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,780
 And they said, "Well, we sent it to the acupuncturist."

773
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
 So she then had my results.

774
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
 Damn!

775
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,780
 And she's been telling--

776
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,780
 And she's been telling--

777
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,780
 I know.

778
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
 She opened yours. She didn't open them.

779
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,780
 She did.

780
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,780
 She did.

781
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
 And she's been--

782
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,780
 This is why alternative medicine doesn't have kind of practice.

783
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:09,780
 And she'd been giving Finella crap for weeks, like saying, "Your husband is your husband's fault.

784
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,780
 This is all your husband's fault."

785
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,780
 And Finella was getting angry at me.

786
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,780
 "You and your bloody bars have been trying for ages."

787
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,780
 So she opens it up.

788
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,780
 Finella calls her up and says, "Can we get the results?"

789
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,780
 And she says, "I've been doing this for 20 years.

790
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,780
 In all my time, I've never seen such strong sperm results in my life."

791
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,780
 He is a super sperm holder.

792
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,780
 This is so inappropriate.

793
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,780
 Even though that's a compliment.

794
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,780
 I couldn't believe it anyway.

795
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,780
 But you know having a high sperm count can be bad for conceiving as well.

796
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,780
 And that's because you're more likely to get two sperms that go in the egg at the same time.

797
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,780
 And obviously I think that can--

798
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
 Wow.

799
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
 Twins, but it can also cause problems.

800
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,780
 Too many people at the cocktail party.

801
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
 No one enjoys it.

802
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,780
 They used to talking over each other.

803
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

804
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,780
 You need just the right number.

805
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,780
 But it's never happened at any of my parties.

806
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,780
 I'll tell you that much.

807
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,780
 I'm lucky to get four.

808
00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:03,780
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

809
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,780
 And that is Andy.

810
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,780
 My fact is that there is only one guy in Dijon who makes mustard.

811
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,780
 And he's busy.

812
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,780
 Any girls who do it?

813
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,780
 I don't know.

814
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,780
 And did you find this out from the Daily Mail?

815
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,780
 Sorry, I got all my facts on the Daily Mail.

816
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,780
 No, actually I found this out from Atlas Obscura.

817
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,780
 And it's about a man.

818
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,780
 His name is Nicholas Chavie.

819
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,780
 And since 2009 he's been the only mutadier in Dijon.

820
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,780
 And he wasn't even born to it.

821
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,780
 You know, he's made himself a mustard maker.

822
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,780
 Is anyone born into mustard?

823
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,780
 There must have been some mustard dynasties, you know.

824
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,780
 The Coleman family, maybe, I don't know.

825
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,780
 But he used to work in IT.

826
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,780
 And then he has a tiny boutique.

827
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,780
 It's not a lot of Dijon mustard that gets made in Dijon.

828
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,780
 Are you allowed to call it Dijon if it's not made in Dijon?

829
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,780
 You are allowed to call it Dijon if it's not made in Dijon.

830
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,780
 It's just sparkling horseradish.

831
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,780
 In fact, there are no rules about whether you can call something Dijon.

832
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,780
 Is that right?

833
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,780
 Yeah, it's a Wild West with Dijon mustard.

834
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,780
 We can't say anything is Dijon mustard.

835
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,780
 You can call any mustard Dijon.

836
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,780
 So it's a recipe rather than some local projects.

837
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,780
 Interesting.

838
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,780
 So there's Grape Poupon, which you might have heard of.

839
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,780
 What?

840
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,780
 That's a famous Dijon mustard.

841
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,780
 And that's based in the USA.

842
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
 Since the 1940s.

843
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,780
 What did you call it?

844
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,780
 Grape Poupon.

845
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
 Grape Poupon.

846
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
 To ride with coupon.

847
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,780
 Have you not heard of Grape Poupon?

848
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,780
 I have, yeah.

849
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,780
 It's one of the most famous musters in the world.

850
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:37,780
 But only because from about, well, no, there's no, it's basically because it's in so many rap songs.

851
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,780
 There's a real thing where lots of rappers, from about the early noughties, they started mentioning.

852
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
 I'm going to go all Pringle buildings here.

853
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
 I want 10 rappers.

854
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,780
 Lil Poupon.

855
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,780
 Biggie Grape.

856
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,780
 The Wu-Tang Clan.

857
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,780
 Kanye West.

858
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
 Ghostface killer.

859
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,780
 Buster Rhymes.

860
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,780
 Kendrick Lamar.

861
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,780
 I could go on about that.

862
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:06,780
 There's a brilliant Vox piece where it was noted by a writer called Estelle Caswell.

863
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,780
 I think she writes for Vox or she writes for Vox at the time.

864
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,780
 And she basically made a supercut of Grape Poupon references in rap songs.

865
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,780
 It seems to be the thing that you mentioned.

866
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,780
 If you want to say, I think, I mean, it's just a mustard.

867
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,780
 It's just a slightly more expensive than normal mustard.

868
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
 Yeah, who knows?

869
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,780
 Do you know, not rap, but have you heard of DJ Mustard?

870
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,780
 No.

871
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,780
 DJ Mustard, big, big DJ.

872
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
 Record producer.

873
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,780
 Yeah, yeah.

874
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,780
 He's worked with a lot of famous people.

875
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,780
 Is it a joke about Dijon?

876
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
 Well, why do you think he's called DJ Mustard?

877
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,780
 Because Dijon contains DJ.

878
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
 Oh, no.

879
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,780
 He's as keen as Mustard.

880
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
 That's a great work ethic.

881
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,780
 Cutting the mustard, isn't there?

882
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,780
 There's lots of stuff going on.

883
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,780
 Getting the mustard.

884
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
 Mustard must have other slang.

885
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,780
 Yeah, well, it's not that.

886
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,780
 It is that his name is Dijon.

887
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,780
 His first name.

888
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,780
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

889
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
 That's an unusual name.

890
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
 That's an unusual name.

891
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
 Mustard.

892
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
 Dijon Mustard.

893
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,780
 What?

894
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,780
 Are they mispronouncing Dijon?

895
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,780
 I don't know how he's pronouncing it, but possibly.

896
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,780
 Can we talk about Mustard?

897
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
 Yeah.

898
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,780
 The Romans were the first to eat it, but the Greeks had it.

899
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,780
 And they would use it medically.

900
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,780
 They would rub it on the chest for bronchitis.

901
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,780
 If your baby had sore teeth, they might rub it on the teeth.

902
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,780
 And Pythagoras took it against scorpion stings.

903
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,780
 Yeah, my friend, I was talking to my friend Ed about Mustard the other day.

904
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,780
 And he said that his dad used to put it on his horse's legs.

905
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,780
 What, as a condiment?

906
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,780
 No, he said a racehorse when they've got leg muscle inflammation.

907
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,780
 And this was during the 70s and 80s, I guess, is when he was doing it.

908
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,780
 Yeah, you'd mix it with linseed, with comfrey, with water.

909
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,780
 You'd make a paste, then you would put it on and you'd bandage up.

910
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,780
 And the poor horse is like, are you basting me?

911
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,780
 Pope John XII appointed his nephew as the grand Mustardier to the Pope.

912
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,780
 Oh, what a name.

913
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,780
 He was the Pope's mustard maker.

914
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,780
 And the Pope's mustard maker became a word for someone who was quite pompous

915
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,780
 and they had a pointless role in society.

916
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,780
 Oh, that's great.

917
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,780
 Yeah, I was supposed like someone who would give your car a ticket,

918
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,780
 like a traffic warden, you would call them a Pope's mustard maker.

919
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,780
 Okay, really great.

920
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,780
 I think they've got an important role in society.

921
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,780
 Oh, no, I do agree, but I'm thinking that you might say it because you're upset with them.

922
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,780
 But that's the third missing mustard phrase.

923
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,780
 We've got cutting the mustard, Keena's mustard, and the Pope's mustard maker.

924
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,780
 And it's a tragedy that that one's dropped out of circulation.

925
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,780
 I think it's because it sounds too much like a euphemism.

926
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,780
 Yeah, you're right.

927
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,780
 And you said it's a nephew who made his...

928
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,780
 So it's nepotism, basically.

929
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,780
 Wasn't the Pope's nephew thing?

930
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,780
 It was often their illegitimate sons.

931
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,780
 That's a good point, they were called the nephews.

932
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,780
 Yes, I don't know if this is that in this case.

933
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,780
 They're not supposed to use their mustard maker.

934
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,780
 Oh, my God.

935
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,780
 That's now the fourth phrase.

936
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:02,780
 The guy in Asda thought it was my mustard maker, but it was actually a kind of pringles.

937
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,780
 Oh, that's horrible.

938
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,780
 France had a huge mustard crisis last year.

939
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
 Okay.

940
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,780
 Yeah, they ran out of mustard, they ran out almost completely of mustard.

941
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
 Oh, really?

942
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,780
 French people eat a kilo of mustard each, I read, somewhere.

943
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
 Okay, right.

944
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,780
 That's a lot, though.

945
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,780
 That's a good few jars per person per year.

946
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,780
 You've got to be shifting it to get through that.

947
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,780
 But basically, 80% of the seeds used in French mustard are from Canada.

948
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,780
 And they had a terrible summer of weather failures and crops all suffered.

949
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:39,780
 And France uses 35,000 tonnes of mustard seeds every year to make us mustard.

950
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
 It's a mad amount.

951
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,780
 The other thing was that a lot of the yellow mustard seeds come from Ukraine and Russia.

952
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,780
 And so that meant there was a shortage in yellow mustard for people like the Germans and the British.

953
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,780
 And so the Germans and the British started eating Dijon.

954
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,780
 And that meant that the French didn't have any Dijon.

955
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,780
 Exactly.

956
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,780
 Okay, I knew they were going to blame it on us somehow.

957
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:09,780
 In the 14th century, the Duke of Burgundy held a gala where the guests ate 85 gallons of mustard in a single sitting.

958
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,780
 With what?

959
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
 Did they say with what?

960
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,780
 It really doesn't say.

961
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,780
 It must have been like a fondue where they just put little breads in it and stuff.

962
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:21,780
 How much of that was left on the side of the plates after they finished their actual meals?

963
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:27,780
 A single sentence in the book "Gaster Obscura" which is made by the same people who do "Happens Obscura".

964
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,780
 Didn't say any more and I couldn't find anything about it.

965
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,780
 But that's a lot.

966
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,780
 It didn't even say how many guests there were.

967
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,780
 It's one of Andy's parties.

968
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,780
 That's a lot per guest.

969
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,780
 That's my fact.

970
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:50,780
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact.

971
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:57,780
 My fact this week is that the poet W.B. Yates once had a vasectomy to cure his writer's block.

972
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:03,780
 So, there wouldn't have been much of a second coming for him.

973
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,780
 Is that one of his books?

974
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,780
 It's his most famous poem.

975
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:13,780
 And you know, if that stays in and it's a big "if" really at this stage, there'll be a few people who really like that.

976
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,780
 Yeah, yeah.

977
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,780
 I'll keep it in.

978
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,780
 Actually, you can still orgasm if you've had a vasectomy.

979
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,780
 I really love the reference to the poem though.

980
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,780
 podcast@qi.parg, do you want to make that point?

981
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:31,780
 I was thinking to cure his writer's block, they bored his writer's cock.

982
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,780
 Spoonerism.

983
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,780
 Very non-technically and the penis don't do the procedure.

984
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,780
 Are you sort of really like this podcast?

985
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,780
 Have you learned how to fax or something?

986
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,780
 Is it just you in the inbox of the series?

987
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,780
 It's uncanny.

988
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:54,780
 So, I got this fax from someone called Georgia Granger.

989
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,780
 She's got a PhD in the history of vasectomy.

990
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:04,780
 You can find her on Twitter @sniphist, so she does a lot of vasectomy fax on there.

991
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:11,780
 And yeah, I asked her what's the most interesting thing that you know about vasectomies and she said about Yates and how he did this.

992
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,780
 And this used to be a thing.

993
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,780
 Why are you googling vasectomies, Dan?

994
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,780
 The super spam.

995
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,780
 I've got to stop it somehow.

996
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,780
 There is no vasectomy strong enough.

997
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,780
 We don't understand.

998
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,780
 These tubes appear to have been unnotted from the inside.

999
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,780
 The acupuncturist is shaking it.

1000
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
 Twenties.

1001
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:35,780
 Yeah, so this used to be a thing that it was believed.

1002
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,780
 These are sort of, I guess, partial vasectomies.

1003
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:41,780
 And the idea was that there was rejuvenation.

1004
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,780
 And it was written about in the 1920s.

1005
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:48,780
 And the idea was by sort of taking the tubes and tying them up.

1006
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,780
 We'd do something to the production of the male hormone and that would be increased.

1007
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,780
 And that would go back into the body and sort of revitalize it.

1008
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,780
 It's kind of like Doctor Who getting another regeneration.

1009
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,780
 It was kind of like a whole new life basically.

1010
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,780
 And he was quite old Yates when he had this.

1011
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,780
 He was 68/69 years old when he had it.

1012
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,780
 And he called it his second puberty because it kind of really did work for him.

1013
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,780
 Particularly on the creative side.

1014
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,780
 His wife said his writing was just extraordinary from that point on.

1015
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,780
 Whether or not that's a placebo or whatever.

1016
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,780
 Psychosomatic.

1017
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
 Yeah, but it did the job.

1018
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,780
 Having an operation.

1019
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,780
 When your body recovers from pain, you quite often do feel rejuvenated.

1020
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,780
 So it could just be having a sort of minor procedure.

1021
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,780
 Even that in itself.

1022
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,780
 Wow, so for all writers block just have...

1023
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,780
 No, I'm not going to recommend it.

1024
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,780
 Because I think that whole thing, like men losing their life force through ejaculation

1025
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,780
 kind of goes around and around.

1026
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,780
 Does it really?

1027
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,780
 Yeah.

1028
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,780
 So similar kind of time when they were sewing monkeys testicles onto people.

1029
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,780
 Yes, this is the same time.

1030
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,780
 Yes, to give them extra, again the same theory, extra sort of male life force.

1031
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,780
 The guy behind this procedure, Austrian Dr. Eugen Steinach.

1032
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,780
 That's the procedure that's called being Steinach.

1033
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:04,780
 He made extraordinary claims for his procedure.

1034
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,780
 Obviously, so many of these doctors did.

1035
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,780
 So just a quote from one piece about this.

1036
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:14,780
 He claimed his patients changed from feeble, parched, dribbling drones to men of vigorous bloom

1037
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:19,780
 who threw away their glasses, shaved twice a day, dragged loads up to 220 pounds

1038
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,780
 and even indulged in such youthful follies as buying land in Florida.

1039
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,780
 That's the most virile thing you can do.

1040
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,780
 That's what young people do by landing in Florida, because that's not why I've heard.

1041
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,780
 How interesting.

1042
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,780
 But the other side of this, so Sigmund Freud, again similar kind of time

1043
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,780
 was doing the same to women with clitorectomies.

1044
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,780
 Yes.

1045
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,780
 That same thing of...

1046
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,780
 I was moving them, wasn't it?

1047
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,780
 Moving them in terms of orgasms, but also lots of people had them removed

1048
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,780
 from that same sort of argument.

1049
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,780
 Well, Freud is one of the people who, when Yates was looking into it,

1050
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,780
 was amongst the list of notables who had had the vasectomy done in order to help him.

1051
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,780
 And he did it for...

1052
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,780
 He had jaw cancer, which they thought that that would help with that

1053
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,780
 as well as other things of the...

1054
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,780
 He kept smoking, unfortunately.

1055
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,780
 Did he?

1056
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,780
 Which is probably the reason he had jaw cancer in the first place.

1057
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,780
 I wonder if they want to know that at the time, right, I guess?

1058
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,780
 No, I don't think it would have been conclusively proven.

1059
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,780
 Yeah.

1060
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,780
 Wow.

1061
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,780
 Yates did loads of sort of spooky spiritual stuff, didn't he?

1062
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,780
 He's awesome.

1063
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,780
 Yeah.

1064
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,780
 And that's why we're talking about him.

1065
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,780
 That's why we're talking about him, really.

1066
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,780
 Yeah, I mean, he was someone who was very closely associated with the world of Alistair Crowley

1067
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,780
 and all that sort of stuff.

1068
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,780
 And he was very much part of a movement, which was...

1069
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,780
 Was it Blavatsky?

1070
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,780
 Was he part of the Theosophical Society?

1071
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,780
 Yeah.

1072
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:43,780
 Which is Theosophical... She was this extraordinary character, Madame Blavatsky, who was an occult leader

1073
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,780
 and she just took under her wing all of these big thinkers of the time.

1074
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,780
 And she had theories about Atlantis and our origin stories and so on.

1075
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,780
 And her sort of disciples were everyone from Crowley through to Rudolf Steiner.

1076
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,780
 You know, the schooling education I had was as a result of Blavatsky, basically,

1077
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,780
 and what Steiner took from that and built on it.

1078
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,780
 And Yates was someone else who very much believed in it.

1079
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,780
 Yeah, she claimed to have gone to Tibet

1080
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,780
 and had these Lamas who she'd met

1081
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,780
 and they could send her ideas through astral projection.

1082
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,780
 They could move from one place to another

1083
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,780
 but they can also send her thoughts into her head

1084
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,780
 so that she could kind of speak to the dead

1085
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,780
 or tell what the future's going to be, tell all sorts of stuff like that.

1086
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,780
 And there was lots of things like seances where letters would fly around

1087
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,780
 and all that kind of stuff.

1088
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,780
 And Yates was involved with the mob.

1089
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,780
 Yeah, he loved it.

1090
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,780
 But even when he turned up, she'd already been theoretically discredited at that time.

1091
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,780
 So one of her acolytes had gone to the papers

1092
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,780
 and given them all the tricks of what she used to do

1093
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,780
 to make things fly around the room.

1094
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,780
 And it was in, it might have even been the Daily Mail, but it was in...

1095
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,780
 Guys, you don't know about it, does it?

1096
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,780
 He wouldn't write it down because it involved a woman.

1097
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,780
 Oh, my God!

1098
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:57,780
 But yeah, I think at that stage, it's the kind of thing where you double down

1099
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,780
 even when things have been debunked, if it's what you believe in,

1100
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,780
 you're kind of like, well, they would say that they're trying to stop us from doing it.

1101
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,780
 Yates is...

1102
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,780
 I don't always approve of the thing of looking at a thing as a writer

1103
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,780
 exclusively through their romantic lives, you know.

1104
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,780
 As in that can be a bit reductive.

1105
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,780
 But Yates' sex life was extraordinary.

1106
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,780
 I mean, strange, really weird.

1107
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,780
 He proposed to an Irish woman.

1108
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,780
 She was a politician and she was called Mordgon.

1109
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,780
 And she was later a really big Irish independence movement leader.

1110
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,780
 He proposed to her and he'd been in love with her for about 20 years at this point.

1111
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,780
 She said, "Absolutely not."

1112
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,780
 Then he proposed immediately, like three weeks later, to her daughter.

1113
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,780
 Second rejection.

1114
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,780
 Then said, "Fine, never mind that."

1115
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,780
 And then immediately proposed to someone else who said, "Yes, Georgie Hyde-Lee's."

1116
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,780
 And they got married, I think, kind of within a few weeks of that.

1117
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,780
 Well, part of the reason was that this, I think it was Blavatsky,

1118
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,780
 or someone like that had told him the best time for him to get married.

1119
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,780
 Or in fact, he would get married that year.

1120
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,780
 So he was like, "Well, OK, well, let's go through the list."

1121
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,780
 That's what they say about marriage, don't they?

1122
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,780
 It's not about the person, it's about the date.

1123
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,780
 It's about the spiritualist who's told you it's this year.

1124
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,780
 You've got a suit, you've booked the guest.

1125
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,780
 But the relationship with Mordgon was really interesting.

1126
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,780
 And Mordgon, absolutely, what a character.

1127
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,780
 She had a second life in Paris, which is why she turned him down all these times.

1128
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,780
 But they did get married in 1898.

1129
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,780
 But they got married telepathically.

1130
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:29,780
 They had a shared vision where they kind of together

1131
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,780
 imagined getting married on the Astral Plane.

1132
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,780
 Yeah, it's been gone.

1133
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,780
 Yeah, yeah.

1134
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,780
 Well, it's cheaper, isn't it, on the Astral Plane?

1135
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,780
 You know, the rooms are bigger.

1136
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,780
 Yeah, you can have more guests.

1137
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,780
 It was a good idea.

1138
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,780
 Yeah.

1139
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,780
 But yeah, they did do that.

1140
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,780
 So they had done it, but not, I mean, not legally.

1141
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,780
 That's not legally binding, no.

1142
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,780
 But she, oh my God, Mordgon, I mean, there's one story,

1143
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,780
 and I'm sure you guys have read this or possibly not.

1144
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,780
 So she was part of, as we now know, the Astral Plane,

1145
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,780
 part of this mysticism stuff.

1146
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,780
 She had a son, a little boy, who sadly passed away when he was very young.

1147
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,780
 He was two years old.

1148
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:05,780
 And she decided that she was going to force reincarnation him back into existence.

1149
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,780
 And the way of doing that is she went to,

1150
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,780
 she had a sort of a place built for her son, the mausoleum.

1151
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,780
 And she went inside with the partner who she had had George with.

1152
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,780
 And they went down and by the coffin of her little son, they had sex.

1153
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,780
 Because the idea was to conceive while being next to the coffin

1154
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,780
 would force the spirit and soul into the new child.

1155
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,780
 Does that look like early IVF, actually?

1156
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:33,780
 So incredibly, she did conceive.

1157
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,780
 Like nine months later, the baby was born.

1158
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,780
 So they assume from stories that this was the point that this happened.

1159
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,780
 And then, and the daughter's name was Izzult.

1160
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,780
 They had a terrible relationship with each other, I guess,

1161
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,780
 because of a slightly fracturous beginning where she sort of was treating her

1162
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,780
 as if she was the reincarnated son.

1163
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,780
 And it became quite clear that she wasn't.

1164
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,780
 Well, the other thing is that Izzult was the daughter who Yates proposed to.

1165
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,780
 Proposed to? Yeah. Yeah.

1166
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,780
 So Yates, we haven't said properly who, if anyone doesn't know,

1167
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,780
 outside of that poem that Andy referenced right at the top.

1168
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,780
 Everyone got it from that.

1169
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,780
 But he was an amazing writer, he's a poet.

1170
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,780
 He got the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1923.

1171
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,780
 He was a sort of Oxford University honoured guy.

1172
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,780
 He was an amazing character who still held up.

1173
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,780
 And then there's all this Irish, of course, Irish, of course.

1174
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:22,780
 And he came from an amazing family.

1175
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,780
 And his brother was an Olympian.

1176
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,780
 He got an Olympic silver medal, the first that Ireland ever got for swimming.

1177
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,780
 Which is amazing. That's cool.

1178
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,780
 And it's not swimming the event.

1179
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,780
 It was a painting that he painted called swimming,

1180
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,780
 because this was back when you could win Olympic medals for paintings.

1181
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,780
 That's so funny. Yeah.

1182
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,780
 And so it's an Olympic silver. You don't look like an Olympic silver.

1183
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,780
 Why are you drawing?

1184
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,780
 Just clinging onto his painting.

1185
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,780
 And they were a very creative family.

1186
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,780
 The two sisters were also, they were very artistic.

1187
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:02,780
 They're sort of getting a second, you know, kind of like a Purdy from IVF fame,

1188
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,780
 or lack of fame, getting their moment now.

1189
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:09,780
 Because they were very influential on Ireland, being a new, its own state.

1190
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,780
 Yeah.

1191
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,780
 And Yates kind of half wasn't, half wasn't as well, wasn't he?

1192
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,780
 I think he was influenced by Morgan,

1193
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,780
 and really wanted to be involved with nationalism when he was with her.

1194
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,780
 But I think also when he wasn't with her anymore,

1195
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,780
 he wasn't that fussed about anything.

1196
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,780
 And she, I think, she drifted in a very radical direction.

1197
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:33,780
 I think by the time that he ended up proposing to her in this realm,

1198
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,780
 she was really, you know, very hard-line and very radical.

1199
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,780
 And she was also apparently a chloroform addict.

1200
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,780
 Oh, really?

1201
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,780
 It was a little bit much for him.

1202
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,780
 So when he proposed to Maude, to the mother,

1203
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:48,780
 he added quite detailed conditions, which basically ensured he would get a no from her.

1204
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,780
 Really?

1205
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1206
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,780
 That's interesting.

1207
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,780
 He puts out the chloroform.

1208
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,780
 But he felt, yeah, but he felt he had to propose,

1209
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,780
 because I think she had been with another partner who,

1210
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,780
 and then they were not together anymore,

1211
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,780
 and he sort of felt it was incumbent on him to propose.

1212
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,780
 How interesting.

1213
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:06,780
 Just on the marriage that Yates ended up having with Georgie,

1214
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,780
 or George, as he called her,

1215
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,780
 they were also involved in the spiritual stuff,

1216
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,780
 because their honeymoon was going incredibly badly.

1217
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,780
 I mean, really badly.

1218
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,780
 If he's proposed to two other women in the previous month,

1219
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,780
 it's not incredibly surprising that the honeymoon's going to go quite poorly.

1220
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,780
 Side note, it was in the Hundred Acre Wood, which is cool.

1221
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,780
 Oh, is it?

1222
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,780
 Or the wood that Ashdown Forest is called,

1223
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,780
 which was later the Hundred Acre Wood of AML.

1224
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,780
 How could you have a bad honeymoon there?

1225
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,780
 Six every day?

1226
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,780
 They stole all their honey on the first morning of the night there.

1227
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,780
 But basically, even on honeymoon,

1228
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,780
 he was writing letters to Izald.

1229
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,780
 So this is not a good sign for the proposal of the honeymoon.

1230
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,780
 And I know, it's like four days in.

1231
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,780
 It's almost like you shouldn't listen to psychics.

1232
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Psychics, puncturists.

1233
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,780
 I mean, careful when you get your advice, basically.

1234
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,780
 But then she turned it round.

1235
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,780
 She said, let's try some automatic writing.

1236
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,780
 You know, where the spirits will guide my hand,

1237
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,780
 and we'll just see what comes out.

1238
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,780
 And she said a bit later on that it had been fake, her word.

1239
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,780
 And then she repented and recanted using that word.

1240
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,780
 But basically, it turned the corner for the entire marriage.

1241
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,780
 And it turned what was a very unpromising marriage,

1242
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,780
 obviously, four days in.

1243
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,780
 Together, they wrote 4,000 pages in the first three years of marriage.

1244
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:21,780
 And the spirits seemed to be really interested in him getting over Maud.

1245
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,780
 Oh, he does.

1246
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,780
 They suggested diet tips for him.

1247
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,780
 They suggested ways to spice up their sex life.

1248
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,780
 This is such a clever tactic.

1249
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,780
 The spirits that they told him,

1250
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,780
 they told them when George was ovulating,

1251
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,780
 so they would have better odds of conceiving.

1252
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,780
 I mean, the spirits were unbelievably useful.

1253
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,780
 Apparently, there was a bit that was stressing the husband's duty

1254
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,780
 to give his wife sexual satisfaction.

1255
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,780
 Oh, my God.

1256
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,780
 She's a genius.

1257
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,780
 She's an absolute genius.

1258
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,780
 Which someone pointed out that these messengers

1259
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,780
 must have been reading a book that was actually published at the time

1260
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,780
 by Mary Stopes, which is called Married Love.

1261
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,780
 Which had that exact thing about sexual satisfaction for the wife.

1262
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,780
 So, just on writer's block, as this was what Yates was trying to deal with in the first place,

1263
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:08,780
 I found the person who I think may have had the worst writer's block in history,

1264
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,780
 a writer for The New Yorker.

1265
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:14,780
 A very successful, well-known writer who was called Joseph Mitchell.

1266
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:19,780
 And for 32 years, he didn't write a single article.

1267
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,780
 He turned up every day to work at The New Yorker.

1268
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,780
 And he didn't write anything.

1269
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,780
 He was working on a memoir, but he couldn't get past Chapter 3.

1270
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,780
 Oh, no.

1271
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,780
 I think he'd just skip onto Chapter 4 and come back to it.

1272
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,780
 Yeah, I think that's fair.

1273
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,780
 But there's a theory that he stopped because of someone being nice about him.

1274
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,780
 Someone wrote that he was the greatest living master of the English declarative sentence.

1275
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,780
 Wow.

1276
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,780
 And that just clamped him up.

1277
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,780
 Oh, no.

1278
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,780
 I know.

1279
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,780
 He should have checked his app messages.

1280
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,780
 Read your tweets.

1281
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:51,780
 Read the comments under your articles.

1282
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,780
 Okay, that's it.

1283
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,780
 That is all of our facts.

1284
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,780

 But don't bother going to our website this week.

1297
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,780
 There's way more important websites to go to.

 So if you're living over there, make sure to check it out and go see her show.

1302
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,780
 And anything else, Sarah, to mention?

1303
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,780
 I don't have an H on Sarah.

1304
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,780
 There's no H on Sarah.

1305
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,780
 @SarahSA.

1306
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:50,780

1307
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,780
 Okay, we'll be back again next week.

1308
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,780

1309
