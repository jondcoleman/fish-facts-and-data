WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.140
 Yeah.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.340
 Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.600
 It isn't nice, there's nothing as a fish.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.640
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.600
 It says it, "Right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:23.280
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.280
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.680
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with the three regular elves

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.720
 and it's Zinsky, James Harkin and Andy Murray.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.000
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.400
 from the last week, and here they are in no particular order.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.200
 Okay, starting fact number one, James.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.920
 Okay, my fact this week is about kangaroos, as you all know.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.440
 Yep.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.240
 Uh, it comes in the form of a question, and that question is how many legs does a kangaroo have?

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.200
 I think I can feel this one with confidence, uh, two.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 [Laughs]

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.920
 James is holding up a tiny Jackson button from...

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.760
 Were you talking about that?

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.400
 That's from the QI travel game.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.800
 Which is available in shops.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.480
 Oh my god, that must be the most annoying toy.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.640
 [Laughs]

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.760
 Can you imagine on a airplane, a little kid sat next to you?

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 Yeah.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.360
 Does any time you get something wrong?

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.480
 Can I, I scream?

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.000
 No.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.760
 [Laughs]

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.400
 No, I'm afraid the answer is I can eat ice cream.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.920
 Okay, I'm going to put that to one side now, because that probably is very annoying.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.560
 Um, yeah, they don't have two legs.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.920
 Wait, so if they don't have two, they must have, what, four, the front, the front hands or legs?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.640
 I'm going to have to get my buzzer out again.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.240
 What? Why?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.080
 Yeah, that isn't annoying.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 [Laughs]

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.680
 Uh, no, they have a three or five, depending on how you look at it, um, the tail counts as a leg.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.480
 Mmm.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.920
 And that's according to a new study, which was in New Scientist a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.120
 And, um, what they did is they put a kangaroo on a treadmill.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.640
 Yeah.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.200
 Which had pressure points and could see when they were putting pressure on the floor.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.120
 And they found that in the normal walk, not their bouncing walk, but the other one they do,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.720
 it's kind of a shuffling walk.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.640
 Um, they used the tail in the way that any other animal would use a leg.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.480
 Is it a weight bearing thing, though?

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.640
 Yeah, it's a weight bearing and propulsion.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.160
 Yeah.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.000
 Wow.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.480
 Okay, so I've got two questions.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.000
 Go on.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.960
 First question is, can they walk backwards?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.200
 Because that's one of the great Australian, either myths or truths.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.600
 Uh, because the idea is that the, uh, the, the country's code of arms has a kangaroo and an

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.640
 e-mew on either side looking at each other and the idea of being that they were chosen

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.320
 because not only are they national animals, but they can't walk backwards, neither an e-mew

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.320
 or a kangaroo.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.320
 What does it say on the code of arms?

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320
 Always forwards or something.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.320
 Oh, keep going forwards.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.320
 Keep going forwards.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.800
 Terrible, terrible piece of advice for a lot of people.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.800
 Yeah, of course.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800
 You're standing there, Cliffs.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800
 No.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.800
 That's true.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.600
 I think they, they can jump backwards.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.080
 There's, yeah, you can see on YouTube.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.760
 There's footage of Woody Allen boxing a kangaroo in a very, very weird boat.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.760
 Very weird, isn't it?

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.760
 It's on YouTube, yeah.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.120
 I think moves backwards a bit in that.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.120
 Yeah.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120
 Yeah.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120
 You said you had a second question.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.120
 I do.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120
 Uh, yeah.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.120
 Second question that I had was, are they the only animals with a tail for a leg?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.600
 Um, as far as I know, you do have prehensile tails that animals use to swing around trees

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.600
 and stuff and grab things, but not to my knowledge, do they use them to walk.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.840
 Did dogongs use their tail as like a supportive thing?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.840
 Is there anything where they do do dogongs, yeah, dogongs, you know, those things, uh,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.840
 their manatees.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840
 A type of manatee.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
 Sea cows.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.840
 They're the things that sailors apparently thought were mermaids back in the olden days.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.320
 They actually do have quite human faces.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.320
 I think they have adorable faces.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.320
 I'll put a picture on the website.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320
 They do.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.960
 Just last time I was back in Sydney, the aquarium, they had like an arrival of dogongs and

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.320
 it was all over the posters, uh, in the city and, you know, dogongs are here.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.280
 And it was the most unexciting attraction to an aquarium.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.280
 Yeah.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.280
 The Lego exhibition at Sydney Aquarium.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.480
 There are lots of, um, bits of Lego washing up on British beaches, do you know about this?

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.480
 Yeah.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.480
 There was a cruise.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.640
 Um, there was a container crash in the late 90s and, um, something like a billion pieces

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.320
 of Lego went into the water and they're still washing up in, in, um, North and South

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.320
 Cornwall.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.960
 Wasn't it weird because a lot of the Lego happened to be sea related stuff.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.960
 Yeah.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.000
 Like there are octopuses which are very, very special and, yeah, but it's a sea gross.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.880
 Well, maybe they are like little Lego plankton and that's what you were watching in Sydney

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.880
 Zoo.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.880
 Yes.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.280
 Remember there was that, um, a guy wrote a book all about a, another container ship, uh, that

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.280
 had ducks.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.280
 Drugs.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.280
 The rubber ducks.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.280
 And the plastic frogs, wasn't it?

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.360
 The rubber ducks were obviously the big, big draw.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.360
 Beavers.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360
 Beavers.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360
 Real beavers are plastic.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.360
 Yeah, plastic ones.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.360
 We're in the same container.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.360
 Didn't know that.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.960
 They don't get the same publicity as the docks do because the rubber duck is a timeless

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.960
 style icon.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960
 Yeah.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.880
 Do you ever bought someone to rub a beaver?

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.880
 Maybe that was, maybe that was like a new thing that they're bringing over.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.640
 This is our big chance with shipping over all the plastic beavers.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.640
 It's going to be a massive hit.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.640
 Now we'll never have them.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.640
 Uh, okay.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.640
 And all the other animals which have odd numbers of legs.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.640
 Okay.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.640
 Do you know any dandy?

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640
 Hmm.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.440
 There's a crab, isn't there?

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.440
 Yes, there is.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.120
 There's a spider crab, uh, called macro-kiera camp fairy.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.680
 It's like that massive Japanese spider crab that you see every now and then on the internet.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.760
 It's absolutely humongous.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.000
 And there's a study done and they found that three quarters of the crabs are missing at

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.320
 least one limb.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.320
 Yeah.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.320
 And most crabs have got ten legs.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.920
 In fact, all crabs have got ten legs.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.560
 So most of these particular crabs have got nine legs, although they have lost them.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560
 Wow.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.560
 It's a bit, yeah.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.560
 It's a bit of a cheat, isn't it?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.560
 They should just evolve with one leg fewer.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.560
 Well, they might do.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560
 They wouldn't need to lose that again.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.240
 They can survive with up to three legs missing.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.240
 It's more than I can do.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.000
 There's a thing called a seven-hour mock to push.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Is that born with seven arms?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.880
 No, it has eight arms, but one of them is very small and held up and you can't see it very

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.880
 well.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.280
 So people thought they had seven arms.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.280
 That's good.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280
 People who didn't look very closely.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.280
 Yeah.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.280
 And also, there's starfish, of course.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.960
 Yeah, so all of those crabs like starfish, sea urchin, sea cucumbers always have multiples

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.960
 of five, don't they?

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.280
 But they're not legs, really.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.280
 They're limbs.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.280
 Limbs?

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.280
 Yeah.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.280
 And the tripod fish.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.280
 Do you guys know about the tripod fish?

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.520
 It's an extremely deep-water fish and it has three long protrusions that come off its fins.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.360
 So I think it's never any more than 30 centimetres long, but its little thin protrusions can

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.040
 be up to a meter and it walks along on them like a tripod.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.720
 And it's really good because it means it's at the right level for the currents to sweep

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.080
 loads of prawns into its face and it can detect vibrations in the seabird if predators

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080
 are coming.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.520
 So I reckon that might be the closest other animal there is having three legs.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.640
 It's true odd-legged.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.720
 When kangaroos are born, when Joey's are born, you know, and they crawl up into the pouch,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.280
 they don't have their back legs even.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.200
 They do have their front legs, but that's the only thing, they're basically a tiny worm

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.720
 with these two minuscule front legs which they use to basically crawl up their mother's

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720
 fur into the pouch.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720
 Yeah.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.720
 That's good.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720
 And then they get their back legs later.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720
 They are tiny aren't they?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.200
 They're the size of a grain of rice, kangaroos when they're born.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.480
 People thought that kangaroos had two heads when they first saw them.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.880
 When Europeans first saw them because of their Joey on the chest.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.400
 Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.440
 So when their first descriptions came back to the West, that's what they thought.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.440
 Wow.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.440
 Yeah.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.120
 They have those, the QIFAC, which might have been one of the first ever QIFACs about kangaroos

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.600
 having three vaginas, which they do just in case there's one listener out there who doesn't

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600
 know it.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.240
 So first fact I learned when I was having my interview for the job.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.240
 Yeah.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.520
 Was it for you for QI was a chat, a lunch, a lunch.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.040
 Was it testing your response to that?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.040
 What did you do?

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.040
 Did you recoil in disgust?

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.040
 You would have made it.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.040
 You've been rejected.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040
 I didn't recoil in disgust.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.040
 I said, hmm.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.640
 I like the sound of that.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.280
 That's the incorrect response.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.600
 I've got two favorite kangaroo QIFACs have been in the books and the TV shows, but I

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.600
 absolutely love them.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.720
 The first one is that the mother kangaroo mammary glands, so female mammary glands produce

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.920
 both full cream and fat-free milk simultaneously.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.920
 That's wonderful.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.720
 The child's just, the root's got an option.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.200
 They're like the way-trows of macropodi.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.560
 And the other one is that kangaroos swim doggie paddle when they go swimming.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.560
 That's their style.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560
 Doggie paddle.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.360
 And also they kick their legs independently when they swim, which they never do on land.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.320
 On land they move both legs simultaneously.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.440
 So you see them move forwards either hopping or using the tail to project themselves.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.240
 But in swimming, dum, dum, dum either side.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.240
 Did you know that Elvis had a pet kangaroos?

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.240
 Did he?

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.760
 I've always been curious if anyone had a pet kangaroo.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.760
 Elvis had one?

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.760
 He had a couple, I think.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.640
 He was given them, I'm going off memory here, but I think he was given them by Zoo in Australia.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.880
 And then he gave them back, because they weren't as much fun as he thought they were going

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.880
 to be.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.880
 Yeah.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.040
 One quite cool thing when I read about kangaroos is kangaroo mother care.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.040
 Kangaroo mother care is what's being recommended for premature births in developing countries.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.520
 So 10% of premature birth in developing countries, the child dies within the first year and in 90%

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.520
 in developed countries.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.040
 So it's a massive problem in developing countries.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.040
 And they're suggesting kangaroo mother care, which is basically where you have constant skin

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.400
 to skin contact between baby and mother.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.920
 And the mother straps the baby to her for up to like the first eight or nine months.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.200
 And it reduces in for mortality by 50%.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.800
 So it could have saved, like, would save like 1.1 million deaths a year.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.920
 And it's just about the warmth of the skin contact and constant breastfeeding and probably

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.160
 bonding between mother and child and anticipating its needs more, a pretty simple way of seriously

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.560
 reducing infant mortality.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.560
 Yeah.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.240
 I've got one last thing that I want to throw in before we move on, which is that there's

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:46.520
 been a study that's shown that male kangaroos can attract the opposite sex by impressing

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.440
 her with his biceps, with his forearms.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.280
 They're apparently really important in the kangaroo world to the point where they frequently

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:02.160
 adopt poses, showing their muscles, like bodybuilders, going, hey, ladies, two tickets to the gun

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.160
 show.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.440
 Like, just for people listening, Dan is doing the bodybuilder poses as well.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.440
 I'm doing it.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.440
 Yeah.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.040
 If you've ever seen Johnny Bravo, it's a lot like cool.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040
 Cool.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040
 Yeah.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040
 Exactly.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.040
 Yeah.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.880
 And in a fight, that's often, apparently, what the female kangaroos are looking at, at

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.280
 the males in a fight, they're going to look at the biceps on that guy.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.440
 Yeah, because what they do is they grab the other guy with the armpits, and then they kick

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.440
 them with the leg bits.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.040
 So the arms are quite important in fighting.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.040
 Yeah.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.520
 But the legs are more impressive if you want to attract someone.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.520
 Why aren't they going?

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.520
 Look at my huge feet.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.040
 How awesome are my huge feet, guys.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.520
 You know what they say about kangaroos with big feet?

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.520
 Yeah.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.520
 Okay.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:46.400
 Time to move on to fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.400
 Yep.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.120
 My fact is that during the financial crisis of 1720, Parliament called upon stop brokers to

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.520
 be sown into sacks filled with poisonous snakes and thrown into the Thames.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.520
 Was that a serious thing?

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.200
 I mean, that's surely.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.120
 I think it was just, I don't think they were intending it actually to happen.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.520
 It was to express their vehement dislike.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.280
 But it was during the South Sea bubble, which was one of the earliest financial crises.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:15.440
 A guy who made the speech, which suggested this, was Lord Molesworth, and he was drawing

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.960
 on Roman tradition, which had people who committed parasite, which had them thrown into the

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960
 typer.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.960
 So he said, what's parasite?

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.560
 It's killing a father.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.600
 Anyway, even with animals as well, there were animals in the sack.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.120
 There was a rooster, a monkey and a dog in the sack with you when you went into the river.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.120
 Oh, was there.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.760
 It's horrible, isn't it?

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.760
 According to another Roman thing, if there wasn't any water nearby, if there wasn't a convenient

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.560
 river or sea nearby, you would be put in a sack with a rooster and a viper and a dog

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.240
 in a monkey, and then thrown into wild animals to be torn apart.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.240
 Oh, my God.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.240
 Yeah.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.240
 They used to put more effort into punishment, I think.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.240
 Yeah.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.040
 They go to lengths to find these poisonous and tropical exotic creatures.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.040
 Well, I think this was, because in this particular case, before the debate, because everyone

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.520
 was extremely angry about the South Sea bubble bursting, because people were ruined by it,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.560
 including, in fact, Isaac Newton invested a lot of money in the South Sea company, and

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.400
 he was totally bankrupt after it.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.800
 And Alexander Pope was not, because he was one of the crafty ones who exited early.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.480
 But so did Isaac Newton.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.680
 Isaac Newton got out in time and then went back in.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.960
 He could see it was going to fall.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.160
 Oh, God.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.440
 But yeah, people were angry.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.520
 And so in Parliament was getting very vehement.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.560
 And so before the debate, the king made a speech, urging people to retain prudence and temper

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.960
 to ensure that the right punishments were distributed.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.280
 And their response to that was say, throw them in the tens in a sack that sewn up with poisonous

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.280
 snakes.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.280
 Well, the king got out in time.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.280
 Did he?

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.280
 He was one of the people who got out in time.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.880
 He and Robert Walpole, who I think was prime minister at the time.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.880
 Both got out in time.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.840
 But that's only because the financial advisors had disobeyed them.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.840
 Oh, really?

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.840
 That's interesting.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.840
 Yeah.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.840
 Oh, that is interesting.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.000
 So actually, this is not going to be good for you.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.440
 I'm not going to put the money in.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.440
 So isn't that--

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.720
 Financial advisors were that thoughtful for everyone all the time.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.920
 Luckily we learned our lesson and there was no financial crisis ever again.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.920
 Absolutely.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.920
 Absolutely.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920
 It's not the earliest.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920
 Is Tulip Mania the first--

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.920
 Was that before the South?

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920
 Yes, it was.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.920
 Yes, it was.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.920
 16th century.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920
 Yeah.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.920
 So you should explain what that is.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.680
 So Tulip Mania was in the Netherlands, wasn't it?

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.040
 And it was when people suddenly started going mad for tulips and the price of tulips massively

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.040
 inflated.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.880
 I think the price of one tulip bulb was the same as a ten-year salary for the average

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.880
 craftsman.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.880
 Wow.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.880
 And then it burst.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.920
 There's a really cool story about Tulip Mania, which is--in the 1630s, a sailor was imprisoned

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.760
 in a Dutch prison for eating what he thought was an onion.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.560
 It was actually a tulip bulb and it could have fed the entire crew of his ship for months.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.600
 Oh, that's insane.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.000
 Who eats an onion just on its own?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.480
 A sailor, he's not had vegetables for a long time, I suppose.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.120
 That's pretty desperate.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:05.240
 Not only are you eating an onion, you're just eating the world's most expensive onion.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.240
 He's like, you know what?

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.360
 As well, it didn't taste that oniony.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.800
 I was reading about Parliament because I don't actually know much about Parliament.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.720
 There's that thing of that, if the queen goes to Parliament, then Buckingham Palace needs

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.800
 to take an MP prisoner for the time that she's there, just in case they suddenly decide

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.800
 to take a hostage.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.600
 Yeah, which is a movie that I've not seen made yet, which might not have a really important

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600
 MP.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.600
 Is it not?

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.600
 Do they get like the rubbishest?

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.600
 They think they get a--

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.600
 The new guy.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.200
 Yeah, sorry, no offense if you're listening and you've been the hostage.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.000
 But it's normally not George Osborne.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.640
 It's normally not a really senior member of Parliament.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.440
 It's dispensable, just in case.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440
 Exactly.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.240
 In Chestnut, it's like trading the queen for a pawn, except you've got 600 pawns and

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.000
 this is the least good of them.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.920
 It's the replaced one because you lost all the other-- you lost the proper one, yeah.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.760
 It's a thin bun, yeah.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.640
 I was thinking about MPs doing kooky stuff in Parliament.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.840
 I read somewhere that William Pitt, the younger, he was a drunk and he once during a speech

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.360
 vomited behind the speaker's chair and then returned to his seat and continued doing

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.360
 his speech until the end.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.760
 There were contemporary reports that say that, but they might come from-- they might be

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.640
 propaganda from the other side, but he was a drunk.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.680
 So I have one more thing, on Parliamentary misdeeds.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.960
 In 2010, a Tory MP had to apologise for being too drunk to cast his vote on the budget.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.880
 He got drunk in the Parliament bar and he forgot to rock up and vote.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.800
 And Hazel Blizz, who we'll probably know, Labour MP, said she had been out on the terrace

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.400
 with him, but had retired to the library when it got a bit too lively.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.200
 But this man's name is Mark Reckless.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.200
 That's great.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.960
 You mentioned the bar, so Parliament has their own bar, don't they?

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.960
 Oh yeah.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.160
 They've got a few bars, they have a library, the strangers bar, they're all cousins.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.160
 Yeah.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.160
 And cheaper jinks.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.160
 They've also got a hairdressers?

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.160
 I don't know.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.160
 Yeah.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.160
 And this is really odd.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.160
 They have a rifle shooting range.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
 Oh, the lords have one of the basement, though.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.160
 Yeah.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.160
 Yeah.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.160
 Isn't that really odd?

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.160
 Yeah.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.160
 They just go and shoot a rifle.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.160
 I think it's very, really used.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.640
 They used to have rifle shooting in pubs.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.640
 Yes.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.120
 It was like a pub spot that people would go around the different pubs and play against

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.120
 each other.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120
 They banned it.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.000
 And you know why they banned it?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.960
 Because people were gambling on it.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.960
 That's excellent.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.960
 They had to.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.240
 It wasn't some of it across corridors and things like that.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.240
 Yeah.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.920
 There's some brilliant photos of people taking shots in a pub and there's like old boys drinking

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.840
 their stout underneath the barrel of the gun, it's absolutely great.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.200
 What shall we do in this place where people come and get really drunk and disordering?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.960
 Should we introduce guns?

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.960
 Anything else?

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.440
 Can we just quickly go back to Punishments because I have one more thing going on.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.440
 Oh yeah.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:55.240
 In the olden days they used to saw people in half as a mode of execution.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.240
 Wow.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.440
 Which is quite a good way of going about it.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.440
 When?

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440
 Well.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.440
 On not a good way, but a way.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.280
 It's a thorough way.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.040
 Simon the Zealot was sawn in this way, supposedly.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.040
 Simon the Zealot.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.040
 Simon the Zealot, yeah?

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.040
 You know him?

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.040
 Really enthusiastic guy.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.360
 Hey guys, do you want to play round as late as it?

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.920
 The way that they saw him, I don't know if this is what they did with everyone, but they

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.960
 hung him upside down and they started with his groin and went lengthways.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.720
 Oh God, the gold finger method.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.720
 Yeah.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.600
 Sorry, when you said in half, I thought you meant as in a magician's trick.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.600
 Me too.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.600
 But so they did it.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.600
 Oh my God.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.600
 Starting with the groin.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.400
 That is the worst.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.800
 But Simon the Zealot didn't mind.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:41.320
 Because I'm not feeling as zealous about this as I normally am about other things.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:50.760
 Okay, time to move on to fact number three and that is you Andy Murray.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.160
 My fact is that there are three times as many estate agents in the UK as there are members

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.160
 of the armed forces.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.160
 Yeah, that is weird.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.760
 Well, yeah, there's been a massive boom in estate agents recently and also all the soldiers

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.760
 have been sacked.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.400
 So in some ways, it's surprising.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.400
 Oh really?

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.800
 Well, there are being huge cuts and people said that the army is going down to the size

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.520
 it was at the bear war, but it's not true.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.320
 It's actually going to be substantially smaller than it was during the bear war.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.320
 Yeah.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.320
 Because in wartime, the army is increased massively.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.320
 It's amazing.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:25.880
 There are graphs of the armed forces population from about 1870 to today.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.160
 And obviously there are two vast spikes there, but then it's been a gradual tail off since

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.360
 the end of the Second World War.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.880
 And are they becoming estate agents?

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.880
 Is that what's that?

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.880
 Is it a straight swap?

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.920
 They're round a house where a guy in camouflage.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.480
 Now this house has a beautiful bunker which you might want to use is facing north and it's

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.160
 very defensible, very defensible.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.160
 I don't know.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.920
 I don't think a lot of them are becoming estate agents.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.040
 How many real estate agents do we have?

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.120
 At real estate agents or fake estate agents?

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.440
 There are, I think it's something like 560,000 from memory.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.160
 In 2008, an estate agent was showing people around a potential property.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.320
 I think it was in somewhere in the south of England.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.080
 It was worth 350 grand.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.480
 He opened up the walking closet to show it off and he found the owner hanging dead in there.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.480
 Oh no.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.680
 A spokesman for the company said it was quite a shock, which you would expect.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.840
 It would have been good if it had been a sold by a guy called Roy Brooks, do you guys know

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.840
 who he is?

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.840
 No.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.880
 Okay, Roy Brooks was an estate agent from the early 20th century and he was known as

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.400
 the honest estate agent.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.440
 He would give somewhat two honest descriptions of his houses that he was trying to sell.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.840
 So, I want to read one.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:48.160
 This was from the early 20th century by Roy Brooks, and Brothel in Pimlico wanted someone

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.440
 with taste, means and a stomach strong enough to buy this erstwhile house of ill repute in Pimlico.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.800
 It is untouched by the 20th century as far as convenience for even the basic human decencies

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.240
 is concerned.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.720
 Although it reeks of damp or worse, the plaster is coming off the walls and daylight peeps

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.040
 through a hole in the roof.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:13.160
 It is still habitable judging by the bed of rags, faggens and empty bottles in one corner.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.440
 Plenty of scope for the socially aspiring to express their decorative taste and nothing to

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.640
 stop them putting Westminster on their note paper.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.640
 That's fantastic.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.880
 Ten rather unpleasant rooms with a smelly backyard £15,000.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.880
 Wow.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.200
 With a smelly backyard.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.200
 Why did he do that?

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.800
 Well, he became famous for it and then got a lot of people looking at his properties because

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.320
 he'd become famous.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.200
 There is definitely room for someone to do that today.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.720
 I went on a viewing with someone who was looking to buy a place recently and it was basically

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:51.240
 a condemned place and his date agent to her credit said this is awful, isn't it?

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.080
 She was really really honest.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.640
 Well, the kitchen was all covered in brown rust and condemned tape where it says it

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.760
 do not use this as a condemned equipment and she says it just looks like really bad food

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.720
 and then someone can get to the toilet in time.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.560
 That was the first viewing I'd ever been on.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.880
 That was quite £450,000 in zone 9.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.760
 The foremost adulterous professions in the US are physicians, police officers, lawyers

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.640
 and then real estate agents or estate agents.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.520
 I do like real estate agents.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.160
 I feel like in Australia, that's what we call them, real estate agents.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.920
 I think it is in America as well, possibly real estate agents or things, but here we just

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.920
 say it's date agents.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.160
 Here in real estate agents is wonderful.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.600
 Doctors, that's not great.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.600
 Doctors.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.600
 Wow.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.600
 Police find that out.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.600
 Was it self-reported?

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.560
 No, it was from a website where you go if you want to, if you're married and you want

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.040
 to hook up with people like those illicit encounters, I mean, not only no, I just, I don't

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.600
 have to put your profession in there and that's what they found.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600
 Right.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.600
 Well, they might have been lying about that.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.600
 I mean, they've been lying to the people in their lives as well.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.600
 It's totally possible.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.360
 A lot of would-be doctors would have said, "Yeah, I'm basically a doctor."

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:03.760
 There's a website you can look up in the US, which tells you if anyone's died in your

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:04.760
 house.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.760
 Oh, okay.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.400
 And how they did it.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.400
 How they did it?

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.640
 Sounds like John Bonderson's book.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.640
 John Bonderson.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.040
 Yeah, James wrote an endorsement for this book that John Bonderson.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.680
 He's a friend of us.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.680
 He's a friend of ours.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.040
 He does all sorts of odd travels around the UK to discover that this book in particular

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.800
 is called The Murder Houses of London.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.080
 Basically, he's got this book, which is all about all the houses in London where there have

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.080
 been murders.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.880
 And he goes into detail about the different murders that have been there.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.080
 It's really, really interesting book.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.560
 I got drunk with him once in Central London and when we got drunk, he went, "Do you want

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.560
 to see some of the houses?"

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.000
 And we walked around the London and he was like, "Here, there was a murder."

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.680
 And he was so excited by these murders.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:51.120
 Just with the people being murdered in houses, though, sometimes the idea of ghosts is actually

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:57.320
 a desirable thing that real estate agents, real ones, use in order to sell a house.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.720
 I mean, the people actually used to put wanted ads out when they were looking for a house

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.080
 with little requests for ghosts in the house.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080
 Wow.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.080
 The word mortgage.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.480
 Does everyone know what that means?

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.520
 I mean, it's a massive kick in the balls delivered to the wallet.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.880
 No, it means death, mort.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.160
 It means death, pledge, basically.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.240
 So you can hang us off until you die?

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240
 It's sort of.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.080
 Well, the reason, so the earliest explanation we have for that is from someone, I think, in

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.280
 the 16th century who said, "The reason mortgage is death pledge, literally, is because it is

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.960
 doubtful whether the borrower will pay at the appointed day such some or not as is due.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.560
 And so the land is taken from him, i.e. dead to him."

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:41.080
 So it's called a death pledge or a dead pledge, literally because it's so unlikely you'll

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.480
 be able to pay it back that you're going to have the land taken away from you, so you want

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480
 it.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.520
 But it comes in the same route, which I find really interesting.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.320
 It comes, the word mortgage comes in the same route as the word wedding, though gauge is

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:57.000
 a pledge and wed was pledged, and they both come with the Germanic word 'wadjo'.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.760
 Why don't we still use the word?

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.800
 Yeah, look at the stupid word.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.800
 'Wadjo' so funny.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.560
 It was a really beautiful 'wadjo' actually, the pride looked wonderful.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.200
 I think we've just realised why we don't still use that word.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.080
 Four wadjos in the funeral.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:24.400
 Okay, time for the final fact of the podcast, and that is my fact, and that is that I recently

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:30.440
 discovered that medieval manuscripts are littered with drawings of warfare between snails

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440
 and knights.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.400
 They're just constantly in battle, and the amazing thing is no one knows why, it's a total

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.400
 mystery.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.400
 Isn't it wonderful?

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.480
 It's just on the margins, on the side of all these manuscripts, there'll just be drawings

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.480
 of snails versus...

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.160
 And at the same time, it's not a real-sized knight and a tiny snail.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.160
 It's the same size.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.760
 It fluctuates sometimes.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.240
 Sometimes it is tiny by their foot, sometimes they're way larger than the knight.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.600
 And people are looking into it to try and work out why.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:04.120
 There was a great paper called 'The Snail in Gothic Marginal Warfare'.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.740
 And they have theories that it's a representation of the resurrection of Jesus, that the snail

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:15.120
 represents a sort of highly armoured chivalric foe.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.120
 They don't know.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.120
 They just have no idea.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.120
 You know what I think it might be.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.360
 You know when you just set the doodle link, one of the things you doodle is like a spiral,

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.560
 and sometimes you just draw a spiral, you might then turn it into a snail, and then when

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.960
 you're trying to snail, what are you obviously going to do?

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.960
 Make it fighting.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:36.800
 It does go down a bit there, but there's a lot of paintings of the Virgin Mary, where she

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.400
 has snails in the picture.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:44.320
 That's the symbolism of the Virgin Mary because the shells mean that their modesty is protected.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.920
 And it was thought that they reproduced without sex.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.920
 Oh really?

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.120
 And they don't do that, do they?

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.120
 Snails.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.960
 Yeah, they don't reproduce without sex.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.960
 No, they don't.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.960
 No sex with sex.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.760
 So they're roundy little beasts.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.360
 Yeah, they're hermaphrodites.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.920
 And they fire loved arts at each other.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.920
 They certainly do.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:08.920
 So, loved arts, they're like little arrows which are attached to the snail, but they don't

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.240
 fire them through the air.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.960
 They basically get into close combat and then stab each other, and sometimes can stab

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.840
 each other very fiercely, so the hoppin will go through the other snail's head and out

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:19.840
 the other side.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.840
 And then they mate.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.640
 Yeah, that's not really what the painters of the Virgin Mary were going for.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.640
 Oh no.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:30.800
 There's a lovely 15th century manuscript that's covered in cat paw prints that I think went

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.480
 on Twitter last year, it went a bit viral.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.200
 Oh, we should put that on our podcast page.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200
 We'll put it on Rolls-Royce page.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200
 Which humanizer is it really?

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.840
 Because suddenly you think, oh my god, a cat just walked across this guy's face.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.880
 That was the one where the cat peed on it, was it?

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.880
 Did it?

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.560
 Yeah, the cat peed on it and the guy wrote, "Here is nothing missing, but a cat urinated

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.880
 on it during a certain night, cursed be the pesky cat that urinated over this book during

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.680
 the night in Deventa, and because of it, many others too, and beware well not to leave open

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.640
 books at night where cats can come as an arrive."

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.640
 Has it already been?

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.640
 Right.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.640
 Cut it.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.280
 Couldn't clarify that.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:09.000
 It sounds like in the margins of these manuscripts are where whoever was scribbling all the

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 stuff in the monks, let's say, there was like their own little place in the book where

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.160
 they could say what they really felt and the drawings that they could do to Lynn.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.720
 No one would know to stop them.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.320
 And people have translated some of like the extra commentary written by some of these monks

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.840
 who are frustrated from writing out these long manuscripts and they're amazing.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:32.880
 So some of them include new parchment, bad ink, I say nothing more.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.160
 Another one is, "Oh, my hand, at this one.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.040
 Now I've written the whole thing, for Christ's sake, give me a drink."

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.280
 That's in a manuscripts.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.880
 Oh god, it's fantastic.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.440
 It's quite exciting because I didn't realize at the time when I saw this snail versus

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.160
 night thing that there's a lot of mysteries in medieval manuscripts.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:56.360
 And they're constantly digging them up and there's great blogs on the British Library website,

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.480
 on the Smithsonian's website where they go into the back rooms.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.440
 They dig through all of these manuscripts and they manage to find things that have just

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.200
 been lost in their archives and they contain mysteries once they find them.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.920
 They found this great one recently, which was a long-lost cookbook that they were dying

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.400
 to find that they knew the existence of and it was run by a guy called Jeffery Fuel.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.680
 And he worked in the kitchens for the Queen of England in 1328 to 1369.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.440
 So that was a philipa of Haynalt at the time.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.520
 And he was basically known as the Heston Blumenthal of his day.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.520
 And he just...

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.320
 If I wouldn't have known who Heston Blumenthal was, that's the mystery, really.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.320
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.920
 The only evidence we have for time travel.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:42.320
 He made tiny night porridge.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.560
 This is what's weird about it.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.160
 It's got a bunch of recipes in it and it has a recipe for hedgehogs, blackbirds,

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.680
 and then a recipe for unicorns.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:57.360
 And one of the recipes starts with the sentence, "Take a one unicorn."

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.120
 That is so good.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.120
 Yeah.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.320
 That was the kind of cookbook you know when you get a cookbook that's really complicated

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.600
 and you open it and you think, "Oh, I don't have any of this."

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.000
 Straight away, you're closing that, you're going, "Fog it, deal here."

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.560
 He was the Heston Blumenthal of his day.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.040
 He was the Miss' Beaton.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.040
 She published recipes for kangaroo.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.040
 Going back to that.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040
 Did she?

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.040
 Yeah.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040
 Curried kangaroo tails.

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.040
 Oh, that's funny.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.800
 Because the Western grey kangaroo smells of curry.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.800
 Does it?

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.800
 Yeah.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.800
 Apparently.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.280
 Well, speaking of kangaroos, there is a manuscript, which is a Portuguese manuscript,

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.640
 which has in one of the, you know how they always have a big letter to start off.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.640
 Yeah.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.000
 And there's always a drawing inside.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.160
 Once upon a time with a bigger...

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.160
 Oh.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.160
 Yeah, exactly.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.160
 And then they're drawing in the oak.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.080
 And this Portuguese manuscript, they have a picture of a kangaroo.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:51.760
 And it predates when supposedly anyone had visited Australia by 400 years.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.080
 Now, here's the thing.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:58.720
 They obviously don't know whether or not it was a kangaroo in the drawing because people

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.600
 have pointed out it looks quite similar to an ardvark.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.920
 And an ardvark apparently can go on its hind legs when it's trying to eat something

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.920
 off a tree.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.720
 But when you look at this picture and we'll put it on the website, it's a kangaroo.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.720
 Like no question about it.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.240
 That's definitely a kangaroo.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.880
 There is a painting from 1496 that has a sulfur-crested cockatoo in it, which is a parent native

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.880
 to Australia.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.880
 Yeah.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.520
 And they reckon that that is evidence that there was trading going on throughout the

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.720
 world at that time.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:30.040
 Okay, we might not have, Westerners might not have sailed down to Australia, but the Australians

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.040
 would have traded with the Chinese who would have traded with Indians who would have traded

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.040
 with Europeans.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.040
 Okay.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.040
 Wow.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.040
 Yeah.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.040
 That's amazing.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.760
 We're certainly trading with China in things like sea cucumbers, so there's no reason to

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.880
 think that we wouldn't have traded, that the trade route wouldn't have come all the way

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.880
 through the silk path, etc.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880
 Yeah.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.880
 Yeah.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.880
 They spread rumours, didn't they?

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:57.960
 They said these islands that we've got are guarded by giant sea serpents and giant birds

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.560
 and they made it, they made the spice islands sound as intimidating as they possibly good,

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.080
 just so that no one else would sail there.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.320
 And also it was so that the price would be so high.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:11.240
 So cinnamon sticks, they said that they were part of a nest of a giant bird, and in order

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.520
 to get this bird you had to kill oxen and hide them so that the bird would go down and get

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.440
 the oxen, and then you could sneak up and grab bits of its, bits of its nest and they

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.440
 were cinnamon sticks.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.040
 Of course it's all made up, but it meant that when you came home you could charge a massive

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.160
 price because all five of my men were killed.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.160
 Wow.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.800
 I'd have one cool thing about nights, so how do you dub a night?

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.800
 Sort on both shoulders, right?

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.800
 Yeah.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.680
 So by the time William the Conqueror come to England, to night someone, you punch them

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.680
 in the face.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:49.080
 Yeah, it was a blow with a fist, a bare fist to the face or neck, and this is how William

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.480
 the Conqueror for instance, knighted his son Henry, just a few punch in the neck.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.480
 When did that stop?

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.480
 Not sure.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.480
 Still going.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.480
 Yeah.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.960
 Can you imagine if the queen did this?

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.960
 To Sir Cliff Richard.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.960
 Yeah.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.440
 Praise yourself Cliff.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.360
 She doesn't say a rise Sir Cliff.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.360
 No.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.360
 It's a myth.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.360
 Yeah, because he's lying.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.440
 He's just on the part.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:17.760

 Also, just very quickly, if you happen to be an Edinburgh for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival,

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.680
 there's quite a lot of no such thing as a fish related comedy shows going up there.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.600
 Andy you're going to be doing two shows, you're doing ostentatious.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:07.080
 Yeah, that's at the Pleasant's Dome at 140pm every day, it's Jane Austen themed enterprise

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080
 comedy.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.720
 I'm also doing a two-person improv show called Folly Adder, which is at 6pm every day at Pleasant's

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.720
 courtyard.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:19.160

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:24.440
 And it's an hour stand-up show from 540 at the Underbelly Daisy Room.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:29.280
 And also we're going to be doing Museumicuriosity Live, which is the live version of our BBC

 John Lloyd's going to be up there.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:36.160

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.440
 and Irving Finkel, who is an ancient Babylonian unicorn expert from the British Museum.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.640
 Okay, and if you're not going to Edinburgh, just come to London and have a drink with me,

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.520
 because I'm going to be on my own.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.800

00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:01.800
 Goodbye.
