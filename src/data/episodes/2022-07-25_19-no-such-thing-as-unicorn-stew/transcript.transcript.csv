00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,"It isn't nice, there's nothing as a fish."
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"It says it, ""Right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."""
00:00:12,00:00:23,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:23,00:00:26,coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:26,00:00:29,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with the three regular elves"
00:00:29,00:00:32,"and it's Zinsky, James Harkin and Andy Murray."
00:00:32,00:00:36,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:36,00:00:39,"from the last week, and here they are in no particular order."
00:00:39,00:00:42,"Okay, starting fact number one, James."
00:00:42,00:00:45,"Okay, my fact this week is about kangaroos, as you all know."
00:00:45,00:00:46,Yep.
00:00:46,00:00:52,"Uh, it comes in the form of a question, and that question is how many legs does a kangaroo have?"
00:00:52,00:00:55,"I think I can feel this one with confidence, uh, two."
00:00:55,00:00:56,[Laughs]
00:00:59,00:01:01,James is holding up a tiny Jackson button from...
00:01:01,00:01:02,Were you talking about that?
00:01:02,00:01:04,That's from the QI travel game.
00:01:04,00:01:05,Which is available in shops.
00:01:05,00:01:08,"Oh my god, that must be the most annoying toy."
00:01:08,00:01:09,[Laughs]
00:01:09,00:01:12,"Can you imagine on a airplane, a little kid sat next to you?"
00:01:12,00:01:13,Yeah.
00:01:13,00:01:15,Does any time you get something wrong?
00:01:15,00:01:16,"Can I, I scream?"
00:01:16,00:01:17,No.
00:01:17,00:01:18,[Laughs]
00:01:18,00:01:21,"No, I'm afraid the answer is I can eat ice cream."
00:01:21,00:01:24,"Okay, I'm going to put that to one side now, because that probably is very annoying."
00:01:24,00:01:26,"Um, yeah, they don't have two legs."
00:01:26,00:01:31,"Wait, so if they don't have two, they must have, what, four, the front, the front hands or legs?"
00:01:31,00:01:33,I'm going to have to get my buzzer out again.
00:01:33,00:01:34,What? Why?
00:01:34,00:01:39,"Yeah, that isn't annoying."
00:01:39,00:01:40,[Laughs]
00:01:40,00:01:46,"Uh, no, they have a three or five, depending on how you look at it, um, the tail counts as a leg."
00:01:46,00:01:47,Mmm.
00:01:47,00:01:50,"And that's according to a new study, which was in New Scientist a couple of weeks ago."
00:01:50,00:01:55,"And, um, what they did is they put a kangaroo on a treadmill."
00:01:55,00:01:55,Yeah.
00:01:55,00:01:59,Which had pressure points and could see when they were putting pressure on the floor.
00:01:59,00:02:03,"And they found that in the normal walk, not their bouncing walk, but the other one they do,"
00:02:03,00:02:04,it's kind of a shuffling walk.
00:02:04,00:02:08,"Um, they used the tail in the way that any other animal would use a leg."
00:02:08,00:02:10,"Is it a weight bearing thing, though?"
00:02:10,00:02:12,"Yeah, it's a weight bearing and propulsion."
00:02:12,00:02:13,Yeah.
00:02:13,00:02:14,Wow.
00:02:14,00:02:15,"Okay, so I've got two questions."
00:02:15,00:02:16,Go on.
00:02:16,00:02:17,"First question is, can they walk backwards?"
00:02:17,00:02:23,"Because that's one of the great Australian, either myths or truths."
00:02:23,00:02:27,"Uh, because the idea is that the, uh, the, the country's code of arms has a kangaroo and an"
00:02:27,00:02:31,e-mew on either side looking at each other and the idea of being that they were chosen
00:02:31,00:02:35,"because not only are they national animals, but they can't walk backwards, neither an e-mew"
00:02:35,00:02:36,or a kangaroo.
00:02:36,00:02:37,What does it say on the code of arms?
00:02:37,00:02:38,Always forwards or something.
00:02:38,00:02:39,"Oh, keep going forwards."
00:02:39,00:02:40,Keep going forwards.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"Terrible, terrible piece of advice for a lot of people."
00:02:42,00:02:43,"Yeah, of course."
00:02:43,00:02:44,"You're standing there, Cliffs."
00:02:44,00:02:45,No.
00:02:45,00:02:46,That's true.
00:02:46,00:02:48,"I think they, they can jump backwards."
00:02:48,00:02:50,"There's, yeah, you can see on YouTube."
00:02:50,00:02:53,"There's footage of Woody Allen boxing a kangaroo in a very, very weird boat."
00:02:53,00:02:54,"Very weird, isn't it?"
00:02:54,00:02:55,"It's on YouTube, yeah."
00:02:55,00:02:57,I think moves backwards a bit in that.
00:02:57,00:02:58,Yeah.
00:02:58,00:02:59,Yeah.
00:02:59,00:03:00,You said you had a second question.
00:03:00,00:03:01,I do.
00:03:01,00:03:02,"Uh, yeah."
00:03:02,00:03:06,"Second question that I had was, are they the only animals with a tail for a leg?"
00:03:06,00:03:11,"Um, as far as I know, you do have prehensile tails that animals use to swing around trees"
00:03:11,00:03:15,"and stuff and grab things, but not to my knowledge, do they use them to walk."
00:03:15,00:03:18,Did dogongs use their tail as like a supportive thing?
00:03:18,00:03:22,"Is there anything where they do do dogongs, yeah, dogongs, you know, those things, uh,"
00:03:22,00:03:23,their manatees.
00:03:23,00:03:24,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:24,00:03:25,A type of manatee.
00:03:25,00:03:26,Sea cows.
00:03:26,00:03:29,They're the things that sailors apparently thought were mermaids back in the olden days.
00:03:29,00:03:31,They actually do have quite human faces.
00:03:31,00:03:32,I think they have adorable faces.
00:03:32,00:03:33,I'll put a picture on the website.
00:03:33,00:03:34,They do.
00:03:34,00:03:37,"Just last time I was back in Sydney, the aquarium, they had like an arrival of dogongs and"
00:03:37,00:03:43,"it was all over the posters, uh, in the city and, you know, dogongs are here."
00:03:43,00:03:47,And it was the most unexciting attraction to an aquarium.
00:03:47,00:03:48,Yeah.
00:03:48,00:03:50,The Lego exhibition at Sydney Aquarium.
00:03:50,00:03:54,"There are lots of, um, bits of Lego washing up on British beaches, do you know about this?"
00:03:54,00:03:55,Yeah.
00:03:55,00:03:56,There was a cruise.
00:03:56,00:04:01,"Um, there was a container crash in the late 90s and, um, something like a billion pieces"
00:04:01,00:04:06,"of Lego went into the water and they're still washing up in, in, um, North and South"
00:04:06,00:04:07,Cornwall.
00:04:07,00:04:10,Wasn't it weird because a lot of the Lego happened to be sea related stuff.
00:04:10,00:04:11,Yeah.
00:04:11,00:04:16,"Like there are octopuses which are very, very special and, yeah, but it's a sea gross."
00:04:16,00:04:20,"Well, maybe they are like little Lego plankton and that's what you were watching in Sydney"
00:04:20,00:04:21,Zoo.
00:04:21,00:04:22,Yes.
00:04:22,00:04:26,"Remember there was that, um, a guy wrote a book all about a, another container ship, uh, that"
00:04:26,00:04:27,had ducks.
00:04:27,00:04:28,Drugs.
00:04:28,00:04:29,The rubber ducks.
00:04:29,00:04:30,"And the plastic frogs, wasn't it?"
00:04:30,00:04:32,"The rubber ducks were obviously the big, big draw."
00:04:32,00:04:33,Beavers.
00:04:33,00:04:34,Beavers.
00:04:34,00:04:35,Real beavers are plastic.
00:04:35,00:04:36,"Yeah, plastic ones."
00:04:36,00:04:37,We're in the same container.
00:04:37,00:04:38,Didn't know that.
00:04:38,00:04:41,They don't get the same publicity as the docks do because the rubber duck is a timeless
00:04:41,00:04:42,style icon.
00:04:42,00:04:43,Yeah.
00:04:43,00:04:47,Do you ever bought someone to rub a beaver?
00:04:47,00:04:51,"Maybe that was, maybe that was like a new thing that they're bringing over."
00:04:51,00:04:54,This is our big chance with shipping over all the plastic beavers.
00:04:54,00:04:56,It's going to be a massive hit.
00:04:56,00:04:57,Now we'll never have them.
00:04:57,00:04:58,"Uh, okay."
00:04:58,00:05:00,And all the other animals which have odd numbers of legs.
00:05:00,00:05:01,Okay.
00:05:01,00:05:02,Do you know any dandy?
00:05:02,00:05:03,Hmm.
00:05:03,00:05:05,"There's a crab, isn't there?"
00:05:05,00:05:06,"Yes, there is."
00:05:06,00:05:11,"There's a spider crab, uh, called macro-kiera camp fairy."
00:05:11,00:05:15,It's like that massive Japanese spider crab that you see every now and then on the internet.
00:05:15,00:05:17,It's absolutely humongous.
00:05:17,00:05:21,And there's a study done and they found that three quarters of the crabs are missing at
00:05:21,00:05:22,least one limb.
00:05:22,00:05:23,Yeah.
00:05:23,00:05:24,And most crabs have got ten legs.
00:05:24,00:05:25,"In fact, all crabs have got ten legs."
00:05:25,00:05:30,"So most of these particular crabs have got nine legs, although they have lost them."
00:05:30,00:05:31,Wow.
00:05:31,00:05:32,"It's a bit, yeah."
00:05:32,00:05:33,"It's a bit of a cheat, isn't it?"
00:05:33,00:05:34,They should just evolve with one leg fewer.
00:05:34,00:05:35,"Well, they might do."
00:05:35,00:05:36,They wouldn't need to lose that again.
00:05:36,00:05:39,They can survive with up to three legs missing.
00:05:39,00:05:41,It's more than I can do.
00:05:41,00:05:45,There's a thing called a seven-hour mock to push.
00:05:45,00:05:47,Is that born with seven arms?
00:05:47,00:05:50,"No, it has eight arms, but one of them is very small and held up and you can't see it very"
00:05:50,00:05:51,well.
00:05:51,00:05:53,So people thought they had seven arms.
00:05:53,00:05:54,That's good.
00:05:54,00:05:55,People who didn't look very closely.
00:05:55,00:05:56,Yeah.
00:05:56,00:05:57,"And also, there's starfish, of course."
00:05:57,00:06:00,"Yeah, so all of those crabs like starfish, sea urchin, sea cucumbers always have multiples"
00:06:00,00:06:01,"of five, don't they?"
00:06:01,00:06:03,"But they're not legs, really."
00:06:03,00:06:04,They're limbs.
00:06:04,00:06:05,Limbs?
00:06:05,00:06:06,Yeah.
00:06:06,00:06:07,And the tripod fish.
00:06:07,00:06:08,Do you guys know about the tripod fish?
00:06:08,00:06:14,It's an extremely deep-water fish and it has three long protrusions that come off its fins.
00:06:14,00:06:18,"So I think it's never any more than 30 centimetres long, but its little thin protrusions can"
00:06:18,00:06:22,be up to a meter and it walks along on them like a tripod.
00:06:22,00:06:24,And it's really good because it means it's at the right level for the currents to sweep
00:06:24,00:06:30,loads of prawns into its face and it can detect vibrations in the seabird if predators
00:06:30,00:06:31,are coming.
00:06:31,00:06:34,So I reckon that might be the closest other animal there is having three legs.
00:06:34,00:06:38,It's true odd-legged.
00:06:38,00:06:43,"When kangaroos are born, when Joey's are born, you know, and they crawl up into the pouch,"
00:06:43,00:06:45,they don't have their back legs even.
00:06:45,00:06:48,"They do have their front legs, but that's the only thing, they're basically a tiny worm"
00:06:48,00:06:52,with these two minuscule front legs which they use to basically crawl up their mother's
00:06:52,00:06:53,fur into the pouch.
00:06:53,00:06:54,Yeah.
00:06:54,00:06:55,That's good.
00:06:55,00:06:56,And then they get their back legs later.
00:06:56,00:06:57,They are tiny aren't they?
00:06:57,00:07:01,"They're the size of a grain of rice, kangaroos when they're born."
00:07:01,00:07:04,People thought that kangaroos had two heads when they first saw them.
00:07:04,00:07:07,When Europeans first saw them because of their Joey on the chest.
00:07:07,00:07:09,"Oh, yeah, that makes sense."
00:07:09,00:07:13,"So when their first descriptions came back to the West, that's what they thought."
00:07:13,00:07:14,Wow.
00:07:14,00:07:15,Yeah.
00:07:15,00:07:20,"They have those, the QIFAC, which might have been one of the first ever QIFACs about kangaroos"
00:07:20,00:07:23,"having three vaginas, which they do just in case there's one listener out there who doesn't"
00:07:23,00:07:24,know it.
00:07:24,00:07:28,So first fact I learned when I was having my interview for the job.
00:07:28,00:07:29,Yeah.
00:07:29,00:07:35,"Was it for you for QI was a chat, a lunch, a lunch."
00:07:35,00:07:37,Was it testing your response to that?
00:07:37,00:07:38,What did you do?
00:07:38,00:07:39,Did you recoil in disgust?
00:07:39,00:07:40,You would have made it.
00:07:40,00:07:41,You've been rejected.
00:07:41,00:07:42,I didn't recoil in disgust.
00:07:42,00:07:43,"I said, hmm."
00:07:43,00:07:45,I like the sound of that.
00:07:45,00:07:49,That's the incorrect response.
00:07:49,00:07:53,"I've got two favorite kangaroo QIFACs have been in the books and the TV shows, but I"
00:07:53,00:07:54,absolutely love them.
00:07:54,00:07:58,"The first one is that the mother kangaroo mammary glands, so female mammary glands produce"
00:07:58,00:08:01,both full cream and fat-free milk simultaneously.
00:08:01,00:08:02,That's wonderful.
00:08:02,00:08:05,"The child's just, the root's got an option."
00:08:05,00:08:08,They're like the way-trows of macropodi.
00:08:08,00:08:09,"Yeah, exactly."
00:08:09,00:08:13,And the other one is that kangaroos swim doggie paddle when they go swimming.
00:08:13,00:08:14,That's their style.
00:08:14,00:08:15,Doggie paddle.
00:08:15,00:08:19,"And also they kick their legs independently when they swim, which they never do on land."
00:08:19,00:08:21,On land they move both legs simultaneously.
00:08:21,00:08:25,So you see them move forwards either hopping or using the tail to project themselves.
00:08:25,00:08:28,"But in swimming, dum, dum, dum either side."
00:08:28,00:08:30,Did you know that Elvis had a pet kangaroos?
00:08:30,00:08:31,Did he?
00:08:31,00:08:33,I've always been curious if anyone had a pet kangaroo.
00:08:33,00:08:34,Elvis had one?
00:08:34,00:08:35,"He had a couple, I think."
00:08:35,00:08:41,"He was given them, I'm going off memory here, but I think he was given them by Zoo in Australia."
00:08:41,00:08:44,"And then he gave them back, because they weren't as much fun as he thought they were going"
00:08:44,00:08:45,to be.
00:08:45,00:08:46,Yeah.
00:08:46,00:08:53,One quite cool thing when I read about kangaroos is kangaroo mother care.
00:08:53,00:08:57,Kangaroo mother care is what's being recommended for premature births in developing countries.
00:08:57,00:09:03,"So 10% of premature birth in developing countries, the child dies within the first year and in 90%"
00:09:03,00:09:04,in developed countries.
00:09:04,00:09:07,So it's a massive problem in developing countries.
00:09:07,00:09:11,"And they're suggesting kangaroo mother care, which is basically where you have constant skin"
00:09:11,00:09:13,to skin contact between baby and mother.
00:09:13,00:09:17,And the mother straps the baby to her for up to like the first eight or nine months.
00:09:17,00:09:20,And it reduces in for mortality by 50%.
00:09:20,00:09:23,"So it could have saved, like, would save like 1.1 million deaths a year."
00:09:23,00:09:27,And it's just about the warmth of the skin contact and constant breastfeeding and probably
00:09:27,00:09:33,"bonding between mother and child and anticipating its needs more, a pretty simple way of seriously"
00:09:33,00:09:34,reducing infant mortality.
00:09:34,00:09:35,Yeah.
00:09:35,00:09:40,"I've got one last thing that I want to throw in before we move on, which is that there's"
00:09:40,00:09:46,been a study that's shown that male kangaroos can attract the opposite sex by impressing
00:09:46,00:09:51,"her with his biceps, with his forearms."
00:09:51,00:09:55,They're apparently really important in the kangaroo world to the point where they frequently
00:09:55,00:10:02,"adopt poses, showing their muscles, like bodybuilders, going, hey, ladies, two tickets to the gun"
00:10:02,00:10:03,show.
00:10:03,00:10:06,"Like, just for people listening, Dan is doing the bodybuilder poses as well."
00:10:06,00:10:07,I'm doing it.
00:10:07,00:10:08,Yeah.
00:10:08,00:10:10,"If you've ever seen Johnny Bravo, it's a lot like cool."
00:10:10,00:10:11,Cool.
00:10:11,00:10:12,Yeah.
00:10:12,00:10:13,Exactly.
00:10:13,00:10:14,Yeah.
00:10:14,00:10:15,"And in a fight, that's often, apparently, what the female kangaroos are looking at, at"
00:10:15,00:10:18,"the males in a fight, they're going to look at the biceps on that guy."
00:10:18,00:10:22,"Yeah, because what they do is they grab the other guy with the armpits, and then they kick"
00:10:22,00:10:23,them with the leg bits.
00:10:23,00:10:26,So the arms are quite important in fighting.
00:10:26,00:10:27,Yeah.
00:10:27,00:10:28,But the legs are more impressive if you want to attract someone.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Why aren't they going?
00:10:29,00:10:30,Look at my huge feet.
00:10:30,00:10:32,"How awesome are my huge feet, guys."
00:10:32,00:10:34,You know what they say about kangaroos with big feet?
00:10:34,00:10:35,Yeah.
00:10:35,00:10:36,Okay.
00:10:36,00:10:46,"Time to move on to fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:10:46,00:10:47,Yep.
00:10:47,00:10:52,"My fact is that during the financial crisis of 1720, Parliament called upon stop brokers to"
00:10:52,00:10:56,be sown into sacks filled with poisonous snakes and thrown into the Thames.
00:10:56,00:10:57,Was that a serious thing?
00:10:57,00:10:59,"I mean, that's surely."
00:10:59,00:11:03,"I think it was just, I don't think they were intending it actually to happen."
00:11:03,00:11:05,It was to express their vehement dislike.
00:11:05,00:11:09,"But it was during the South Sea bubble, which was one of the earliest financial crises."
00:11:09,00:11:15,"A guy who made the speech, which suggested this, was Lord Molesworth, and he was drawing"
00:11:15,00:11:20,"on Roman tradition, which had people who committed parasite, which had them thrown into the"
00:11:20,00:11:21,typer.
00:11:21,00:11:22,"So he said, what's parasite?"
00:11:22,00:11:24,It's killing a father.
00:11:24,00:11:27,"Anyway, even with animals as well, there were animals in the sack."
00:11:27,00:11:32,"There was a rooster, a monkey and a dog in the sack with you when you went into the river."
00:11:32,00:11:33,"Oh, was there."
00:11:33,00:11:34,"It's horrible, isn't it?"
00:11:34,00:11:39,"According to another Roman thing, if there wasn't any water nearby, if there wasn't a convenient"
00:11:39,00:11:43,"river or sea nearby, you would be put in a sack with a rooster and a viper and a dog"
00:11:43,00:11:46,"in a monkey, and then thrown into wild animals to be torn apart."
00:11:46,00:11:47,"Oh, my God."
00:11:47,00:11:48,Yeah.
00:11:48,00:11:49,"They used to put more effort into punishment, I think."
00:11:49,00:11:50,Yeah.
00:11:50,00:11:53,They go to lengths to find these poisonous and tropical exotic creatures.
00:11:53,00:11:57,"Well, I think this was, because in this particular case, before the debate, because everyone"
00:11:57,00:12:00,"was extremely angry about the South Sea bubble bursting, because people were ruined by it,"
00:12:00,00:12:05,"including, in fact, Isaac Newton invested a lot of money in the South Sea company, and"
00:12:05,00:12:07,he was totally bankrupt after it.
00:12:07,00:12:11,"And Alexander Pope was not, because he was one of the crafty ones who exited early."
00:12:11,00:12:13,But so did Isaac Newton.
00:12:13,00:12:16,Isaac Newton got out in time and then went back in.
00:12:16,00:12:20,He could see it was going to fall.
00:12:20,00:12:25,"Oh, God."
00:12:25,00:12:26,"But yeah, people were angry."
00:12:26,00:12:28,And so in Parliament was getting very vehement.
00:12:28,00:12:33,"And so before the debate, the king made a speech, urging people to retain prudence and temper"
00:12:33,00:12:36,to ensure that the right punishments were distributed.
00:12:36,00:12:42,"And their response to that was say, throw them in the tens in a sack that sewn up with poisonous"
00:12:42,00:12:43,snakes.
00:12:43,00:12:44,"Well, the king got out in time."
00:12:44,00:12:45,Did he?
00:12:45,00:12:46,He was one of the people who got out in time.
00:12:46,00:12:47,"He and Robert Walpole, who I think was prime minister at the time."
00:12:47,00:12:48,Both got out in time.
00:12:48,00:12:52,But that's only because the financial advisors had disobeyed them.
00:12:52,00:12:53,"Oh, really?"
00:12:53,00:12:54,That's interesting.
00:12:54,00:12:55,Yeah.
00:12:55,00:12:56,"Oh, that is interesting."
00:12:56,00:12:59,"So actually, this is not going to be good for you."
00:12:59,00:13:00,I'm not going to put the money in.
00:13:00,00:13:01,So isn't that--
00:13:01,00:13:06,Financial advisors were that thoughtful for everyone all the time.
00:13:06,00:13:10,Luckily we learned our lesson and there was no financial crisis ever again.
00:13:10,00:13:11,Absolutely.
00:13:11,00:13:12,Absolutely.
00:13:12,00:13:13,It's not the earliest.
00:13:13,00:13:14,Is Tulip Mania the first--
00:13:14,00:13:15,Was that before the South?
00:13:15,00:13:16,"Yes, it was."
00:13:16,00:13:17,"Yes, it was."
00:13:17,00:13:18,16th century.
00:13:18,00:13:19,Yeah.
00:13:19,00:13:20,So you should explain what that is.
00:13:20,00:13:22,"So Tulip Mania was in the Netherlands, wasn't it?"
00:13:22,00:13:27,And it was when people suddenly started going mad for tulips and the price of tulips massively
00:13:27,00:13:28,inflated.
00:13:28,00:13:32,I think the price of one tulip bulb was the same as a ten-year salary for the average
00:13:32,00:13:33,craftsman.
00:13:33,00:13:34,Wow.
00:13:34,00:13:35,And then it burst.
00:13:35,00:13:40,"There's a really cool story about Tulip Mania, which is--in the 1630s, a sailor was imprisoned"
00:13:40,00:13:44,in a Dutch prison for eating what he thought was an onion.
00:13:44,00:13:49,It was actually a tulip bulb and it could have fed the entire crew of his ship for months.
00:13:49,00:13:51,"Oh, that's insane."
00:13:51,00:13:54,Who eats an onion just on its own?
00:13:54,00:13:58,"A sailor, he's not had vegetables for a long time, I suppose."
00:13:58,00:14:00,That's pretty desperate.
00:14:00,00:14:05,"Not only are you eating an onion, you're just eating the world's most expensive onion."
00:14:05,00:14:06,"He's like, you know what?"
00:14:06,00:14:09,"As well, it didn't taste that oniony."
00:14:09,00:14:13,I was reading about Parliament because I don't actually know much about Parliament.
00:14:13,00:14:18,"There's that thing of that, if the queen goes to Parliament, then Buckingham Palace needs"
00:14:18,00:14:23,"to take an MP prisoner for the time that she's there, just in case they suddenly decide"
00:14:23,00:14:24,to take a hostage.
00:14:24,00:14:29,"Yeah, which is a movie that I've not seen made yet, which might not have a really important"
00:14:29,00:14:30,MP.
00:14:30,00:14:31,Is it not?
00:14:31,00:14:32,Do they get like the rubbishest?
00:14:32,00:14:33,They think they get a--
00:14:33,00:14:34,The new guy.
00:14:34,00:14:37,"Yeah, sorry, no offense if you're listening and you've been the hostage."
00:14:37,00:14:39,But it's normally not George Osborne.
00:14:39,00:14:41,It's normally not a really senior member of Parliament.
00:14:41,00:14:43,"It's dispensable, just in case."
00:14:43,00:14:44,Exactly.
00:14:44,00:14:48,"In Chestnut, it's like trading the queen for a pawn, except you've got 600 pawns and"
00:14:48,00:14:51,this is the least good of them.
00:14:51,00:14:55,"It's the replaced one because you lost all the other-- you lost the proper one, yeah."
00:14:55,00:14:58,"It's a thin bun, yeah."
00:14:58,00:15:01,I was thinking about MPs doing kooky stuff in Parliament.
00:15:01,00:15:06,"I read somewhere that William Pitt, the younger, he was a drunk and he once during a speech"
00:15:06,00:15:10,vomited behind the speaker's chair and then returned to his seat and continued doing
00:15:10,00:15:11,his speech until the end.
00:15:11,00:15:16,"There were contemporary reports that say that, but they might come from-- they might be"
00:15:16,00:15:18,"propaganda from the other side, but he was a drunk."
00:15:18,00:15:22,"So I have one more thing, on Parliamentary misdeeds."
00:15:22,00:15:27,"In 2010, a Tory MP had to apologise for being too drunk to cast his vote on the budget."
00:15:27,00:15:31,He got drunk in the Parliament bar and he forgot to rock up and vote.
00:15:31,00:15:35,"And Hazel Blizz, who we'll probably know, Labour MP, said she had been out on the terrace"
00:15:35,00:15:39,"with him, but had retired to the library when it got a bit too lively."
00:15:39,00:15:44,But this man's name is Mark Reckless.
00:15:44,00:15:45,That's great.
00:15:45,00:15:47,"You mentioned the bar, so Parliament has their own bar, don't they?"
00:15:47,00:15:48,Oh yeah.
00:15:48,00:15:53,"They've got a few bars, they have a library, the strangers bar, they're all cousins."
00:15:53,00:15:54,Yeah.
00:15:54,00:15:55,And cheaper jinks.
00:15:55,00:15:56,They've also got a hairdressers?
00:15:56,00:15:57,I don't know.
00:15:57,00:15:58,Yeah.
00:15:58,00:15:59,And this is really odd.
00:15:59,00:16:00,They have a rifle shooting range.
00:16:00,00:16:02,"Oh, the lords have one of the basement, though."
00:16:02,00:16:03,Yeah.
00:16:03,00:16:04,Yeah.
00:16:04,00:16:05,Isn't that really odd?
00:16:05,00:16:06,Yeah.
00:16:06,00:16:07,They just go and shoot a rifle.
00:16:07,00:16:09,"I think it's very, really used."
00:16:09,00:16:11,They used to have rifle shooting in pubs.
00:16:11,00:16:12,Yes.
00:16:12,00:16:16,It was like a pub spot that people would go around the different pubs and play against
00:16:16,00:16:17,each other.
00:16:17,00:16:18,They banned it.
00:16:18,00:16:20,And you know why they banned it?
00:16:20,00:16:21,Because people were gambling on it.
00:16:21,00:16:22,That's excellent.
00:16:22,00:16:23,They had to.
00:16:23,00:16:27,It wasn't some of it across corridors and things like that.
00:16:27,00:16:28,Yeah.
00:16:28,00:16:32,There's some brilliant photos of people taking shots in a pub and there's like old boys drinking
00:16:32,00:16:36,"their stout underneath the barrel of the gun, it's absolutely great."
00:16:36,00:16:40,What shall we do in this place where people come and get really drunk and disordering?
00:16:40,00:16:44,Should we introduce guns?
00:16:44,00:16:45,Anything else?
00:16:45,00:16:49,Can we just quickly go back to Punishments because I have one more thing going on.
00:16:49,00:16:50,Oh yeah.
00:16:50,00:16:55,In the olden days they used to saw people in half as a mode of execution.
00:16:55,00:16:56,Wow.
00:16:56,00:16:57,Which is quite a good way of going about it.
00:16:57,00:16:58,When?
00:16:58,00:16:59,Well.
00:16:59,00:17:00,"On not a good way, but a way."
00:17:00,00:17:02,It's a thorough way.
00:17:02,00:17:05,"Simon the Zealot was sawn in this way, supposedly."
00:17:05,00:17:06,Simon the Zealot.
00:17:06,00:17:07,"Simon the Zealot, yeah?"
00:17:07,00:17:08,You know him?
00:17:08,00:17:10,Really enthusiastic guy.
00:17:10,00:17:14,"Hey guys, do you want to play round as late as it?"
00:17:14,00:17:17,"The way that they saw him, I don't know if this is what they did with everyone, but they"
00:17:17,00:17:21,hung him upside down and they started with his groin and went lengthways.
00:17:21,00:17:23,"Oh God, the gold finger method."
00:17:23,00:17:24,Yeah.
00:17:24,00:17:27,"Sorry, when you said in half, I thought you meant as in a magician's trick."
00:17:27,00:17:28,Me too.
00:17:28,00:17:29,But so they did it.
00:17:29,00:17:30,Oh my God.
00:17:30,00:17:31,Starting with the groin.
00:17:31,00:17:33,That is the worst.
00:17:33,00:17:35,But Simon the Zealot didn't mind.
00:17:35,00:17:41,Because I'm not feeling as zealous about this as I normally am about other things.
00:17:41,00:17:50,"Okay, time to move on to fact number three and that is you Andy Murray."
00:17:50,00:17:55,My fact is that there are three times as many estate agents in the UK as there are members
00:17:55,00:17:56,of the armed forces.
00:17:56,00:17:57,"Yeah, that is weird."
00:17:57,00:18:01,"Well, yeah, there's been a massive boom in estate agents recently and also all the soldiers"
00:18:01,00:18:02,have been sacked.
00:18:02,00:18:04,"So in some ways, it's surprising."
00:18:04,00:18:05,Oh really?
00:18:05,00:18:08,"Well, there are being huge cuts and people said that the army is going down to the size"
00:18:08,00:18:12,"it was at the bear war, but it's not true."
00:18:12,00:18:15,It's actually going to be substantially smaller than it was during the bear war.
00:18:15,00:18:16,Yeah.
00:18:16,00:18:17,"Because in wartime, the army is increased massively."
00:18:17,00:18:18,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:18,00:18:19,It's amazing.
00:18:19,00:18:25,There are graphs of the armed forces population from about 1870 to today.
00:18:25,00:18:31,"And obviously there are two vast spikes there, but then it's been a gradual tail off since"
00:18:31,00:18:32,the end of the Second World War.
00:18:32,00:18:33,And are they becoming estate agents?
00:18:33,00:18:34,Is that what's that?
00:18:34,00:18:35,Is it a straight swap?
00:18:35,00:18:39,They're round a house where a guy in camouflage.
00:18:39,00:18:45,Now this house has a beautiful bunker which you might want to use is facing north and it's
00:18:45,00:18:48,"very defensible, very defensible."
00:18:48,00:18:49,I don't know.
00:18:49,00:18:50,I don't think a lot of them are becoming estate agents.
00:18:50,00:18:53,How many real estate agents do we have?
00:18:53,00:18:57,At real estate agents or fake estate agents?
00:18:57,00:19:01,"There are, I think it's something like 560,000 from memory."
00:19:01,00:19:06,"In 2008, an estate agent was showing people around a potential property."
00:19:06,00:19:09,I think it was in somewhere in the south of England.
00:19:09,00:19:11,It was worth 350 grand.
00:19:11,00:19:15,He opened up the walking closet to show it off and he found the owner hanging dead in there.
00:19:15,00:19:16,Oh no.
00:19:16,00:19:20,"A spokesman for the company said it was quite a shock, which you would expect."
00:19:20,00:19:24,"It would have been good if it had been a sold by a guy called Roy Brooks, do you guys know"
00:19:24,00:19:25,who he is?
00:19:25,00:19:26,No.
00:19:26,00:19:30,"Okay, Roy Brooks was an estate agent from the early 20th century and he was known as"
00:19:30,00:19:33,the honest estate agent.
00:19:33,00:19:37,He would give somewhat two honest descriptions of his houses that he was trying to sell.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"So, I want to read one."
00:19:39,00:19:48,"This was from the early 20th century by Roy Brooks, and Brothel in Pimlico wanted someone"
00:19:48,00:19:54,"with taste, means and a stomach strong enough to buy this erstwhile house of ill repute in Pimlico."
00:19:54,00:19:59,It is untouched by the 20th century as far as convenience for even the basic human decencies
00:19:59,00:20:01,is concerned.
00:20:01,00:20:05,"Although it reeks of damp or worse, the plaster is coming off the walls and daylight peeps"
00:20:05,00:20:07,through a hole in the roof.
00:20:07,00:20:13,"It is still habitable judging by the bed of rags, faggens and empty bottles in one corner."
00:20:13,00:20:17,Plenty of scope for the socially aspiring to express their decorative taste and nothing to
00:20:17,00:20:20,stop them putting Westminster on their note paper.
00:20:20,00:20:21,That's fantastic.
00:20:21,00:20:25,"Ten rather unpleasant rooms with a smelly backyard £15,000."
00:20:25,00:20:26,Wow.
00:20:26,00:20:30,With a smelly backyard.
00:20:30,00:20:31,Why did he do that?
00:20:31,00:20:36,"Well, he became famous for it and then got a lot of people looking at his properties because"
00:20:36,00:20:38,he'd become famous.
00:20:38,00:20:41,There is definitely room for someone to do that today.
00:20:41,00:20:45,I went on a viewing with someone who was looking to buy a place recently and it was basically
00:20:45,00:20:51,"a condemned place and his date agent to her credit said this is awful, isn't it?"
00:20:51,00:20:53,She was really really honest.
00:20:53,00:20:56,"Well, the kitchen was all covered in brown rust and condemned tape where it says it"
00:20:56,00:21:00,do not use this as a condemned equipment and she says it just looks like really bad food
00:21:00,00:21:02,and then someone can get to the toilet in time.
00:21:02,00:21:05,That was the first viewing I'd ever been on.
00:21:05,00:21:10,"That was quite £450,000 in zone 9."
00:21:10,00:21:16,"The foremost adulterous professions in the US are physicians, police officers, lawyers"
00:21:16,00:21:19,and then real estate agents or estate agents.
00:21:19,00:21:21,I do like real estate agents.
00:21:21,00:21:25,"I feel like in Australia, that's what we call them, real estate agents."
00:21:25,00:21:28,"I think it is in America as well, possibly real estate agents or things, but here we just"
00:21:28,00:21:29,say it's date agents.
00:21:29,00:21:32,Here in real estate agents is wonderful.
00:21:32,00:21:34,"Doctors, that's not great."
00:21:34,00:21:35,Doctors.
00:21:35,00:21:36,Wow.
00:21:36,00:21:37,Police find that out.
00:21:37,00:21:38,Was it self-reported?
00:21:38,00:21:43,"No, it was from a website where you go if you want to, if you're married and you want"
00:21:43,00:21:48,"to hook up with people like those illicit encounters, I mean, not only no, I just, I don't"
00:21:48,00:21:50,have to put your profession in there and that's what they found.
00:21:50,00:21:51,Right.
00:21:51,00:21:52,"Well, they might have been lying about that."
00:21:52,00:21:54,"I mean, they've been lying to the people in their lives as well."
00:21:54,00:21:55,It's totally possible.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"A lot of would-be doctors would have said, ""Yeah, I'm basically a doctor."""
00:21:58,00:22:03,"There's a website you can look up in the US, which tells you if anyone's died in your"
00:22:03,00:22:04,house.
00:22:04,00:22:05,"Oh, okay."
00:22:05,00:22:07,And how they did it.
00:22:07,00:22:08,How they did it?
00:22:08,00:22:09,Sounds like John Bonderson's book.
00:22:09,00:22:10,John Bonderson.
00:22:10,00:22:15,"Yeah, James wrote an endorsement for this book that John Bonderson."
00:22:15,00:22:16,He's a friend of us.
00:22:16,00:22:17,He's a friend of ours.
00:22:17,00:22:22,He does all sorts of odd travels around the UK to discover that this book in particular
00:22:22,00:22:23,is called The Murder Houses of London.
00:22:23,00:22:27,"Basically, he's got this book, which is all about all the houses in London where there have"
00:22:27,00:22:28,been murders.
00:22:28,00:22:30,And he goes into detail about the different murders that have been there.
00:22:30,00:22:33,"It's really, really interesting book."
00:22:33,00:22:37,"I got drunk with him once in Central London and when we got drunk, he went, ""Do you want"
00:22:37,00:22:38,"to see some of the houses?"""
00:22:38,00:22:42,"And we walked around the London and he was like, ""Here, there was a murder."""
00:22:42,00:22:45,And he was so excited by these murders.
00:22:45,00:22:51,"Just with the people being murdered in houses, though, sometimes the idea of ghosts is actually"
00:22:51,00:22:57,"a desirable thing that real estate agents, real ones, use in order to sell a house."
00:22:57,00:23:01,"I mean, the people actually used to put wanted ads out when they were looking for a house"
00:23:01,00:23:06,with little requests for ghosts in the house.
00:23:06,00:23:07,Wow.
00:23:07,00:23:08,The word mortgage.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Does everyone know what that means?
00:23:09,00:23:12,"I mean, it's a massive kick in the balls delivered to the wallet."
00:23:12,00:23:14,"No, it means death, mort."
00:23:14,00:23:17,"It means death, pledge, basically."
00:23:17,00:23:19,So you can hang us off until you die?
00:23:19,00:23:20,It's sort of.
00:23:20,00:23:25,"Well, the reason, so the earliest explanation we have for that is from someone, I think, in"
00:23:25,00:23:30,"the 16th century who said, ""The reason mortgage is death pledge, literally, is because it is"
00:23:30,00:23:34,doubtful whether the borrower will pay at the appointed day such some or not as is due.
00:23:34,00:23:37,"And so the land is taken from him, i.e. dead to him."""
00:23:37,00:23:41,"So it's called a death pledge or a dead pledge, literally because it's so unlikely you'll"
00:23:41,00:23:44,"be able to pay it back that you're going to have the land taken away from you, so you want"
00:23:44,00:23:45,it.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"But it comes in the same route, which I find really interesting."
00:23:47,00:23:52,"It comes, the word mortgage comes in the same route as the word wedding, though gauge is"
00:23:52,00:23:57,"a pledge and wed was pledged, and they both come with the Germanic word 'wadjo'."
00:23:57,00:24:00,Why don't we still use the word?
00:24:00,00:24:02,"Yeah, look at the stupid word."
00:24:02,00:24:03,'Wadjo' so funny.
00:24:03,00:24:07,"It was a really beautiful 'wadjo' actually, the pride looked wonderful."
00:24:07,00:24:11,I think we've just realised why we don't still use that word.
00:24:11,00:24:13,Four wadjos in the funeral.
00:24:13,00:24:24,"Okay, time for the final fact of the podcast, and that is my fact, and that is that I recently"
00:24:24,00:24:30,discovered that medieval manuscripts are littered with drawings of warfare between snails
00:24:30,00:24:31,and knights.
00:24:31,00:24:36,"They're just constantly in battle, and the amazing thing is no one knows why, it's a total"
00:24:36,00:24:37,mystery.
00:24:37,00:24:38,Isn't it wonderful?
00:24:38,00:24:43,"It's just on the margins, on the side of all these manuscripts, there'll just be drawings"
00:24:43,00:24:44,of snails versus...
00:24:44,00:24:47,"And at the same time, it's not a real-sized knight and a tiny snail."
00:24:47,00:24:48,It's the same size.
00:24:48,00:24:49,It fluctuates sometimes.
00:24:49,00:24:55,"Sometimes it is tiny by their foot, sometimes they're way larger than the knight."
00:24:55,00:24:58,And people are looking into it to try and work out why.
00:24:58,00:25:04,There was a great paper called 'The Snail in Gothic Marginal Warfare'.
00:25:04,00:25:08,"And they have theories that it's a representation of the resurrection of Jesus, that the snail"
00:25:08,00:25:15,represents a sort of highly armoured chivalric foe.
00:25:15,00:25:16,They don't know.
00:25:16,00:25:17,They just have no idea.
00:25:17,00:25:18,You know what I think it might be.
00:25:18,00:25:22,"You know when you just set the doodle link, one of the things you doodle is like a spiral,"
00:25:22,00:25:26,"and sometimes you just draw a spiral, you might then turn it into a snail, and then when"
00:25:26,00:25:28,"you're trying to snail, what are you obviously going to do?"
00:25:28,00:25:29,Make it fighting.
00:25:29,00:25:36,"It does go down a bit there, but there's a lot of paintings of the Virgin Mary, where she"
00:25:36,00:25:38,has snails in the picture.
00:25:38,00:25:44,That's the symbolism of the Virgin Mary because the shells mean that their modesty is protected.
00:25:44,00:25:46,And it was thought that they reproduced without sex.
00:25:46,00:25:47,Oh really?
00:25:47,00:25:50,"And they don't do that, do they?"
00:25:50,00:25:51,Snails.
00:25:51,00:25:52,"Yeah, they don't reproduce without sex."
00:25:52,00:25:53,"No, they don't."
00:25:53,00:25:54,No sex with sex.
00:25:54,00:25:56,So they're roundy little beasts.
00:25:56,00:25:58,"Yeah, they're hermaphrodites."
00:25:58,00:25:59,And they fire loved arts at each other.
00:25:59,00:26:00,They certainly do.
00:26:00,00:26:08,"So, loved arts, they're like little arrows which are attached to the snail, but they don't"
00:26:08,00:26:10,fire them through the air.
00:26:10,00:26:13,"They basically get into close combat and then stab each other, and sometimes can stab"
00:26:13,00:26:18,"each other very fiercely, so the hoppin will go through the other snail's head and out"
00:26:18,00:26:19,the other side.
00:26:19,00:26:20,And then they mate.
00:26:20,00:26:24,"Yeah, that's not really what the painters of the Virgin Mary were going for."
00:26:24,00:26:25,Oh no.
00:26:25,00:26:30,There's a lovely 15th century manuscript that's covered in cat paw prints that I think went
00:26:30,00:26:32,"on Twitter last year, it went a bit viral."
00:26:32,00:26:34,"Oh, we should put that on our podcast page."
00:26:34,00:26:35,We'll put it on Rolls-Royce page.
00:26:35,00:26:36,Which humanizer is it really?
00:26:36,00:26:38,"Because suddenly you think, oh my god, a cat just walked across this guy's face."
00:26:38,00:26:40,"That was the one where the cat peed on it, was it?"
00:26:40,00:26:41,Did it?
00:26:41,00:26:46,"Yeah, the cat peed on it and the guy wrote, ""Here is nothing missing, but a cat urinated"
00:26:46,00:26:51,"on it during a certain night, cursed be the pesky cat that urinated over this book during"
00:26:51,00:26:56,"the night in Deventa, and because of it, many others too, and beware well not to leave open"
00:26:56,00:26:59,"books at night where cats can come as an arrive."""
00:26:59,00:27:00,Has it already been?
00:27:00,00:27:01,Right.
00:27:01,00:27:02,Cut it.
00:27:02,00:27:04,Couldn't clarify that.
00:27:04,00:27:09,It sounds like in the margins of these manuscripts are where whoever was scribbling all the
00:27:09,00:27:14,"stuff in the monks, let's say, there was like their own little place in the book where"
00:27:14,00:27:17,they could say what they really felt and the drawings that they could do to Lynn.
00:27:17,00:27:18,No one would know to stop them.
00:27:18,00:27:23,And people have translated some of like the extra commentary written by some of these monks
00:27:23,00:27:26,who are frustrated from writing out these long manuscripts and they're amazing.
00:27:26,00:27:32,"So some of them include new parchment, bad ink, I say nothing more."
00:27:32,00:27:37,"Another one is, ""Oh, my hand, at this one."
00:27:37,00:27:41,"Now I've written the whole thing, for Christ's sake, give me a drink."""
00:27:41,00:27:42,That's in a manuscripts.
00:27:42,00:27:43,"Oh god, it's fantastic."
00:27:43,00:27:47,It's quite exciting because I didn't realize at the time when I saw this snail versus
00:27:47,00:27:51,night thing that there's a lot of mysteries in medieval manuscripts.
00:27:51,00:27:56,"And they're constantly digging them up and there's great blogs on the British Library website,"
00:27:56,00:27:59,on the Smithsonian's website where they go into the back rooms.
00:27:59,00:28:03,They dig through all of these manuscripts and they manage to find things that have just
00:28:03,00:28:07,been lost in their archives and they contain mysteries once they find them.
00:28:07,00:28:11,"They found this great one recently, which was a long-lost cookbook that they were dying"
00:28:11,00:28:16,to find that they knew the existence of and it was run by a guy called Jeffery Fuel.
00:28:16,00:28:21,And he worked in the kitchens for the Queen of England in 1328 to 1369.
00:28:21,00:28:24,So that was a philipa of Haynalt at the time.
00:28:24,00:28:27,And he was basically known as the Heston Blumenthal of his day.
00:28:27,00:28:28,And he just...
00:28:28,00:28:32,"If I wouldn't have known who Heston Blumenthal was, that's the mystery, really."
00:28:32,00:28:33,"Yeah, exactly."
00:28:33,00:28:36,The only evidence we have for time travel.
00:28:36,00:28:42,He made tiny night porridge.
00:28:42,00:28:43,This is what's weird about it.
00:28:43,00:28:48,"It's got a bunch of recipes in it and it has a recipe for hedgehogs, blackbirds,"
00:28:48,00:28:50,and then a recipe for unicorns.
00:28:50,00:28:57,"And one of the recipes starts with the sentence, ""Take a one unicorn."""
00:28:57,00:28:59,That is so good.
00:28:59,00:29:00,Yeah.
00:29:00,00:29:02,That was the kind of cookbook you know when you get a cookbook that's really complicated
00:29:02,00:29:06,"and you open it and you think, ""Oh, I don't have any of this."""
00:29:06,00:29:11,"Straight away, you're closing that, you're going, ""Fog it, deal here."""
00:29:11,00:29:12,He was the Heston Blumenthal of his day.
00:29:12,00:29:14,He was the Miss' Beaton.
00:29:14,00:29:16,She published recipes for kangaroo.
00:29:16,00:29:17,Going back to that.
00:29:17,00:29:18,Did she?
00:29:18,00:29:19,Yeah.
00:29:19,00:29:20,Curried kangaroo tails.
00:29:20,00:29:21,"Oh, that's funny."
00:29:21,00:29:22,Because the Western grey kangaroo smells of curry.
00:29:22,00:29:23,Does it?
00:29:23,00:29:24,Yeah.
00:29:24,00:29:25,Apparently.
00:29:25,00:29:30,"Well, speaking of kangaroos, there is a manuscript, which is a Portuguese manuscript,"
00:29:30,00:29:35,"which has in one of the, you know how they always have a big letter to start off."
00:29:35,00:29:36,Yeah.
00:29:36,00:29:38,And there's always a drawing inside.
00:29:38,00:29:39,Once upon a time with a bigger...
00:29:39,00:29:40,Oh.
00:29:40,00:29:41,"Yeah, exactly."
00:29:41,00:29:42,And then they're drawing in the oak.
00:29:42,00:29:46,"And this Portuguese manuscript, they have a picture of a kangaroo."
00:29:46,00:29:51,And it predates when supposedly anyone had visited Australia by 400 years.
00:29:51,00:29:53,"Now, here's the thing."
00:29:53,00:29:58,They obviously don't know whether or not it was a kangaroo in the drawing because people
00:29:58,00:30:02,have pointed out it looks quite similar to an ardvark.
00:30:02,00:30:05,And an ardvark apparently can go on its hind legs when it's trying to eat something
00:30:05,00:30:06,off a tree.
00:30:06,00:30:09,"But when you look at this picture and we'll put it on the website, it's a kangaroo."
00:30:09,00:30:10,Like no question about it.
00:30:10,00:30:12,That's definitely a kangaroo.
00:30:12,00:30:17,"There is a painting from 1496 that has a sulfur-crested cockatoo in it, which is a parent native"
00:30:17,00:30:18,to Australia.
00:30:18,00:30:19,Yeah.
00:30:19,00:30:23,And they reckon that that is evidence that there was trading going on throughout the
00:30:23,00:30:24,world at that time.
00:30:24,00:30:30,"Okay, we might not have, Westerners might not have sailed down to Australia, but the Australians"
00:30:30,00:30:34,would have traded with the Chinese who would have traded with Indians who would have traded
00:30:34,00:30:35,with Europeans.
00:30:35,00:30:36,Okay.
00:30:36,00:30:37,Wow.
00:30:37,00:30:38,Yeah.
00:30:38,00:30:39,That's amazing.
00:30:39,00:30:44,"We're certainly trading with China in things like sea cucumbers, so there's no reason to"
00:30:44,00:30:47,"think that we wouldn't have traded, that the trade route wouldn't have come all the way"
00:30:47,00:30:48,"through the silk path, etc."
00:30:48,00:30:49,Yeah.
00:30:49,00:30:50,Yeah.
00:30:50,00:30:51,"They spread rumours, didn't they?"
00:30:51,00:30:57,They said these islands that we've got are guarded by giant sea serpents and giant birds
00:30:57,00:31:02,"and they made it, they made the spice islands sound as intimidating as they possibly good,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,just so that no one else would sail there.
00:31:04,00:31:06,And also it was so that the price would be so high.
00:31:06,00:31:11,"So cinnamon sticks, they said that they were part of a nest of a giant bird, and in order"
00:31:11,00:31:15,to get this bird you had to kill oxen and hide them so that the bird would go down and get
00:31:15,00:31:20,"the oxen, and then you could sneak up and grab bits of its, bits of its nest and they"
00:31:20,00:31:21,were cinnamon sticks.
00:31:21,00:31:25,"Of course it's all made up, but it meant that when you came home you could charge a massive"
00:31:25,00:31:27,price because all five of my men were killed.
00:31:27,00:31:28,Wow.
00:31:28,00:31:31,"I'd have one cool thing about nights, so how do you dub a night?"
00:31:31,00:31:33,"Sort on both shoulders, right?"
00:31:33,00:31:34,Yeah.
00:31:34,00:31:40,"So by the time William the Conqueror come to England, to night someone, you punch them"
00:31:40,00:31:41,in the face.
00:31:41,00:31:49,"Yeah, it was a blow with a fist, a bare fist to the face or neck, and this is how William"
00:31:49,00:31:54,"the Conqueror for instance, knighted his son Henry, just a few punch in the neck."
00:31:54,00:31:55,When did that stop?
00:31:55,00:31:56,Not sure.
00:31:56,00:31:57,Still going.
00:31:57,00:31:58,Yeah.
00:31:58,00:31:59,Can you imagine if the queen did this?
00:31:59,00:32:00,To Sir Cliff Richard.
00:32:00,00:32:01,Yeah.
00:32:01,00:32:04,Praise yourself Cliff.
00:32:04,00:32:06,She doesn't say a rise Sir Cliff.
00:32:06,00:32:07,No.
00:32:07,00:32:08,It's a myth.
00:32:08,00:32:09,"Yeah, because he's lying."
00:32:09,00:32:11,He's just on the part.
