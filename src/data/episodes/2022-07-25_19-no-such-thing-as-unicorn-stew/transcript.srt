1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,140
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,340
 Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,600
 It isn't nice, there's nothing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,640
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,600
 It says it, "Right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:23,280
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,280
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,680
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with the three regular elves

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,720
 and it's Zinsky, James Harkin and Andy Murray.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,000
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,400
 from the last week, and here they are in no particular order.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,200
 Okay, starting fact number one, James.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,920
 Okay, my fact this week is about kangaroos, as you all know.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,440
 Yep.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,240
 Uh, it comes in the form of a question, and that question is how many legs does a kangaroo have?

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,200
 I think I can feel this one with confidence, uh, two.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
 [Laughs]

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,920
 James is holding up a tiny Jackson button from...

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,760
 Were you talking about that?

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,400
 That's from the QI travel game.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,800
 Which is available in shops.

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,480
 Oh my god, that must be the most annoying toy.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,640
 [Laughs]

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,760
 Can you imagine on a airplane, a little kid sat next to you?

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
 Yeah.

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,360
 Does any time you get something wrong?

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,480
 Can I, I scream?

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,000
 No.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,760
 [Laughs]

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,400
 No, I'm afraid the answer is I can eat ice cream.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,920
 Okay, I'm going to put that to one side now, because that probably is very annoying.

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,560
 Um, yeah, they don't have two legs.

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,920
 Wait, so if they don't have two, they must have, what, four, the front, the front hands or legs?

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,640
 I'm going to have to get my buzzer out again.

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,240
 What? Why?

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,080
 Yeah, that isn't annoying.

38
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
 [Laughs]

39
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,680
 Uh, no, they have a three or five, depending on how you look at it, um, the tail counts as a leg.

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,480
 Mmm.

41
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,920
 And that's according to a new study, which was in New Scientist a couple of weeks ago.

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,120
 And, um, what they did is they put a kangaroo on a treadmill.

43
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,640
 Yeah.

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,200
 Which had pressure points and could see when they were putting pressure on the floor.

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,120
 And they found that in the normal walk, not their bouncing walk, but the other one they do,

46
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,720
 it's kind of a shuffling walk.

47
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,640
 Um, they used the tail in the way that any other animal would use a leg.

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,480
 Is it a weight bearing thing, though?

49
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,640
 Yeah, it's a weight bearing and propulsion.

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,160
 Yeah.

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,000
 Wow.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,480
 Okay, so I've got two questions.

53
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,000
 Go on.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,960
 First question is, can they walk backwards?

55
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,200
 Because that's one of the great Australian, either myths or truths.

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,600
 Uh, because the idea is that the, uh, the, the country's code of arms has a kangaroo and an

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,640
 e-mew on either side looking at each other and the idea of being that they were chosen

58
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,320
 because not only are they national animals, but they can't walk backwards, neither an e-mew

59
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
 or a kangaroo.

60
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
 What does it say on the code of arms?

61
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
 Always forwards or something.

62
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
 Oh, keep going forwards.

63
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
 Keep going forwards.

64
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,800
 Terrible, terrible piece of advice for a lot of people.

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
 Yeah, of course.

66
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
 You're standing there, Cliffs.

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
 No.

68
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
 That's true.

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,600
 I think they, they can jump backwards.

70
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,080
 There's, yeah, you can see on YouTube.

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
 There's footage of Woody Allen boxing a kangaroo in a very, very weird boat.

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
 Very weird, isn't it?

73
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
 It's on YouTube, yeah.

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,120
 I think moves backwards a bit in that.

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
 Yeah.

76
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
 Yeah.

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
 You said you had a second question.

78
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
 I do.

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
 Uh, yeah.

80
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,120
 Second question that I had was, are they the only animals with a tail for a leg?

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,600
 Um, as far as I know, you do have prehensile tails that animals use to swing around trees

82
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 and stuff and grab things, but not to my knowledge, do they use them to walk.

83
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,840
 Did dogongs use their tail as like a supportive thing?

84
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,840
 Is there anything where they do do dogongs, yeah, dogongs, you know, those things, uh,

85
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
 their manatees.

86
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
 Oh, yeah.

87
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
 A type of manatee.

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
 Sea cows.

89
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,840
 They're the things that sailors apparently thought were mermaids back in the olden days.

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,320
 They actually do have quite human faces.

91
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
 I think they have adorable faces.

92
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
 I'll put a picture on the website.

93
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
 They do.

94
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,960
 Just last time I was back in Sydney, the aquarium, they had like an arrival of dogongs and

95
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,320
 it was all over the posters, uh, in the city and, you know, dogongs are here.

96
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,280
 And it was the most unexciting attraction to an aquarium.

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
 Yeah.

98
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
 The Lego exhibition at Sydney Aquarium.

99
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,480
 There are lots of, um, bits of Lego washing up on British beaches, do you know about this?

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
 Yeah.

101
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
 There was a cruise.

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,640
 Um, there was a container crash in the late 90s and, um, something like a billion pieces

103
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,320
 of Lego went into the water and they're still washing up in, in, um, North and South

104
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
 Cornwall.

105
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,960
 Wasn't it weird because a lot of the Lego happened to be sea related stuff.

106
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
 Yeah.

107
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,000
 Like there are octopuses which are very, very special and, yeah, but it's a sea gross.

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,880
 Well, maybe they are like little Lego plankton and that's what you were watching in Sydney

109
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
 Zoo.

110
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
 Yes.

111
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,280
 Remember there was that, um, a guy wrote a book all about a, another container ship, uh, that

112
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
 had ducks.

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
 Drugs.

114
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
 The rubber ducks.

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
 And the plastic frogs, wasn't it?

116
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,360
 The rubber ducks were obviously the big, big draw.

117
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
 Beavers.

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
 Beavers.

119
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
 Real beavers are plastic.

120
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
 Yeah, plastic ones.

121
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
 We're in the same container.

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
 Didn't know that.

123
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,960
 They don't get the same publicity as the docks do because the rubber duck is a timeless

124
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
 style icon.

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
 Yeah.

126
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,880
 Do you ever bought someone to rub a beaver?

127
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 Maybe that was, maybe that was like a new thing that they're bringing over.

128
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,640
 This is our big chance with shipping over all the plastic beavers.

129
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
 It's going to be a massive hit.

130
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
 Now we'll never have them.

131
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
 Uh, okay.

132
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,640
 And all the other animals which have odd numbers of legs.

133
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
 Okay.

134
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
 Do you know any dandy?

135
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
 Hmm.

136
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,440
 There's a crab, isn't there?

137
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
 Yes, there is.

138
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,120
 There's a spider crab, uh, called macro-kiera camp fairy.

139
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,680
 It's like that massive Japanese spider crab that you see every now and then on the internet.

140
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,760
 It's absolutely humongous.

141
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,000
 And there's a study done and they found that three quarters of the crabs are missing at

142
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,320
 least one limb.

143
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
 Yeah.

144
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
 And most crabs have got ten legs.

145
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,920
 In fact, all crabs have got ten legs.

146
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,560
 So most of these particular crabs have got nine legs, although they have lost them.

147
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
 Wow.

148
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
 It's a bit, yeah.

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
 It's a bit of a cheat, isn't it?

150
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
 They should just evolve with one leg fewer.

151
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
 Well, they might do.

152
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
 They wouldn't need to lose that again.

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,240
 They can survive with up to three legs missing.

154
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
 It's more than I can do.

155
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,000
 There's a thing called a seven-hour mock to push.

156
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Is that born with seven arms?

157
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,880
 No, it has eight arms, but one of them is very small and held up and you can't see it very

158
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
 well.

159
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,280
 So people thought they had seven arms.

160
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
 That's good.

161
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
 People who didn't look very closely.

162
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
 Yeah.

163
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
 And also, there's starfish, of course.

164
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,960
 Yeah, so all of those crabs like starfish, sea urchin, sea cucumbers always have multiples

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
 of five, don't they?

166
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,280
 But they're not legs, really.

167
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
 They're limbs.

168
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
 Limbs?

169
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
 Yeah.

170
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
 And the tripod fish.

171
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
 Do you guys know about the tripod fish?

172
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:14,520
 It's an extremely deep-water fish and it has three long protrusions that come off its fins.

173
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,360
 So I think it's never any more than 30 centimetres long, but its little thin protrusions can

174
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,040
 be up to a meter and it walks along on them like a tripod.

175
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,720
 And it's really good because it means it's at the right level for the currents to sweep

176
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,080
 loads of prawns into its face and it can detect vibrations in the seabird if predators

177
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
 are coming.

178
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,520
 So I reckon that might be the closest other animal there is having three legs.

179
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,640
 It's true odd-legged.

180
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,720
 When kangaroos are born, when Joey's are born, you know, and they crawl up into the pouch,

181
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,280
 they don't have their back legs even.

182
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,200
 They do have their front legs, but that's the only thing, they're basically a tiny worm

183
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,720
 with these two minuscule front legs which they use to basically crawl up their mother's

184
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
 fur into the pouch.

185
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
 Yeah.

186
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
 That's good.

187
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
 And then they get their back legs later.

188
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
 They are tiny aren't they?

189
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,200
 They're the size of a grain of rice, kangaroos when they're born.

190
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,480
 People thought that kangaroos had two heads when they first saw them.

191
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,880
 When Europeans first saw them because of their Joey on the chest.

192
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,400
 Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

193
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,440
 So when their first descriptions came back to the West, that's what they thought.

194
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
 Wow.

195
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
 Yeah.

196
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,120
 They have those, the QIFAC, which might have been one of the first ever QIFACs about kangaroos

197
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,600
 having three vaginas, which they do just in case there's one listener out there who doesn't

198
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
 know it.

199
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,240
 So first fact I learned when I was having my interview for the job.

200
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
 Yeah.

201
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,520
 Was it for you for QI was a chat, a lunch, a lunch.

202
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,040
 Was it testing your response to that?

203
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
 What did you do?

204
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
 Did you recoil in disgust?

205
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
 You would have made it.

206
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
 You've been rejected.

207
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
 I didn't recoil in disgust.

208
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
 I said, hmm.

209
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,640
 I like the sound of that.

210
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,280
 That's the incorrect response.

211
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,600
 I've got two favorite kangaroo QIFACs have been in the books and the TV shows, but I

212
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 absolutely love them.

213
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,720
 The first one is that the mother kangaroo mammary glands, so female mammary glands produce

214
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,920
 both full cream and fat-free milk simultaneously.

215
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
 That's wonderful.

216
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,720
 The child's just, the root's got an option.

217
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,200
 They're like the way-trows of macropodi.

218
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,520
 Yeah, exactly.

219
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,560
 And the other one is that kangaroos swim doggie paddle when they go swimming.

220
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
 That's their style.

221
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
 Doggie paddle.

222
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,360
 And also they kick their legs independently when they swim, which they never do on land.

223
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,320
 On land they move both legs simultaneously.

224
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,440
 So you see them move forwards either hopping or using the tail to project themselves.

225
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,240
 But in swimming, dum, dum, dum either side.

226
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
 Did you know that Elvis had a pet kangaroos?

227
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
 Did he?

228
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,760
 I've always been curious if anyone had a pet kangaroo.

229
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
 Elvis had one?

230
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
 He had a couple, I think.

231
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,640
 He was given them, I'm going off memory here, but I think he was given them by Zoo in Australia.

232
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,880
 And then he gave them back, because they weren't as much fun as he thought they were going

233
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
 to be.

234
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 Yeah.

235
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,040
 One quite cool thing when I read about kangaroos is kangaroo mother care.

236
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,040
 Kangaroo mother care is what's being recommended for premature births in developing countries.

237
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,520
 So 10% of premature birth in developing countries, the child dies within the first year and in 90%

238
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
 in developed countries.

239
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,040
 So it's a massive problem in developing countries.

240
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,040
 And they're suggesting kangaroo mother care, which is basically where you have constant skin

241
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,400
 to skin contact between baby and mother.

242
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,920
 And the mother straps the baby to her for up to like the first eight or nine months.

243
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,200
 And it reduces in for mortality by 50%.

244
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,800
 So it could have saved, like, would save like 1.1 million deaths a year.

245
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,920
 And it's just about the warmth of the skin contact and constant breastfeeding and probably

246
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,160
 bonding between mother and child and anticipating its needs more, a pretty simple way of seriously

247
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,560
 reducing infant mortality.

248
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
 Yeah.

249
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,240
 I've got one last thing that I want to throw in before we move on, which is that there's

250
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,520
 been a study that's shown that male kangaroos can attract the opposite sex by impressing

251
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,440
 her with his biceps, with his forearms.

252
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,280
 They're apparently really important in the kangaroo world to the point where they frequently

253
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:02,160
 adopt poses, showing their muscles, like bodybuilders, going, hey, ladies, two tickets to the gun

254
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
 show.

255
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,440
 Like, just for people listening, Dan is doing the bodybuilder poses as well.

256
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
 I'm doing it.

257
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
 Yeah.

258
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,040
 If you've ever seen Johnny Bravo, it's a lot like cool.

259
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
 Cool.

260
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
 Yeah.

261
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
 Exactly.

262
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
 Yeah.

263
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,880
 And in a fight, that's often, apparently, what the female kangaroos are looking at, at

264
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,280
 the males in a fight, they're going to look at the biceps on that guy.

265
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,440
 Yeah, because what they do is they grab the other guy with the armpits, and then they kick

266
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
 them with the leg bits.

267
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,040
 So the arms are quite important in fighting.

268
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
 Yeah.

269
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,520
 But the legs are more impressive if you want to attract someone.

270
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
 Why aren't they going?

271
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
 Look at my huge feet.

272
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,040
 How awesome are my huge feet, guys.

273
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,520
 You know what they say about kangaroos with big feet?

274
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
 Yeah.

275
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
 Okay.

276
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:46,400
 Time to move on to fact number two, and that is Anna.

277
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
 Yep.

278
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,120
 My fact is that during the financial crisis of 1720, Parliament called upon stop brokers to

279
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,520
 be sown into sacks filled with poisonous snakes and thrown into the Thames.

280
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
 Was that a serious thing?

281
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,200
 I mean, that's surely.

282
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,120
 I think it was just, I don't think they were intending it actually to happen.

283
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,520
 It was to express their vehement dislike.

284
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,280
 But it was during the South Sea bubble, which was one of the earliest financial crises.

285
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,440
 A guy who made the speech, which suggested this, was Lord Molesworth, and he was drawing

286
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,960
 on Roman tradition, which had people who committed parasite, which had them thrown into the

287
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
 typer.

288
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
 So he said, what's parasite?

289
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,560
 It's killing a father.

290
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,600
 Anyway, even with animals as well, there were animals in the sack.

291
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,120
 There was a rooster, a monkey and a dog in the sack with you when you went into the river.

292
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
 Oh, was there.

293
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,760
 It's horrible, isn't it?

294
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,760
 According to another Roman thing, if there wasn't any water nearby, if there wasn't a convenient

295
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,560
 river or sea nearby, you would be put in a sack with a rooster and a viper and a dog

296
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,240
 in a monkey, and then thrown into wild animals to be torn apart.

297
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
 Oh, my God.

298
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
 Yeah.

299
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
 They used to put more effort into punishment, I think.

300
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
 Yeah.

301
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,040
 They go to lengths to find these poisonous and tropical exotic creatures.

302
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,040
 Well, I think this was, because in this particular case, before the debate, because everyone

303
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,520
 was extremely angry about the South Sea bubble bursting, because people were ruined by it,

304
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,560
 including, in fact, Isaac Newton invested a lot of money in the South Sea company, and

305
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,400
 he was totally bankrupt after it.

306
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,800
 And Alexander Pope was not, because he was one of the crafty ones who exited early.

307
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,480
 But so did Isaac Newton.

308
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,680
 Isaac Newton got out in time and then went back in.

309
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,960
 He could see it was going to fall.

310
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,160
 Oh, God.

311
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,440
 But yeah, people were angry.

312
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,520
 And so in Parliament was getting very vehement.

313
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,560
 And so before the debate, the king made a speech, urging people to retain prudence and temper

314
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,960
 to ensure that the right punishments were distributed.

315
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,280
 And their response to that was say, throw them in the tens in a sack that sewn up with poisonous

316
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
 snakes.

317
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
 Well, the king got out in time.

318
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
 Did he?

319
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
 He was one of the people who got out in time.

320
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,880
 He and Robert Walpole, who I think was prime minister at the time.

321
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
 Both got out in time.

322
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,840
 But that's only because the financial advisors had disobeyed them.

323
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
 Oh, really?

324
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
 That's interesting.

325
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
 Yeah.

326
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
 Oh, that is interesting.

327
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,000
 So actually, this is not going to be good for you.

328
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,440
 I'm not going to put the money in.

329
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
 So isn't that--

330
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,720
 Financial advisors were that thoughtful for everyone all the time.

331
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,920
 Luckily we learned our lesson and there was no financial crisis ever again.

332
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
 Absolutely.

333
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
 Absolutely.

334
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
 It's not the earliest.

335
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
 Is Tulip Mania the first--

336
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
 Was that before the South?

337
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
 Yes, it was.

338
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
 Yes, it was.

339
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
 16th century.

340
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
 Yeah.

341
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
 So you should explain what that is.

342
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,680
 So Tulip Mania was in the Netherlands, wasn't it?

343
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,040
 And it was when people suddenly started going mad for tulips and the price of tulips massively

344
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
 inflated.

345
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,880
 I think the price of one tulip bulb was the same as a ten-year salary for the average

346
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
 craftsman.

347
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
 Wow.

348
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
 And then it burst.

349
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,920
 There's a really cool story about Tulip Mania, which is--in the 1630s, a sailor was imprisoned

350
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,760
 in a Dutch prison for eating what he thought was an onion.

351
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,560
 It was actually a tulip bulb and it could have fed the entire crew of his ship for months.

352
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,600
 Oh, that's insane.

353
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
 Who eats an onion just on its own?

354
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,480
 A sailor, he's not had vegetables for a long time, I suppose.

355
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,120
 That's pretty desperate.

356
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,240
 Not only are you eating an onion, you're just eating the world's most expensive onion.

357
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
 He's like, you know what?

358
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,360
 As well, it didn't taste that oniony.

359
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,800
 I was reading about Parliament because I don't actually know much about Parliament.

360
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,720
 There's that thing of that, if the queen goes to Parliament, then Buckingham Palace needs

361
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,800
 to take an MP prisoner for the time that she's there, just in case they suddenly decide

362
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
 to take a hostage.

363
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,600
 Yeah, which is a movie that I've not seen made yet, which might not have a really important

364
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 MP.

365
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
 Is it not?

366
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
 Do they get like the rubbishest?

367
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
 They think they get a--

368
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
 The new guy.

369
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,200
 Yeah, sorry, no offense if you're listening and you've been the hostage.

370
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,000
 But it's normally not George Osborne.

371
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,640
 It's normally not a really senior member of Parliament.

372
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,440
 It's dispensable, just in case.

373
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
 Exactly.

374
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,240
 In Chestnut, it's like trading the queen for a pawn, except you've got 600 pawns and

375
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,000
 this is the least good of them.

376
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,920
 It's the replaced one because you lost all the other-- you lost the proper one, yeah.

377
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,760
 It's a thin bun, yeah.

378
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,640
 I was thinking about MPs doing kooky stuff in Parliament.

379
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,840
 I read somewhere that William Pitt, the younger, he was a drunk and he once during a speech

380
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,360
 vomited behind the speaker's chair and then returned to his seat and continued doing

381
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
 his speech until the end.

382
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,760
 There were contemporary reports that say that, but they might come from-- they might be

383
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,640
 propaganda from the other side, but he was a drunk.

384
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,680
 So I have one more thing, on Parliamentary misdeeds.

385
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,960
 In 2010, a Tory MP had to apologise for being too drunk to cast his vote on the budget.

386
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,880
 He got drunk in the Parliament bar and he forgot to rock up and vote.

387
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,800
 And Hazel Blizz, who we'll probably know, Labour MP, said she had been out on the terrace

388
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,400
 with him, but had retired to the library when it got a bit too lively.

389
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,200
 But this man's name is Mark Reckless.

390
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
 That's great.

391
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,960
 You mentioned the bar, so Parliament has their own bar, don't they?

392
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
 Oh yeah.

393
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,160
 They've got a few bars, they have a library, the strangers bar, they're all cousins.

394
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
 Yeah.

395
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
 And cheaper jinks.

396
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
 They've also got a hairdressers?

397
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
 I don't know.

398
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
 Yeah.

399
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
 And this is really odd.

400
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
 They have a rifle shooting range.

401
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
 Oh, the lords have one of the basement, though.

402
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
 Yeah.

403
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
 Yeah.

404
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
 Isn't that really odd?

405
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
 Yeah.

406
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
 They just go and shoot a rifle.

407
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
 I think it's very, really used.

408
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,640
 They used to have rifle shooting in pubs.

409
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
 Yes.

410
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,120
 It was like a pub spot that people would go around the different pubs and play against

411
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
 each other.

412
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
 They banned it.

413
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,000
 And you know why they banned it?

414
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,960
 Because people were gambling on it.

415
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
 That's excellent.

416
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
 They had to.

417
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,240
 It wasn't some of it across corridors and things like that.

418
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
 Yeah.

419
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,920
 There's some brilliant photos of people taking shots in a pub and there's like old boys drinking

420
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,840
 their stout underneath the barrel of the gun, it's absolutely great.

421
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,200
 What shall we do in this place where people come and get really drunk and disordering?

422
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,960
 Should we introduce guns?

423
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
 Anything else?

424
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,440
 Can we just quickly go back to Punishments because I have one more thing going on.

425
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
 Oh yeah.

426
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,240
 In the olden days they used to saw people in half as a mode of execution.

427
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
 Wow.

428
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,440
 Which is quite a good way of going about it.

429
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
 When?

430
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
 Well.

431
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
 On not a good way, but a way.

432
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,280
 It's a thorough way.

433
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,040
 Simon the Zealot was sawn in this way, supposedly.

434
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
 Simon the Zealot.

435
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
 Simon the Zealot, yeah?

436
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
 You know him?

437
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
 Really enthusiastic guy.

438
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,360
 Hey guys, do you want to play round as late as it?

439
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,920
 The way that they saw him, I don't know if this is what they did with everyone, but they

440
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,960
 hung him upside down and they started with his groin and went lengthways.

441
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,720
 Oh God, the gold finger method.

442
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
 Yeah.

443
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,600
 Sorry, when you said in half, I thought you meant as in a magician's trick.

444
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
 Me too.

445
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
 But so they did it.

446
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
 Oh my God.

447
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
 Starting with the groin.

448
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,400
 That is the worst.

449
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,800
 But Simon the Zealot didn't mind.

450
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,320
 Because I'm not feeling as zealous about this as I normally am about other things.

451
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:50,760
 Okay, time to move on to fact number three and that is you Andy Murray.

452
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,160
 My fact is that there are three times as many estate agents in the UK as there are members

453
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
 of the armed forces.

454
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
 Yeah, that is weird.

455
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,760
 Well, yeah, there's been a massive boom in estate agents recently and also all the soldiers

456
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
 have been sacked.

457
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,400
 So in some ways, it's surprising.

458
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
 Oh really?

459
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,800
 Well, there are being huge cuts and people said that the army is going down to the size

460
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,520
 it was at the bear war, but it's not true.

461
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,320
 It's actually going to be substantially smaller than it was during the bear war.

462
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
 Yeah.

463
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
 Because in wartime, the army is increased massively.

464
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

465
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
 It's amazing.

466
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,880
 There are graphs of the armed forces population from about 1870 to today.

467
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,160
 And obviously there are two vast spikes there, but then it's been a gradual tail off since

468
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,360
 the end of the Second World War.

469
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,880
 And are they becoming estate agents?

470
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
 Is that what's that?

471
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
 Is it a straight swap?

472
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,920
 They're round a house where a guy in camouflage.

473
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,480
 Now this house has a beautiful bunker which you might want to use is facing north and it's

474
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,160
 very defensible, very defensible.

475
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
 I don't know.

476
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,920
 I don't think a lot of them are becoming estate agents.

477
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,040
 How many real estate agents do we have?

478
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,120
 At real estate agents or fake estate agents?

479
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,440
 There are, I think it's something like 560,000 from memory.

480
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,160
 In 2008, an estate agent was showing people around a potential property.

481
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,320
 I think it was in somewhere in the south of England.

482
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,080
 It was worth 350 grand.

483
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,480
 He opened up the walking closet to show it off and he found the owner hanging dead in there.

484
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
 Oh no.

485
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,680
 A spokesman for the company said it was quite a shock, which you would expect.

486
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,840
 It would have been good if it had been a sold by a guy called Roy Brooks, do you guys know

487
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
 who he is?

488
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
 No.

489
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,880
 Okay, Roy Brooks was an estate agent from the early 20th century and he was known as

490
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,400
 the honest estate agent.

491
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,440
 He would give somewhat two honest descriptions of his houses that he was trying to sell.

492
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
 So, I want to read one.

493
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:48,160
 This was from the early 20th century by Roy Brooks, and Brothel in Pimlico wanted someone

494
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,440
 with taste, means and a stomach strong enough to buy this erstwhile house of ill repute in Pimlico.

495
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,800
 It is untouched by the 20th century as far as convenience for even the basic human decencies

496
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,240
 is concerned.

497
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,720
 Although it reeks of damp or worse, the plaster is coming off the walls and daylight peeps

498
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,040
 through a hole in the roof.

499
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:13,160
 It is still habitable judging by the bed of rags, faggens and empty bottles in one corner.

500
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,440
 Plenty of scope for the socially aspiring to express their decorative taste and nothing to

501
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,640
 stop them putting Westminster on their note paper.

502
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
 That's fantastic.

503
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,880
 Ten rather unpleasant rooms with a smelly backyard £15,000.

504
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
 Wow.

505
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,200
 With a smelly backyard.

506
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
 Why did he do that?

507
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,800
 Well, he became famous for it and then got a lot of people looking at his properties because

508
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,320
 he'd become famous.

509
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,200
 There is definitely room for someone to do that today.

510
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,720
 I went on a viewing with someone who was looking to buy a place recently and it was basically

511
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,240
 a condemned place and his date agent to her credit said this is awful, isn't it?

512
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,080
 She was really really honest.

513
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,640
 Well, the kitchen was all covered in brown rust and condemned tape where it says it

514
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,760
 do not use this as a condemned equipment and she says it just looks like really bad food

515
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,720
 and then someone can get to the toilet in time.

516
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,560
 That was the first viewing I'd ever been on.

517
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,880
 That was quite £450,000 in zone 9.

518
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,760
 The foremost adulterous professions in the US are physicians, police officers, lawyers

519
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,640
 and then real estate agents or estate agents.

520
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,520
 I do like real estate agents.

521
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,160
 I feel like in Australia, that's what we call them, real estate agents.

522
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,920
 I think it is in America as well, possibly real estate agents or things, but here we just

523
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
 say it's date agents.

524
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,160
 Here in real estate agents is wonderful.

525
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,600
 Doctors, that's not great.

526
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
 Doctors.

527
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
 Wow.

528
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
 Police find that out.

529
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
 Was it self-reported?

530
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,560
 No, it was from a website where you go if you want to, if you're married and you want

531
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,040
 to hook up with people like those illicit encounters, I mean, not only no, I just, I don't

532
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,600
 have to put your profession in there and that's what they found.

533
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
 Right.

534
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
 Well, they might have been lying about that.

535
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
 I mean, they've been lying to the people in their lives as well.

536
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
 It's totally possible.

537
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,360
 A lot of would-be doctors would have said, "Yeah, I'm basically a doctor."

538
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,760
 There's a website you can look up in the US, which tells you if anyone's died in your

539
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
 house.

540
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
 Oh, okay.

541
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,400
 And how they did it.

542
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
 How they did it?

543
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,640
 Sounds like John Bonderson's book.

544
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
 John Bonderson.

545
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,040
 Yeah, James wrote an endorsement for this book that John Bonderson.

546
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,680
 He's a friend of us.

547
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
 He's a friend of ours.

548
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,040
 He does all sorts of odd travels around the UK to discover that this book in particular

549
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,800
 is called The Murder Houses of London.

550
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,080
 Basically, he's got this book, which is all about all the houses in London where there have

551
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
 been murders.

552
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,880
 And he goes into detail about the different murders that have been there.

553
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,080
 It's really, really interesting book.

554
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,560
 I got drunk with him once in Central London and when we got drunk, he went, "Do you want

555
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
 to see some of the houses?"

556
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,000
 And we walked around the London and he was like, "Here, there was a murder."

557
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,680
 And he was so excited by these murders.

558
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:51,120
 Just with the people being murdered in houses, though, sometimes the idea of ghosts is actually

559
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,320
 a desirable thing that real estate agents, real ones, use in order to sell a house.

560
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,720
 I mean, the people actually used to put wanted ads out when they were looking for a house

561
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,080
 with little requests for ghosts in the house.

562
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
 Wow.

563
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
 The word mortgage.

564
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,480
 Does everyone know what that means?

565
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,520
 I mean, it's a massive kick in the balls delivered to the wallet.

566
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,880
 No, it means death, mort.

567
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,160
 It means death, pledge, basically.

568
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,240
 So you can hang us off until you die?

569
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
 It's sort of.

570
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,080
 Well, the reason, so the earliest explanation we have for that is from someone, I think, in

571
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,280
 the 16th century who said, "The reason mortgage is death pledge, literally, is because it is

572
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,960
 doubtful whether the borrower will pay at the appointed day such some or not as is due.

573
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,560
 And so the land is taken from him, i.e. dead to him."

574
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,080
 So it's called a death pledge or a dead pledge, literally because it's so unlikely you'll

575
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,480
 be able to pay it back that you're going to have the land taken away from you, so you want

576
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
 it.

577
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,520
 But it comes in the same route, which I find really interesting.

578
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,320
 It comes, the word mortgage comes in the same route as the word wedding, though gauge is

579
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,000
 a pledge and wed was pledged, and they both come with the Germanic word 'wadjo'.

580
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,760
 Why don't we still use the word?

581
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,800
 Yeah, look at the stupid word.

582
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
 'Wadjo' so funny.

583
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,560
 It was a really beautiful 'wadjo' actually, the pride looked wonderful.

584
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,200
 I think we've just realised why we don't still use that word.

585
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,080
 Four wadjos in the funeral.

586
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:24,400
 Okay, time for the final fact of the podcast, and that is my fact, and that is that I recently

587
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,440
 discovered that medieval manuscripts are littered with drawings of warfare between snails

588
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
 and knights.

589
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,400
 They're just constantly in battle, and the amazing thing is no one knows why, it's a total

590
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
 mystery.

591
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
 Isn't it wonderful?

592
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,480
 It's just on the margins, on the side of all these manuscripts, there'll just be drawings

593
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
 of snails versus...

594
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,160
 And at the same time, it's not a real-sized knight and a tiny snail.

595
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
 It's the same size.

596
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,760
 It fluctuates sometimes.

597
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,240
 Sometimes it is tiny by their foot, sometimes they're way larger than the knight.

598
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,600
 And people are looking into it to try and work out why.

599
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,120
 There was a great paper called 'The Snail in Gothic Marginal Warfare'.

600
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,740
 And they have theories that it's a representation of the resurrection of Jesus, that the snail

601
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:15,120
 represents a sort of highly armoured chivalric foe.

602
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
 They don't know.

603
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
 They just have no idea.

604
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
 You know what I think it might be.

605
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,360
 You know when you just set the doodle link, one of the things you doodle is like a spiral,

606
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,560
 and sometimes you just draw a spiral, you might then turn it into a snail, and then when

607
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,960
 you're trying to snail, what are you obviously going to do?

608
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
 Make it fighting.

609
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:36,800
 It does go down a bit there, but there's a lot of paintings of the Virgin Mary, where she

610
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,400
 has snails in the picture.

611
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,320
 That's the symbolism of the Virgin Mary because the shells mean that their modesty is protected.

612
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,920
 And it was thought that they reproduced without sex.

613
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
 Oh really?

614
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,120
 And they don't do that, do they?

615
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
 Snails.

616
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,960
 Yeah, they don't reproduce without sex.

617
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
 No, they don't.

618
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
 No sex with sex.

619
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,760
 So they're roundy little beasts.

620
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,360
 Yeah, they're hermaphrodites.

621
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,920
 And they fire loved arts at each other.

622
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
 They certainly do.

623
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:08,920
 So, loved arts, they're like little arrows which are attached to the snail, but they don't

624
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,240
 fire them through the air.

625
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,960
 They basically get into close combat and then stab each other, and sometimes can stab

626
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,840
 each other very fiercely, so the hoppin will go through the other snail's head and out

627
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
 the other side.

628
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
 And then they mate.

629
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,640
 Yeah, that's not really what the painters of the Virgin Mary were going for.

630
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
 Oh no.

631
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,800
 There's a lovely 15th century manuscript that's covered in cat paw prints that I think went

632
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,480
 on Twitter last year, it went a bit viral.

633
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,200
 Oh, we should put that on our podcast page.

634
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
 We'll put it on Rolls-Royce page.

635
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
 Which humanizer is it really?

636
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,840
 Because suddenly you think, oh my god, a cat just walked across this guy's face.

637
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,880
 That was the one where the cat peed on it, was it?

638
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,880
 Did it?

639
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,560
 Yeah, the cat peed on it and the guy wrote, "Here is nothing missing, but a cat urinated

640
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,880
 on it during a certain night, cursed be the pesky cat that urinated over this book during

641
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,680
 the night in Deventa, and because of it, many others too, and beware well not to leave open

642
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,640
 books at night where cats can come as an arrive."

643
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
 Has it already been?

644
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
 Right.

645
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
 Cut it.

646
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,280
 Couldn't clarify that.

647
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,000
 It sounds like in the margins of these manuscripts are where whoever was scribbling all the

648
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 stuff in the monks, let's say, there was like their own little place in the book where

649
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,160
 they could say what they really felt and the drawings that they could do to Lynn.

650
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,720
 No one would know to stop them.

651
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,320
 And people have translated some of like the extra commentary written by some of these monks

652
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,840
 who are frustrated from writing out these long manuscripts and they're amazing.

653
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,880
 So some of them include new parchment, bad ink, I say nothing more.

654
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,160
 Another one is, "Oh, my hand, at this one.

655
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,040
 Now I've written the whole thing, for Christ's sake, give me a drink."

656
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,280
 That's in a manuscripts.

657
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,880
 Oh god, it's fantastic.

658
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,440
 It's quite exciting because I didn't realize at the time when I saw this snail versus

659
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,160
 night thing that there's a lot of mysteries in medieval manuscripts.

660
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,360
 And they're constantly digging them up and there's great blogs on the British Library website,

661
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,480
 on the Smithsonian's website where they go into the back rooms.

662
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,440
 They dig through all of these manuscripts and they manage to find things that have just

663
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,200
 been lost in their archives and they contain mysteries once they find them.

664
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,920
 They found this great one recently, which was a long-lost cookbook that they were dying

665
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,400
 to find that they knew the existence of and it was run by a guy called Jeffery Fuel.

666
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,680
 And he worked in the kitchens for the Queen of England in 1328 to 1369.

667
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,440
 So that was a philipa of Haynalt at the time.

668
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,520
 And he was basically known as the Heston Blumenthal of his day.

669
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
 And he just...

670
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,320
 If I wouldn't have known who Heston Blumenthal was, that's the mystery, really.

671
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
 Yeah, exactly.

672
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,920
 The only evidence we have for time travel.

673
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:42,320
 He made tiny night porridge.

674
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,560
 This is what's weird about it.

675
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,160
 It's got a bunch of recipes in it and it has a recipe for hedgehogs, blackbirds,

676
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,680
 and then a recipe for unicorns.

677
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:57,360
 And one of the recipes starts with the sentence, "Take a one unicorn."

678
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,120
 That is so good.

679
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
 Yeah.

680
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,320
 That was the kind of cookbook you know when you get a cookbook that's really complicated

681
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,600
 and you open it and you think, "Oh, I don't have any of this."

682
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,000
 Straight away, you're closing that, you're going, "Fog it, deal here."

683
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,560
 He was the Heston Blumenthal of his day.

684
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,040
 He was the Miss' Beaton.

685
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
 She published recipes for kangaroo.

686
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
 Going back to that.

687
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
 Did she?

688
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
 Yeah.

689
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
 Curried kangaroo tails.

690
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
 Oh, that's funny.

691
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,800
 Because the Western grey kangaroo smells of curry.

692
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
 Does it?

693
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
 Yeah.

694
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
 Apparently.

695
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,280
 Well, speaking of kangaroos, there is a manuscript, which is a Portuguese manuscript,

696
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,640
 which has in one of the, you know how they always have a big letter to start off.

697
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
 Yeah.

698
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,000
 And there's always a drawing inside.

699
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,160
 Once upon a time with a bigger...

700
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
 Oh.

701
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
 Yeah, exactly.

702
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
 And then they're drawing in the oak.

703
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,080
 And this Portuguese manuscript, they have a picture of a kangaroo.

704
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,760
 And it predates when supposedly anyone had visited Australia by 400 years.

705
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,080
 Now, here's the thing.

706
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,720
 They obviously don't know whether or not it was a kangaroo in the drawing because people

707
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,600
 have pointed out it looks quite similar to an ardvark.

708
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,920
 And an ardvark apparently can go on its hind legs when it's trying to eat something

709
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
 off a tree.

710
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,720
 But when you look at this picture and we'll put it on the website, it's a kangaroo.

711
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
 Like no question about it.

712
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,240
 That's definitely a kangaroo.

713
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,880
 There is a painting from 1496 that has a sulfur-crested cockatoo in it, which is a parent native

714
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
 to Australia.

715
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
 Yeah.

716
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,520
 And they reckon that that is evidence that there was trading going on throughout the

717
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,720
 world at that time.

718
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,040
 Okay, we might not have, Westerners might not have sailed down to Australia, but the Australians

719
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,040
 would have traded with the Chinese who would have traded with Indians who would have traded

720
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
 with Europeans.

721
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
 Okay.

722
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
 Wow.

723
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
 Yeah.

724
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
 That's amazing.

725
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,760
 We're certainly trading with China in things like sea cucumbers, so there's no reason to

726
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,880
 think that we wouldn't have traded, that the trade route wouldn't have come all the way

727
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
 through the silk path, etc.

728
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
 Yeah.

729
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
 Yeah.

730
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
 They spread rumours, didn't they?

731
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,960
 They said these islands that we've got are guarded by giant sea serpents and giant birds

732
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,560
 and they made it, they made the spice islands sound as intimidating as they possibly good,

733
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,080
 just so that no one else would sail there.

734
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,320
 And also it was so that the price would be so high.

735
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,240
 So cinnamon sticks, they said that they were part of a nest of a giant bird, and in order

736
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,520
 to get this bird you had to kill oxen and hide them so that the bird would go down and get

737
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,440
 the oxen, and then you could sneak up and grab bits of its, bits of its nest and they

738
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
 were cinnamon sticks.

739
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,040
 Of course it's all made up, but it meant that when you came home you could charge a massive

740
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,160
 price because all five of my men were killed.

741
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
 Wow.

742
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,800
 I'd have one cool thing about nights, so how do you dub a night?

743
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
 Sort on both shoulders, right?

744
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
 Yeah.

745
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:40,680
 So by the time William the Conqueror come to England, to night someone, you punch them

746
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
 in the face.

747
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:49,080
 Yeah, it was a blow with a fist, a bare fist to the face or neck, and this is how William

748
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,480
 the Conqueror for instance, knighted his son Henry, just a few punch in the neck.

749
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
 When did that stop?

750
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
 Not sure.

751
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
 Still going.

752
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
 Yeah.

753
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,960
 Can you imagine if the queen did this?

754
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
 To Sir Cliff Richard.

755
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
 Yeah.

756
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,440
 Praise yourself Cliff.

757
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,360
 She doesn't say a rise Sir Cliff.

758
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
 No.

759
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
 It's a myth.

760
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
 Yeah, because he's lying.

761
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,440
 He's just on the part.

762
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,760

 Also, just very quickly, if you happen to be an Edinburgh for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival,

775
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,680
 there's quite a lot of no such thing as a fish related comedy shows going up there.

776
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,600
 Andy you're going to be doing two shows, you're doing ostentatious.

777
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,080
 Yeah, that's at the Pleasant's Dome at 140pm every day, it's Jane Austen themed enterprise

778
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
 comedy.

779
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,720
 I'm also doing a two-person improv show called Folly Adder, which is at 6pm every day at Pleasant's

780
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
 courtyard.

 Yeah, I'm going to be doing my debut hour, which is called Cock Blocked from Outer Space.

782
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,440
 And it's an hour stand-up show from 540 at the Underbelly Daisy Room.

783
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,280
 And also we're going to be doing Museumicuriosity Live, which is the live version of our BBC

 We have amazing guests from Jimmy Carr, Phil Jupiter, Mark Watson, David O'Doppady, to the
