1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
 is anyone else cold? No, I'm okay. I am wearing a jumper. Oh, yeah. I'm wearing two jumpers.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,760
 No fucking way. I'm naked. No, I'm cold. Thanks for giving me a jumper, James.

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,160
 Hi. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Drop Us Align, the clubfish bonus lounge where we talk about all the

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,760
 facts you've sent in or the corrections you've sent in, and we're going to be getting some of those

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,080
 out of the inbox. Yeah. I'm reading through them, putting them back in the inbox. It's going to

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:46,160
 be great. Putting them back in the inbox. Yeah. Okay, let's get cracking. Here is a message from

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,880
 Ellie. Ellie says, "I hope you're well. I really enjoyed listening to the blobby chat." This was

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,200
 the Rachel was on. Yeah. She says, "Even more so, because I can exclusively share what blobby school

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:04,000
 is really like." Ah, blobby school being where, when it was turned into a theme park? No training

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
 academy for being blobby. Yeah, but they needed blobby's for these theme parks. You're right.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,200
 I got to experience the absolute horror of being Mr. blobby in real life during an ill-fated

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,160
 short-lived Panto run recently. So basically, there was one blobby costume designed for actors

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,480
 who were around five foot six. She's five foot four, and she was sharing it with a colleague

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,120
 who was six foot two. Wait a minute. So this isn't a pantomime horse thing, where they're both in

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,760
 the costume at the same time, is it? One person's blobby's arms and the other one's blobby's legs.

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:42,000
 Blobby on all fours is even more chaotic, Mr. blobby. Blobby on all fours is a pantomime I do not

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,760
 want to see. Weirdly, I do. Imagine a pantomime blobby. Oh, God. So anyway, Ellie says, "We met

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,960
 Paul Denson, the current official Mr. blobby in a rehearsal room in Milton Keynes. There was a brand

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,960
 new blobby suit waiting for us. My six foot two colleague was the first to venture in. He was,

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,480
 of course, far too big for it. Blobby's legs don't go all the way up. They stop mid-thigh.

21
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,680
 And they're attached to braces. So his crotch and backside were very much visible.

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,160
 The producers simply sourced some pink leggings. Yeah, that makes sense. Blobby's school consists

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,720
 mostly of running around manically and screaming. He doesn't bend his knees nor does he look where

24
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,600
 he's going. Interestingly, blobby's vocals are all live. You are mic'd up inside and your voice

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 goes through a modulator. So actually, if you say, "Fucking hell, it's hot inside this costume," does

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,200
 it come out as blobby blobby blobby blobby blob? I think it does. Or do you have to say blobby blobby

27
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,880
 blobby blobby blob, I wonder? Ellie doesn't specify. She's just to tell you how the show went.

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,800
 The first performance went about as well as you'd expect. Not only was I bringing blobby

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,160
 carnage, I didn't know my exits, entrances, or even queues. Neither did the other actors or crew.

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,880
 That sounds like Panto, basically. It does sound like an incredible Panto.

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,520
 Is it because I've never seen blobby, except for the videos that I've now seen or chat about it,

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,640
 but it's a very dangerous character to be playing. You're bumping into things falling

33
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,560
 over, causing chaos. I can speak from experience. Well, you've got experience, that's what I was

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,720
 going to bring up. Yeah. So I was on QI as a giant chicken in a giant chicken costume,

35
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,400
 which, and I can empathize with the size of the costume, I wasn't supposed to do it because,

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,400
 you know, I'm a very evidence researcher on QI. I'm not a chicken costume guy. And it was supposed

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,600
 to be one of the runners, I think, was going to do it. But they got a costume. And weirdly,

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,720
 the runner was too tall for it. And as was everyone else on production, either too tall or too

39
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,480
 short, apart from me, who it perfectly fitted. So they made me do it. And I mean, it was fine.

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,400
 Goldy Cox. Because it's a chicken costume, cockerel. Yeah, lovely. Great. It's just right.

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,640
 Yeah, yeah, brilliant. But yeah, I think I can really empathize also with this person because

42
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,960
 you can't see where you're going. You really can't. And this was even in the costume that I had,

43
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,320
 which had eye holes. You really don't know where you are at any stage. And you're dancing around

44
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,720
 and you're trying to act, obviously, because you're trying to get your point across and you're

45
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,800
 in a giant costume. And I went right over on the set and really kind of laughed as well, right?

46
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,600
 Because the chaos of someone in a costume who hurts himself, there's no sympathy. It's just a

47
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,280
 is the problem that because chickens are prey animals, aren't they? They're not predators.

48
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,240
 Yeah. And a human, human's eyes are at the front of their face because we're predator animals. Whereas

49
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,120
 a prey animal's eyes are at the side of its head. I see what you're saying. So you want to have an

50
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,480
 accurate costume. Yeah. Doesn't imply that blobby is a predator.

51
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:42,720
 I think that is implied. Yeah. But anyway, when I was chicken, I got a massive cut on my leg,

52
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,080
 which I've still got a scar. I saw a photo the other day you put on Instagram, which in the

53
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,720
 green room afterwards, we were just I kind of was so I had a very sore leg. Well, I'm like, oh,

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,600
 yeah, whatever. And it was only when the blood was sloshing in my shoes. And I was walking and

55
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,400
 it was making like a sloshing sound. I was like, oh, there might be something there. And it was

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,080
 really bleeding right down into my shoes. Oh my God. Is there a time limit on suing

57
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:18,000
 productions? I think you're still in the grace period. Perfect. I've got a blobby fact that got

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,440
 sent in as a bit of correspondence that I wanted to mention. So ages ago, you remember, Andy, you

59
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,200
 and I went on a podcast of a friend of ours called Stevie Webb. And Stevie has a show called Brain

60
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,840
 Rot where he talks about B move horror movies. So you watch it and then you go on the pod with

61
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,560
 him and you talk about this movie. Yeah, really good. He wrote to me after listening to our episode

62
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,080
 about Mr. Blobby. And he just said that he is connected to the world of Blobby. And he's connected

63
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,680
 by the fact that we talked about one of the songs that Mr. Blobby did that was released as a single.

64
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,400
 He was one of the children who was part of the choir. So Stevie Webber Brain Rock podcast.

65
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,120
 He must be loaded because the of every Christmas that comes out. You can't walk around the

66
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,280
 department stores of London without hearing Mr. Blobby. Exactly. It's haunting him.

67
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,160
 That's really cool. He only did one single, I think, Mr. Blobby. So it will be that one.

68
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,000
 Mr. Blobby. Yeah. So that's the I think that's the blobby discourse very well dealt with. I did buy

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,320
 that single, by the way, the Mr. Blobby single. Oh, yeah. Tape or CD. It was on CD. On CD. Nice.

70
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,960
 My first single I bought was on tape. Was it? Yeah. I think for me too. Yeah. I was at about

71
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,720
 1997. That's late for tapes. I was Cheapskate. Oh, maybe I didn't have a CD player then.

72
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,760
 Don't remember. Right. Here we go. We always used to give you crap for not telling personal

73
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,240
 anecdotes. I see now why you've been. Shut it down. Oh, dear. Right. Here's a bonus thing. This is from

74
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,600
 Lawrence in Pontypryd. He says long time listen the first time blah, blah, blah. Not an auspicious

75
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:01,920
 start. A note on Rachel's, go Rachel Paris, mention of Peter Dowdwell eating sausages on John Evans'

76
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:09,600
 head. Okay, yes. So this was a gentleman who had lots of speed eating records and speed drinking

77
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,960
 records and Rachel listed all of them. And then the pièce de résistance was he had the world record

78
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,440
 for eating sausages on someone's head. And we weren't sure whether he was eating them off the

79
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,400
 head as in the head is shaped like a plate or whether he was sat on the head and eating them.

80
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,120
 Lawrence has chapter reverse for us. He says I was surprised. None of you know John Evans.

81
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,960
 As he's a pretty famous strongman slash head balancer. Oh, cool. And was a bit of a stalwart on

82
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,880
 TV in the late 90s or early 2000s. He was always balancing loads of milk crates or eggs or a mini

83
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,200
 on his head. I know who he is. Yeah. And on his website, which is www.headbalancer.com,

84
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,000
 there's even a photo of him balancing Peter Dowdwell sitting on a bed of nails while drinking a yard

85
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 of ale on his head. The problem is that John Evans is very common name, right? And so I didn't

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,600
 immediately associate him with this strongman. No. Are you now claiming you know who the strongman

87
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,120
 John Evans is? I know who John Evans is. Yeah, yeah, me too. I'm on his website. I'm on headbalancer.com

88
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,640
 now. Cool. Oh, you've got a car in his head. He's got a car in his head. I sold you a mini.

89
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,440
 That can't be a real mini on his head. I think it's a real mini. No. Yeah, they, I think they strip

90
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,680
 out everything for me. It's just the shell of the mini. Yeah. It's a chassis. Anyway,

91
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
 so thank you, Lawrence. We're all better informed about who John Evans is now. I love it. Thank

92
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,680
 you. There's an email which is going to make one of you two the happiest man alive. Okay.

93
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:42,400
 It's from me. I'm leaving. Just one of us. Amazing. Anyway, right. Tiffany Cheng. Hi,

94
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,000
 everyone. I was just listening to the latest Drop As A Line where Dan was getting a right

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,720
 old kick up the ass for a dumb joke about musicians. Thank you. Thank you. In one of the emails,

96
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,240
 the composer who wrote in said that he wishes musicians could fake their way through a piece

97
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,480
 of music. Now I'm a professional violinist and I have to say we fake it all the time.

98
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,440
 In my opinion, one of the core skills required in being able to make it as a professional

99
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,000
 is this. There is simply too much music or not enough time or rehearsals. Your skills of sight

100
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,680
 reading, following cues around you, like are you playing the right notes with everyone else,

101
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,960
 visually following your colleagues or the conductor to who you could be performing with

102
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,400
 for the first time are some of the skills required to fake their way through a performance.

103
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,600
 Pieces may be under rehearsed. There may be last minute additions. There have been many

104
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,520
 disasters where people have got lost or conductors are straight up conducting the wrong thing.

105
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,680
 Once I played a concert where one half of the orchestra was half a bar in front of, in front.

106
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,200
 And from our backstage debrief, no one knew what happened. They call that counterpoint. That's all

107
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,760
 that is. After a minute, we were able to come back together. It is at these moments of panic

108
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,000
 and disaster, a musician's ability to fake it and cover their mistakes are vital. The less the

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,920
 audience can tell, the more highly skilled musician. So I guess I felt just a little sorry for Dan,

110
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,760
 but I did get a good laugh at the outrage in Tiffany. That's great though. What a cool fact.

111
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,360
 Yeah. And thank you. Thank you, Tiffany. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that is. Does it make

112
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,880
 you the happiest man alive? The moron rises. Yeah, I am back baby. My confidence is back.

113
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,920
 Flags in Canada. You remember those? Oh, where you, they were up one day at a time and then

114
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,080
 you registered to be given it. Yeah, yeah. And the waiting list is 100 years plus.

115
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,120
 So Timothy Conlon writes, you've probably received the CML a thousand times already,

116
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,680
 just in case you haven't, we haven't. You can get a flag that's been flown over the US Capitol

117
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,880
 Building and the waiting time is six to eight weeks, not a hundred years. Why? Because they

118
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,800
 do a hundred thousand a year. And basically, as far as I can tell, they fly these flags for about

119
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,400
 30 seconds each. I thought he was going to say, you can get a flag from the Capitol Building if

120
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:47,200
 you turn up on January the 6th. Just grab one, it's fine. You can get laptops, you can get anything.

121
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,600
 And I look this up, your flag has run up the flagpole for 30 seconds. Why? And then it's

122
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,400
 to give to people who want a flag that's been over the Capitol and it comes with an authenticity

123
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,120
 certificate that you can personalize. But they don't sell it. They, I think they might sell

124
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,080
 them actually. So I looked up the program and it's for keepsakes and it might be for an anniversary,

125
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,760
 a death or another occasion. And so, yeah. So someone's job is just to put a flag up 30 seconds,

126
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,160
 bring it down, next flag up down. They can't have automated the procedure yet. Yeah. Yeah.

127
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,320
 Well, because you still have to treat the flag with respect. And if you're doing it in such an

128
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,640
 important landmark as well. But you could make a robot that treated the flag respectfully. Can you?

129
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,280
 You could program that in. Maybe. These days. Chat GPT it. Yeah. These days. Yeah. We talked

130
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:39,280
 about Brighton Quickie Divorces also in that episode with Monica. Zach Bulpit writes in. Excuse me?

131
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:47,760
 Zach Bulpit. Bulpit. Bulpit. B-U-L-P-I-T. Great name. Brilliant name actually. It's always good

132
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,880
 to hear a good name that you haven't heard before. Yeah. If Zach was a vicar, you could do Bulpit

133
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,960
 in the pulpit. His new podcast. Brilliant. Anyway, Brighton Quickie Divorce was definitely real.

134
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,000
 My grandmother divorced. Oh, sorry, Brighton Quickie Divorce where you get observed in pseudo

135
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,640
 adultery. You get a train down from London to Brighton. You go in a hotel. You stay in a room

136
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,160
 with a woman, probably who you've never met. Someone says. Like a cleaner sees you. Cleaner

137
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,840
 sees you. And then you get a train back up and you've got evidence that you were divorced, that

138
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,120
 you were cheating. Yeah. My grandmother divorced her first husband like this. So, Zach, by paying

139
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,400
 a hotel maid to catch her husband and a friend of theirs in bed together. And big quotation marks

140
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,360
 on catch because it's not really cool. Yeah. The whole thing was completely staged and everyone,

141
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,440
 including the maid, knew. Yeah. I got a tweet from someone called Peter Sutton Fitzgibbon.

142
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,880
 And he said that his mother and father, who were called Marjorie Steele and Dudley Sutton,

143
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,440
 they were quite well known actors back in the day. And they got divorced Brighton Quickie Style.

144
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,320
 Wow. Wow. That's incredible, isn't it? It's good to have some because we weren't 100%

145
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,880
 sure. Yeah. Sorry, you weren't 100% sure because you brought the facts, Andy. And you weren't,

146
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,080
 you knew it was in novels and stuff, but whether it actually happened. But yeah,

147
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,040
 it seems like it did. That's awesome. That's another thing we should say if you're listening to

148
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,440
 this and like we do accept corroboration. That's a nice thing, actually. That would be the best thing,

149
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,400
 isn't it? Yeah. Because we don't do that much. We don't, we sometimes say, if anyone out there

150
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,760
 is listening, can you say it? But it gets in the way of the chat. But yeah, if you hear something

151
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,600
 where we're unsure, please find out for us. Do you remember where we were talking about

152
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,560
 vaginal suppositories on the last drop us a line? Yeah, I do remember that. And then we were getting

153
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,440
 deeper into, I confused Vaseline and Valium. Oh, yes. And then someone said, no, but you can put

154
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,400
 Valium in a vaginal suppository. Sarah Warack writes, Hi, all. I'm happy to contribute to the

155
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,000
 drop us a line inception by sharing with you my favorite non-rectal suppository. I am a clinical

156
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,880
 pharmacist in Massachusetts. And during pharmacy school, I was horrified to learn that there is a

157
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:54,480
 treatment for erectile dysfunction that involves pushing a pellet of alprostadil down the urethra

158
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,560
 prior to sex, then rolling the penis to distribute the drug evenly. Rolling. With a rolling pin.

159
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,600
 Doesn't say what. You know that song by limp biscuit that goes rolling, rolling, rolling. He's

160
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,640
 actually talking about a PNL suppository. Wow. Is that still in play? The PNL suppository. I think

161
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,280
 so. And she sent through a link to the package, scroll down for the visual instructions to get

162
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:30,160
 the full scope of what's really happened. I just sent you a dick pic. No, it's a dick illustration.

163
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,280
 Oh, yeah, you just roll the penis between your hands for at least 10 seconds. Like you're rubbing

164
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,200
 sticks. If you feel a burning sensation, it may help to continue to roll the penis for an additional

165
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:44,000
 30 to 60 seconds or until the burning subsides. Wow. There we go. Thank you, Sarah. I was going

166
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,280
 to mention this on a show not too long ago, but there's a thing now for pre-ejaculation where

167
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:58,160
 I was premature. No, no, no, pre. Okay. No, so premature ejaculation. There's a thing that

168
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,800
 there's a new invention. There's an episode where we're going to be talking about inventions at some

169
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,760
 point, and it's something that you place in between the anus and the penis. The perineum.

170
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,960
 The perineum, as it's otherwise known. And then that kind of is connected to an app. So while

171
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,800
 you're having sex, if you feel like you're on the brink of ejaculating too soon, you can press

172
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,600
 this button that kind of then sends a message to this thing that you've placed. I see. And it

173
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,640
 kind of zaps you and or does a thing. Distracts you. Distracts you. Oh, yeah. Like, yeah. I don't

174
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,800
 know if it's out on the market yet, but yeah. Interesting. Does it work? Do we know if it

175
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,440
 works? I mean, it's invented and they showcased it at some kind of. Does it require you to have

176
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,480
 your phone out during copulation? Exactly. It's often frowned upon. I've frowned in the past when

177
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:57,760
 I'm desperately doing research for fish. I was in my research for that, which I never used,

178
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,960
 which I guess you guys might have seen. There's a really cool thing in New Zealand for people who

179
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,280
 want to be checked for testicular cancer, but they're embarrassed for whatever reason. And it's

180
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,960
 like a glory hole. And what you do is you turn up and it's in the doctor's eye. She was in a

181
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,280
 doctor's and you go behind the wall and then you put your testicles through a little hole and then

182
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:27,520
 the doctor can have a feel and check your testicles. Well, good lord. It does sound like a confession

183
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,720
 booth, but it is. That actually you need to go to another confession booth if you do that in the

184
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,880
 first confession booth. That's really bad. That's really bad. Yeah. Anyway, that is a nice invention,

185
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,120
 isn't it? I mean, anything that can make sure more people get checked. Yeah, absolutely. Definitely.

186
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,840
 Good. Again, it does feel like a pervert strata. All you need to do is disguise yourself as a

187
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,880
 doctor and get into the surgery. You only have to do like seven years of training to become a doctor.

188
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,400
 Yeah. It's a long game.

189
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,680
 We're actually going to a public toilet though, seeing a glory hole and putting it through and

190
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,400
 accidentally having a doctor on the other side who diagnoses you. Not a good day for the pervert.

191
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,840
 Sean King writes, yeah, in James's defense. Is that how it begins? Yeah. The expression,

192
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:19,600
 would you jump in my grave as quick? Oh, yeah. Does exist and is commonly used here in Ireland.

193
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 If, for instance, someone takes the seat you've been sitting in. Yeah, I haven't.

194
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,320
 I haven't heard anyone using Andy's expression for which your expression.

195
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,280
 Sorry. I haven't heard anyone using Andy's expression.

196
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,400
 The great thing is, this is your own expression. I think your pop's in over.

197
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,000
 Such a good expression. I wouldn't piss on your shoes if you were dead,

198
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,680
 but I intend to start. So thank you, Sean. Wow. So what was the phrase? It was would you jump

199
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,600
 in my grave as quickly? Yeah, right. And actually, I had spoken to quite a few people from up north,

200
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,360
 and I think it could possibly be a northern/Irish thing, as in, you know, get a lot of Irish

201
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,000
 expressions in the north of England. Years ago, I watched a sketch which was Dave Allen,

202
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,920
 the great comedian, Irish comedian. He used to do stand up and then he'd sort of go,

203
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,600
 I wonder what would happen? And then he would cut to a sketch that was pre-filled. Yeah, great.

204
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,520
 And he had a thing where he was saying within, what's Ireland predominantly, Christian?

205
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,320
 Or Catholic. South of Ireland is Catholic. Okay, right. So they would have a thing.

206
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,240
 Almost all Hindu. Very strange.

207
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,360
 But what they would have is such a vex question, you've just asked that. What's

208
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,920
 going on with them in Ireland? Oh, boy. Sorry. How long have you got?

209
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,160
 I was just, because I was thinking, what did Dave specifically say? I can't remember, but within

210
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,040
 one of the religions, there is a... This is going to be a three-hour drop as a line.

211
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,360
 You would have a thing where he said, if on the day where a burial was happening

212
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,120
 at a graveyard, only one of the people being buried that day would have sent to heaven

213
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,560
 as a result of... So his whole thing was, so what would then happen if two funeral processions

214
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,000
 were carrying a coffin and spotted each other on the way? And then it cuts to a sketch where

215
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,440
 they're chasing and racing to get there and so on. And I wonder if that slightly,

216
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,720
 would you jump in my grave as in, would you ascend to heaven ahead of me?

217
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,520
 I see, I see. He sees. Andy does not see, just want to let the listener know.

218
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,840
 I'm closing my eyes to it. Yeah. Do you remember we talked about Mr Pringles?

219
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,160
 Yeah. Sorry, the inventor of the Pringles, who was very...

220
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,000
 Sarah. Okay, with Sarah Pascoe, exactly. This is a thing, it's from Tom Holderness.

221
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,760
 Dear James Andrew Dan/The Late Great Anna, still alive.

222
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,200
 Just listen to your episode with Sarah Pascoe where she shared the brilliant fact that the

223
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,480
 inventor of the Pringle was buried in a Pringles can. It reminded me of a similar morbid fact,

224
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:05,600
 this is amazing. The stovetop mocha pot coffee maker, Renato Bialetti, 1923 to 2016,

225
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,920
 was buried in a giant version of his creation as well. Stunning. It was used in place of an urn

226
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,920
 at the funeral. It was invented by his father Alfonso, but he ensured the brand's ubiquity as

227
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,520
 the design was so simple and successful that many tried to copy it. Now, I'm just, I have

228
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,080
 got an image for you here. I think I know what you're saying.

229
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,840
 Of a pre, is the mocha, is that silver pot with two halves of it? Yeah.

230
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,440
 Yeah. There's an image from the funeral. That's the funeral.

231
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,320
 Him being buried in like his ashes in a mocha. It's like a silver teapot,

232
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,160
 but it's almost like an octagonal shape and then below it, it's got another octagonal cylinder.

233
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,440
 So imagine that, basically. That is so good. It's M-O-K-A, if you want to look it up. It's

234
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,560
 unbelievable. That's great. Perfect. Any more of those, if anyone has them. Oh, God, yeah.

235
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,600
 We'd love those. Tom ends just to round off his email. He gives us some more context.

236
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,760
 Attached below are some photos from Renato's funeral. It isn't known if the ashes were put

237
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,760
 where the ground coffee would normally go. It's a little bonus fact. Other people buried

238
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,520
 in their own inventions include several Egyptian pharaohs and the inventor of the coffin.

239
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,520
 I think Tom could come on the show. Absolutely. Tom Holdeness. Tom on the show. Oh, my God.

240
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:28,240
 Just a couple more. There's an email from Bob Harris, who is the radio.

241
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,200
 Quite a famous quizzer. He's been on Jeopardy! 14 times. He wrote us an amazing email. He wrote

242
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,280
 us an amazing email. He's written a book called Prisoner of Trebekistan, because he was on

243
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,080
 Jeopardy! so many times. He's done loads and loads of things. He's an incredible guy. And

244
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,360
 Trebek is the guy who hosted it. Exactly, yeah, who hosted it. Jeopardy! So anyway,

245
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,480
 Bob is a lovely man. He sent us a lovely email. He writes, "Urgent info,

246
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,880
 read my personal relationship with President Garfield's Anus." Call back to episode one.

247
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,520
 This simply cannot wait, Bob says. I grew up and my mum still lives in Mentor, Ohio,

248
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,040
 walking distance from Garfield's family estate, where, as I'm sure you know, for the

249
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,800
 housing years of 1876 to '81, both Garfield and his Anus resided so happily that they rarely left.

250
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 It would be a strange world where his Anus just popped out for some milk and he stayed at home.

251
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,880
 Wandering Anus of present Garfield. Popped out for some squirrel soup.

252
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,200
 Until their inauguration as president. Fast forward to October 1969,

253
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,520
 more than 88 years after Garfield's last meal, and less than 88 years since his Anuses.

254
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,280
 Six-year-old me was on an elementary school tour of Lawnfield, that's the estate,

255
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,880
 a decade before the place was considered such a landmark. Security was lax,

256
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,240
 so naturally I stole the opportunity to sit on several pieces of furniture,

257
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,840
 all of which were claimed to have been original and all of which remain in the collection.

258
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,080
 Thus, there still exist multiple squares of fabric that have passed mere millimeters from

259
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,760
 Garfield's cul-de-sac and my own. I assume you are suitably impressed? I may have to add this to

260
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,760
 my LinkedIn. I'm properly impressed, yeah. There we go. Thank you, Bob. I love that.

261
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,360
 Cul-de-sac means bottom of the bag. He could have just said, "Cole,

262
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,080
 didn't have to add those extra two bits." Yeah, Bob. Uh-oh. Beef alert.

263
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,920
 Well, all right, Bob, we're asking you out for a fight, apparently. Thanks for your email.

264
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,840
 I'll take beating the shit out of Bob for $1,000, please, Alex.

265
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,000
 One last email from Andrew Ferguson in Australia. Good name, mate.

266
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,520
 He wrote a while ago saying, "Happy New Year." We've actually heard from Andrew once before,

267
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,600
 but he wrote a second time. He said, "A quick message for Andy. I got somewhat bored

268
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,120
 over the holiday break and so started to think about what you might look like as a muppet."

269
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,400
 Without knowing what you look like? Or what just goes on. Now, I mean this in the kindest

270
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,320
 possible way. You're really rather average and unremarkable looking,

271
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:58,000
 which made it kind of hard to muppetize you. Have we said this before on this show? I feel

272
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,120
 like we must have done, but there is a bit of a meme when we get fan art that Anna looks like

273
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,880
 a woman. I look like someone with crazy hair. Dan looks like someone with glasses and a beard

274
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,120
 or whatever. And Andy is usually just a stick man. Just a stick man, yeah. Well, Andrew agrees with

275
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,760
 all of you. Says it makes it very hard to muppetize you. If you had a large nose or glasses or an

276
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,400
 eye patch, then that'd be better, but nonetheless. Have you considered going eye patch? Oh, yeah.

277
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,840
 Because I've got the glasses and big nose covered. Yeah. Well, if I lose an eye at any point,

278
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,840
 I'll be thrilled that the fan art quality will really go up. So anyway, but Andrew has been

279
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,000
 in touch and he actually got in touch. And this box arrived in the office recently.

280
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,640
 He's made it. Let's have a look. This is a huge, huge box. Oh, wow. Oh my God.

281
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,200
 Is a completely average looking muppet. I honestly, what has happened here is he's just

282
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,360
 got a spare muppet of an average man and he's looked around at the internet going,

283
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,040
 "Who is the most average person I can find?" And as what I've said, you've got to get this out

284
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,120
 of the house. It's got to go. Is there anyone? Did they not do one for us? You got your own.

285
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,680
 This is incredible. And he's included some rods. Put your hand in and do some talking.

286
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:30,080
 You don't have to make up a voice. Hi. This is the worst audio thing.

287
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,080
 The thing is, I nearly put his mouth on the microphone. I was so convinced. He does look like

288
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:43,200
 you. He does. I think that's really handy. Yeah. Even like that, you know, Andy has generic photo

289
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,960
 face, that one photo. Here's another thing about Andy. Look at any photo of him and it could be

290
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,280
 the same photo. Andy does the eyebrow lift in his photo. Oh my God. Your muppet has it.

291
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,480
 Your puppet has it. Yeah. So thank you so much, Andrew. We'll put up a photo. Yeah.

292
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,320
 That's really cool. That's really cool. It is amazing. The only thing that would have made

293
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,520
 it more perfect if it was wearing a 20 year old black keys t-shirt, that would be the only thing

294
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,880
 to really stamp it as you. Yeah. Bye. That was him saying it, not me.

295
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:22,400
 I want it to keep going. Maybe muppet Andy, you can do the email address and all that kind of

296
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,200
 stuff. Oh yeah. Good idea. All right. So thank you so much everyone for listening. If you want to

297
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:36,640
 get it. Don't do a silly voice. Do you? Okay, everybody. That is it for this episode of Drop
