00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 is anyone else cold? No, I'm okay. I am wearing a jumper. Oh, yeah. I'm wearing two jumpers.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.760
 No fucking way. I'm naked. No, I'm cold. Thanks for giving me a jumper, James.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.160
 Hi. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Drop Us Align, the clubfish bonus lounge where we talk about all the

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.760
 facts you've sent in or the corrections you've sent in, and we're going to be getting some of those

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.080
 out of the inbox. Yeah. I'm reading through them, putting them back in the inbox. It's going to

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.160
 be great. Putting them back in the inbox. Yeah. Okay, let's get cracking. Here is a message from

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.880
 Ellie. Ellie says, "I hope you're well. I really enjoyed listening to the blobby chat." This was

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.200
 the Rachel was on. Yeah. She says, "Even more so, because I can exclusively share what blobby school

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.000
 is really like." Ah, blobby school being where, when it was turned into a theme park? No training

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.840
 academy for being blobby. Yeah, but they needed blobby's for these theme parks. You're right.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.200
 I got to experience the absolute horror of being Mr. blobby in real life during an ill-fated

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.160
 short-lived Panto run recently. So basically, there was one blobby costume designed for actors

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.480
 who were around five foot six. She's five foot four, and she was sharing it with a colleague

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.120
 who was six foot two. Wait a minute. So this isn't a pantomime horse thing, where they're both in

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.760
 the costume at the same time, is it? One person's blobby's arms and the other one's blobby's legs.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:42.000
 Blobby on all fours is even more chaotic, Mr. blobby. Blobby on all fours is a pantomime I do not

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.760
 want to see. Weirdly, I do. Imagine a pantomime blobby. Oh, God. So anyway, Ellie says, "We met

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.960
 Paul Denson, the current official Mr. blobby in a rehearsal room in Milton Keynes. There was a brand

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 new blobby suit waiting for us. My six foot two colleague was the first to venture in. He was,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.480
 of course, far too big for it. Blobby's legs don't go all the way up. They stop mid-thigh.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.680
 And they're attached to braces. So his crotch and backside were very much visible.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.160
 The producers simply sourced some pink leggings. Yeah, that makes sense. Blobby's school consists

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.720
 mostly of running around manically and screaming. He doesn't bend his knees nor does he look where

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.600
 he's going. Interestingly, blobby's vocals are all live. You are mic'd up inside and your voice

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 goes through a modulator. So actually, if you say, "Fucking hell, it's hot inside this costume," does

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.200
 it come out as blobby blobby blobby blobby blob? I think it does. Or do you have to say blobby blobby

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.880
 blobby blobby blob, I wonder? Ellie doesn't specify. She's just to tell you how the show went.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.800
 The first performance went about as well as you'd expect. Not only was I bringing blobby

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.160
 carnage, I didn't know my exits, entrances, or even queues. Neither did the other actors or crew.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.880
 That sounds like Panto, basically. It does sound like an incredible Panto.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.520
 Is it because I've never seen blobby, except for the videos that I've now seen or chat about it,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.640
 but it's a very dangerous character to be playing. You're bumping into things falling

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.560
 over, causing chaos. I can speak from experience. Well, you've got experience, that's what I was

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.720
 going to bring up. Yeah. So I was on QI as a giant chicken in a giant chicken costume,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.400
 which, and I can empathize with the size of the costume, I wasn't supposed to do it because,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.400
 you know, I'm a very evidence researcher on QI. I'm not a chicken costume guy. And it was supposed

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.600
 to be one of the runners, I think, was going to do it. But they got a costume. And weirdly,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.720
 the runner was too tall for it. And as was everyone else on production, either too tall or too

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.480
 short, apart from me, who it perfectly fitted. So they made me do it. And I mean, it was fine.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.400
 Goldy Cox. Because it's a chicken costume, cockerel. Yeah, lovely. Great. It's just right.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.640
 Yeah, yeah, brilliant. But yeah, I think I can really empathize also with this person because

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.960
 you can't see where you're going. You really can't. And this was even in the costume that I had,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.320
 which had eye holes. You really don't know where you are at any stage. And you're dancing around

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.720
 and you're trying to act, obviously, because you're trying to get your point across and you're

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.800
 in a giant costume. And I went right over on the set and really kind of laughed as well, right?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.600
 Because the chaos of someone in a costume who hurts himself, there's no sympathy. It's just a

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.280
 is the problem that because chickens are prey animals, aren't they? They're not predators.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.240
 Yeah. And a human, human's eyes are at the front of their face because we're predator animals. Whereas

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.120
 a prey animal's eyes are at the side of its head. I see what you're saying. So you want to have an

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.480
 accurate costume. Yeah. Doesn't imply that blobby is a predator.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:42.720
 I think that is implied. Yeah. But anyway, when I was chicken, I got a massive cut on my leg,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.080
 which I've still got a scar. I saw a photo the other day you put on Instagram, which in the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.720
 green room afterwards, we were just I kind of was so I had a very sore leg. Well, I'm like, oh,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.600
 yeah, whatever. And it was only when the blood was sloshing in my shoes. And I was walking and

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.400
 it was making like a sloshing sound. I was like, oh, there might be something there. And it was

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.080
 really bleeding right down into my shoes. Oh my God. Is there a time limit on suing

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:18.000
 productions? I think you're still in the grace period. Perfect. I've got a blobby fact that got

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.440
 sent in as a bit of correspondence that I wanted to mention. So ages ago, you remember, Andy, you

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.200
 and I went on a podcast of a friend of ours called Stevie Webb. And Stevie has a show called Brain

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.840
 Rot where he talks about B move horror movies. So you watch it and then you go on the pod with

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.560
 him and you talk about this movie. Yeah, really good. He wrote to me after listening to our episode

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.080
 about Mr. Blobby. And he just said that he is connected to the world of Blobby. And he's connected

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.680
 by the fact that we talked about one of the songs that Mr. Blobby did that was released as a single.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.400
 He was one of the children who was part of the choir. So Stevie Webber Brain Rock podcast.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.120
 He must be loaded because the of every Christmas that comes out. You can't walk around the

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.280
 department stores of London without hearing Mr. Blobby. Exactly. It's haunting him.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.160
 That's really cool. He only did one single, I think, Mr. Blobby. So it will be that one.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.000
 Mr. Blobby. Yeah. So that's the I think that's the blobby discourse very well dealt with. I did buy

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.320
 that single, by the way, the Mr. Blobby single. Oh, yeah. Tape or CD. It was on CD. On CD. Nice.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.960
 My first single I bought was on tape. Was it? Yeah. I think for me too. Yeah. I was at about

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.720
 1997. That's late for tapes. I was Cheapskate. Oh, maybe I didn't have a CD player then.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.760
 Don't remember. Right. Here we go. We always used to give you crap for not telling personal

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.240
 anecdotes. I see now why you've been. Shut it down. Oh, dear. Right. Here's a bonus thing. This is from

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.600
 Lawrence in Pontypryd. He says long time listen the first time blah, blah, blah. Not an auspicious

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.920
 start. A note on Rachel's, go Rachel Paris, mention of Peter Dowdwell eating sausages on John Evans'

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:09.600
 head. Okay, yes. So this was a gentleman who had lots of speed eating records and speed drinking

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.960
 records and Rachel listed all of them. And then the pièce de résistance was he had the world record

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.440
 for eating sausages on someone's head. And we weren't sure whether he was eating them off the

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.400
 head as in the head is shaped like a plate or whether he was sat on the head and eating them.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.120
 Lawrence has chapter reverse for us. He says I was surprised. None of you know John Evans.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.960
 As he's a pretty famous strongman slash head balancer. Oh, cool. And was a bit of a stalwart on

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.880
 TV in the late 90s or early 2000s. He was always balancing loads of milk crates or eggs or a mini

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:47.200
 on his head. I know who he is. Yeah. And on his website, which is www.headbalancer.com,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.000
 there's even a photo of him balancing Peter Dowdwell sitting on a bed of nails while drinking a yard

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 of ale on his head. The problem is that John Evans is very common name, right? And so I didn't

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.600
 immediately associate him with this strongman. No. Are you now claiming you know who the strongman

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.120
 John Evans is? I know who John Evans is. Yeah, yeah, me too. I'm on his website. I'm on headbalancer.com

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.640
 now. Cool. Oh, you've got a car in his head. He's got a car in his head. I sold you a mini.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.440
 That can't be a real mini on his head. I think it's a real mini. No. Yeah, they, I think they strip

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.680
 out everything for me. It's just the shell of the mini. Yeah. It's a chassis. Anyway,

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.840
 so thank you, Lawrence. We're all better informed about who John Evans is now. I love it. Thank

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.680
 you. There's an email which is going to make one of you two the happiest man alive. Okay.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:42.400
 It's from me. I'm leaving. Just one of us. Amazing. Anyway, right. Tiffany Cheng. Hi,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.000
 everyone. I was just listening to the latest Drop As A Line where Dan was getting a right

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.720
 old kick up the ass for a dumb joke about musicians. Thank you. Thank you. In one of the emails,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.240
 the composer who wrote in said that he wishes musicians could fake their way through a piece

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.480
 of music. Now I'm a professional violinist and I have to say we fake it all the time.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:05.440
 In my opinion, one of the core skills required in being able to make it as a professional

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.000
 is this. There is simply too much music or not enough time or rehearsals. Your skills of sight

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.680
 reading, following cues around you, like are you playing the right notes with everyone else,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.960
 visually following your colleagues or the conductor to who you could be performing with

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.400
 for the first time are some of the skills required to fake their way through a performance.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.600
 Pieces may be under rehearsed. There may be last minute additions. There have been many

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.520
 disasters where people have got lost or conductors are straight up conducting the wrong thing.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:33.680
 Once I played a concert where one half of the orchestra was half a bar in front of, in front.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.200
 And from our backstage debrief, no one knew what happened. They call that counterpoint. That's all

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.760
 that is. After a minute, we were able to come back together. It is at these moments of panic

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.000
 and disaster, a musician's ability to fake it and cover their mistakes are vital. The less the

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.920
 audience can tell, the more highly skilled musician. So I guess I felt just a little sorry for Dan,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.760
 but I did get a good laugh at the outrage in Tiffany. That's great though. What a cool fact.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.360
 Yeah. And thank you. Thank you, Tiffany. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that is. Does it make

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.880
 you the happiest man alive? The moron rises. Yeah, I am back baby. My confidence is back.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.920
 Flags in Canada. You remember those? Oh, where you, they were up one day at a time and then

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.080
 you registered to be given it. Yeah, yeah. And the waiting list is 100 years plus.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.120
 So Timothy Conlon writes, you've probably received the CML a thousand times already,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.680
 just in case you haven't, we haven't. You can get a flag that's been flown over the US Capitol

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.880
 Building and the waiting time is six to eight weeks, not a hundred years. Why? Because they

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.800
 do a hundred thousand a year. And basically, as far as I can tell, they fly these flags for about

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.400
 30 seconds each. I thought he was going to say, you can get a flag from the Capitol Building if

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:47.200
 you turn up on January the 6th. Just grab one, it's fine. You can get laptops, you can get anything.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:53.600
 And I look this up, your flag has run up the flagpole for 30 seconds. Why? And then it's

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.400
 to give to people who want a flag that's been over the Capitol and it comes with an authenticity

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.120
 certificate that you can personalize. But they don't sell it. They, I think they might sell

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.080
 them actually. So I looked up the program and it's for keepsakes and it might be for an anniversary,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.760
 a death or another occasion. And so, yeah. So someone's job is just to put a flag up 30 seconds,

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.160
 bring it down, next flag up down. They can't have automated the procedure yet. Yeah. Yeah.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.320
 Well, because you still have to treat the flag with respect. And if you're doing it in such an

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.640
 important landmark as well. But you could make a robot that treated the flag respectfully. Can you?

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:33.280
 You could program that in. Maybe. These days. Chat GPT it. Yeah. These days. Yeah. We talked

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:39.280
 about Brighton Quickie Divorces also in that episode with Monica. Zach Bulpit writes in. Excuse me?

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:47.760
 Zach Bulpit. Bulpit. Bulpit. B-U-L-P-I-T. Great name. Brilliant name actually. It's always good

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.880
 to hear a good name that you haven't heard before. Yeah. If Zach was a vicar, you could do Bulpit

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.960
 in the pulpit. His new podcast. Brilliant. Anyway, Brighton Quickie Divorce was definitely real.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.000
 My grandmother divorced. Oh, sorry, Brighton Quickie Divorce where you get observed in pseudo

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.640
 adultery. You get a train down from London to Brighton. You go in a hotel. You stay in a room

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:14.160
 with a woman, probably who you've never met. Someone says. Like a cleaner sees you. Cleaner

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.840
 sees you. And then you get a train back up and you've got evidence that you were divorced, that

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:23.120
 you were cheating. Yeah. My grandmother divorced her first husband like this. So, Zach, by paying

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.400
 a hotel maid to catch her husband and a friend of theirs in bed together. And big quotation marks

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.360
 on catch because it's not really cool. Yeah. The whole thing was completely staged and everyone,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.440
 including the maid, knew. Yeah. I got a tweet from someone called Peter Sutton Fitzgibbon.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.880
 And he said that his mother and father, who were called Marjorie Steele and Dudley Sutton,

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.440
 they were quite well known actors back in the day. And they got divorced Brighton Quickie Style.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.320
 Wow. Wow. That's incredible, isn't it? It's good to have some because we weren't 100%

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.880
 sure. Yeah. Sorry, you weren't 100% sure because you brought the facts, Andy. And you weren't,

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.080
 you knew it was in novels and stuff, but whether it actually happened. But yeah,

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.040
 it seems like it did. That's awesome. That's another thing we should say if you're listening to

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.440
 this and like we do accept corroboration. That's a nice thing, actually. That would be the best thing,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.400
 isn't it? Yeah. Because we don't do that much. We don't, we sometimes say, if anyone out there

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.760
 is listening, can you say it? But it gets in the way of the chat. But yeah, if you hear something

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.600
 where we're unsure, please find out for us. Do you remember where we were talking about

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.560
 vaginal suppositories on the last drop us a line? Yeah, I do remember that. And then we were getting

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.440
 deeper into, I confused Vaseline and Valium. Oh, yes. And then someone said, no, but you can put

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:36.400
 Valium in a vaginal suppository. Sarah Warack writes, Hi, all. I'm happy to contribute to the

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:42.000
 drop us a line inception by sharing with you my favorite non-rectal suppository. I am a clinical

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.880
 pharmacist in Massachusetts. And during pharmacy school, I was horrified to learn that there is a

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:54.480
 treatment for erectile dysfunction that involves pushing a pellet of alprostadil down the urethra

00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:02.560
 prior to sex, then rolling the penis to distribute the drug evenly. Rolling. With a rolling pin.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:09.600
 Doesn't say what. You know that song by limp biscuit that goes rolling, rolling, rolling. He's

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:16.640
 actually talking about a PNL suppository. Wow. Is that still in play? The PNL suppository. I think

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:23.280
 so. And she sent through a link to the package, scroll down for the visual instructions to get

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:30.160
 the full scope of what's really happened. I just sent you a dick pic. No, it's a dick illustration.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.280
 Oh, yeah, you just roll the penis between your hands for at least 10 seconds. Like you're rubbing

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.200
 sticks. If you feel a burning sensation, it may help to continue to roll the penis for an additional

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:44.000
 30 to 60 seconds or until the burning subsides. Wow. There we go. Thank you, Sarah. I was going

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.280
 to mention this on a show not too long ago, but there's a thing now for pre-ejaculation where

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:58.160
 I was premature. No, no, no, pre. Okay. No, so premature ejaculation. There's a thing that

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.800
 there's a new invention. There's an episode where we're going to be talking about inventions at some

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:09.760
 point, and it's something that you place in between the anus and the penis. The perineum.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.960
 The perineum, as it's otherwise known. And then that kind of is connected to an app. So while

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.800
 you're having sex, if you feel like you're on the brink of ejaculating too soon, you can press

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.600
 this button that kind of then sends a message to this thing that you've placed. I see. And it

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:32.640
 kind of zaps you and or does a thing. Distracts you. Distracts you. Oh, yeah. Like, yeah. I don't

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:38.800
 know if it's out on the market yet, but yeah. Interesting. Does it work? Do we know if it

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.440
 works? I mean, it's invented and they showcased it at some kind of. Does it require you to have

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.480
 your phone out during copulation? Exactly. It's often frowned upon. I've frowned in the past when

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:57.760
 I'm desperately doing research for fish. I was in my research for that, which I never used,

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.960
 which I guess you guys might have seen. There's a really cool thing in New Zealand for people who

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:09.280
 want to be checked for testicular cancer, but they're embarrassed for whatever reason. And it's

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.960
 like a glory hole. And what you do is you turn up and it's in the doctor's eye. She was in a

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:21.280
 doctor's and you go behind the wall and then you put your testicles through a little hole and then

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:27.520
 the doctor can have a feel and check your testicles. Well, good lord. It does sound like a confession

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:32.720
 booth, but it is. That actually you need to go to another confession booth if you do that in the

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:38.880
 first confession booth. That's really bad. That's really bad. Yeah. Anyway, that is a nice invention,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.120
 isn't it? I mean, anything that can make sure more people get checked. Yeah, absolutely. Definitely.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.840
 Good. Again, it does feel like a pervert strata. All you need to do is disguise yourself as a

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.880
 doctor and get into the surgery. You only have to do like seven years of training to become a doctor.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.400
 Yeah. It's a long game.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:01.680
 We're actually going to a public toilet though, seeing a glory hole and putting it through and

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.400
 accidentally having a doctor on the other side who diagnoses you. Not a good day for the pervert.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:13.840
 Sean King writes, yeah, in James's defense. Is that how it begins? Yeah. The expression,

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:19.600
 would you jump in my grave as quick? Oh, yeah. Does exist and is commonly used here in Ireland.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.600
 If, for instance, someone takes the seat you've been sitting in. Yeah, I haven't.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:30.320
 I haven't heard anyone using Andy's expression for which your expression.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.280
 Sorry. I haven't heard anyone using Andy's expression.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.400
 The great thing is, this is your own expression. I think your pop's in over.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.000
 Such a good expression. I wouldn't piss on your shoes if you were dead,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:57.680
 but I intend to start. So thank you, Sean. Wow. So what was the phrase? It was would you jump

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:03.600
 in my grave as quickly? Yeah, right. And actually, I had spoken to quite a few people from up north,

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:09.360
 and I think it could possibly be a northern/Irish thing, as in, you know, get a lot of Irish

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.000
 expressions in the north of England. Years ago, I watched a sketch which was Dave Allen,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.920
 the great comedian, Irish comedian. He used to do stand up and then he'd sort of go,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.600
 I wonder what would happen? And then he would cut to a sketch that was pre-filled. Yeah, great.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:27.520
 And he had a thing where he was saying within, what's Ireland predominantly, Christian?

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.320
 Or Catholic. South of Ireland is Catholic. Okay, right. So they would have a thing.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.240
 Almost all Hindu. Very strange.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:41.360
 But what they would have is such a vex question, you've just asked that. What's

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.920
 going on with them in Ireland? Oh, boy. Sorry. How long have you got?

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.160
 I was just, because I was thinking, what did Dave specifically say? I can't remember, but within

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.040
 one of the religions, there is a... This is going to be a three-hour drop as a line.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:01.360
 You would have a thing where he said, if on the day where a burial was happening

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:07.120
 at a graveyard, only one of the people being buried that day would have sent to heaven

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.560
 as a result of... So his whole thing was, so what would then happen if two funeral processions

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.000
 were carrying a coffin and spotted each other on the way? And then it cuts to a sketch where

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.440
 they're chasing and racing to get there and so on. And I wonder if that slightly,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.720
 would you jump in my grave as in, would you ascend to heaven ahead of me?

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.520
 I see, I see. He sees. Andy does not see, just want to let the listener know.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:33.840
 I'm closing my eyes to it. Yeah. Do you remember we talked about Mr Pringles?

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.160
 Yeah. Sorry, the inventor of the Pringles, who was very...

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.000
 Sarah. Okay, with Sarah Pascoe, exactly. This is a thing, it's from Tom Holderness.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.760
 Dear James Andrew Dan/The Late Great Anna, still alive.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:51.200
 Just listen to your episode with Sarah Pascoe where she shared the brilliant fact that the

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.480
 inventor of the Pringle was buried in a Pringles can. It reminded me of a similar morbid fact,

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:05.600
 this is amazing. The stovetop mocha pot coffee maker, Renato Bialetti, 1923 to 2016,

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:11.920
 was buried in a giant version of his creation as well. Stunning. It was used in place of an urn

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.920
 at the funeral. It was invented by his father Alfonso, but he ensured the brand's ubiquity as

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.520
 the design was so simple and successful that many tried to copy it. Now, I'm just, I have

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.080
 got an image for you here. I think I know what you're saying.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.840
 Of a pre, is the mocha, is that silver pot with two halves of it? Yeah.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.440
 Yeah. There's an image from the funeral. That's the funeral.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:36.320
 Him being buried in like his ashes in a mocha. It's like a silver teapot,

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:42.160
 but it's almost like an octagonal shape and then below it, it's got another octagonal cylinder.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.440
 So imagine that, basically. That is so good. It's M-O-K-A, if you want to look it up. It's

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.560
 unbelievable. That's great. Perfect. Any more of those, if anyone has them. Oh, God, yeah.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.600
 We'd love those. Tom ends just to round off his email. He gives us some more context.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.760
 Attached below are some photos from Renato's funeral. It isn't known if the ashes were put

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:07.760
 where the ground coffee would normally go. It's a little bonus fact. Other people buried

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.520
 in their own inventions include several Egyptian pharaohs and the inventor of the coffin.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:21.520
 I think Tom could come on the show. Absolutely. Tom Holdeness. Tom on the show. Oh, my God.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:28.240
 Just a couple more. There's an email from Bob Harris, who is the radio.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.200
 Quite a famous quizzer. He's been on Jeopardy! 14 times. He wrote us an amazing email. He wrote

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.280
 us an amazing email. He's written a book called Prisoner of Trebekistan, because he was on

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.080
 Jeopardy! so many times. He's done loads and loads of things. He's an incredible guy. And

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:45.360
 Trebek is the guy who hosted it. Exactly, yeah, who hosted it. Jeopardy! So anyway,

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.480
 Bob is a lovely man. He sent us a lovely email. He writes, "Urgent info,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.880
 read my personal relationship with President Garfield's Anus." Call back to episode one.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:59.520
 This simply cannot wait, Bob says. I grew up and my mum still lives in Mentor, Ohio,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.040
 walking distance from Garfield's family estate, where, as I'm sure you know, for the

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:08.800
 housing years of 1876 to '81, both Garfield and his Anus resided so happily that they rarely left.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.800
 It would be a strange world where his Anus just popped out for some milk and he stayed at home.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.880
 Wandering Anus of present Garfield. Popped out for some squirrel soup.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:23.200
 Until their inauguration as president. Fast forward to October 1969,

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.520
 more than 88 years after Garfield's last meal, and less than 88 years since his Anuses.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.280
 Six-year-old me was on an elementary school tour of Lawnfield, that's the estate,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.880
 a decade before the place was considered such a landmark. Security was lax,

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.240
 so naturally I stole the opportunity to sit on several pieces of furniture,

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.840
 all of which were claimed to have been original and all of which remain in the collection.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.080
 Thus, there still exist multiple squares of fabric that have passed mere millimeters from

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.760
 Garfield's cul-de-sac and my own. I assume you are suitably impressed? I may have to add this to

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.760
 my LinkedIn. I'm properly impressed, yeah. There we go. Thank you, Bob. I love that.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.360
 Cul-de-sac means bottom of the bag. He could have just said, "Cole,

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:08.080
 didn't have to add those extra two bits." Yeah, Bob. Uh-oh. Beef alert.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.920
 Well, all right, Bob, we're asking you out for a fight, apparently. Thanks for your email.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:19.840
 I'll take beating the shit out of Bob for $1,000, please, Alex.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:26.000
 One last email from Andrew Ferguson in Australia. Good name, mate.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.520
 He wrote a while ago saying, "Happy New Year." We've actually heard from Andrew once before,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.600
 but he wrote a second time. He said, "A quick message for Andy. I got somewhat bored

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.120
 over the holiday break and so started to think about what you might look like as a muppet."

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:46.400
 Without knowing what you look like? Or what just goes on. Now, I mean this in the kindest

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.320
 possible way. You're really rather average and unremarkable looking,

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:58.000
 which made it kind of hard to muppetize you. Have we said this before on this show? I feel

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.120
 like we must have done, but there is a bit of a meme when we get fan art that Anna looks like

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:10.880
 a woman. I look like someone with crazy hair. Dan looks like someone with glasses and a beard

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:17.120
 or whatever. And Andy is usually just a stick man. Just a stick man, yeah. Well, Andrew agrees with

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.760
 all of you. Says it makes it very hard to muppetize you. If you had a large nose or glasses or an

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:28.400
 eye patch, then that'd be better, but nonetheless. Have you considered going eye patch? Oh, yeah.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:35.840
 Because I've got the glasses and big nose covered. Yeah. Well, if I lose an eye at any point,

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.840
 I'll be thrilled that the fan art quality will really go up. So anyway, but Andrew has been

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.000
 in touch and he actually got in touch. And this box arrived in the office recently.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:56.640
 He's made it. Let's have a look. This is a huge, huge box. Oh, wow. Oh my God.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:03.200
 Is a completely average looking muppet. I honestly, what has happened here is he's just

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.360
 got a spare muppet of an average man and he's looked around at the internet going,

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.040
 "Who is the most average person I can find?" And as what I've said, you've got to get this out

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:17.120
 of the house. It's got to go. Is there anyone? Did they not do one for us? You got your own.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.680
 This is incredible. And he's included some rods. Put your hand in and do some talking.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:30.080
 You don't have to make up a voice. Hi. This is the worst audio thing.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:36.080
 The thing is, I nearly put his mouth on the microphone. I was so convinced. He does look like

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:43.200
 you. He does. I think that's really handy. Yeah. Even like that, you know, Andy has generic photo

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.960
 face, that one photo. Here's another thing about Andy. Look at any photo of him and it could be

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:53.280
 the same photo. Andy does the eyebrow lift in his photo. Oh my God. Your muppet has it.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:58.480
 Your puppet has it. Yeah. So thank you so much, Andrew. We'll put up a photo. Yeah.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.320
 That's really cool. That's really cool. It is amazing. The only thing that would have made

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.520
 it more perfect if it was wearing a 20 year old black keys t-shirt, that would be the only thing

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:12.880
 to really stamp it as you. Yeah. Bye. That was him saying it, not me.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:22.400
 I want it to keep going. Maybe muppet Andy, you can do the email address and all that kind of

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.200
 stuff. Oh yeah. Good idea. All right. So thank you so much everyone for listening. If you want to

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:36.640
 get it. Don't do a silly voice. Do you? Okay, everybody. That is it for this episode of Drop
