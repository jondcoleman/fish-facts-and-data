 Hi everyone, before we begin this week's episode of Fish, we just want to let you know that
 we have a very special guest on today. It is the mighty host of QI herself, Sandy Toxfig,
 finally to have the Supreme Boss come and fight us with facts was a wonderful honor.
 Also just to mention that this week by coincidence, genuine coincidence, Sandy's book 'Between
 the Stops' is coming out in paperback. It's a memoir that collects all stories via very
 interesting routes, specifically a bus route of the number 12 bus where she travels around
 London, jumps off at the stops and explores her childhood and memories from her life.
 I've read it. It is absolutely brilliant. It is packed with facts. Every single paragraph
 just has something that blows your mind. I highly recommend reading it. It's fantastic
 and we hope you enjoy the show as well. So let's do it. On with the show.
 Hello and welcome to another Working from Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a
 weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber,
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and special guest, it's Sandy
 Toxfig and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
 from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with you, Sandy.
 So my fact is that Sloan Square Underground Station in London has a river running through
 it. Well actually, it runs over the trains. I think this is a marvellous thing that you
 can actually go under a river, but be on a train in that way. I love that.
 It's astonishing. I've been to Sloan Square Station a lot. I've never noticed that. I've
 looked up photos and I now understand what this giant metallic pipe that sort of sits
 above the track is. I mean, that's the exciting thing about London is that really nobody has
 a full map of it. That's the extraordinary thing. We don't really have a full map of
 where everything goes, where all the pipes are, where all the deserted tunnels and so
 on. And that in Sloan Square is the Westbourne River, used to be called the Serpentine River,
 and they had to divert it when they built the underground and they divert it into a
 massive pipe and it crosses between the platforms just above where the carriages travel. And
 you can actually see it, but it's not the only one. There are just loads and loads and
 loads of rivers that stop or used to course. When I worked at the Palace Theatre years
 and years ago, which is in the West End of London, if you go right down into the sub-sub-sub-basement
 of the theatre, you can open a large metal hatch and you can see the Fleet River still.
 Cool. Oh my God, I've seen that. I've been there. Yeah. It was our mutual friend, Chris
 Buddle, wasn't it? Ah, there you go, yeah, yeah. Chris Buddle, yes. He used to be the chief
 electrician there. Oh, I can go on this tour. Am I the only person in this podcast recording
 who hasn't seen the Fleet River through a hatch? I'm afraid so. Oh, great. Okay. Probably the
 only person listening to this podcast who hasn't seen that. Quite embarrassing. Yeah,
 that's a very small club that you belong to. And Chris says, please stop contacting him,
 Andy. He just doesn't like you, okay? So I love that. I love that about London. I love
 that you can find the extraordinary bits of history. Do you guys know the Thomas a Beckett
 pub on the old Kent Road? Do you know it? Yeah. I think it's closed down now, but it used
 to be a spot called St Thomas a watering. And it was a place where horses used to go
 and drink. It was the last stop out of London. It was also the sort of first into the capital.
 And now there's a closed pub and then I think an ex white goods store, which is what we
 all need. But where the litter blows and the traffic steams past, that's where Chaucer's
 pilgrims set off for Canterbury. It's the very spot where Henry the fifth returned from
 Agincourt. It's the very spot where Charles II processed with 20,000 people on his way
 into reclaim the throne in 1660. And it's a really important place. But the stream that
 used to run there, the River Neckinger, there's no sign of it now, I think, whatsoever. But
 it was a really important place for horses coming in. And the water was the thing that
 drew them there. So I love all those. If you look for those old rivers, then you'll find
 that tremendous history. Yeah, I really didn't know about these rivers,
 as in I'd heard that there was the one in Sloane Square and so on. But I didn't appreciate
 how much they were the fabric of London in the old days and 1700s and before. And it's
 extraordinary because all the names of the tube stations are a reflection of the rivers
 and their names. So Bayswater and Knight's Bridge, where there was a bridge for knights
 and so on. And it would be insane to bring someone from old London to new London and
 show that we've turned it into sort of metal rivers now, like the robotic future.
 Yeah, especially Knight's Bridge, which was also the Westbourne River. So the same one
 that goes through Sloane Square. The Knight's Bridge was the bridge over that river. And
 it was where all the highwaymen would get you. So if you're leaving London to the North
 West, you would have to go over this bridge and we would always get captured by highwaymen.
 And obviously now Knight's Bridge is, well, obviously no highwaymen there now, but...
 Still, I think some highwaymen in Knight's Bridge and some of those shops, if I'm honest
 with you. Prize of a handbag.
 Apparently, apparently you can swim in the Westbourne River even these days, a little
 bit of it. So not very much because obviously it's in the tube and you can't go into the
 tube, the red hot on that. But it empties out into the Thames proper at Chelsea Embankment.
 And if you go there at low tide, the opening is visible, where the pipe comes out basically.
 And apparently you can get 20 metres in there, and then there's a hatch. So you could theoretically
 get... It's probably more paddling than swimming.
 Yeah, and probably more dying of botulism than swimming in the Westbourne River. But it is
 extraordinary when you think about all the stuff that's going on underground that we
 don't know about. I'm reading a book at the moment called The Mole People. And it's about
 the number of people who live underground in New York City.
 And they estimate there's about 2,000 people who live full time in the old tunnels that
 are now abandoned.
 Do they not worry, isn't there supposed to be like an urban myth that there are crocodiles
 in the sewers in New York or something?
 Alligators.
 Alligators.
 Alligators, yes. When I was a child, if you came up from Florida, there would be people
 at the side of the road selling baby alligators. It was perfectly allowable. And children used
 to pester and say, "Please, can I have a baby alligator?" And you would drive all the way
 to New York with this baby alligator. And then the baby alligator would just very annoying
 thing and grow into a bigger alligator. And people were said to flush them down the toilet.
 To this day, I still check the toilet to make sure that the alligator isn't going to appear.
 There was a trend for micro pigs, wasn't there? I think this might be an urban myth too, that
 people bought micro pigs lots in the early 2000s, and it turns out they were just buying
 pigs.
 Yeah, piglets.
 There's like a really old Russian joke where a guy walks into a pub with a massive bear
 and says, "Where's that bastard that sold me a guinea pig?"
 That was Russians.
 But about the pigs, Andy, the theory, the idea of there being alligators in New York, there
 was also an urban myth that there were wild hogs living in the sewers of London. And this
 was, there was a group of people called Toshers who went through the sewers collecting, like
 people's refuse, but they'd be able to find little bits and pieces and trinkets and make
 a load of money. And they believed that there was a race of wild hogs that was down there
 that might get them.
 So Toshing was a full-time career for some people, particularly in the East End. And
 the best thing that you could do is have some kind of accommodation where you had a manhole
 cover in your garden. I mean, I say garden, it'd be more like a sort of a yard. And any
 Tosher who had their own manhole cover was simply able to go, it was a very easy commute
 to go down into the sewers where they would find, I don't know, coins and things that
 the rich had dropped down open grates. And it was a living. Yeah, the Toshers were famous,
 but they also kind of helped keep the sewage system moving. We now have these fat mountains
 and stuff down in the sewage systems, but the Toshers were busy making sure that areas
 were cleared because they wanted to get through the sewage system and see if anything of value
 would fall into the sewage system.
 And I think they had a special bucket that they would keep the things they found in.
 And that was called a Toshpot. And... Very nice.
 Yeah.
 Thank you.
 If it's not true, I think we should spread the word that it is.
 I believe the etymology of Toshpot is to toss back a drink. Like if you had a drink, you
 would toss it back. And it was a word for people who drank a lot, I think that's right.
 Oh, that's okay.
 No, but Andy's is way better. I think you're right.
 Another river that goes into the Thames, which you can't see anymore, is the Ephra, which
 is in south London. And it kind of bends around Stockwell and Oval. And the reason that the
 oval cricket ground is oval in shape is because it had to go where the river wasn't, basically.
 So the river went meandered around there. And so they put the cricket ground there,
 which was oval shaped. And then all the other cricket grounds in the world were oval because
 of the oval in south London. And that's why that all cricket grounds are that shape is
 because of this particular river in London.
 I love that.
 I love that.
 To just think, well, we've found a shape. Let's stick with it. Let's...
 That square cricket grounds ain't not working for us. We'll just stick with that. I love
 that.
 While I was looking into this, I found a couple of things about the London Underground, just
 actual, you know, general facts about it. And I really wanted to mention this one. I
 read about a train driver, a tube driver called Red Pepper. Don't know if you guys have heard
 of Red Pepper, R-E-D-D, Pepper. So he was a London Underground driver. And his thing
 was any time when a train was in the middle, in between two stations, and had to stop because
 they had to regulate the services, he would often, when they were sitting there, would
 turn the lights off inside the carriages of all the trains and go, "This is your driver
 speaking, or is it?" And he was a real prankster. And he used to love doing all these silly
 voices.
 Anyway, one day he pulls into the station and someone comes and knocks on the, I believe
 this is the story, knocks on the window and hands him a card and says, "I'm a voiceover,
 exec, please get in contact." So he gets in contact, Red Pepper writes to him, "Red
 Pepper goes on to be a voiceover man who does the in-a-world voiceover trailers in Hollywood."
 Yes, a London Underground driver did the in-a-world voice for Independence Day, for Space Jam,
 for Armageddon, for the Blair Witch Project, for Mr Bean's holiday. His career kind of
 went a bit lower in the late 2000s. In fact, the last thing I could find on IMDB where he
 did a Hollywood movie or a movie was... So he did the Blair Witch Project in 1999, but
 then in 2010 he did the Blair Bitch Project, which was a very much a B movie, yeah, misogynistic,
 starring Linda Blair of The Exorcist, the girl in The Exorcist.
 What a wormhole, Dan.
 I was reading about one more train driver who was Hannah Datz. Do you know about her,
 Mandy? I bet you do. She was the first woman to become a tube driver, because what happened
 was when the war happened, when both wars happened, they needed to bring new people
 into the underground to do all the jobs, and loads of women started doing those jobs. And
 in fact, when Made of Ale opened, it was staffed completely by women. But there was one job
 that they basically didn't let women do all the way until the late 70s, and that was a
 tube driver for some reason.
 Which is weird, because it's not like you can get lost.
 Men are always so unwilling to ask for directions on a train.
 All right, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy.
 My fact is that in 1992, Hoover ran a promotion which was so successful that the firm collapsed
 and had to be sold off.
 What the heck happened?
 So they thought, this is the European Arm of Hoover we're talking about, and in 1992
 they thought of this brilliant promotion, and it was this. If you spent 100 quid on
 any Hoover product, you would get two free return flights to somewhere in Europe. And
 that was very exciting, and they had worked out the maths of it. They thought people will
 spend enough money on extra products, and there were hoops to jump through and things
 like this. It sold a lot of hoovers, brilliant.
 And then, so that kind of gone all right, and then Hoover got a bit confident, and they
 said, we're going to expand this deal and say, if you spend 100 quid on any Hoover
 product, you will get two return flights to America. And they were advised by risk management
 people not to do this, and they said, no, it's fine. People will spend so much on Hoover
 products that it will completely offset the cost.
 Unfortunately, they weren't reckoning on the British people who flocked to Hoover shops,
 bought the absolute cheapest thing they could, which is about 120 quid, and then sent off
 a 600 pounds worth of free flights. And it was such a disaster, 500,000 people applied
 for the promotion.
 Oh my goodness.
 I know. And they weren't making much profit, even on the cheap vacuum cleaners that they
 were selling at the time. They made about 30 quid profit on the vacuum cleaner, and then
 they had to spend 600 pounds on plane tickets.
 Amazing. I read that people were buying a vacuum cleaner, and they're just leaving
 it in the shop. And then they didn't need a vacuum cleaner.
 And Hoover started panicking, obviously, when they saw the numbers coming in. So they started
 being really finicky about the fine print. It was a really complicated procedure you
 had to go through to get two return flights. But they started saying people hadn't filled
 in the forms, or they would offer you the flights, and you could accept them or say,
 oh, I can't do that.
 So they started offering people flights from airports, which were hundreds of miles from
 where they lived. Or they would send out request forms on Christmas Eve in the hope that the
 post would be closed and people would miss the deadline to return them, because it was
 Christmas. They tried everything.
 Yeah, it's an astonishing, even, but the first promotion that they did where there was the
 tickets to Europe, the complications of trying to actually be someone who actually receives
 it is extraordinary. They would send you a registration form. You had 14 days to fill
 it out, send it back. Then they sent you another form, which had three different destination
 airports and combinations and dates that you had to fill out and send back. Then that came
 back. If they rejected it and you had to pick three more, they made it as hard as possible,
 but it worked out for them the first time. The problem with the second time is they didn't
 send anyone to America. They should have at least sent some in order to make it look like
 it was a genuine thing, but they just knocked it out so heavily that no one ended up going
 as far as I could see. And you look like people did.
 I don't think that's right. I think about 220,000 people got their flights.
 Really?
 Both promotions. Yeah, it was absolutely huge.
 I know one person who, in fact, we all know one person who got one of the flights, and
 that's Stephen K. Amos, the comedian.
 Really?
 Yeah, and he says that it kind of started his career. When he was 19 years old, he got
 these tickets. He went to New York and he met a promoter called Delphine Manfield who
 said, "Hey, you're a really funny guy. You should become a comedian." And she set him
 up in a show in London when he got back, and he said that was his big break.
 So what happened to the Mandy? They obviously went bankrupt or what?
 There was another problem. The company spent £50 million on airline tickets in the end.
 The other problem was that so many people had bought hoovers that everyone now had a
 hoover, and people started selling them off cheaply in secondhand, which meant that no
 one was going into shops and buying new hoovers because they were on every street corner,
 as far as I could tell.
 The Observer said, "If left uncontrolled, Britain could soon be knee-deep in hoover
 TurboMaster uprights."
 I'll tell you the final thing that happened, but just one previous thing is that there
 was a kidnapping or it's kind of slight kidnapping over this, which was that there was a hoover
 customer who bought a washing machine. That was his way of getting the free tickets.
 And a repairman from the firm came around to fix it, some little problem with it. And
 the guy said, "Yeah, I'm going to be getting these flights." And the hoover repairman called
 him an idiot for thinking he would get these flights. And this customer, it was called David
 Dixon, he saw red, and he blocked in the hoover guy's repair van, and he held at hostage in
 his front drive for 13 days. He was a national hero.
 Oh, the temptation, the temptation.
 I know. I found one other promotion, which was by Tesco in 1997, and I'm pretty sure
 this is niche enough that it'll be news to all of you. This was a deal where if you bought
 three pounds of bananas, you would get 25 points on your Tesco club card, all right?
 And that was worth £1.25.
 That's how I started my comedy career and the crew. I bought all those bananas and left
 them on the street so people slipped on them and videoed them.
 You're still living off the you've been framed income, aren't you? £250 a time. No, so you'd
 get these things. You'd get £1.25 on your card if you bought these bananas, and the
 bananas, £3 at the time, only cost £1.17. And a heroic shopper, he's probably sell
 out there some way, he's called Phil Kolcott. He said, "I did a mental calculation and
 it seems like you couldn't lose. Basically, they were paying shoppers eight pence to take
 away three pounds of bananas." So he spent £367 on 942 pounds of bananas and took them
 away in his car. Had to make a few trips. He ended up with about 3,000 bananas and he
 just started giving them away. He got the local nickname Banana Man because he was just
 constantly giving out bananas. He ended up making £25 and 12 pence in profit thanks to
 the scheme.
 The thing is, can you be asked? That's the thing. Can you be bothered to go and do that
 is the real question. That's amazing.
 Phil, if you're out there, write in. We want to know. We want to hear from you.
 Yeah, we need to track these people down.
 One or two things on Hoover's?
 Yeah, sure.
 Okay, so this is, I think of no interest to anyone but me, but I want to say it anyway,
 which is that the lead singer of AC/DC, this guy called Brian Johnson, his final job before
 getting the gig as the lead singer of AC/DC, the biggest heavy metal band in the world,
 was a Hoover advert, was singing the jingle on a Hoover advert.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 I don't think you're alone in finding that interesting. I love that. I love that very
 much.
 In fact, he got the job because the previous singer, Bond Scott had died and he was auditioning,
 but he made the band wait. They were waiting in London for him to get to his callback and
 he insisted on going off to record a Hoover jingle first. Then the very next thing he
 recorded after that was Back in Black, which was the second biggest album of all time.
 Wow.
 I know, but on the way up, everybody's got to make a living, you know what I'm saying?
 But that's more extraordinary that I thought he had done the gig and that was on TV and
 then he went to this audition. He actually said to AC/DC, the most rock and roll band
 at that time, sorry guys, I got to do a corporate gig before auditioning for the band.
 I think they were down in London saying, can you come by? And he said, yeah, I'll come
 by in a bit, but I have this thing I've got to do first.
 Yeah.
 We've all done adverts where you think, shame that that happened. Years ago, I did an advert
 in Ireland for cottage cheese, which involved me being inside a giant pot of cottage cheese.
 Wow.
 Yeah. So I'm just saying, I've never seen it, but it's out there somewhere.
 Wow. I mean, if anyone could find that video and send it to us, I would be very grateful.
 That's so funny. I want to hear more, Sandy. You were in the pot. Was there actual cottage
 cheese in the pot?
 It was just before that people could do green screen and all these kind of technical tricks.
 Oh no, they didn't actually.
 They actually made this enormous pot. And I think they chose me because it seemed, you
 know, like they didn't have to make such a big pot with me thing. And they were wonderful.
 It's just the most glorious people to work with. And I finished, we've worked all day.
 I was in cottage cheese all day. And then I went back to the hotel early because I needed
 to get a flight first thing. And at about six o'clock in the morning, I got a call from
 the director. So I just wanted to wish a good flight. I said, oh, thank you very much. That's
 very sweet of you to get up at this time to wish me a good flight. Sure. No, we're all
 just going home now. So they'd been up partying around the cottage cheese for the entire night.
 Sorry, Sandy, can I just check what the conceit was of the effort? Was it that this pot you
 were in was normal size? Was there going to be a massive knife sort of diving in?
 I never saw it, darling. I feel really bad. I never saw it. I've done a few adverts in
 my time. I did that and I did an advert for a Torah beef suet once, which I played a small
 girl.
 I had to get into a giant pudding for that. Me and a Mel the Stones and lead school girls
 wanting to eat beef suet. That's so funny. Again, didn't get shown, I don't think.
 That's very good. Some more Hoover stuff, anyone?
 Oh, sure. So the first upright Hoover or vacuum cleaner, you see, we call it Hoover in the
 UK, right? But I think it's mostly because of this promotion, isn't it? Because so many
 people own them because of this massive promotion, they were completely ubiquitous. And so that
 became the name for any vacuum cleaner. But the first one was invented by James Murray
 Spangler in 1908. He had terrible asthma and he decided that the reason that it was is
 because it was the carpet sweeping that he was doing. So he came up with a basic suction
 system. To start off with, he could only make two machines a week to sell because he was
 doing all the designing. His son was assembling them all and his daughter was assembling the
 dust bags. And so it was like literally a cottage industry where that was all they could
 do two a week. And it was only when they sold it, I think to his brother-in-law, the company
 that they managed to put some money behind it and make loads of them.
 And he was an inventor throughout his whole life. And this came very late in his career.
 I think he'd just hit his sixties when he invented this Hoover. But after he sold it
 to the Hoover family, William Hoover, he worked as a superintendent for the company.
 So he stayed on working for them. And then finally, he decided he was going to go on
 his first ever holiday because he never had a holiday before. And he was going to go to
 Florida and sadly he passed away the night before going on his first ever holiday.
 Done.
 Oh.
 I know.
 The tragic thing was, thanks to inventing the Hoover, he was actually given two free
 flights.
 Yes.
 That's a very good thing. I always wanted to be an inventor. I just think it's a nice
 thing to say. Actually, this is what I had. What do you do for a living? I'm an inventor.
 My great-grandfather was an inventor. His name was Field Tricket. And he worked with
 ...
 Right name.
 He worked with the Sahara Maxim, I'm embarrassed to say, inventing the machine gun.
 But he was also, which links us back to an earlier conversation, he was the person who
 put electric light into the West End and he put the lighting into the Palace Theatre where
 the River Fleet runs below and where I once worked in the Electric Department.
 Wow.
 Hang on, you worked in the lighting. Was that nepotism? Did you get that gig?
 It was my great-grandfather.
 I don't know how I got the gig. I was too small to operate any of the lights. I had to, the
 Chief Electrician, Chris Buddle, had to make a special box for me to stand on in order
 to make ...
 Well, also, you probably had cottage cheese till all over your hands.
 Oh, darling.
 It was a complete disaster on the deck.
 Chris Buddle's a guy, Andy, that we know. A really nice guy.
 Yes, yes, you've named him before. Yep, thank you. Hi again, Chris. I feel like listening
 please write back.
 OK, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact. My fact this week is that after
 he retired from dancing in his late 70s, Fred Astaire became a skateboarder.
 It's just a classic ...
 It's just wonderful.
 Career shift.
 So when you say became a skateboarder ...
 Yeah.
 He didn't become a pro skateboarder. It's very hard to skateboard, but this is one of
 the most elegant dancers that we've ever committed to film. An extraordinary human whose whole
 career was defined by his career largely with Ginger Rogers on screen. When he hit his late
 70s, he realized that the grace of his dancing wasn't going to keep up. So he thought, better
 leave it on top. He could still act, so he thought, I'll continue on with that. But he
 retired from dancing and then he was hanging out with his grandkids when they introduced
 him to the skateboard. And this is someone who danced on screen on roller skates. It's
 someone who was an innovator of dance. And he saw this as another place to innovate dancing.
 So he in his late 70s was reportedly doing handstands on his skateboard as he was going
 across his tennis court. These are the reports. And he was just very good with it. He was
 very obsessed with it. If he went on the talk show, like the Merve Griffin show, he would
 talk about how incredible the skateboard was and his fascination that if he had discovered
 it years before, how he definitely would have brought that into the films that he was doing.
 But then unfortunately, one day he fell over and he ruined his wrist in the process and
 had to be in a cast for weeks on end. And that was the sort of end of his skateboarding
 career. But he was made a member of the National Skateboard Society of America. He featured
 in skateboard magazines. He pushed it as a sport. I think that counts as a skateboarder.
 Dan, I read that that he was given lifetime membership of the National Skateboard Society.
 But I can't find what the National Skateboard Society is. There seems to be nothing online
 or anything like that. I looked for it as well. I couldn't find any.
 So I went, I found an old article in the British newspaper archives. And it was from actually
 the Irish Independent. And it was an interview with Averist there, who was Fred's daughter.
 And she said that after he broke his wrist, he got a plaque from the Skateboarding Association,
 which definitely does exist, for highlighting how dangerous the sport can be without proper
 protection. So I wonder if that story's been slightly kind of bouldlerised.
 Yeah. Also, he got an award for being crap. That's not even a good award.
 I tell you, it is a very odd kind of six degrees of separation, but I know his daughter of
 a Irish woman. I'll ask her. I was hoping you'd have a Fred Astaire connection somewhere.
 I was crossing my fingers. I thought she must do. I'm so glad.
 No, she's absolutely lovely. Cool. Yeah. She's a smashing person. I've had dinner with her
 many times. So I will, I'll see you after I can ask her.
 But I mean, he was clearly, he was clearly somebody who was full of pep, as it were.
 Because when he was 81, he married a woman, Jockey, called Robin Smith. And she was 45
 years younger than him. I mean, he, you know, and she's the one who looks pleased. You
 know what I mean? She's looking very thrilled in the photo. So he clearly didn't lack
 vim and vigor, shall we call it? Yeah. We should put together a list of questions
 for you to ask his daughter, because I've got so many serious things. So one thing
 that I wanted to know about was that he was in an episode of Battlestar Galactica.
 Was he playing what? Just an alien. No, he was an alien. He was an alien that looked
 like a man, as in, you know, he was a human shaped alien. But... Isn't everyone in Battlestar
 Galactica an alien? Well, I've only seen the new series, not the original. But I just
 find that insane that... Have you watched it, Dan? Have you watched it? I tried to find
 it. No, I didn't find it in time. There are some clips on YouTube and you know how you
 said he didn't dance anymore. Well, he is dancing in this episode of Battlestar Galactica,
 but he's just kind of swaying and moving his hands a little bit. So it's not really...
 Yeah. It's not tap dancing, if you know. No, but you're right. He came out of retirement
 from the dancing retirement in order to do one final dance to disco as an alien on Battlestar
 Galactica. Wow. And yeah, and I really want to see it. I'm glad it's online. And again,
 it was because his grandchildren loved the show, right? And I think there was an interview
 afterwards and he said it was the favourite thing that he did in his whole career, but
 only for the reason that it was something that his grandchildren really loved and were
 really proud of him. I did bake off for the same reason my kids liked him. For me, the
 most interesting thing is the success of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films is extraordinary.
 So Top Hat and Follow the Fleet and The Gate of Orsay and Shall We Dance and so on. And
 I discovered why they all seem so successful in such a... They're so beautifully shaped.
 It's because the director, Mark Sandrich, he did what he called "minitage" for each
 film. So he had this elaborate colour-coded chart and he detailed minute by minute everything
 that was going to happen in the film. So there would be a blue section for music, there'd
 be a green section for singing, a red section for dancing and a yellow section for the novelty
 and speaking and so on. And he made all the films look roughly the same. So you would
 have that much singing in that point in the film. You'd have that much dancing at that
 point in the film. And actually, if you look at the colour-coded charts, you can see them.
 There's a book called the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers book and they reproduce a panel
 from one of his colour-coded charts. You can see that he used... It's almost Mozart-like
 in its mathematical calculation about what makes the perfect song and dance musical because
 he'd worked it out.
 Wow, that's so interesting.
 So like the phrase to make a song and dance out of something, really, it should be, "We've
 done this then and then we did this."
 But you wouldn't expect it to be so prescriptive in a way.
 When you're writing your plays or books or whatever, Sandy, would you do similar kind
 of things to that? Would you try and have a...
 Yeah. So I'm sitting in my office at the moment. I'm writing an opera with my sister. My sister
 and I write musicals and stuff together. And we have different colour-coded notes depending
 on whether it's a particular kind of song or whether it's a light moment or a big moment
 or not. And always our great moment, which we got to yesterday, is that we now know what
 the opening number is and we know what the closing number is. So we know how we begin
 and we know how we end. And then all we've got to do now is fill in the bit of the middle
 part. And that's all there is to it. I feel like Verdy had exactly the same technique.
 Post-it notes all over his office.
 So one thing I did read is that when Astaire and Rogers were making these films, they had
 to be adjusted in part because the films were almost too good. So every routine they did,
 dancing, was followed by applause. Live cinema audiences would applaud for a little while
 after the dance ended. So the producers had to follow in the movie. They had to put in
 some applause after the end of the dance or some laughter or something just to let the
 atmosphere in the cinema calm down.
 You get those brilliant scenes with Edward Everett Horton doing, you know, just basically
 doing a lot of silly, funny faces. And that's really a sort of cover to make sure that the
 audience has come back to the story. Not that the story was ever so complicated. It was
 difficult to follow.
 Yeah. Ginger Rogers, a speaking sandy of your great-great-grandfather who was an inventor.
 Ginger Rogers' great-great-grandfather discovered something as well. He was the person who discovered
 Quinning for malaria.
 Really?
 Wow.
 He's called John S. Sappington, and he developed a sort of precursor to hydroxychloroquine,
 which is something we've been hearing a lot about from the President of the United States
 of America.
 Yeah. Apparently, it shows stupidity.
 Well, it hasn't yet.
 Ginger Rogers, I mean, genius. And as she said herself, you know, I did all the same dances
 as Fred, but I did it backwards and in high heels. And there is something in that that
 was tougher for her, I think, than it was for him.
 There's a wonderful early film called Stage Door with her in it, and Lucille Ball and
 Catherine Hepburn, have you guys seen it?
 No.
 It's an all-black-and-white movie.
 And all of these incredible, it's a set in a boarding house of lots of young ingenues
 who want to get into show business, but it is actually lots of women who became incredibly
 famous.
 And the thing about Ginger Rogers, but from being brilliant dancers, you can see what
 a phenomenal amount of comedy timing she had. She just was a comedic genius.
 I found out her first famous catchphrase, which I've never heard before. So the first
 movie she was in was called Young Man of Manhattan. And she said the line in it, there's a line
 where she says, "Cigarette me, big boy." And this became a popular catchphrase across
 America.
 "Cigarette me, big boy."
 We should all take that on, then.
 I almost feel like taking up smoking. I've never taken up smoking in my whole life, but
 just the chance to say, "Cigarette me, big boy."
 Yeah, I don't think vape me, big boy. It has quite the same effect.
 Is it true that he didn't really want to pair up with Ginger Rogers at the start because
 he'd had a duet with his sister?
 Yeah, his sister was his partner for many, many years, in the years when he did live
 performances. And his original name, I think, is Austerlitz, not Astaire at all. I think
 it's Fred Austerlitz. But I think his sister married money and decided to give up show
 business. Dear God, that's such a good idea. I mean, I think anybody. I thought my wife
 did have money, which is why I was on my way out. But what was she called? She was called
 Adele, I think, Adele Astaire.
 One of the not charges, I mean, he was obviously pretty much the greatest dancer ever to live,
 but he was accused of being quite sexless or the dancers were not sensual in the way
 that maybe in his later career, when he was dancing with Sir Cheresy, they were a bit
 sexier, actually. But when he was younger, they weren't. And that might be partly because
 he spent pretty much his entire early career dancing with his sister.
 Yeah, and that would have been a bad look, darling.
 Yeah. And she was the one who was going to be successful. This is a really fascinating
 thing. But the first, one of the first dances they did was when he was about five years
 old when they were dancing together as a pair. And they did a bride and groom dance on top
 of a wedding cake in the first half.
 Wow.
 Yeah, it sounds amazing. And in the second half, he played a lobster.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 Was that, was that a boarder bill thing, Andy, I think it was. Yeah.
 I think it was called juvenile artists presenting an electric musical toe dancing novelty.
 It's not that, it's not exactly catchy, is it?
 I don't often get professional jealousy, but I totally want to play a lobster.
 I think in this weather, we're all playing lobsters, aren't we?
 Dying.
 His first wife sounds pretty, pretty intimidating, actually. So this is, he, before he married
 the jockey, he was, he married quite young and he and his first wife were together until
 1954.
 She died of cancer, unfortunately. They've been married 21 years and he absolutely adored
 her.
 Yeah, he was inconsolable and then did marry for years and years and years afterwards.
 It was a proper love match.
 But she was very concerned about his leading ladies, I believe, and she would turn up at
 the side of the set and knit to make sure that there was no inappropriateness going on.
 Wow.
 And I know, and this is the amazing thing is that Fredster and Ted Rogers, they made ten
 films together. They kissed once on screen and even that kiss had to be...
 It's behind a door, I think, that kiss.
 Oh, was it?
 Yeah, so I think it's not even, you don't even really see anything.
 Because the thing I heard, oh, this, well, maybe, maybe there's one behind a door and
 one on screen, I'm not sure. But the one that was on screen was extended in slow-mo to make
 it seem longer than it actually had been. So it's a pretty brief peck. And they did
 have one scene in bed, but for that they used a dummy instead of a real woman.
 Is that a Ginger Rogers?
 I like the idea of the wife knitting like the women at the guillotine.
 I was just going to say the same thing. It's like the intimidating knitters of history.
 There is something quite intimidating about someone just sat there knitting, isn't there?
 Yeah, definitely.
 And if Ginger Rogers comes on with a low cut dress, she goes, "I've knitted you a cardigan,
 darling."
 Yes, here's a little belero for you.
 I was reading about some other dancers, actually. National Tap Dancing Day is May the 25th.
 And who hasn't celebrated that?
 Well it was designated that date because it was the birthday of Bill Robinson. And Bill
 Robinson is a very --
 Is that Bill Bojangles?
 Bojangles, exactly, yeah. He was the highest paid black American entertainer in America
 during the first half of the 20th century. One year he did 400 charity events in a single
 year. This guy was absolutely amazing. And whenever he did a show, he needed to get publicity
 for it. There was no TV in those days. How do you get publicity? He would run backwards
 and have races running backwards against local athletes. Because apparently he held the world
 record for running backwards, which was 100 yards in 13.5 seconds.
 Wow.
 That's pretty good.
 I wonder who holds it now. We should surely meet this person. We need to find that out.
 I think there would be. I think it is a Guinness World Record thing. But that's -- I mean,
 13.5 seconds for 100 yards is certainly faster than I've ever run that distance forwards
 in my entire life. Even when I was a young man, I couldn't do that.
 I haven't covered it that fast in a car.
 There was another dancer who -- the name caught my eye, which was Ann Miller, obviously,
 our colleague, Ann Miller. And she was incredible. She could dance 500 taps in a minute when
 she was tap dancing. That's what she claimed. No one doubted her. 500 taps in a minute.
 And she was --
 Stunning.
 Yeah. Oh, so you know about her, Sandy?
 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm a big musical theater buff.
 But what I like about Ann Miller is when she was very young, she suffered from rickets.
 And she had to have her legs strengthened as a child. And that seems to have been what
 made her a brilliant dancer as she got older. And there's a lot of other people like that.
 Like, there's a soccer player called Garincha, a Brazilian who had rickets as a child and
 then strengthened his legs. And it made him a great player. And last week, we talked about
 Annette Kellerman. Do you remember the swimmer?
 Yes, the Australian swimmer.
 Yeah, exactly. And she was exactly the same. She had this problem as a child, very weak
 legs, but they really strengthened them. And it made her a brilliant swimmer when she
 got older.
 She got into trouble, didn't she, for wearing a one-piece swimsuit, which I was thought
 of.
 Exactly. Yeah, she invented that.
 Very naughty.
 But Ann Miller as well, she was quite tall. And she once danced with Fred Astaire. And
 she had to wear ballet slippers so that she wasn't taller than him.
 Should have danced with me. It would have been all right.
 I have a link fact, which is that Fred Astaire, ten years after his death, appeared in an
 advert for a vacuum cleaner.
 No.
 That's very good. Dancing with the vacuum cleaner?
 Yes, because, as you'll know, there's a bit where he's dancing with a mop in one of his
 films.
 And I think they CGI'd it. I think this would have been the '90s. They CGI'd it so he was
 dancing with a vacuum cleaner instead. And his widow, his second wife, Robin, the jockey,
 she said it was artistically suitable to use the vacuum cleaners as props. But his daughter,
 Ava, was so angry about him being used in an ad without his permission, obviously, because
 he was dead. She returned her devil vacuum cleaner to the firm.
 Well, that's told them. I'm not surprised. I am surprised that it happened at all. I'm
 not surprised his daughter was angry because one of the things he left very strict instructions
 about was that he was never to be portrayed after his death. He didn't want his life story
 done. He didn't want anybody to do his autobiography on film, as it were, or portray him in any
 way. So I suspect she wouldn't have been thrilled with that because actually it's a great story.
 Him coming up, huffing through vaudeville and working with his sister and coming to Hollywood
 and making it and so on and working with George's. It seems like a natural biopic, but apparently
 he left incredibly strict instructions saying that the estate would never give permission.
 But he didn't mention vacuum cleaner either. Never mentioned the slutty Hoover.
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.
 OK, my fact this week is that the Icelandic word for museum is the same as the word for
 a flock of sheep.
 I love this fact. Yes, me too. I think it's so Icelandic. It's got two of the most Icelandic
 things which is sheep and museums because they have so many museums in Iceland. They
 have about 300, which is one for every a thousand people, just about, which is proportionally
 25 times more common in Iceland than they are in Britain. So this is from a book by
 someone called A Kendra Green, which is called the Museum of Wales You Will Never See, and
 it's all about these museums in Iceland. And the word is Safan. I'm sure I'm pronouncing
 that wrong. It's S-A-F-N. And that comes from Safna, which is an old Norse word meaning
 to collect or assemble. So it was a collection of things, became a museum and also a collection
 of sheep. Like a flock of sheep became that word as well.
 And there's a similar word in English, which comes from the same root from thousands and
 thousands of years ago. And that is the root Sam, which is where we get the word same or
 similar. And the Russian togyasamoye, which means the same. It's like all these words
 all come from the same original roots from thousands and thousands of years ago.
 What did you say? S-A-F-N? Did you say?
 S-A-F-N in Icelandic. Yeah, so S-A-V-N in Danish sound means to save, means to save things
 together.
 Exactly. And then this word also Samma became Hammer in Greek, in ancient Greek. And that's
 where we get words like homeopathy, homosexual, meaning the same, you know, things, a homeopathy,
 it's where the same thing cures, the same thing, and like that.
 But it's the same with the actual word, isn't it? Because it's a homograph. It's a, it's
 a, you know, it's the similar, spelt the same, but it means two completely different.
 So really interesting stuff about etymology of words, which is what I love. But really,
 I just want to talk about the amazing museums in Iceland because I've just been there.
 You've just been there, yeah. You just had a week there. What I did on my holidays section
 of the podcast.
 I'm looking forward to doing all this.
 Listen to everything James says now to be tax deductible in the course of this chat.
 So, James, which museums did you see?
 Well, I mean, everyone's going to expect me to say the Penis Museum in Reykjavik, which
 of course I did go to, which, I mean, it's brilliant. It really is a good museum. There's
 so many interesting things there. And it was started by this guy who acquired his first
 penis in 1970. Well, a second penis, but it's, I was going to go for number two there.
 He acquired it.
 He must have been so thrilled for the day he acquired his first penis.
 I should start a museum.
 It's like a clip on thing.
 Yeah, it's like this is a potato head you have to look up.
 The curator, speaking of clip-ons, the curator does have a bow tie made from a sperm whale's
 penis, which he wears for the Christmas party every year, which is on display. But he acquired
 his first or second penis in 1974 when he got a bull's pizzle, which was being used
 by a local teacher as a blackboard pointer. And then that was handed to him and he later
 on a few years later thought, you know what, I could turn this into a collection.
 Is that not a kind of child abuse, to point things out with a penis?
 Depends on what lesson it is, I guess.
 So, James, I read that people started giving him more as a kind of joke. Once he had the
 bull's one, sort of, you know, if someone's into something, you always give them a tourist
 bit of that. And then he got sort of almost every mammal in Iceland. And he thought, actually,
 this is a proper collection now.
 Yeah, a bit like collecting like football cards or football stickers. He wanted to get
 them all. Oh, Pokemon. He wanted to collect all of them. So it was like, OK, well, we
 know all of these animals in Iceland. I need one penis from every male animal. It's like
 the Noah of Iceland.
 That's a weird calling from God. Two of every animal. Actually, just one of every animal.
 Actually just the penis of every animal.
 And they have the penises of the 2008 Icelandic National Handball Team, which are not the
 actual ones. Sorry.
 But they're not the actual ones. They're silver replicants.
 Caster casts.
 They're silver casts because they won silver medal in that game.
 Ow!
 God, what a relief. He must have been hugely relieved they didn't take gold, because the
 cost would have been exorbitant.
 Never mind that. What about the molten metal on you, to put it into the picture?
 It's like goldfinger, isn't it, where they cover that lady in gold all the way through.
 They probably threw the match going, we can't win gold.
 Have I remembered incorrectly, guys, but in parts of the Arctic, when people made wooden
 huts, they sometimes used to make windows out of stretched foreskins. Is that right,
 or have I made that up?
 No, I think you are right.
 Thank you, right, yeah.
 Obviously, it's going to be a walrus foreskin, if you're going to make a window.
 Sorry, the windows are so tiny.
 They've been those mullion sort of diamond shaped windows you get in old houses.
 It really worries me that that's in my head somewhere.
 You guys are too young to remember play school, where they used to look through a different
 window every day. The other things he has in his museum are penises from various animals
 in folklore. So they have an elf penis, a troll penis, and the testicles of a corpse
 eating ghoul cat. And again, what it is, it's like locals just give him these things and
 say, I'm pretty sure this is the testicles of a ghost eating ghoul cat.
 Yeah, then they go home and sob with laughter.
 Did he not go, sorry, the testicle museum's down the road, we only need some penises.
 Actually, the testicle museum, Dan, is on either side of the penis museum.
 Well, we do have a vagina museum, don't we, in London, in London, the vagina museum, which
 was started by someone we all know, someone the elves know anyway, Florence, who worked
 with us for a little while. But, yeah, they're, I think they're closed at the moment due
 to COVID, but they're still doing events online. So it's worth searching Twitter for
 the vagina museum and following those guys, for sure.
 Worrying about what the opening hours are for the vagina.
 Not something that had occurred to me until this moment.
 I've always thought they'll open if you're that keen, you know what I mean?
 You have to buy them a drink first, that's it.
 Obviously.
 Did you swim in the Blue Lagoon?
 Yeah, we went to the Blue Lagoon.
 It was great.
 What's that?
 It's a hot water kind of spa area, because obviously Iceland, the land of ice and fire,
 they have a lot of geysers and hot water and stuff like that. So, yeah, it was really good.
 It's amazing. It has a sort of sulfur coating on the bottom of the pool, which is white
 and people cover themselves all over. But I've been there when it's deep snow and you
 have to run through the snow to get into the Blue Lagoon. But then there's all this steam
 and you're covering yourself in this kind of weight. It's supposed to be incredibly
 good for you, but it's a very surreal experience to be in a swimsuit in the freezing cold.
 Yeah, I had a couple of facials of the local mud and stuff. And I'm quite surprised you
 guys haven't noticed how young my skin looks.
 It's just the quality of the Zoom, James.
 All right. I hardly recognise you. I'm honest with you. But those geysers, what it means
 is that, for example, the whole town of Reykjavik, nobody pays for central heating, even though
 you are talking about one of the coldest countries in the world, because there's enough natural
 heat underground, which they have transferred into domestic heating. So you can have it
 as hot as you like, even though it's freezing cold outside, which is absolutely fantastic.
 And there are restaurants where they cook, they have deep pits outside the restaurant
 and the pits, they put the pots down into the steaming heat down into the ground and
 cook it and then bring it back up again. So they're even using it for cooking.
 It's so cool. That's wonderful. It's a fantastic country. I really need to go. I really want
 to visit. James, did you go to this while you're there? It's not in Reykjavik, but the
 Museum of Sorcery and Witchcraft? Unfortunately, we got stuck behind a landslide, which meant
 that we lost half a day, which meant that we couldn't go. But I have always wanted to
 go there because I want to see the necropants. The necropants. They sound incredible. The
 necropads. So from the 17th century, they are a pair of trousers that are made of human
 skin, of human corpse. Yeah. And they were supposedly used by, you'd have to have permission
 from a dead man to skin him afterwards and use his skin as the trousers. And then the
 idea is that they were a money making device. They would provide money out of the trousers
 for you to become rich. So you had to, in order to access the money, get a coin from
 a widow and put it in the front of the trousers. But from then on in, it sort of produces more
 and more coins. It's astonishing. I don't know if it really worked.
 You've got to match yourself up with a friend who's going to be the right size. I mean,
 if you're a big fat guy, you don't want a dead skinny guy to make trousers out of.
 That's true. And if you're meeting someone as a friend for the first time and they're
 kind of looking at your legs going, size in you up. But it's a curious thing because
 traditionally witches around the world, if you think about the Pendle Witches in this
 country and you think about the Salem Witches in the United States, it's traditionally
 it's been women, but I believe the Icelandic witches are predominantly male.
 That's right. Only one of all the, there were 21 Icelanders who were burnt alive for being
 witches in the 17th century and only one was a woman.
 Wow.
 That's unusual.
 That's unusual.
 A blow for equality there.
 I know, right? Finally.
 The first person to be executed for witchcraft was guy called John Johnson, who admitted
 having used farting runes against a girl.
 Sorry?
 Farting.
 Farting runes. So you kind of toss them and they, they, they do a bit of magic and then
 someone just starts farting all the time.
 Oh, so you call someone to fart.
 Yeah, it's like a curse or a magic spell.
 Death by farting.
 Wow.
 Is it okay, James, to suggest I feel you've lowered the tone with your penises in your
 farting?
 I'm just going to say I'm just going to.
 I think you might be right.
 We had quite erudite conversations about underground rivers and.
 I saw a quite a fun thing that Iceland's doing at the moment as a sort of global mental
 health incentive and it's that the tourist board has made it so that all of us, all four
 of us here, anyone listening over the world can go to a website and scream at it as loud
 as we want and they will play your scream in one of seven locations in Iceland at the
 moment where they've parked these giant speakers into these vast empty quarters, either looking
 out to the ocean or inland and you just, it's, it's a primal scream thing where they
 just want you to vent all this pented up anxiety and depression from the lockdown period out
 onto their website and they'll bung it out into the open airs of Iceland.
 And that's a thing that if you go to their website, you can actually just record that
 scream and have it played out there.
 I think a few of the locals aren't that sure about the shouting thing though Dan, because
 let's say you have some nice puffin sort of living around the speaker and they're just
 hearing people yelling into them.
 I was, I went to this lagoon, it's called the iceberg lagoon and the glacier, the biggest
 place you're in Europe kind of comes to the edge of the sea and bits of it break off and
 you see these icebergs on the water, it's quite amazing.
 But a few years ago, do you remember there was a Bond movie where they drove cars on
 ice.
 I can't remember, is it Tomorrow Never Dies or something like that?
 It's Die Another Day.
 It's one of the really bad, it's the last Brosnan one.
 I think it's the Madonna Die Another Day.
 It's a real stinker.
 So they filmed that on that lagoon, but to do so they needed it to be quite thick ice
 and so they dammed the lagoon so no seawater could go there and it froze to like about
 six feet deep or maybe even deeper.
 And I was talking to the guy who was showing us around, I said, was that not quite bad for
 the animals, the seals and birds that live here?
 He's like, yeah, yeah, that was pretty bad.
 And apparently it used to be owned, privately owned that area and they dammed it off and
 so they could film this and then as soon as that happened, the government went, we're
 going to have to buy this off you because we can't be having this kind of thing happening
 in our country and killing all our animals just so you could get a good scene in a bad
 movie.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Not one seals life is worth giving up for the film, Die Another Day.
 I think we can all agree with that.
 I mean, I'd have that on a t-shirt, that's right.
 OK, that is it.
 That is all of our facts.
