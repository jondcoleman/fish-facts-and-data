00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hi everyone, before we begin this week's episode of Fish, we just want to let you know that"
00:00:03,00:00:10,"we have a very special guest on today. It is the mighty host of QI herself, Sandy Toxfig,"
00:00:10,00:00:16,finally to have the Supreme Boss come and fight us with facts was a wonderful honor.
00:00:16,00:00:21,"Also just to mention that this week by coincidence, genuine coincidence, Sandy's book 'Between"
00:00:21,00:00:26,the Stops' is coming out in paperback. It's a memoir that collects all stories via very
00:00:26,00:00:31,"interesting routes, specifically a bus route of the number 12 bus where she travels around"
00:00:31,00:00:35,"London, jumps off at the stops and explores her childhood and memories from her life."
00:00:35,00:00:39,I've read it. It is absolutely brilliant. It is packed with facts. Every single paragraph
00:00:39,00:00:44,just has something that blows your mind. I highly recommend reading it. It's fantastic
00:00:44,00:01:04,and we hope you enjoy the show as well. So let's do it. On with the show.
00:01:04,00:01:08,"Hello and welcome to another Working from Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a"
00:01:08,00:01:14,"weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber,"
00:01:14,00:01:18,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and special guest, it's Sandy"
00:01:18,00:01:23,Toxfig and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:01:23,00:01:30,"from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with you, Sandy."
00:01:30,00:01:37,So my fact is that Sloan Square Underground Station in London has a river running through
00:01:37,00:01:44,"it. Well actually, it runs over the trains. I think this is a marvellous thing that you"
00:01:44,00:01:48,"can actually go under a river, but be on a train in that way. I love that."
00:01:48,00:01:52,It's astonishing. I've been to Sloan Square Station a lot. I've never noticed that. I've
00:01:52,00:01:58,looked up photos and I now understand what this giant metallic pipe that sort of sits
00:01:58,00:02:02,"above the track is. I mean, that's the exciting thing about London is that really nobody has"
00:02:02,00:02:06,a full map of it. That's the extraordinary thing. We don't really have a full map of
00:02:06,00:02:11,"where everything goes, where all the pipes are, where all the deserted tunnels and so"
00:02:11,00:02:15,"on. And that in Sloan Square is the Westbourne River, used to be called the Serpentine River,"
00:02:15,00:02:19,and they had to divert it when they built the underground and they divert it into a
00:02:19,00:02:24,massive pipe and it crosses between the platforms just above where the carriages travel. And
00:02:24,00:02:28,"you can actually see it, but it's not the only one. There are just loads and loads and"
00:02:28,00:02:35,loads of rivers that stop or used to course. When I worked at the Palace Theatre years
00:02:35,00:02:40,"and years ago, which is in the West End of London, if you go right down into the sub-sub-sub-basement"
00:02:40,00:02:46,"of the theatre, you can open a large metal hatch and you can see the Fleet River still."
00:02:46,00:02:51,"Cool. Oh my God, I've seen that. I've been there. Yeah. It was our mutual friend, Chris"
00:02:51,00:02:55,"Buddle, wasn't it? Ah, there you go, yeah, yeah. Chris Buddle, yes. He used to be the chief"
00:02:55,00:02:59,"electrician there. Oh, I can go on this tour. Am I the only person in this podcast recording"
00:02:59,00:03:05,"who hasn't seen the Fleet River through a hatch? I'm afraid so. Oh, great. Okay. Probably the"
00:03:05,00:03:11,"only person listening to this podcast who hasn't seen that. Quite embarrassing. Yeah,"
00:03:11,00:03:17,"that's a very small club that you belong to. And Chris says, please stop contacting him,"
00:03:17,00:03:24,"Andy. He just doesn't like you, okay? So I love that. I love that about London. I love"
00:03:24,00:03:29,that you can find the extraordinary bits of history. Do you guys know the Thomas a Beckett
00:03:29,00:03:35,"pub on the old Kent Road? Do you know it? Yeah. I think it's closed down now, but it used"
00:03:35,00:03:39,to be a spot called St Thomas a watering. And it was a place where horses used to go
00:03:39,00:03:43,and drink. It was the last stop out of London. It was also the sort of first into the capital.
00:03:43,00:03:46,"And now there's a closed pub and then I think an ex white goods store, which is what we"
00:03:46,00:03:52,"all need. But where the litter blows and the traffic steams past, that's where Chaucer's"
00:03:52,00:03:58,pilgrims set off for Canterbury. It's the very spot where Henry the fifth returned from
00:03:58,00:04:05,"Agincourt. It's the very spot where Charles II processed with 20,000 people on his way"
00:04:05,00:04:11,into reclaim the throne in 1660. And it's a really important place. But the stream that
00:04:11,00:04:17,"used to run there, the River Neckinger, there's no sign of it now, I think, whatsoever. But"
00:04:17,00:04:23,it was a really important place for horses coming in. And the water was the thing that
00:04:23,00:04:28,"drew them there. So I love all those. If you look for those old rivers, then you'll find"
00:04:28,00:04:32,"that tremendous history. Yeah, I really didn't know about these rivers,"
00:04:32,00:04:38,as in I'd heard that there was the one in Sloane Square and so on. But I didn't appreciate
00:04:38,00:04:44,how much they were the fabric of London in the old days and 1700s and before. And it's
00:04:44,00:04:48,extraordinary because all the names of the tube stations are a reflection of the rivers
00:04:48,00:04:52,"and their names. So Bayswater and Knight's Bridge, where there was a bridge for knights"
00:04:52,00:04:56,and so on. And it would be insane to bring someone from old London to new London and
00:04:56,00:05:01,"show that we've turned it into sort of metal rivers now, like the robotic future."
00:05:01,00:05:05,"Yeah, especially Knight's Bridge, which was also the Westbourne River. So the same one"
00:05:05,00:05:09,that goes through Sloane Square. The Knight's Bridge was the bridge over that river. And
00:05:09,00:05:14,it was where all the highwaymen would get you. So if you're leaving London to the North
00:05:14,00:05:18,"West, you would have to go over this bridge and we would always get captured by highwaymen."
00:05:18,00:05:23,"And obviously now Knight's Bridge is, well, obviously no highwaymen there now, but..."
00:05:23,00:05:27,"Still, I think some highwaymen in Knight's Bridge and some of those shops, if I'm honest"
00:05:27,00:05:29,with you. Prize of a handbag.
00:05:29,00:05:35,"Apparently, apparently you can swim in the Westbourne River even these days, a little"
00:05:35,00:05:39,bit of it. So not very much because obviously it's in the tube and you can't go into the
00:05:39,00:05:46,"tube, the red hot on that. But it empties out into the Thames proper at Chelsea Embankment."
00:05:46,00:05:52,"And if you go there at low tide, the opening is visible, where the pipe comes out basically."
00:05:52,00:05:58,"And apparently you can get 20 metres in there, and then there's a hatch. So you could theoretically"
00:05:58,00:06:00,get... It's probably more paddling than swimming.
00:06:00,00:06:06,"Yeah, and probably more dying of botulism than swimming in the Westbourne River. But it is"
00:06:06,00:06:08,extraordinary when you think about all the stuff that's going on underground that we
00:06:08,00:06:12,don't know about. I'm reading a book at the moment called The Mole People. And it's about
00:06:12,00:06:17,the number of people who live underground in New York City.
00:06:17,00:06:23,"And they estimate there's about 2,000 people who live full time in the old tunnels that"
00:06:23,00:06:24,are now abandoned.
00:06:24,00:06:28,"Do they not worry, isn't there supposed to be like an urban myth that there are crocodiles"
00:06:28,00:06:30,in the sewers in New York or something?
00:06:30,00:06:31,Alligators.
00:06:31,00:06:32,Alligators.
00:06:32,00:06:36,"Alligators, yes. When I was a child, if you came up from Florida, there would be people"
00:06:36,00:06:41,at the side of the road selling baby alligators. It was perfectly allowable. And children used
00:06:41,00:06:45,"to pester and say, ""Please, can I have a baby alligator?"" And you would drive all the way"
00:06:45,00:06:49,to New York with this baby alligator. And then the baby alligator would just very annoying
00:06:49,00:06:57,thing and grow into a bigger alligator. And people were said to flush them down the toilet.
00:06:57,00:07:03,"To this day, I still check the toilet to make sure that the alligator isn't going to appear."
00:07:03,00:07:09,"There was a trend for micro pigs, wasn't there? I think this might be an urban myth too, that"
00:07:09,00:07:12,"people bought micro pigs lots in the early 2000s, and it turns out they were just buying"
00:07:12,00:07:13,pigs.
00:07:13,00:07:14,"Yeah, piglets."
00:07:14,00:07:20,There's like a really old Russian joke where a guy walks into a pub with a massive bear
00:07:20,00:07:24,"and says, ""Where's that bastard that sold me a guinea pig?"""
00:07:24,00:07:27,That was Russians.
00:07:27,00:07:32,"But about the pigs, Andy, the theory, the idea of there being alligators in New York, there"
00:07:32,00:07:37,was also an urban myth that there were wild hogs living in the sewers of London. And this
00:07:37,00:07:43,"was, there was a group of people called Toshers who went through the sewers collecting, like"
00:07:43,00:07:47,"people's refuse, but they'd be able to find little bits and pieces and trinkets and make"
00:07:47,00:07:51,a load of money. And they believed that there was a race of wild hogs that was down there
00:07:51,00:07:53,that might get them.
00:07:53,00:07:57,"So Toshing was a full-time career for some people, particularly in the East End. And"
00:07:57,00:08:02,the best thing that you could do is have some kind of accommodation where you had a manhole
00:08:02,00:08:09,"cover in your garden. I mean, I say garden, it'd be more like a sort of a yard. And any"
00:08:09,00:08:13,"Tosher who had their own manhole cover was simply able to go, it was a very easy commute"
00:08:13,00:08:22,"to go down into the sewers where they would find, I don't know, coins and things that"
00:08:22,00:08:28,"the rich had dropped down open grates. And it was a living. Yeah, the Toshers were famous,"
00:08:28,00:08:33,but they also kind of helped keep the sewage system moving. We now have these fat mountains
00:08:33,00:08:37,"and stuff down in the sewage systems, but the Toshers were busy making sure that areas"
00:08:37,00:08:40,were cleared because they wanted to get through the sewage system and see if anything of value
00:08:40,00:08:42,would fall into the sewage system.
00:08:42,00:08:46,And I think they had a special bucket that they would keep the things they found in.
00:08:46,00:08:50,And that was called a Toshpot. And... Very nice.
00:08:50,00:08:51,Yeah.
00:08:51,00:08:52,Thank you.
00:08:52,00:08:57,"If it's not true, I think we should spread the word that it is."
00:08:57,00:09:02,"I believe the etymology of Toshpot is to toss back a drink. Like if you had a drink, you"
00:09:02,00:09:05,"would toss it back. And it was a word for people who drank a lot, I think that's right."
00:09:05,00:09:06,"Oh, that's okay."
00:09:06,00:09:11,"No, but Andy's is way better. I think you're right."
00:09:11,00:09:16,"Another river that goes into the Thames, which you can't see anymore, is the Ephra, which"
00:09:16,00:09:23,is in south London. And it kind of bends around Stockwell and Oval. And the reason that the
00:09:23,00:09:29,"oval cricket ground is oval in shape is because it had to go where the river wasn't, basically."
00:09:29,00:09:32,"So the river went meandered around there. And so they put the cricket ground there,"
00:09:32,00:09:37,which was oval shaped. And then all the other cricket grounds in the world were oval because
00:09:37,00:09:42,of the oval in south London. And that's why that all cricket grounds are that shape is
00:09:42,00:09:44,because of this particular river in London.
00:09:44,00:09:45,I love that.
00:09:45,00:09:46,I love that.
00:09:46,00:09:51,"To just think, well, we've found a shape. Let's stick with it. Let's..."
00:09:51,00:09:55,That square cricket grounds ain't not working for us. We'll just stick with that. I love
00:09:55,00:09:56,that.
00:09:56,00:09:59,"While I was looking into this, I found a couple of things about the London Underground, just"
00:09:59,00:10:04,"actual, you know, general facts about it. And I really wanted to mention this one. I"
00:10:04,00:10:09,"read about a train driver, a tube driver called Red Pepper. Don't know if you guys have heard"
00:10:09,00:10:16,"of Red Pepper, R-E-D-D, Pepper. So he was a London Underground driver. And his thing"
00:10:16,00:10:21,"was any time when a train was in the middle, in between two stations, and had to stop because"
00:10:21,00:10:25,"they had to regulate the services, he would often, when they were sitting there, would"
00:10:25,00:10:29,"turn the lights off inside the carriages of all the trains and go, ""This is your driver"
00:10:29,00:10:38,"speaking, or is it?"" And he was a real prankster. And he used to love doing all these silly"
00:10:38,00:10:39,voices.
00:10:39,00:10:44,"Anyway, one day he pulls into the station and someone comes and knocks on the, I believe"
00:10:44,00:10:49,"this is the story, knocks on the window and hands him a card and says, ""I'm a voiceover,"
00:10:49,00:10:54,"exec, please get in contact."" So he gets in contact, Red Pepper writes to him, ""Red"
00:10:54,00:11:01,"Pepper goes on to be a voiceover man who does the in-a-world voiceover trailers in Hollywood."""
00:11:01,00:11:07,"Yes, a London Underground driver did the in-a-world voice for Independence Day, for Space Jam,"
00:11:07,00:11:15,"for Armageddon, for the Blair Witch Project, for Mr Bean's holiday. His career kind of"
00:11:15,00:11:20,"went a bit lower in the late 2000s. In fact, the last thing I could find on IMDB where he"
00:11:20,00:11:26,"did a Hollywood movie or a movie was... So he did the Blair Witch Project in 1999, but"
00:11:26,00:11:33,"then in 2010 he did the Blair Bitch Project, which was a very much a B movie, yeah, misogynistic,"
00:11:33,00:11:36,"starring Linda Blair of The Exorcist, the girl in The Exorcist."
00:11:36,00:11:41,"What a wormhole, Dan."
00:11:41,00:11:46,"I was reading about one more train driver who was Hannah Datz. Do you know about her,"
00:11:46,00:11:52,"Mandy? I bet you do. She was the first woman to become a tube driver, because what happened"
00:11:52,00:11:57,"was when the war happened, when both wars happened, they needed to bring new people"
00:11:57,00:12:02,"into the underground to do all the jobs, and loads of women started doing those jobs. And"
00:12:02,00:12:08,"in fact, when Made of Ale opened, it was staffed completely by women. But there was one job"
00:12:08,00:12:12,"that they basically didn't let women do all the way until the late 70s, and that was a"
00:12:12,00:12:14,tube driver for some reason.
00:12:14,00:12:19,"Which is weird, because it's not like you can get lost."
00:12:19,00:12:24,Men are always so unwilling to ask for directions on a train.
00:12:24,00:12:30,"All right, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:12:30,00:12:35,"My fact is that in 1992, Hoover ran a promotion which was so successful that the firm collapsed"
00:12:35,00:12:36,and had to be sold off.
00:12:36,00:12:39,What the heck happened?
00:12:39,00:12:44,"So they thought, this is the European Arm of Hoover we're talking about, and in 1992"
00:12:44,00:12:50,"they thought of this brilliant promotion, and it was this. If you spent 100 quid on"
00:12:50,00:12:56,"any Hoover product, you would get two free return flights to somewhere in Europe. And"
00:12:56,00:13:00,"that was very exciting, and they had worked out the maths of it. They thought people will"
00:13:00,00:13:05,"spend enough money on extra products, and there were hoops to jump through and things"
00:13:05,00:13:07,"like this. It sold a lot of hoovers, brilliant."
00:13:07,00:13:12,"And then, so that kind of gone all right, and then Hoover got a bit confident, and they"
00:13:12,00:13:16,"said, we're going to expand this deal and say, if you spend 100 quid on any Hoover"
00:13:16,00:13:22,"product, you will get two return flights to America. And they were advised by risk management"
00:13:22,00:13:27,"people not to do this, and they said, no, it's fine. People will spend so much on Hoover"
00:13:27,00:13:29,products that it will completely offset the cost.
00:13:29,00:13:34,"Unfortunately, they weren't reckoning on the British people who flocked to Hoover shops,"
00:13:34,00:13:39,"bought the absolute cheapest thing they could, which is about 120 quid, and then sent off"
00:13:39,00:13:47,"a 600 pounds worth of free flights. And it was such a disaster, 500,000 people applied"
00:13:47,00:13:48,for the promotion.
00:13:48,00:13:49,Oh my goodness.
00:13:49,00:13:55,"I know. And they weren't making much profit, even on the cheap vacuum cleaners that they"
00:13:55,00:13:59,"were selling at the time. They made about 30 quid profit on the vacuum cleaner, and then"
00:13:59,00:14:02,they had to spend 600 pounds on plane tickets.
00:14:02,00:14:05,"Amazing. I read that people were buying a vacuum cleaner, and they're just leaving"
00:14:05,00:14:10,it in the shop. And then they didn't need a vacuum cleaner.
00:14:10,00:14:16,"And Hoover started panicking, obviously, when they saw the numbers coming in. So they started"
00:14:16,00:14:19,being really finicky about the fine print. It was a really complicated procedure you
00:14:19,00:14:23,had to go through to get two return flights. But they started saying people hadn't filled
00:14:23,00:14:27,"in the forms, or they would offer you the flights, and you could accept them or say,"
00:14:27,00:14:29,"oh, I can't do that."
00:14:29,00:14:32,"So they started offering people flights from airports, which were hundreds of miles from"
00:14:32,00:14:38,where they lived. Or they would send out request forms on Christmas Eve in the hope that the
00:14:38,00:14:42,"post would be closed and people would miss the deadline to return them, because it was"
00:14:42,00:14:45,Christmas. They tried everything.
00:14:45,00:14:50,"Yeah, it's an astonishing, even, but the first promotion that they did where there was the"
00:14:50,00:14:56,"tickets to Europe, the complications of trying to actually be someone who actually receives"
00:14:56,00:14:59,it is extraordinary. They would send you a registration form. You had 14 days to fill
00:14:59,00:15:04,"it out, send it back. Then they sent you another form, which had three different destination"
00:15:04,00:15:09,airports and combinations and dates that you had to fill out and send back. Then that came
00:15:09,00:15:13,"back. If they rejected it and you had to pick three more, they made it as hard as possible,"
00:15:13,00:15:17,but it worked out for them the first time. The problem with the second time is they didn't
00:15:17,00:15:22,send anyone to America. They should have at least sent some in order to make it look like
00:15:22,00:15:27,"it was a genuine thing, but they just knocked it out so heavily that no one ended up going"
00:15:27,00:15:29,as far as I could see. And you look like people did.
00:15:29,00:15:33,"I don't think that's right. I think about 220,000 people got their flights."
00:15:33,00:15:34,Really?
00:15:34,00:15:37,"Both promotions. Yeah, it was absolutely huge."
00:15:37,00:15:40,"I know one person who, in fact, we all know one person who got one of the flights, and"
00:15:40,00:15:42,"that's Stephen K. Amos, the comedian."
00:15:42,00:15:43,Really?
00:15:43,00:15:48,"Yeah, and he says that it kind of started his career. When he was 19 years old, he got"
00:15:48,00:15:54,these tickets. He went to New York and he met a promoter called Delphine Manfield who
00:15:54,00:15:58,"said, ""Hey, you're a really funny guy. You should become a comedian."" And she set him"
00:15:58,00:16:02,"up in a show in London when he got back, and he said that was his big break."
00:16:02,00:16:07,So what happened to the Mandy? They obviously went bankrupt or what?
00:16:07,00:16:13,There was another problem. The company spent £50 million on airline tickets in the end.
00:16:13,00:16:17,The other problem was that so many people had bought hoovers that everyone now had a
00:16:17,00:16:21,"hoover, and people started selling them off cheaply in secondhand, which meant that no"
00:16:21,00:16:25,"one was going into shops and buying new hoovers because they were on every street corner,"
00:16:25,00:16:26,as far as I could tell.
00:16:26,00:16:30,"The Observer said, ""If left uncontrolled, Britain could soon be knee-deep in hoover"
00:16:30,00:16:35,"TurboMaster uprights."""
00:16:35,00:16:40,"I'll tell you the final thing that happened, but just one previous thing is that there"
00:16:40,00:16:44,"was a kidnapping or it's kind of slight kidnapping over this, which was that there was a hoover"
00:16:44,00:16:48,customer who bought a washing machine. That was his way of getting the free tickets.
00:16:48,00:16:53,"And a repairman from the firm came around to fix it, some little problem with it. And"
00:16:53,00:16:56,"the guy said, ""Yeah, I'm going to be getting these flights."" And the hoover repairman called"
00:16:56,00:17:01,"him an idiot for thinking he would get these flights. And this customer, it was called David"
00:17:01,00:17:06,"Dixon, he saw red, and he blocked in the hoover guy's repair van, and he held at hostage in"
00:17:06,00:17:10,his front drive for 13 days. He was a national hero.
00:17:10,00:17:15,"Oh, the temptation, the temptation."
00:17:15,00:17:20,"I know. I found one other promotion, which was by Tesco in 1997, and I'm pretty sure"
00:17:20,00:17:24,this is niche enough that it'll be news to all of you. This was a deal where if you bought
00:17:24,00:17:30,"three pounds of bananas, you would get 25 points on your Tesco club card, all right?"
00:17:30,00:17:31,And that was worth £1.25.
00:17:31,00:17:37,That's how I started my comedy career and the crew. I bought all those bananas and left
00:17:37,00:17:41,them on the street so people slipped on them and videoed them.
00:17:41,00:17:48,"You're still living off the you've been framed income, aren't you? £250 a time. No, so you'd"
00:17:48,00:17:52,"get these things. You'd get £1.25 on your card if you bought these bananas, and the"
00:17:52,00:17:58,"bananas, £3 at the time, only cost £1.17. And a heroic shopper, he's probably sell"
00:17:58,00:18:01,"out there some way, he's called Phil Kolcott. He said, ""I did a mental calculation and"
00:18:01,00:18:05,"it seems like you couldn't lose. Basically, they were paying shoppers eight pence to take"
00:18:05,00:18:14,"away three pounds of bananas."" So he spent £367 on 942 pounds of bananas and took them"
00:18:14,00:18:21,"away in his car. Had to make a few trips. He ended up with about 3,000 bananas and he"
00:18:21,00:18:25,just started giving them away. He got the local nickname Banana Man because he was just
00:18:25,00:18:31,constantly giving out bananas. He ended up making £25 and 12 pence in profit thanks to
00:18:31,00:18:32,the scheme.
00:18:32,00:18:37,"The thing is, can you be asked? That's the thing. Can you be bothered to go and do that"
00:18:37,00:18:40,is the real question. That's amazing.
00:18:40,00:18:43,"Phil, if you're out there, write in. We want to know. We want to hear from you."
00:18:43,00:18:46,"Yeah, we need to track these people down."
00:18:46,00:18:48,One or two things on Hoover's?
00:18:48,00:18:49,"Yeah, sure."
00:18:49,00:18:56,"Okay, so this is, I think of no interest to anyone but me, but I want to say it anyway,"
00:18:56,00:19:04,"which is that the lead singer of AC/DC, this guy called Brian Johnson, his final job before"
00:19:04,00:19:08,"getting the gig as the lead singer of AC/DC, the biggest heavy metal band in the world,"
00:19:08,00:19:13,"was a Hoover advert, was singing the jingle on a Hoover advert."
00:19:13,00:19:14,Really?
00:19:14,00:19:15,Yeah.
00:19:15,00:19:18,I don't think you're alone in finding that interesting. I love that. I love that very
00:19:18,00:19:19,much.
00:19:19,00:19:24,"In fact, he got the job because the previous singer, Bond Scott had died and he was auditioning,"
00:19:24,00:19:28,but he made the band wait. They were waiting in London for him to get to his callback and
00:19:28,00:19:32,he insisted on going off to record a Hoover jingle first. Then the very next thing he
00:19:32,00:19:36,"recorded after that was Back in Black, which was the second biggest album of all time."
00:19:36,00:19:37,Wow.
00:19:37,00:19:42,"I know, but on the way up, everybody's got to make a living, you know what I'm saying?"
00:19:42,00:19:46,But that's more extraordinary that I thought he had done the gig and that was on TV and
00:19:46,00:19:52,"then he went to this audition. He actually said to AC/DC, the most rock and roll band"
00:19:52,00:19:57,"at that time, sorry guys, I got to do a corporate gig before auditioning for the band."
00:19:57,00:20:01,"I think they were down in London saying, can you come by? And he said, yeah, I'll come"
00:20:01,00:20:03,"by in a bit, but I have this thing I've got to do first."
00:20:03,00:20:04,Yeah.
00:20:04,00:20:08,"We've all done adverts where you think, shame that that happened. Years ago, I did an advert"
00:20:08,00:20:14,"in Ireland for cottage cheese, which involved me being inside a giant pot of cottage cheese."
00:20:14,00:20:15,Wow.
00:20:15,00:20:19,"Yeah. So I'm just saying, I've never seen it, but it's out there somewhere."
00:20:19,00:20:25,"Wow. I mean, if anyone could find that video and send it to us, I would be very grateful."
00:20:25,00:20:33,"That's so funny. I want to hear more, Sandy. You were in the pot. Was there actual cottage"
00:20:33,00:20:34,cheese in the pot?
00:20:34,00:20:38,It was just before that people could do green screen and all these kind of technical tricks.
00:20:38,00:20:39,"Oh no, they didn't actually."
00:20:39,00:20:43,"They actually made this enormous pot. And I think they chose me because it seemed, you"
00:20:43,00:20:49,"know, like they didn't have to make such a big pot with me thing. And they were wonderful."
00:20:49,00:20:54,"It's just the most glorious people to work with. And I finished, we've worked all day."
00:20:54,00:20:59,I was in cottage cheese all day. And then I went back to the hotel early because I needed
00:20:59,00:21:03,"to get a flight first thing. And at about six o'clock in the morning, I got a call from"
00:21:03,00:21:07,"the director. So I just wanted to wish a good flight. I said, oh, thank you very much. That's"
00:21:07,00:21:11,"very sweet of you to get up at this time to wish me a good flight. Sure. No, we're all"
00:21:11,00:21:18,just going home now. So they'd been up partying around the cottage cheese for the entire night.
00:21:18,00:21:22,"Sorry, Sandy, can I just check what the conceit was of the effort? Was it that this pot you"
00:21:22,00:21:27,were in was normal size? Was there going to be a massive knife sort of diving in?
00:21:27,00:21:32,"I never saw it, darling. I feel really bad. I never saw it. I've done a few adverts in"
00:21:32,00:21:38,"my time. I did that and I did an advert for a Torah beef suet once, which I played a small"
00:21:38,00:21:39,girl.
00:21:39,00:21:45,I had to get into a giant pudding for that. Me and a Mel the Stones and lead school girls
00:21:45,00:21:51,"wanting to eat beef suet. That's so funny. Again, didn't get shown, I don't think."
00:21:51,00:21:57,"That's very good. Some more Hoover stuff, anyone?"
00:21:57,00:22:04,"Oh, sure. So the first upright Hoover or vacuum cleaner, you see, we call it Hoover in the"
00:22:04,00:22:08,"UK, right? But I think it's mostly because of this promotion, isn't it? Because so many"
00:22:08,00:22:14,"people own them because of this massive promotion, they were completely ubiquitous. And so that"
00:22:14,00:22:18,became the name for any vacuum cleaner. But the first one was invented by James Murray
00:22:18,00:22:26,Spangler in 1908. He had terrible asthma and he decided that the reason that it was is
00:22:26,00:22:31,because it was the carpet sweeping that he was doing. So he came up with a basic suction
00:22:31,00:22:37,"system. To start off with, he could only make two machines a week to sell because he was"
00:22:37,00:22:42,doing all the designing. His son was assembling them all and his daughter was assembling the
00:22:42,00:22:47,dust bags. And so it was like literally a cottage industry where that was all they could
00:22:47,00:22:52,"do two a week. And it was only when they sold it, I think to his brother-in-law, the company"
00:22:52,00:22:55,that they managed to put some money behind it and make loads of them.
00:22:55,00:22:59,And he was an inventor throughout his whole life. And this came very late in his career.
00:22:59,00:23:03,I think he'd just hit his sixties when he invented this Hoover. But after he sold it
00:23:03,00:23:09,"to the Hoover family, William Hoover, he worked as a superintendent for the company."
00:23:09,00:23:14,"So he stayed on working for them. And then finally, he decided he was going to go on"
00:23:14,00:23:18,his first ever holiday because he never had a holiday before. And he was going to go to
00:23:18,00:23:23,Florida and sadly he passed away the night before going on his first ever holiday.
00:23:23,00:23:24,Done.
00:23:24,00:23:25,Oh.
00:23:25,00:23:26,I know.
00:23:26,00:23:28,"The tragic thing was, thanks to inventing the Hoover, he was actually given two free"
00:23:28,00:23:29,flights.
00:23:29,00:23:30,Yes.
00:23:30,00:23:35,That's a very good thing. I always wanted to be an inventor. I just think it's a nice
00:23:35,00:23:38,"thing to say. Actually, this is what I had. What do you do for a living? I'm an inventor."
00:23:38,00:23:42,My great-grandfather was an inventor. His name was Field Tricket. And he worked with
00:23:42,00:23:43,...
00:23:43,00:23:44,Right name.
00:23:44,00:23:49,"He worked with the Sahara Maxim, I'm embarrassed to say, inventing the machine gun."
00:23:49,00:23:55,"But he was also, which links us back to an earlier conversation, he was the person who"
00:23:55,00:24:00,put electric light into the West End and he put the lighting into the Palace Theatre where
00:24:00,00:24:05,the River Fleet runs below and where I once worked in the Electric Department.
00:24:05,00:24:06,Wow.
00:24:06,00:24:09,"Hang on, you worked in the lighting. Was that nepotism? Did you get that gig?"
00:24:09,00:24:10,It was my great-grandfather.
00:24:10,00:24:15,"I don't know how I got the gig. I was too small to operate any of the lights. I had to, the"
00:24:15,00:24:19,"Chief Electrician, Chris Buddle, had to make a special box for me to stand on in order"
00:24:19,00:24:20,to make ...
00:24:20,00:24:22,"Well, also, you probably had cottage cheese till all over your hands."
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Oh, darling."
00:24:23,00:24:26,It was a complete disaster on the deck.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"Chris Buddle's a guy, Andy, that we know. A really nice guy."
00:24:28,00:24:33,"Yes, yes, you've named him before. Yep, thank you. Hi again, Chris. I feel like listening"
00:24:33,00:24:35,please write back.
00:24:35,00:24:43,"OK, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact. My fact this week is that after"
00:24:43,00:24:48,"he retired from dancing in his late 70s, Fred Astaire became a skateboarder."
00:24:48,00:24:50,It's just a classic ...
00:24:50,00:24:52,It's just wonderful.
00:24:52,00:24:53,Career shift.
00:24:53,00:24:54,So when you say became a skateboarder ...
00:24:54,00:24:55,Yeah.
00:24:55,00:25:01,"He didn't become a pro skateboarder. It's very hard to skateboard, but this is one of"
00:25:01,00:25:08,the most elegant dancers that we've ever committed to film. An extraordinary human whose whole
00:25:08,00:25:15,career was defined by his career largely with Ginger Rogers on screen. When he hit his late
00:25:15,00:25:19,"70s, he realized that the grace of his dancing wasn't going to keep up. So he thought, better"
00:25:19,00:25:23,"leave it on top. He could still act, so he thought, I'll continue on with that. But he"
00:25:23,00:25:28,retired from dancing and then he was hanging out with his grandkids when they introduced
00:25:28,00:25:33,him to the skateboard. And this is someone who danced on screen on roller skates. It's
00:25:33,00:25:38,someone who was an innovator of dance. And he saw this as another place to innovate dancing.
00:25:38,00:25:44,So he in his late 70s was reportedly doing handstands on his skateboard as he was going
00:25:44,00:25:51,across his tennis court. These are the reports. And he was just very good with it. He was
00:25:51,00:25:54,"very obsessed with it. If he went on the talk show, like the Merve Griffin show, he would"
00:25:54,00:25:58,talk about how incredible the skateboard was and his fascination that if he had discovered
00:25:58,00:26:03,"it years before, how he definitely would have brought that into the films that he was doing."
00:26:03,00:26:10,"But then unfortunately, one day he fell over and he ruined his wrist in the process and"
00:26:10,00:26:14,had to be in a cast for weeks on end. And that was the sort of end of his skateboarding
00:26:14,00:26:20,career. But he was made a member of the National Skateboard Society of America. He featured
00:26:20,00:26:24,in skateboard magazines. He pushed it as a sport. I think that counts as a skateboarder.
00:26:24,00:26:29,"Dan, I read that that he was given lifetime membership of the National Skateboard Society."
00:26:29,00:26:33,But I can't find what the National Skateboard Society is. There seems to be nothing online
00:26:33,00:26:36,or anything like that. I looked for it as well. I couldn't find any.
00:26:36,00:26:42,"So I went, I found an old article in the British newspaper archives. And it was from actually"
00:26:42,00:26:47,"the Irish Independent. And it was an interview with Averist there, who was Fred's daughter."
00:26:47,00:26:53,"And she said that after he broke his wrist, he got a plaque from the Skateboarding Association,"
00:26:53,00:26:57,"which definitely does exist, for highlighting how dangerous the sport can be without proper"
00:26:57,00:27:01,protection. So I wonder if that story's been slightly kind of bouldlerised.
00:27:01,00:27:09,"Yeah. Also, he got an award for being crap. That's not even a good award."
00:27:09,00:27:15,"I tell you, it is a very odd kind of six degrees of separation, but I know his daughter of"
00:27:15,00:27:21,a Irish woman. I'll ask her. I was hoping you'd have a Fred Astaire connection somewhere.
00:27:21,00:27:25,I was crossing my fingers. I thought she must do. I'm so glad.
00:27:25,00:27:30,"No, she's absolutely lovely. Cool. Yeah. She's a smashing person. I've had dinner with her"
00:27:30,00:27:34,"many times. So I will, I'll see you after I can ask her."
00:27:34,00:27:39,"But I mean, he was clearly, he was clearly somebody who was full of pep, as it were."
00:27:39,00:27:44,"Because when he was 81, he married a woman, Jockey, called Robin Smith. And she was 45"
00:27:44,00:27:49,"years younger than him. I mean, he, you know, and she's the one who looks pleased. You"
00:27:49,00:27:54,know what I mean? She's looking very thrilled in the photo. So he clearly didn't lack
00:27:54,00:27:59,"vim and vigor, shall we call it? Yeah. We should put together a list of questions"
00:27:59,00:28:05,"for you to ask his daughter, because I've got so many serious things. So one thing"
00:28:05,00:28:10,that I wanted to know about was that he was in an episode of Battlestar Galactica.
00:28:10,00:28:17,"Was he playing what? Just an alien. No, he was an alien. He was an alien that looked"
00:28:17,00:28:23,"like a man, as in, you know, he was a human shaped alien. But... Isn't everyone in Battlestar"
00:28:23,00:28:26,"Galactica an alien? Well, I've only seen the new series, not the original. But I just"
00:28:26,00:28:30,"find that insane that... Have you watched it, Dan? Have you watched it? I tried to find"
00:28:30,00:28:33,"it. No, I didn't find it in time. There are some clips on YouTube and you know how you"
00:28:33,00:28:38,"said he didn't dance anymore. Well, he is dancing in this episode of Battlestar Galactica,"
00:28:38,00:28:42,but he's just kind of swaying and moving his hands a little bit. So it's not really...
00:28:42,00:28:46,"Yeah. It's not tap dancing, if you know. No, but you're right. He came out of retirement"
00:28:46,00:28:52,from the dancing retirement in order to do one final dance to disco as an alien on Battlestar
00:28:52,00:28:58,"Galactica. Wow. And yeah, and I really want to see it. I'm glad it's online. And again,"
00:28:58,00:29:02,"it was because his grandchildren loved the show, right? And I think there was an interview"
00:29:02,00:29:07,"afterwards and he said it was the favourite thing that he did in his whole career, but"
00:29:07,00:29:10,only for the reason that it was something that his grandchildren really loved and were
00:29:10,00:29:17,"really proud of him. I did bake off for the same reason my kids liked him. For me, the"
00:29:17,00:29:22,most interesting thing is the success of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films is extraordinary.
00:29:22,00:29:26,So Top Hat and Follow the Fleet and The Gate of Orsay and Shall We Dance and so on. And
00:29:26,00:29:32,I discovered why they all seem so successful in such a... They're so beautifully shaped.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"It's because the director, Mark Sandrich, he did what he called ""minitage"" for each"
00:29:35,00:29:40,film. So he had this elaborate colour-coded chart and he detailed minute by minute everything
00:29:40,00:29:44,"that was going to happen in the film. So there would be a blue section for music, there'd"
00:29:44,00:29:47,"be a green section for singing, a red section for dancing and a yellow section for the novelty"
00:29:47,00:29:53,and speaking and so on. And he made all the films look roughly the same. So you would
00:29:53,00:29:58,have that much singing in that point in the film. You'd have that much dancing at that
00:29:58,00:30:02,"point in the film. And actually, if you look at the colour-coded charts, you can see them."
00:30:02,00:30:05,There's a book called the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers book and they reproduce a panel
00:30:05,00:30:09,from one of his colour-coded charts. You can see that he used... It's almost Mozart-like
00:30:09,00:30:15,in its mathematical calculation about what makes the perfect song and dance musical because
00:30:15,00:30:16,he'd worked it out.
00:30:16,00:30:17,"Wow, that's so interesting."
00:30:17,00:30:21,"So like the phrase to make a song and dance out of something, really, it should be, ""We've"
00:30:21,00:30:23,"done this then and then we did this."""
00:30:23,00:30:29,But you wouldn't expect it to be so prescriptive in a way.
00:30:29,00:30:34,"When you're writing your plays or books or whatever, Sandy, would you do similar kind"
00:30:34,00:30:37,of things to that? Would you try and have a...
00:30:37,00:30:41,Yeah. So I'm sitting in my office at the moment. I'm writing an opera with my sister. My sister
00:30:41,00:30:45,and I write musicals and stuff together. And we have different colour-coded notes depending
00:30:45,00:30:51,on whether it's a particular kind of song or whether it's a light moment or a big moment
00:30:51,00:30:55,"or not. And always our great moment, which we got to yesterday, is that we now know what"
00:30:55,00:30:58,the opening number is and we know what the closing number is. So we know how we begin
00:30:58,00:31:01,and we know how we end. And then all we've got to do now is fill in the bit of the middle
00:31:01,00:31:07,part. And that's all there is to it. I feel like Verdy had exactly the same technique.
00:31:07,00:31:10,Post-it notes all over his office.
00:31:10,00:31:15,"So one thing I did read is that when Astaire and Rogers were making these films, they had"
00:31:15,00:31:23,"to be adjusted in part because the films were almost too good. So every routine they did,"
00:31:23,00:31:28,"dancing, was followed by applause. Live cinema audiences would applaud for a little while"
00:31:28,00:31:34,after the dance ended. So the producers had to follow in the movie. They had to put in
00:31:34,00:31:39,some applause after the end of the dance or some laughter or something just to let the
00:31:39,00:31:42,atmosphere in the cinema calm down.
00:31:42,00:31:47,"You get those brilliant scenes with Edward Everett Horton doing, you know, just basically"
00:31:47,00:31:54,"doing a lot of silly, funny faces. And that's really a sort of cover to make sure that the"
00:31:54,00:31:58,audience has come back to the story. Not that the story was ever so complicated. It was
00:31:58,00:31:59,difficult to follow.
00:31:59,00:32:05,"Yeah. Ginger Rogers, a speaking sandy of your great-great-grandfather who was an inventor."
00:32:05,00:32:09,Ginger Rogers' great-great-grandfather discovered something as well. He was the person who discovered
00:32:09,00:32:11,Quinning for malaria.
00:32:11,00:32:12,Really?
00:32:12,00:32:13,Wow.
00:32:13,00:32:21,"He's called John S. Sappington, and he developed a sort of precursor to hydroxychloroquine,"
00:32:21,00:32:25,which is something we've been hearing a lot about from the President of the United States
00:32:25,00:32:26,of America.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"Yeah. Apparently, it shows stupidity."
00:32:28,00:32:33,"Well, it hasn't yet."
00:32:33,00:32:38,"Ginger Rogers, I mean, genius. And as she said herself, you know, I did all the same dances"
00:32:38,00:32:43,"as Fred, but I did it backwards and in high heels. And there is something in that that"
00:32:43,00:32:46,"was tougher for her, I think, than it was for him."
00:32:46,00:32:50,"There's a wonderful early film called Stage Door with her in it, and Lucille Ball and"
00:32:50,00:32:52,"Catherine Hepburn, have you guys seen it?"
00:32:52,00:32:53,No.
00:32:53,00:32:54,It's an all-black-and-white movie.
00:32:54,00:32:58,"And all of these incredible, it's a set in a boarding house of lots of young ingenues"
00:32:58,00:33:02,"who want to get into show business, but it is actually lots of women who became incredibly"
00:33:02,00:33:03,famous.
00:33:03,00:33:06,"And the thing about Ginger Rogers, but from being brilliant dancers, you can see what"
00:33:06,00:33:13,a phenomenal amount of comedy timing she had. She just was a comedic genius.
00:33:13,00:33:19,"I found out her first famous catchphrase, which I've never heard before. So the first"
00:33:19,00:33:25,"movie she was in was called Young Man of Manhattan. And she said the line in it, there's a line"
00:33:25,00:33:30,"where she says, ""Cigarette me, big boy."" And this became a popular catchphrase across"
00:33:30,00:33:31,America.
00:33:31,00:33:34,"""Cigarette me, big boy."""
00:33:34,00:33:36,"We should all take that on, then."
00:33:36,00:33:41,"I almost feel like taking up smoking. I've never taken up smoking in my whole life, but"
00:33:41,00:33:43,"just the chance to say, ""Cigarette me, big boy."""
00:33:43,00:33:51,"Yeah, I don't think vape me, big boy. It has quite the same effect."
00:33:51,00:33:55,Is it true that he didn't really want to pair up with Ginger Rogers at the start because
00:33:55,00:33:58,he'd had a duet with his sister?
00:33:58,00:34:05,"Yeah, his sister was his partner for many, many years, in the years when he did live"
00:34:05,00:34:10,"performances. And his original name, I think, is Austerlitz, not Astaire at all. I think"
00:34:10,00:34:18,it's Fred Austerlitz. But I think his sister married money and decided to give up show
00:34:18,00:34:23,"business. Dear God, that's such a good idea. I mean, I think anybody. I thought my wife"
00:34:23,00:34:28,"did have money, which is why I was on my way out. But what was she called? She was called"
00:34:28,00:34:31,"Adele, I think, Adele Astaire."
00:34:31,00:34:35,"One of the not charges, I mean, he was obviously pretty much the greatest dancer ever to live,"
00:34:35,00:34:41,but he was accused of being quite sexless or the dancers were not sensual in the way
00:34:41,00:34:45,"that maybe in his later career, when he was dancing with Sir Cheresy, they were a bit"
00:34:45,00:34:49,"sexier, actually. But when he was younger, they weren't. And that might be partly because"
00:34:49,00:34:53,he spent pretty much his entire early career dancing with his sister.
00:34:53,00:34:55,"Yeah, and that would have been a bad look, darling."
00:34:55,00:35:00,Yeah. And she was the one who was going to be successful. This is a really fascinating
00:35:00,00:35:06,"thing. But the first, one of the first dances they did was when he was about five years"
00:35:06,00:35:10,old when they were dancing together as a pair. And they did a bride and groom dance on top
00:35:10,00:35:12,of a wedding cake in the first half.
00:35:12,00:35:13,Wow.
00:35:13,00:35:16,"Yeah, it sounds amazing. And in the second half, he played a lobster."
00:35:16,00:35:17,Wow.
00:35:17,00:35:18,Yeah.
00:35:18,00:35:22,"Was that, was that a boarder bill thing, Andy, I think it was. Yeah."
00:35:22,00:35:27,I think it was called juvenile artists presenting an electric musical toe dancing novelty.
00:35:27,00:35:31,"It's not that, it's not exactly catchy, is it?"
00:35:31,00:35:36,"I don't often get professional jealousy, but I totally want to play a lobster."
00:35:36,00:35:39,"I think in this weather, we're all playing lobsters, aren't we?"
00:35:39,00:35:40,Dying.
00:35:40,00:35:47,"His first wife sounds pretty, pretty intimidating, actually. So this is, he, before he married"
00:35:47,00:35:51,"the jockey, he was, he married quite young and he and his first wife were together until"
00:35:51,00:35:53,1954.
00:35:53,00:35:58,"She died of cancer, unfortunately. They've been married 21 years and he absolutely adored"
00:35:58,00:35:59,her.
00:35:59,00:36:03,"Yeah, he was inconsolable and then did marry for years and years and years afterwards."
00:36:03,00:36:06,It was a proper love match.
00:36:06,00:36:10,"But she was very concerned about his leading ladies, I believe, and she would turn up at"
00:36:10,00:36:17,the side of the set and knit to make sure that there was no inappropriateness going on.
00:36:17,00:36:18,Wow.
00:36:18,00:36:20,"And I know, and this is the amazing thing is that Fredster and Ted Rogers, they made ten"
00:36:20,00:36:26,films together. They kissed once on screen and even that kiss had to be...
00:36:26,00:36:27,"It's behind a door, I think, that kiss."
00:36:27,00:36:28,"Oh, was it?"
00:36:28,00:36:31,"Yeah, so I think it's not even, you don't even really see anything."
00:36:31,00:36:35,"Because the thing I heard, oh, this, well, maybe, maybe there's one behind a door and"
00:36:35,00:36:41,"one on screen, I'm not sure. But the one that was on screen was extended in slow-mo to make"
00:36:41,00:36:46,it seem longer than it actually had been. So it's a pretty brief peck. And they did
00:36:46,00:36:50,"have one scene in bed, but for that they used a dummy instead of a real woman."
00:36:50,00:36:51,Is that a Ginger Rogers?
00:36:51,00:36:54,I like the idea of the wife knitting like the women at the guillotine.
00:36:54,00:36:58,I was just going to say the same thing. It's like the intimidating knitters of history.
00:36:58,00:37:03,"There is something quite intimidating about someone just sat there knitting, isn't there?"
00:37:03,00:37:04,"Yeah, definitely."
00:37:04,00:37:07,"And if Ginger Rogers comes on with a low cut dress, she goes, ""I've knitted you a cardigan,"
00:37:07,00:37:08,"darling."""
00:37:08,00:37:13,"Yes, here's a little belero for you."
00:37:13,00:37:20,"I was reading about some other dancers, actually. National Tap Dancing Day is May the 25th."
00:37:20,00:37:24,And who hasn't celebrated that?
00:37:24,00:37:29,Well it was designated that date because it was the birthday of Bill Robinson. And Bill
00:37:29,00:37:30,Robinson is a very --
00:37:30,00:37:31,Is that Bill Bojangles?
00:37:31,00:37:37,"Bojangles, exactly, yeah. He was the highest paid black American entertainer in America"
00:37:37,00:37:42,during the first half of the 20th century. One year he did 400 charity events in a single
00:37:42,00:37:48,"year. This guy was absolutely amazing. And whenever he did a show, he needed to get publicity"
00:37:48,00:37:53,for it. There was no TV in those days. How do you get publicity? He would run backwards
00:37:53,00:37:59,and have races running backwards against local athletes. Because apparently he held the world
00:37:59,00:38:04,"record for running backwards, which was 100 yards in 13.5 seconds."
00:38:04,00:38:05,Wow.
00:38:05,00:38:06,That's pretty good.
00:38:06,00:38:09,I wonder who holds it now. We should surely meet this person. We need to find that out.
00:38:09,00:38:13,"I think there would be. I think it is a Guinness World Record thing. But that's -- I mean,"
00:38:13,00:38:17,13.5 seconds for 100 yards is certainly faster than I've ever run that distance forwards
00:38:17,00:38:20,"in my entire life. Even when I was a young man, I couldn't do that."
00:38:20,00:38:25,I haven't covered it that fast in a car.
00:38:25,00:38:30,"There was another dancer who -- the name caught my eye, which was Ann Miller, obviously,"
00:38:30,00:38:38,"our colleague, Ann Miller. And she was incredible. She could dance 500 taps in a minute when"
00:38:38,00:38:43,she was tap dancing. That's what she claimed. No one doubted her. 500 taps in a minute.
00:38:43,00:38:44,And she was --
00:38:44,00:38:45,Stunning.
00:38:45,00:38:46,"Yeah. Oh, so you know about her, Sandy?"
00:38:46,00:38:50,"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm a big musical theater buff."
00:38:50,00:38:54,"But what I like about Ann Miller is when she was very young, she suffered from rickets."
00:38:54,00:38:59,And she had to have her legs strengthened as a child. And that seems to have been what
00:38:59,00:39:03,made her a brilliant dancer as she got older. And there's a lot of other people like that.
00:39:03,00:39:07,"Like, there's a soccer player called Garincha, a Brazilian who had rickets as a child and"
00:39:07,00:39:11,"then strengthened his legs. And it made him a great player. And last week, we talked about"
00:39:11,00:39:13,Annette Kellerman. Do you remember the swimmer?
00:39:13,00:39:15,"Yes, the Australian swimmer."
00:39:15,00:39:20,"Yeah, exactly. And she was exactly the same. She had this problem as a child, very weak"
00:39:20,00:39:23,"legs, but they really strengthened them. And it made her a brilliant swimmer when she"
00:39:23,00:39:24,got older.
00:39:24,00:39:27,"She got into trouble, didn't she, for wearing a one-piece swimsuit, which I was thought"
00:39:27,00:39:28,of.
00:39:28,00:39:29,"Exactly. Yeah, she invented that."
00:39:29,00:39:30,Very naughty.
00:39:30,00:39:34,"But Ann Miller as well, she was quite tall. And she once danced with Fred Astaire. And"
00:39:34,00:39:38,she had to wear ballet slippers so that she wasn't taller than him.
00:39:38,00:39:43,Should have danced with me. It would have been all right.
00:39:43,00:39:50,"I have a link fact, which is that Fred Astaire, ten years after his death, appeared in an"
00:39:50,00:39:51,advert for a vacuum cleaner.
00:39:51,00:39:52,No.
00:39:52,00:39:56,That's very good. Dancing with the vacuum cleaner?
00:39:56,00:40:01,"Yes, because, as you'll know, there's a bit where he's dancing with a mop in one of his"
00:40:01,00:40:02,films.
00:40:02,00:40:09,And I think they CGI'd it. I think this would have been the '90s. They CGI'd it so he was
00:40:09,00:40:14,"dancing with a vacuum cleaner instead. And his widow, his second wife, Robin, the jockey,"
00:40:14,00:40:19,"she said it was artistically suitable to use the vacuum cleaners as props. But his daughter,"
00:40:19,00:40:24,"Ava, was so angry about him being used in an ad without his permission, obviously, because"
00:40:24,00:40:29,he was dead. She returned her devil vacuum cleaner to the firm.
00:40:29,00:40:34,"Well, that's told them. I'm not surprised. I am surprised that it happened at all. I'm"
00:40:34,00:40:37,not surprised his daughter was angry because one of the things he left very strict instructions
00:40:37,00:40:42,about was that he was never to be portrayed after his death. He didn't want his life story
00:40:42,00:40:49,"done. He didn't want anybody to do his autobiography on film, as it were, or portray him in any"
00:40:49,00:40:54,way. So I suspect she wouldn't have been thrilled with that because actually it's a great story.
00:40:54,00:40:58,"Him coming up, huffing through vaudeville and working with his sister and coming to Hollywood"
00:40:58,00:41:02,"and making it and so on and working with George's. It seems like a natural biopic, but apparently"
00:41:02,00:41:06,he left incredibly strict instructions saying that the estate would never give permission.
00:41:06,00:41:11,But he didn't mention vacuum cleaner either. Never mentioned the slutty Hoover.
00:41:11,00:41:18,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:41:18,00:41:23,"OK, my fact this week is that the Icelandic word for museum is the same as the word for"
00:41:23,00:41:24,a flock of sheep.
00:41:24,00:41:31,"I love this fact. Yes, me too. I think it's so Icelandic. It's got two of the most Icelandic"
00:41:31,00:41:37,things which is sheep and museums because they have so many museums in Iceland. They
00:41:37,00:41:42,"have about 300, which is one for every a thousand people, just about, which is proportionally"
00:41:42,00:41:48,25 times more common in Iceland than they are in Britain. So this is from a book by
00:41:48,00:41:53,"someone called A Kendra Green, which is called the Museum of Wales You Will Never See, and"
00:41:53,00:41:59,it's all about these museums in Iceland. And the word is Safan. I'm sure I'm pronouncing
00:41:59,00:42:04,"that wrong. It's S-A-F-N. And that comes from Safna, which is an old Norse word meaning"
00:42:04,00:42:09,"to collect or assemble. So it was a collection of things, became a museum and also a collection"
00:42:09,00:42:13,of sheep. Like a flock of sheep became that word as well.
00:42:13,00:42:17,"And there's a similar word in English, which comes from the same root from thousands and"
00:42:17,00:42:22,"thousands of years ago. And that is the root Sam, which is where we get the word same or"
00:42:22,00:42:28,"similar. And the Russian togyasamoye, which means the same. It's like all these words"
00:42:28,00:42:31,all come from the same original roots from thousands and thousands of years ago.
00:42:31,00:42:33,What did you say? S-A-F-N? Did you say?
00:42:33,00:42:41,"S-A-F-N in Icelandic. Yeah, so S-A-V-N in Danish sound means to save, means to save things"
00:42:41,00:42:42,together.
00:42:42,00:42:49,"Exactly. And then this word also Samma became Hammer in Greek, in ancient Greek. And that's"
00:42:49,00:42:55,"where we get words like homeopathy, homosexual, meaning the same, you know, things, a homeopathy,"
00:42:55,00:42:58,"it's where the same thing cures, the same thing, and like that."
00:42:58,00:43:02,"But it's the same with the actual word, isn't it? Because it's a homograph. It's a, it's"
00:43:02,00:43:06,"a, you know, it's the similar, spelt the same, but it means two completely different."
00:43:06,00:43:11,"So really interesting stuff about etymology of words, which is what I love. But really,"
00:43:11,00:43:15,I just want to talk about the amazing museums in Iceland because I've just been there.
00:43:15,00:43:20,"You've just been there, yeah. You just had a week there. What I did on my holidays section"
00:43:20,00:43:21,of the podcast.
00:43:21,00:43:24,I'm looking forward to doing all this.
00:43:24,00:43:29,Listen to everything James says now to be tax deductible in the course of this chat.
00:43:29,00:43:32,"So, James, which museums did you see?"
00:43:32,00:43:37,"Well, I mean, everyone's going to expect me to say the Penis Museum in Reykjavik, which"
00:43:37,00:43:43,"of course I did go to, which, I mean, it's brilliant. It really is a good museum. There's"
00:43:43,00:43:48,so many interesting things there. And it was started by this guy who acquired his first
00:43:48,00:43:55,"penis in 1970. Well, a second penis, but it's, I was going to go for number two there."
00:43:55,00:43:56,He acquired it.
00:43:56,00:43:59,He must have been so thrilled for the day he acquired his first penis.
00:43:59,00:44:03,I should start a museum.
00:44:03,00:44:05,It's like a clip on thing.
00:44:05,00:44:10,"Yeah, it's like this is a potato head you have to look up."
00:44:10,00:44:15,"The curator, speaking of clip-ons, the curator does have a bow tie made from a sperm whale's"
00:44:15,00:44:21,"penis, which he wears for the Christmas party every year, which is on display. But he acquired"
00:44:21,00:44:27,"his first or second penis in 1974 when he got a bull's pizzle, which was being used"
00:44:27,00:44:34,by a local teacher as a blackboard pointer. And then that was handed to him and he later
00:44:34,00:44:36,"on a few years later thought, you know what, I could turn this into a collection."
00:44:36,00:44:42,"Is that not a kind of child abuse, to point things out with a penis?"
00:44:42,00:44:45,"Depends on what lesson it is, I guess."
00:44:45,00:44:49,"So, James, I read that people started giving him more as a kind of joke. Once he had the"
00:44:49,00:44:53,"bull's one, sort of, you know, if someone's into something, you always give them a tourist"
00:44:53,00:44:58,"bit of that. And then he got sort of almost every mammal in Iceland. And he thought, actually,"
00:44:58,00:44:59,this is a proper collection now.
00:44:59,00:45:05,"Yeah, a bit like collecting like football cards or football stickers. He wanted to get"
00:45:05,00:45:09,"them all. Oh, Pokemon. He wanted to collect all of them. So it was like, OK, well, we"
00:45:09,00:45:14,know all of these animals in Iceland. I need one penis from every male animal. It's like
00:45:14,00:45:18,the Noah of Iceland.
00:45:18,00:45:24,"That's a weird calling from God. Two of every animal. Actually, just one of every animal."
00:45:24,00:45:28,Actually just the penis of every animal.
00:45:28,00:45:36,"And they have the penises of the 2008 Icelandic National Handball Team, which are not the"
00:45:36,00:45:37,actual ones. Sorry.
00:45:37,00:45:40,But they're not the actual ones. They're silver replicants.
00:45:40,00:45:41,Caster casts.
00:45:41,00:45:44,They're silver casts because they won silver medal in that game.
00:45:44,00:45:45,Ow!
00:45:45,00:45:49,"God, what a relief. He must have been hugely relieved they didn't take gold, because the"
00:45:49,00:45:50,cost would have been exorbitant.
00:45:50,00:45:54,"Never mind that. What about the molten metal on you, to put it into the picture?"
00:45:54,00:46:01,"It's like goldfinger, isn't it, where they cover that lady in gold all the way through."
00:46:01,00:46:05,"They probably threw the match going, we can't win gold."
00:46:05,00:46:12,"Have I remembered incorrectly, guys, but in parts of the Arctic, when people made wooden"
00:46:12,00:46:18,"huts, they sometimes used to make windows out of stretched foreskins. Is that right,"
00:46:18,00:46:19,or have I made that up?
00:46:19,00:46:20,"No, I think you are right."
00:46:20,00:46:21,"Thank you, right, yeah."
00:46:21,00:46:27,"Obviously, it's going to be a walrus foreskin, if you're going to make a window."
00:46:27,00:46:31,"Sorry, the windows are so tiny."
00:46:31,00:46:37,They've been those mullion sort of diamond shaped windows you get in old houses.
00:46:37,00:46:41,It really worries me that that's in my head somewhere.
00:46:41,00:46:44,"You guys are too young to remember play school, where they used to look through a different"
00:46:44,00:47:00,window every day. The other things he has in his museum are penises from various animals
00:47:00,00:47:05,"in folklore. So they have an elf penis, a troll penis, and the testicles of a corpse"
00:47:05,00:47:11,"eating ghoul cat. And again, what it is, it's like locals just give him these things and"
00:47:11,00:47:15,"say, I'm pretty sure this is the testicles of a ghost eating ghoul cat."
00:47:15,00:47:18,"Yeah, then they go home and sob with laughter."
00:47:18,00:47:23,"Did he not go, sorry, the testicle museum's down the road, we only need some penises."
00:47:23,00:47:28,"Actually, the testicle museum, Dan, is on either side of the penis museum."
00:47:28,00:47:35,"Well, we do have a vagina museum, don't we, in London, in London, the vagina museum, which"
00:47:35,00:47:40,"was started by someone we all know, someone the elves know anyway, Florence, who worked"
00:47:40,00:47:44,"with us for a little while. But, yeah, they're, I think they're closed at the moment due"
00:47:44,00:47:49,"to COVID, but they're still doing events online. So it's worth searching Twitter for"
00:47:49,00:47:53,"the vagina museum and following those guys, for sure."
00:47:53,00:47:59,Worrying about what the opening hours are for the vagina.
00:47:59,00:48:04,Not something that had occurred to me until this moment.
00:48:04,00:48:10,"I've always thought they'll open if you're that keen, you know what I mean?"
00:48:10,00:48:13,"You have to buy them a drink first, that's it."
00:48:13,00:48:15,Obviously.
00:48:15,00:48:17,Did you swim in the Blue Lagoon?
00:48:17,00:48:18,"Yeah, we went to the Blue Lagoon."
00:48:18,00:48:19,It was great.
00:48:19,00:48:20,What's that?
00:48:20,00:48:28,"It's a hot water kind of spa area, because obviously Iceland, the land of ice and fire,"
00:48:28,00:48:33,"they have a lot of geysers and hot water and stuff like that. So, yeah, it was really good."
00:48:33,00:48:40,"It's amazing. It has a sort of sulfur coating on the bottom of the pool, which is white"
00:48:40,00:48:45,and people cover themselves all over. But I've been there when it's deep snow and you
00:48:45,00:48:50,have to run through the snow to get into the Blue Lagoon. But then there's all this steam
00:48:50,00:48:53,and you're covering yourself in this kind of weight. It's supposed to be incredibly
00:48:53,00:48:58,"good for you, but it's a very surreal experience to be in a swimsuit in the freezing cold."
00:48:58,00:49:05,"Yeah, I had a couple of facials of the local mud and stuff. And I'm quite surprised you"
00:49:05,00:49:08,guys haven't noticed how young my skin looks.
00:49:08,00:49:10,"It's just the quality of the Zoom, James."
00:49:10,00:49:18,"All right. I hardly recognise you. I'm honest with you. But those geysers, what it means"
00:49:18,00:49:22,"is that, for example, the whole town of Reykjavik, nobody pays for central heating, even though"
00:49:22,00:49:26,"you are talking about one of the coldest countries in the world, because there's enough natural"
00:49:26,00:49:34,"heat underground, which they have transferred into domestic heating. So you can have it"
00:49:34,00:49:38,"as hot as you like, even though it's freezing cold outside, which is absolutely fantastic."
00:49:38,00:49:42,"And there are restaurants where they cook, they have deep pits outside the restaurant"
00:49:42,00:49:49,"and the pits, they put the pots down into the steaming heat down into the ground and"
00:49:49,00:49:52,cook it and then bring it back up again. So they're even using it for cooking.
00:49:52,00:49:58,It's so cool. That's wonderful. It's a fantastic country. I really need to go. I really want
00:49:58,00:50:01,"to visit. James, did you go to this while you're there? It's not in Reykjavik, but the"
00:50:01,00:50:07,"Museum of Sorcery and Witchcraft? Unfortunately, we got stuck behind a landslide, which meant"
00:50:07,00:50:11,"that we lost half a day, which meant that we couldn't go. But I have always wanted to"
00:50:11,00:50:16,go there because I want to see the necropants. The necropants. They sound incredible. The
00:50:16,00:50:20,"necropads. So from the 17th century, they are a pair of trousers that are made of human"
00:50:20,00:50:27,"skin, of human corpse. Yeah. And they were supposedly used by, you'd have to have permission"
00:50:27,00:50:32,from a dead man to skin him afterwards and use his skin as the trousers. And then the
00:50:32,00:50:37,idea is that they were a money making device. They would provide money out of the trousers
00:50:37,00:50:42,"for you to become rich. So you had to, in order to access the money, get a coin from"
00:50:42,00:50:48,"a widow and put it in the front of the trousers. But from then on in, it sort of produces more"
00:50:48,00:50:52,and more coins. It's astonishing. I don't know if it really worked.
00:50:52,00:50:56,"You've got to match yourself up with a friend who's going to be the right size. I mean,"
00:50:56,00:51:02,"if you're a big fat guy, you don't want a dead skinny guy to make trousers out of."
00:51:02,00:51:05,That's true. And if you're meeting someone as a friend for the first time and they're
00:51:05,00:51:13,"kind of looking at your legs going, size in you up. But it's a curious thing because"
00:51:13,00:51:17,"traditionally witches around the world, if you think about the Pendle Witches in this"
00:51:17,00:51:21,"country and you think about the Salem Witches in the United States, it's traditionally"
00:51:21,00:51:26,"it's been women, but I believe the Icelandic witches are predominantly male."
00:51:26,00:51:31,"That's right. Only one of all the, there were 21 Icelanders who were burnt alive for being"
00:51:31,00:51:35,witches in the 17th century and only one was a woman.
00:51:35,00:51:36,Wow.
00:51:36,00:51:37,That's unusual.
00:51:37,00:51:38,That's unusual.
00:51:38,00:51:40,A blow for equality there.
00:51:40,00:51:43,"I know, right? Finally."
00:51:43,00:51:50,"The first person to be executed for witchcraft was guy called John Johnson, who admitted"
00:51:50,00:51:53,having used farting runes against a girl.
00:51:53,00:51:54,Sorry?
00:51:54,00:51:55,Farting.
00:51:55,00:52:00,"Farting runes. So you kind of toss them and they, they, they do a bit of magic and then"
00:52:00,00:52:02,someone just starts farting all the time.
00:52:02,00:52:04,"Oh, so you call someone to fart."
00:52:04,00:52:07,"Yeah, it's like a curse or a magic spell."
00:52:07,00:52:08,Death by farting.
00:52:08,00:52:09,Wow.
00:52:09,00:52:17,"Is it okay, James, to suggest I feel you've lowered the tone with your penises in your"
00:52:17,00:52:18,farting?
00:52:18,00:52:19,I'm just going to say I'm just going to.
00:52:19,00:52:20,I think you might be right.
00:52:20,00:52:26,We had quite erudite conversations about underground rivers and.
00:52:26,00:52:31,I saw a quite a fun thing that Iceland's doing at the moment as a sort of global mental
00:52:31,00:52:38,"health incentive and it's that the tourist board has made it so that all of us, all four"
00:52:38,00:52:44,"of us here, anyone listening over the world can go to a website and scream at it as loud"
00:52:44,00:52:49,as we want and they will play your scream in one of seven locations in Iceland at the
00:52:49,00:52:54,"moment where they've parked these giant speakers into these vast empty quarters, either looking"
00:52:54,00:53:00,"out to the ocean or inland and you just, it's, it's a primal scream thing where they"
00:53:00,00:53:05,just want you to vent all this pented up anxiety and depression from the lockdown period out
00:53:05,00:53:10,onto their website and they'll bung it out into the open airs of Iceland.
00:53:10,00:53:13,"And that's a thing that if you go to their website, you can actually just record that"
00:53:13,00:53:15,scream and have it played out there.
00:53:15,00:53:20,"I think a few of the locals aren't that sure about the shouting thing though Dan, because"
00:53:20,00:53:24,let's say you have some nice puffin sort of living around the speaker and they're just
00:53:24,00:53:26,hearing people yelling into them.
00:53:26,00:53:32,"I was, I went to this lagoon, it's called the iceberg lagoon and the glacier, the biggest"
00:53:32,00:53:36,place you're in Europe kind of comes to the edge of the sea and bits of it break off and
00:53:36,00:53:40,"you see these icebergs on the water, it's quite amazing."
00:53:40,00:53:44,"But a few years ago, do you remember there was a Bond movie where they drove cars on"
00:53:44,00:53:45,ice.
00:53:45,00:53:48,"I can't remember, is it Tomorrow Never Dies or something like that?"
00:53:48,00:53:49,It's Die Another Day.
00:53:49,00:53:52,"It's one of the really bad, it's the last Brosnan one."
00:53:52,00:53:54,I think it's the Madonna Die Another Day.
00:53:54,00:53:55,It's a real stinker.
00:53:55,00:54:01,"So they filmed that on that lagoon, but to do so they needed it to be quite thick ice"
00:54:01,00:54:06,and so they dammed the lagoon so no seawater could go there and it froze to like about
00:54:06,00:54:09,six feet deep or maybe even deeper.
00:54:09,00:54:13,"And I was talking to the guy who was showing us around, I said, was that not quite bad for"
00:54:13,00:54:15,"the animals, the seals and birds that live here?"
00:54:15,00:54:18,"He's like, yeah, yeah, that was pretty bad."
00:54:18,00:54:23,"And apparently it used to be owned, privately owned that area and they dammed it off and"
00:54:23,00:54:27,"so they could film this and then as soon as that happened, the government went, we're"
00:54:27,00:54:30,going to have to buy this off you because we can't be having this kind of thing happening
00:54:30,00:54:34,in our country and killing all our animals just so you could get a good scene in a bad
00:54:34,00:54:35,movie.
00:54:35,00:54:36,Yeah.
00:54:36,00:54:37,Yeah.
00:54:37,00:54:41,"Not one seals life is worth giving up for the film, Die Another Day."
00:54:41,00:54:43,I think we can all agree with that.
00:54:43,00:54:48,"I mean, I'd have that on a t-shirt, that's right."
00:54:48,00:54:54,"OK, that is it."
00:54:54,00:54:55,That is all of our facts.
00:54:55,00:54:57,Thank you so much for listening.
00:54:57,00:55:00,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over

00:55:28,00:55:33,"Do say hi to Sandy on Twitter, and we will be back again next week with another episode."
