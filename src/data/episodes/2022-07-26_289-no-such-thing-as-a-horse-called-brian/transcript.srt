 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,520
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,880
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Aniches enski, Andrew Hunter Murray and

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,120
 James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,640
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go, starting with you, James.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,080
 Okay my fact this week is that using too much red lipstick can make your urine turn red.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,920
 That's weird so it gets into your kidney somehow.

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
 Yeah, I reckon.

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
 How do you wear lipstick?

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,680
 I must have worn it wrong before at times I've worn it, not wearing it on the outside,

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
 are you?

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,440
 I screwed it up, you put it on your tongue didn't you?

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:04,000
 So I found this on the website of improbable research our friends who also make the Ig Nobel

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,080
 Prizes and this was a case for 28 year old woman who turned up at a nephrology clinic with

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,800
 a five day history of passing red colored urine but she didn't have any other symptoms,

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,240
 she had no pain, she didn't have chills, she didn't have anything else that could have

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,120
 caused this like blood in your urine for instance and the doctor said that the only noticeable

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,920
 feature was her bright red lipstick, which I think is a bit harsh actually, I'm sure she

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,480
 had lots of other great features but anyway they tested all the other things like her liver

20
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,100
 function and her blood counts and everything like that and they found out that she would

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,120
 apply her lipstick 20 to 25 times a day and they worked out that it was the lipstick that

22
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,160
 was causing the urine to turn red.

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,120
 It kind of makes sense because like lots of things can make your urine turn colors like

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,660
 lots of food so if she's accidentally ingesting this stuff then it could happen.

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,000
 So that's an abnormal number of times to reapply lipstick over the course of the day?

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,200
 It's certainly more than I've ever done.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 Wow.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,920
 It's weird because just the idea that it's like say beetroot not known to color your urine

29
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,200
 I don't think so much as the back passage when you go to the toilet.

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,000
 No, it doesn't pass.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 What?

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,720
 It's more commonly known to color your urine, yeah it is.

33
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,720
 So discreet the way you said back passage.

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,920
 It doesn't color your back passage, although it might do.

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
 No.

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
 It's more like the thing that comes out of your back passage.

37
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
 I mean it's a bit of a stain on me.

38
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,960
 How have you been eating it?

39
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,440
 Have you been having the beetroot supposed to trees again?

40
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
 Exactly.

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
 I've been smuggling.

42
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
 Do you get that then?

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
 Yeah, I do.

44
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,800
 Yeah, I've stopped eating beetroot off the back of that.

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,440
 I found it too scary to look down to a blood bath in my toilet.

46
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,040
 But you are quite special.

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,880
 So it's only like maximum 14% of people who get any kind of coloration from beetroot.

48
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,880
 So it's quite lucky to have it.

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
 Lucky you.

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,040
 And what percentage is through the ages?

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,720
 We should say in case people start to panic at home, it does also come in the poo.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,560
 It comes back at both sides.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
 Oh okay.

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,280
 But it's, yeah and it's called beeturia, the condition and it's harmless but if you suddenly

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,000
 start doing it and you've never done it before.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,880
 So if suddenly you beetroot, you're wee red or you poo red and it hasn't happened before,

57
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,760
 then you should get checked out because it might be an iron deficiency because the reason

58
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,840
 that most of us don't have red wee when we eat beetroot is because the iron reacts with

59
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,600
 the red pigment which is called better lane.

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,120
 So any iron in our stomach reacts with that and so that creates a different compound

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,360
 which isn't red.

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,320
 And so you might be iron deficient if you're not doing that.

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,480
 That's interesting because you I know and also I don't like beetroot.

64
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,640
 I never eat it and I love it.

65
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,000
 So if I ever have iron deficiency, I'm going to be one of the first to know about it.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,200
 You are one of the first people on earth.

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,000
 We could be an even guy to might be.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,720
 Yeah exactly, but you would never know right?

69
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
 Yeah.

70
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,520
 Maybe this is why I faint 15 times.

71
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,600
 And it's only some lipsticks I think that can do it and it just happened that this lady

72
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,280
 was doing it because apparently most of them dissolve in fats and so once, even if you

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,880
 apply certain lipsticks lots of times a day, you might be alright.

74
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,440
 We won't turn red but this will.

75
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,280
 When we go on tar, we ask people to send their own fats and one of the most common ones

76
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,280
 that I get is that if you want to choose the perfect shade of nude lipstick that looks

77
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,480
 natural, then you should get the color that is the same color as your nipples.

78
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
 Oh.

79
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,480
 This is an unbelievably common fact that I get said.

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,320
 It's so weird that it's one of the few that I get like five or six times every tar.

81
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
 Wow.

82
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,280
 It's because you keep wearing lipstick that really clashes with the rest of your face because

83
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:53,080
 I do the tar topless because I think he's got green nipples.

84
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,440
 And this apparently is kind of half true.

85
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,920
 So it came from, most people got it from a show called The Doctors on NBC.

86
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,120
 They famously mentioned this and they say that it generally does work.

87
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,200
 But then Washington University Medical Centre when asked about this did point out that your

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,720
 nipple color does change throughout your life.

89
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,120
 So it's kind of an average works, but if your nipples have changed color recently, then

90
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
 maybe...

91
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
 Yeah.

92
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
 Well, they go gray, don't they?

93
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
 You age.

94
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
 I have.

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
 That's right.

96
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,440
 Yeah, and you should wear gray lipstick too.

97
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
 Yeah, absolutely.

98
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,400
 So wait, should you take an average of your lifetime nipple color and always use that lipstick

99
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,000
 or should you have your lipstick vary in accordance with your nipple color?

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,680
 I think you should go into the lipstick shop.

101
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
 Yeah.

102
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,360
 And if you have a color of your nipples, then if it doesn't look right...

103
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,720
 I've tried that, but whenever I expose myself in lipstick shops, I get removed from the building.

104
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,120
 What you need is a top that only exposes your nipple so you can subtly compare the lipstick

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
 color to the nipple color.

106
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,680
 I don't know how subtle that kind of top is going to be.

107
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
 I've just got a thing, just as we were talking about beetroot before, because beetroot

108
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,920
 was actually a substitute for lipstick during the war, during the Second World War.

109
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,880
 Yeah, so there was a big push that the English government did, which they had a slogan

110
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,320
 for, which was "Beauty is duty."

111
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,160
 And this was a thing because Hitler supposedly really disapproved of makeup.

112
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,920
 So the British government wanted to make it a proud thing in the country.

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
 And they released...

114
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,360
 There were certain lipsticks that were released during World War II that were called like

115
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,560
 "Regimental Red" or "Lips in Uniform."

116
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,880
 But this was before rationing became, you know, the materials were sort of depleting.

117
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
 And so they stopped doing it.

118
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,480
 But as a result, women still wanted to sort of keep up the appearance of makeup.

119
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,080
 So beetroot juice was done in place of lipstick, and mascara and so on, and boot polish was

120
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,400
 used as well as...

121
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,560
 But yeah, it was interesting, you know, beetroot juice.

122
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,520
 Yeah, didn't know I Hitler didn't like lipstick.

123
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
 No.

124
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
 Excuse the vegetarian.

125
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,520
 He said that lipstick was evil because it was made from animal fat, rescued from sewage.

126
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,880
 Ah, so wait a minute.

127
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,320
 But it is kind of made with animal products, a lot of makeup, right?

128
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,240
 Yes, it is much less than used to be, but yes.

129
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,760
 But the red in lipstick for centuries has come from these bugs, cochineal, yeah.

130
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
 Cochineal, yeah.

131
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
 Cochineal, yeah.

132
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,760
 I think now they often make plant-based.

133
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
 But yeah.

134
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,720
 But in Hitler's time, they didn't use cochineal law.

135
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,760
 I think maybe some times they did.

136
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,760
 Not necessarily rescued from sewage, though.

137
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
 They would have definitely.

138
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,840
 But it's had this weird history lipstick where it's just gone in and out of fashion and

139
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
 popularity.

140
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,960
 And it's been condemned and then praised and then condemned and then praised.

141
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,000
 And so just before the Elizabethan period, it was basically evil.

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,400
 So Catholic priests would say that, you know, a woman wearing lipstick was essentially

143
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,880
 the spawn of Satan.

144
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,800
 You'd have to go to confession and confess that you'd worn lipstick.

145
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,720
 And it was, I was thought as being deceitful, so you were deceiving men into falling in love

146
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
 with you.

147
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,200
 And you could, it was grounds for a nulment, for instance, in a lot of places in Pennsylvania,

148
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
 I think.

149
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,560
 And in Britain for a time, it was grounds for a nulment.

150
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
 It's grounds for nulment, yeah.

151
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,000
 If you married a woman who had worn lipstick at some point while seducing you, it's false

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 advertising.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 It's false advertising.

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 It's false advertising.

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 The nulments were there.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,400
 I imagine there were a few, but they were mostly loopholes as they were looking for an

157
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
 nulment.

158
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
 Yeah.

159
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
 It wasn't any man who got home, woke up next to his wife the next morning, went, oh, my

160
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
 god, what are they?

161
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
 Yeah.

162
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
 Wait a minute.

163
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,040
 Your nipples and lips are completely different colors.

164
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,560
 So in Egypt, prostitutes had to wear lipstick.

165
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,960
 And the reason being that if they didn't, they would be punished because it implied that

166
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,600
 they were deceitfully posing as ladies.

167
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
 Hmm.

168
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,640
 God, it's just, it's a rough beat being a woman wearing lipstick or not wearing lipstick,

169
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
 isn't it?

170
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
 Yeah.

171
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,040
 When you get your marriage cancelled or you get mistaken for a prostitute or...

172
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,080
 But then in other times, then you're really popular, like Queen Elizabeth loved it and

173
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,160
 so it became popular then.

174
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,400
 So I think it's important, if you're a woman time-traveling, to know exactly what time

175
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
 period you've been dropped in.

176
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
 Hmm.

177
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
 So whether you wear the lipstick.

178
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,360
 Also important to be a queen rather than a prostitute.

179
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
 Yeah.

180
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,760
 Generally speaking, you see a life.

181
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,720
 If you did, if you wear a prostitute wearing lipstick in ancient Egypt or ancient Greece,

182
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,800
 then you made it out of quite weird stuff.

183
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,240
 But actually one reason why being a prostitute might have been better than a queen is that you

184
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,640
 couldn't afford the good stuff, which was actually often the materials that really

185
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,960
 damaged you in poison to you.

186
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,560
 Oh, I learned and stuff, man.

187
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
 Yeah.

188
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,520
 So you made a prostitute, so they'd make it from sheep sweat, was a very popular apparently.

189
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,120
 I don't even know how you harvest that.

190
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,400
 And human saliva and crocodile excrement in ancient Greece.

191
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,360
 I have the thing about crocodile excrement that I don't think it's actually crocodile excrement.

192
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
 No, you think it's...

193
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,360
 I think it's a metaphor for Egyptian soil.

194
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,440
 I knew that you thought that for contraceptives, but do you think it's the same for this?

195
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
 Yeah.

196
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
 Maybe wrong, though.

197
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
 I mean, it seems likely it doesn't.

198
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,400
 It's actually going around French kissing a crocodile pat and then...

199
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,880
 What sheep sweat a metaphor for?

200
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
 Or something?

201
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
 I don't know.

202
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,280
 How do you get sheep sweat?

203
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
 Do you ring them out?

204
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
 How do you...

205
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
 How do you get it?

206
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,080
 Yeah, I don't know.

207
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,760
 And that wouldn't be red, though, I imagine.

208
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,880
 I think the earth would be red, but the sheep sweat was just going to make your lips taste

209
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
 a bit salty.

210
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
 Wet.

211
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,120
 Don't hippo sweat red or purple?

212
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
 They do.

213
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,080
 And they were very popular around there, don't want to get up and harvest hippo sweat.

214
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,320
 Maybe you just for a bit of lipstick.

215
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
 No, but you could...

216
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,720
 I suppose if you lived with a bunch of sisters, maybe you'd have a room where you kept the

217
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,920
 hippo and you just ran and smogged it quickly, and then ran away.

218
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
 What?

219
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
 What was smoking the hippo?

220
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
 It's the quickest way to get the lipstick on.

221
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
 Yeah.

222
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
 No, it's hippo sweat.

223
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
 Yes.

224
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
 No, you're not kissing it in the mouth.

225
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
 You're just wearing sweater.

226
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
 Or you're just kissing the hippo's side.

227
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
 Yeah.

228
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
 Right.

229
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
 Queen Elizabeth was wearing an inch of lipstick when she died, apparently.

230
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
 No, she wasn't.

231
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
 Come on.

232
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
 Yeah.

233
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
 And then...

234
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
 Do you know how big an inch is?

235
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
 It's ridiculous.

236
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
 I'm just reporting what people reported at the time.

237
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,240
 It's like those trout pups that you get these days when you put Botox in your lips, and

238
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,600
 that kind of makes them stick out about half a bench.

239
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
 She looked like one of those.

240
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,680
 Botox was gone wrong.

241
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
 She was lipstick gone wrong.

242
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
 It can't be true, Anna.

243
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
 It can't be true.

244
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,520
 I think an inch is probably an exaggeration from the time.

245
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,000
 You know, people are seeing a bit blurry when someone's died.

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,840
 You would say the only way is the Earl of Essex, because he was one of her favourites.

247
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,560
 And of course, that's a big lip look that's popular on that TV show.

248
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
 Of course.

249
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
 That's very nice.

250
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
 Of course.

251
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,280
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

252
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,760
 My fact is that some maggots can jump 40 times their own length, but only in August.

253
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,560
 Well, I know.

254
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
 It's true.

255
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
 So we've just missed it.

256
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
 If you want to see it, you've got to wait another year.

257
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
 Yeah, I'm sorry.

258
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,280
 So this is a specific species of maggot or fly, because maggots are the larvae of fly.

259
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,400
 It's called Asphondylia, and they're only a third of a centimeter long, but they've

260
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,960
 been observed jumping up to 12 centimeters, which is really impressive.

261
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
 Yeah.

262
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,240
 It's the equivalent of a human jumping 200 feet.

263
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
 Yeah.

264
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
 Yeah.

265
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
 Although, we always say this.

266
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
 I know.

267
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,800
 It's not an exact equivalent, because it's much easier for small things to jump these distances

268
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
 of big things.

269
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,360
 It's the equivalent of a miniaturised human jumping 12 centimeters.

270
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
 Yeah.

271
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
 And what's the...

272
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
 And what's the size of a maggot?

273
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
 It's very impressive.

274
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,040
 And are they practicing for when they fly?

275
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
 Is that...

276
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
 Yeah, I do.

277
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
 Yes, they are.

278
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
 Yeah.

279
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,120
 Um, no, it's actually an escape plan.

280
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,800
 So they're hatched out onto these plants, and then they need to make a swift exit, because

281
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,480
 they're very easy prey when they're just sitting around on these plants.

282
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,760
 So they need to jump quite far.

283
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,240
 They're born in Gauls, you know, the larvae are laid in plants, the mother's lay the eggs

284
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,880
 in plants, and these create swelling school Gauls, and they hatch out of them.

285
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,360
 So then they need to escape.

286
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,120
 And the cool thing is, they have no legs, and yet they jump.

287
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
 Yeah, how are they doing that?

288
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
 What?

289
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,200
 Like a slinky, is it sort of like the suppressed spring?

290
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
 Yeah, yeah.

291
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
 Yeah, basically, yeah.

292
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
 Cool.

293
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
 They sort of improvise a leg.

294
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
 Uh.

295
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,680
 I see you're improvising, man, and very good as it is, you don't suddenly sprout a leg.

296
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
 No, you're right.

297
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,200
 We don't do whole limb work.

298
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,840
 Well, that's why he's recently been replaced with a maggot in his fantasies, isn't he?

299
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,880
 They sort of fold themselves up.

300
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,280
 So you know how octopuses sometimes make artificial elbows, right?

301
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,920
 You know, they just fold their limb at a certain point.

302
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,720
 So they do that, and they build up a load of pressure leaning against that slightly folded

303
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,240
 leg, and then they flick.

304
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,920
 They release, and they flick themselves into the air.

305
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,200
 But they also have, on either end, these kind of little hairs that when they touch each

306
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,400
 other, so when they bend forward, it's like touching your toes.

307
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,000
 It's like an adhesive, so it holds on really strong.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,800
 And as they push all this liquid down into their bottom, the tension gets greater and

309
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,200
 greater, but they're still hanging on.

310
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
 And when that snaps, they just fling into the air, yeah.

311
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
 Nice.

312
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,680
 So we have a very relatable octopus-based analogy to help me understand that better.

313
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
 No.

314
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,480
 Who knows the octopus elbow thing?

315
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
 I'm sure.

316
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
 I've never heard of what we've talked about that.

317
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,800
 We probably have, but it's pretty arcane, isn't it?

318
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,400
 People are going to remember all those things.

319
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
 That's not it.

320
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
 Yeah, you're right.

321
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,640
 So a related fact is that octopus is sometimes improvised elbows, which is pretty cool.

322
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,200
 Like, if you're chatting to me in the pub, you can say that because you know that I'm

323
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
 going to tell that.

324
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
 Yeah.

325
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
 Do not improvise your own limbs at home.

326
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
 Oh, yeah.

327
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,120
 So we've missed the big one here, though.

328
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,400
 Why just August?

329
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
 What's going on?

330
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
 Oh, yeah.

331
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
 One month of the year.

332
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,640
 Is it because the football season's just started?

333
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
 That's right.

334
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
 I'm really excited.

335
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
 Yeah.

336
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
 Do you know?

337
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,680
 I don't think we do know exactly why it is.

338
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,400
 It may be because they hatch in August.

339
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
 Yes.

340
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,920
 And then after August, they've turned into flies.

341
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
 Yeah.

342
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
 And they don't need to do this jumping trick anymore.

343
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
 Okay.

344
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
 I think that's a bit of a...

345
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
 I'm genuinely not sure.

346
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,120
 I did have a look at the paper and it wasn't actually very clear why this happens.

347
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
 Okay.

348
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
 Okay.

349
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,480
 Currently, this study came after the group had a load of these gold maggots in a peatry

350
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
 dish.

351
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,160
 And then they came to look at them and there were only two left because they were jumping

352
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
 all around the office.

353
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
 That's so good.

354
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,920
 And they thought, "Oh, I'm going to have to probably study this."

355
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
 Oh.

356
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
 That's so funny.

357
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
 Yeah.

358
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
 maggots are really cool.

359
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
 What?

360
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
 No.

361
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
 Actually, they can get really hot.

362
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
 Go on.

363
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,120
 Because when they eat, they increase their temperature because of all the digestive juices

364
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,920
 and they're kind of wriggling around and stuff like that.

365
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,240
 And there's usually a load of them in one little place and they're all wriggling and they're

366
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,760
 all getting hotter and hotter and hotter and sometimes it can get so hot that they start

367
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
 to die.

368
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
 Oh.

369
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,520
 That doesn't have a funny jockey facty ending at all.

370
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,360
 But sure it's God.

371
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
 But they do.

372
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
 I think they can sometimes recognise that this is starting to happen.

373
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
 They do.

374
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,120
 Like, you know, the guy next to him has just died, so this is getting too hot.

375
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,360
 So what they'll do is they'll, as a group, just retreat to a cooler place.

376
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,040
 Well, actually, it's like the ones that are in, it's a bit like, you know, groups of

377
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
 penguins.

378
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,920
 Again, this is the kind of thing that, me and I, and I, and our conversation about those people

379
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
 want.

380
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,560
 So like, the ones on the outside, move to the inside, the ones to the inside, move to the

381
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
 outside.

382
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
 Yeah.

383
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
 Yeah.

384
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
 Kind of keep the temperature.

385
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
 And do they do that?

386
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
 Yeah.

387
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,560
 Imagine being in a restaurant and people are just going so crazy about the food, they start

388
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
 dying.

389
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,040
 That is an exciting but also stressful restaurant opening, isn't it?

390
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,840
 I think it's one of being in a mosh pit and getting so hot people dying, which maybe

391
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
 they would.

392
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
 Yeah.

393
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,880
 But the thing that's like the penguins is also how they manage to eat so fast.

394
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,720
 So maggots are useful for things like clearing up garbage, you can use maggots for clearing

395
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,720
 up our trash and stuff because they can consume stuff at an amazing rate for their size.

396
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,400
 They can't carry it away quite as quickly as the bin man.

397
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,000
 They're working up to it.

398
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,640
 And your neighbours really hate you, by the way, Anna, pouring bags and bags of maggots

399
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,680
 over your bins every week.

400
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
 It's got to stop.

401
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,720
 They're very efficient, we've got to give them work.

402
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,320
 So they do this and they are less efficient than the bin man, but the reason they are still

403
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,840
 efficient is that if you've got a lump of food, then they'll be, let's say, a hundred maggots

404
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,680
 and they'll form a little mountain that climbs up the mound and the maggots can eat solidly

405
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,440
 for about five minutes and then they get a bit tired and they need a break.

406
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,880
 And so they'll be maggots pushing them further and further up the mound of food because

407
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,840
 their own maggots queuing behind them.

408
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,560
 And then once they get to the top of the mound, then they've had enough food and they tumble

409
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,880
 off the top and back to the back of the queue.

410
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,800
 And the next maggot is up there eating it.

411
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 So amazing.

412
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
 Do you see what I mean?

413
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
 It's like a cycle if you might see this.

414
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,120
 It's like going up the escalator on the tube and you have to eat one doughnut every time

415
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,480
 you go three feet up, but then you get to the top and you're full of doughnuts and then

416
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,880
 you go down the aisle.

417
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,920
 Sure, you also go down the aisle.

418
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,120
 Like, this analogy did start to fall apart quite well this time.

419
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:32,320
 So the other thing, they can, so this thing of mounting themselves up, I read an article

420
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,840
 saying that they can be mischievous sometimes, maggots and it's a bit of a stretch, but if

421
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,680
 you keep them in a glass enclosure without food and without a lid, they will organise

422
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,400
 themselves into a prison break because they will all get together in a corner and they

423
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,200
 will push up and up and up, they will pile up until the ones at the top can escape.

424
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
 Cool.

425
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,800
 So if you keep maggots, if you're a scientist, you sometimes have to have a moat around

426
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 them to stop them escaping.

427
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
 Wow.

428
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
 Isn't that crazy?

429
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
 Yeah, that's awesome.

430
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,320
 Besides who the poor Bruce Willis and Armageddon guy is who stays behind and gives them

431
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
 another leg out.

432
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
 I don't know.

433
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
 But I think most of them stay behind, don't they?

434
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
 Yeah.

435
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
 It's really.

436
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,680
 It's on a few brave souls making out.

437
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
 Yeah.

438
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
 Gosh.

439
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,520
 I guess the most intelligent ones get to go out to town.

440
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,520
 No, well, it'd be the strongest ones, but they've got to find a way of busting the rest

441
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
 out.

442
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
 So who do you three?

443
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
 Of course.

444
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,520
 Probably a group of maybe five or six you'd have one quite strong one, one really smart

445
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
 one, one sexy one.

446
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
 Yeah.

447
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,120
 Well, just to keep the others entertained.

448
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,280
 Speaking of sexy, they can breathe through their bottoms.

449
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
 Cool.

450
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
 Cool.

451
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
 And that's breathe.

452
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
 Breathe.

453
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
 Yeah, not breathe.

454
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
 Oh, yeah.

455
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,000
 They breathe through their bottoms and that's had another way that they eat really quickly

456
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,560
 because they can just continuously eat, like you say, until they get tired because they're

457
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
 breathing out their bum.

458
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
 Yeah.

459
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,560
 So they don't need to breathe out their mouths.

460
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
 That's great.

461
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
 That's amazing.

462
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
 That's so cool.

463
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,240
 What they mean is they can't poo as quickly as we can because they need to break constantly

464
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
 during pooing.

465
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
 Yeah.

466
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,440
 But they don't switch back to mouth breathing while they're having a poo.

467
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
 Yeah.

468
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,400
 So what they can't do is eat a hot dog and have a poo at the same time.

469
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
 Actually, they can do that.

470
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
 Yeah.

471
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
 So that's why we are a higher being with maggots.

472
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
 Yeah.

473
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:22,680
 I mean, again, I'm not coming to any of your restaurant openings, that's the big pitch.

474
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:29,120
 You'll notice your seats are also toilets and go, so they do love rotting meat.

475
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,280
 And that was the cause of this massive misinformation campaign about maggots that went

476
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,640
 on until about 200 years ago, which is the spontaneous generation thing, which I don't

477
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,800
 think we've talked about before.

478
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,080
 But so everyone used to think that maggots were spontaneously generated out of dead flesh

479
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,960
 because you'd have a rotting carcass and then maggots would suddenly appear and flies

480
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,560
 would come out of that.

481
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,840
 And that's just how people thought life happened.

482
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,600
 It would have made sense when you think of it if you didn't know we...

483
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 It does.

484
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
 You know.

485
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,760
 There's absolutely no reason you wouldn't think it if you didn't know what we know now.

486
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,240
 And it was finally proven in 1668 by this guy called Francesco Ready.

487
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,160
 That flies come from maggots and flies aren't just spontaneously produced from carcasses.

488
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,840
 And he did that by putting sort of rotting meat in jars and some of the jars he'd cover

489
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
 up and some he wouldn't.

490
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,600
 And he'd be like, look, life isn't in the jars that I covered up.

491
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,200
 But he had to, because he was around about the time of Galileo and lots of other scientists

492
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,720
 who were getting in trouble with the church.

493
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,240
 So every time he found something out like this, he had to go through the Bible and find

494
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,480
 a bit of Bible passage that supported it.

495
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,560
 So he'd find the Bible passage that said, all life comes from life.

496
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
 So it's okay.

497
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
 Got some nice lines.

498
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
 Oh, no.

499
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
 Don't worry about it.

500
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
 No.

501
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,080
 I mean, it sounds like he would have been quite low on the church's inquisition list after

502
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,080
 Galileo.

503
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,080
 Galileo is saying some pretty punchy things about the relationship between the earth and

504
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
 the sun.

505
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,080
 This is just a guy with meat jars.

506
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
 I don't know.

507
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
 I do.

508
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
 It was a huge deal.

509
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
 It really is.

510
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,000
 Well, life couldn't come out of nothing questioning where life came from.

511
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,440
 It was a massive deal.

512
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
 Okay.

513
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,200
 Because where did Jesus, not Jesus, where did God, Jesus wasn't a maggot, I think.

514
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,600
 But how did God make life, if we're saying life always comes from life and you need the

515
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,240
 original thing, how did God make it in one day?

516
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
 Okay.

517
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
 Okay.

518
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
 Let's get him in for some inquisitioning.

519
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
 Who's a big man?

520
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
 Yeah.

521
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,080
 But his ideas, his ideas, he debunked.

522
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,400
 The debunked idea is dated back to an aximander of myletus and he thought something really cool.

523
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,640
 So he was seven century BC.

524
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,040
 He was the first person who posited this idea of spontaneous generation of life.

525
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 And he thought how it happened was.

526
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,920
 He looked at fetuses of children and he thought they look kind of fishy.

527
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,680
 And so what he thought was that he thought that if water warmed up with the sun, then

528
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,760
 it sort of created a fish.

529
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
 Okay.

530
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,880
 So there'd be this reaction which created a living fish.

531
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,920
 And then some fish gestated and gave birth to other fish.

532
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,740
 And then others that decided to gestate for longer would eventually create a human.

533
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,440
 And so he said fish would crawl up onto the bank when they were really far into their pregnancy,

534
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,580
 give birth to an adult human.

535
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,680
 And then that adult human would go in and have his...

536
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
 He's kind of right in a way.

537
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,040
 He's just missing out millions and millions of years of evolution.

538
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,120
 He's kind of right that you end up with a human and you start with a fish.

539
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
 Yeah.

540
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
 You're right.

541
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
 Yeah.

542
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
 He just sped it up a lot.

543
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
 It was fast forward.

544
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
 It was Darwin in fast forward.

545
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:22,480
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna.

546
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,320
 My fact this week is that humans may have developed motion sickness to stop us falling out

547
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
 of trees.

548
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
 Hmm.

549
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,600
 And read the rest of it.

550
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,360
 I've got just a theory but an interesting one for what you said round.

551
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
 Yeah.

552
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
 Whenever I pitch that.

553
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,360
 It gets a flat out.

554
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
 No.

555
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
 And here we are.

556
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
 Just an idea.

557
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
 Just a crazy idea.

558
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:48,560
 An idea from scientists, not from some crazy yeti-finantic in Arkansas.

559
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
 I'm sorry.

560
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,040
 She doesn't mean that Mike.

561
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,200
 The theory is about how we and other great apes lived up trees as many of them do.

562
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
 Great apes, I guess.

563
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
 I guess so.

564
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
 Well, it's one of the greatest of all the apes.

565
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
 All right.

566
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
 Donald Trump.

567
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,400
 Let's calm down.

568
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,680
 And basically if we ever lived up trees millions of years ago, hundreds of thousands of

569
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,800
 years ago, then it was quite bad for us to want to climb really, really high up onto the

570
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,360
 really wobbly branches because that made it more likely that it would snap and you'd fall

571
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,560
 off and die.

572
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,520
 And that's why we developed motion sickness.

573
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,880
 And the fact is that chimps and things that still do live in trees do avoid going on those

574
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,320
 wobbly branches and lots of other animals do have motion sickness.

575
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,080
 So it does seem to be like a risk aversion thing.

576
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,960
 Because if you don't, the thing about falling out of a tree, I guess, is it's quite hard

577
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,040
 to learn from your mistakes gradually and evolve that gradually.

578
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,080
 Because once you fall and out, you're either really severely injured or you're dead.

579
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
 And they've looked, they looked into this.

580
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,440
 I was reading a book about this and it talks about the actual frequency that elicits motion

581
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,960
 sickness, the amount of wobble, the pace of the wobble.

582
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,680
 And it is about the same frequency as the trees that people would have been in would

583
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
 have swayed at.

584
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:04,520
 So I've also read that it's about the same frequency as is generated by wind generated

585
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
 waves.

586
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,400
 So there's another theory that it's from under the water because fish also get motion sickness.

587
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,880
 And if you get wind blowing waves, it makes you feel a bit woozy.

588
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,160
 You get to a certain point where actually it's quite dangerous.

589
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,760
 And so you get away from those areas.

590
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
 Same thing.

591
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
 Fish have the aversion.

592
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,400
 Because then you get disorientated if you're being swept around by the waves.

593
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
 Fish gets sick.

594
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
 Yeah, fish gets sick.

595
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
 No, that's nice.

596
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
 Well, humans get lansick.

597
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
 Yes.

598
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,000
 If you go on a boat for too long and then you walk off the boat for a while, you feel really

599
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 woozy.

600
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,200
 It's a French thing called mal de debaachmol, which is like mal de mer.

601
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
 It's easy to say.

602
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,640
 Mal de debaachmol is illness from disembarking.

603
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
 Yeah.

604
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
 I mean, you also can just call it lansickness.

605
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,240
 I mean, that's what the French do call it, I suppose.

606
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
 Yeah.

607
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,360
 There's a French podcast right now saying it is called lansickness.

608
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,800
 It's so weird to think of all the ancestors of ours as in the, you know, eight-like ancestors

609
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,760
 of ours who didn't have motion sickness, who then died as a result because they were climbing.

610
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,120
 They didn't know not to climb a wobbly tree.

611
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
 Yeah.

612
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,880
 And as a result, they died out because they're in many ways the superior beings.

613
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
 Because they could climb so much higher.

614
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
 They don't get seasick.

615
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
 Yeah.

616
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
 You're right.

617
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
 You're right.

618
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
 You're right.

619
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
 You're right.

620
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
 You're right.

621
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,640
 And just on their seething as well, just because it's a fact, the word nausea comes from

622
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,400
 the same word as nautical or something like that, because it's to do with the sea.

623
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,600
 Because it's to do with sea sickness originally.

624
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
 Yeah.

625
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
 Nails, ancient Greek.

626
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,960
 Well, just on sea sickness as well.

627
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,320
 I was reading that Nelson suffered severe sea sickness his entire life from age 12 onwards

628
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
 to his death.

629
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,600
 The guy was constantly vomiting on both.

630
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,840
 Why do you not become a treason exactly?

631
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,920
 Well, he wrote letters about it, didn't he?

632
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
 Yeah.

633
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,560
 And his letters to his lovers, he'd sign off your affectionate seasick Nelson.

634
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,400
 And he said, "I am ill every time it blows hard."

635
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
 And...

636
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
 Maybe this means something else.

637
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
 Yeah.

638
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,880
 That he was writing to his lovers.

639
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
 We're on clear.

640
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,040
 He said, "Nothing but my love of the profession keeps me at sea for more than an hour."

641
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,400
 So you really love what you do, doesn't matter if you vomit throughout.

642
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,200
 Do you know another great nautical hero who had sea sickness?

643
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,200
 Who?

644
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
 Jacques Cousteau.

645
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,840
 Well, Captain A. Hab.

646
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
 It's entirely possible.

647
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,640
 But it's the last Captain Bird's Eye.

648
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
 Yeah.

649
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
 He was really seasick.

650
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
 Really?

651
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
 The fish finger guy.

652
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
 The fish finger guy.

653
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
 But was he an actual captain that one?

654
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,640
 Well, was he an actor?

655
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
 He was an actor.

656
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
 Oh, okay.

657
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
 For TV Airvotes.

658
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
 Sorry, sir.

659
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,760
 But this was the big pitch where they unveiled him to the public.

660
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,640
 His call Mitch Cummins, he was a South African.

661
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
 And he really looked apart.

662
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,520
 You know, great big bushy beard.

663
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,400
 And probably looked like Captain Bird's Eye.

664
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,400
 But then he got very recently replaced by a man called Riccardo Aserby, an Italian who

665
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,960
 is basically a model.

666
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
 He's really, really...

667
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,360
 He's too good looking to be Captain Bird's Eye.

668
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
 Seriously?

669
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
 Yeah.

670
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
 How bizarre.

671
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
 And he's quite young as well.

672
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
 And the whole thing just stinks.

673
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,360
 Does he have a big gray beard?

674
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
 Doesn't he have a beard?

675
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,360
 He's got a beard.

676
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,680
 So is it like a big white beard?

677
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,440
 It's more like an iron gray, hunky, modally beard.

678
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,040
 If you want to get off with this guy, you just give him a call at me.

679
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
 Yeah.

680
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,040
 If you want a bird's eye view.

681
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:23,400
 It's better than the fish finger.

682
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,240
 The thing is that a lot of people get motion sickness now because we drive in cars, which

683
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,320
 we didn't evolve to do.

684
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,160
 And people use VR stuff, like headset and stuff.

685
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,800
 And that's a real problem with people getting motion sickness.

686
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:43,600
 Apparently, there are some VR games where 100% of users get motion sickness, like literally

687
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
 everyone.

688
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,880
 And usually for most games, it's between 40 and 70% of people get it.

689
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,600
 So it's like a really common thing, motion sickness.

690
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,080
 And yet admirably, like Rachel Ordenelson, they're so passionate about the pursuit that they

691
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
 will make this happen.

692
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,760
 Exactly, my wife plays them all the time.

693
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,160
 It's almost as if being in a virtual reality is preferable to be buried to me.

694
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,760
 She's throwing up constantly, but...

695
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
 Does she write your list?

696
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
 But then she puts the VR set up.

697
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
 Sure.

698
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,200
 Does she write your letters from inside the game, saying, "Your affectionate seasick ballina,

699
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,840
 have you heard of the SS Bessamer?"

700
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,320
 This is a very cool anti-seasickness innovation from the Victorian times.

701
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,160
 It was a steamer ship across the English channel for passengers.

702
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
 And it was experimental.

703
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,120
 It was a guy called Henry Bessamer who invented it.

704
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:38,080
 And the idea was it had a room inside it, which would be suspended using incredibly elaborate

705
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,680
 counterweight and counterbalances and all sorts of mechanics to keep it exactly in position

706
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,680
 while the ship moved up and down the waves and left to right.

707
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,360
 Yeah.

708
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,280
 So he built a model of it at its house, huge model, which could, you know, the thing would

709
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,400
 move around and the room would stay the same.

710
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,000
 And it got a lot of investment.

711
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,200
 And on its first trial, it couldn't quite sail properly.

712
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,480
 I think partly due to this stuff inside it.

713
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,720
 And it smashed into the pier at Calais.

714
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,480
 It was slightly fixed.

715
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,120
 And then on its side, he said, "Oh, we haven't had enough time to fix it properly."

716
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:18,800
 So it had only one public voyage, and it crashed into the Calais pier again.

717
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,760
 Could it have a massive magnet in it or something?

718
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,160
 It was a disaster.

719
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
 How was it?

720
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,560
 I wonder if that's the same Bessamer as did the Bessamer process for smelting aluminium or

721
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
 whatever it is.

722
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,560
 I don't know.

723
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
 Was that profound cock-up as well?

724
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
 It was.

725
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,080
 Sounds like it doesn't know what he's doing.

726
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,680
 He designed something that's not a boat, clearly, if it's just constantly crashing.

727
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
 I don't know.

728
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
 Was there nobody steering it?

729
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
 It had people steering it.

730
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,680
 You can't say it's not a boat just because it crashes.

731
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,480
 You can't say Titanic is not a boat.

732
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,680
 Not a boat.

733
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,000
 Just a rock, as far as I'm concerned.

734
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,600
 We should talk about what's actually going on.

735
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,360
 So it's just the difference of information between what your eyes are seeing, when you're

736
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,640
 on a ship, this is.

737
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,640
 So your eyes are seeing, let's say, a stable room, because you're in a ship room and you're

738
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,920
 moving with the ship, so it's all the same to you, but your body, your inner ear, can tell

739
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
 that you're moving around.

740
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,080
 Actually, that's the case in all these things, right?

741
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,160
 So if you're in a car, it's the same, you're reading the book, which is still, but actually

742
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,160
 everything else is moving around you.

743
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,040
 But there's a third thing as well.

744
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,720
 So apart from your eyes and your inner ear, there's a third bit of your body, which is also

745
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:40,640
 getting sending you conflicting information about what it does, what you're saying, your eyes,

746
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,240
 your ears, and the little boxing bag at the back of your mouth, the uvula.

747
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
 Yeah.

748
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
 Yeah.

749
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
 You can imagine that with work.

750
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
 If it's tilting over, look at it.

751
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
 It's insane.

752
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
 Okay.

753
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
 No.

754
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
 Great guess.

755
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
 Great guess.

756
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
 Is it somewhere, is it sort of in your crop somewhere?

757
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
 Oh, it's close.

758
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
 You're so close.

759
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
 Oh, is it in your bottom?

760
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
 If you're sitting down, it's in your bottom.

761
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,360
 It's outside of my bottom when I've standing up, but inside my bottom when I sit down.

762
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
 Your feet.

763
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,440
 If you're standing up, you can tell this through your feet, and if you're sitting down

764
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
 through your bottom.

765
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,440
 Got it.

766
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,600
 And it's a sense called proprioception, and it's where, if you're swaying, there's more

767
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,680
 pressure on one side of your feet, and then on the other, you know what I mean, if your

768
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,480
 body senses this, and that is another thing that can give you motion sickness, or if you're

769
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,720
 sitting down, it's on your bottom.

770
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
 Yeah.

771
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,160
 And it's like when you're on a tube train, you know, you can feel the acceleration really

772
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,360
 stronger on one side, and it doesn't take off, yeah.

773
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
 That's really quick.

774
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:32,240
 And other things that get seasickness, I mean loads of stuff does really dot so dogs, people

775
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,680
 anyone who's had a dog will know that they get motion sickness, it's blood irritating in

776
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,680
 a car, mice, amphibians, fish who said frogs get it quite badly.

777
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,480
 So they tested this, but they often test it by putting them in parabolic conditions.

778
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,960
 So it's simulating weightlessness by sort of spinning or spinning them round to simulate

779
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,880
 this sort of concentric movement.

780
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,360
 And so I was reading a study about whether frogs get motion sick, and they said the way we

781
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,080
 find out is we put them in these containers, and then we subject them to parabolic flight,

782
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,480
 and then we open the containers, and the presence of vomitus in their containers after

783
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,640
 flight will be used to indicate if they get motion sick.

784
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,920
 My wife, we brought her up far today, but she's going on one of these parabolic flights

785
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
 next year.

786
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
 Why?

787
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
 Yeah.

788
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
 Yeah.

789
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
 So I wonder if she'll vomit.

790
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
 Yeah.

791
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,400
 So what you can tell is by the presence of vomitus in the...

792
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
 Vomitus.

793
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
 I mean, is that just vomitus?

794
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
 It's Latin for vomit.

795
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
 I mean, why do they need to still say vomitus?

796
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
 It's bizarre.

797
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,880
 I looked this up, so I thought they must have made that up.

798
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,560
 Yep, it's just vomitus, the definition is the stuff that comes out of your mouth when

799
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
 you vomit.

800
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
 It's vomit.

801
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
 Wow.

802
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,360
 But anyway, it turns out they are different to us and how they see sick themselves.

803
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,920
 Oh, we talked about frogs.

804
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
 Frogs?

805
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,720
 Yes, because they don't throw up at the time, they throw up afterwards, which is actually

806
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,720
 quite considerate.

807
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,320
 They will wait until the car's stopped or they won't do it on the roller coaster, but usually

808
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,800
 happens between a few minutes and 24 hours afterwards.

809
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,560
 Almost like a hangover vomit, right?

810
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
 Yes.

811
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,320
 I was reading that the guys who built the Golden Gate Bridge, the builders supposedly were

812
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,920
 put on a special diet by the leader of the construction works guy called Strauss.

813
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,600
 I can't find any detail though about what that diet was, but the idea was the diet was

814
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
 for motion sickness.

815
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,000
 It was for dizziness because people were very scared when they were building this bridge.

816
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,800
 You know, you had to climb very high, you had to get to, and so supposedly there was a diet

817
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
 to stop that.

818
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,200
 But a really cool extra thing about that was what they ended up doing was they built a giant

819
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,560
 net under the bridge, cost $130,000, and it was like a circus trapeze net.

820
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,280
 The idea was the dizziness would have been a huge factor in the construction pace that was

821
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
 going on.

822
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,880
 And by building this little netting, it meant that people could go and work harder with

823
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,760
 the knowledge that they would probably survive if they fell off.

824
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
 And 19 people did fall off.

825
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
 Oh my god, did they all live?

826
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,480
 Yeah, and they became what was known as part of the Halfway to Hell Club.

827
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
 Yeah.

828
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
 When was that built, did you see that?

829
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
 It was 19.

830
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
 Oh, 36.

831
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
 Oh, 36.

832
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
 Okay.

833
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,840
 So they probably wouldn't have had any effective actual medicines at that time to deal with

834
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,680
 sea sickness, because the drugs weren't invented until the 50s, and the drugs just switched

835
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,680
 off the information coming from the inner ear that we've today.

836
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,600
 So the Victorian Cures evolved sucking lemons, which did absolutely no good.

837
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
 No.

838
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
 Just did not help.

839
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,200
 There were loads of cures which didn't do any good, actually.

840
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,320
 Opium, I think, did some good, but opium's gone for everything.

841
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
 Yeah.

842
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,800
 Something that removes you mentally from any kind of reality is probably going to stop

843
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
 you being aware of your sea sickness.

844
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
 Exactly.

845
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,400
 But if you're the captain of the ship, unfortunately, that's why it crashed.

846
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,640
 There are some special glasses you can buy that have been made by Citroen, their car

847
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
 company.

848
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,080
 They're called C-Troen.

849
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
 Very C-Troen.

850
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
 Oh, nice.

851
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
 C-Troen, C-Troen.

852
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:57,320
 I don't think they thought of the C-Troen, C-Troen, but yeah, they have this blue liquid inside

853
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,440
 them, and it gives you an artificial horizon, because a lot of it is being able to see the

854
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
 horizon, isn't it?

855
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,320
 Being able to see that moving at the same way as you're feeling it's moving.

856
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,360
 So whichever way you move, it makes the horizon look like it's in that direction.

857
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,680
 Apparently, they do work after about 10 to 12 minutes, your motion sickness will just disappear.

858
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,920
 That's really clever.

859
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,640
 But what is the point in them, because the only time that you're not looking at the horizon,

860
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,200
 the reason you get travel sick is when you're reading or something, and then that, therefore,

861
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,920
 you're not looking outside, you're not seeing the world go by, but if you're wearing these

862
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,640
 weird horizon glasses, can you read a book with them?

863
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,720
 I guess that's what I want to know.

864
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
 Can you read a book?

865
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
 Can you read a book?

866
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
 I think you're not wearing the Citroen.

867
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
 Can you?

868
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
 I think so.

869
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,480
 And the answer to them actually is because when we have self-driving cars, people won't be

870
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,840
 driving and looking at the road, they'll be playing video games or they'll be reading books

871
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,840
 or doing whatever.

872
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,480
 So you need to come up with a new way of dealing with that, because otherwise, whenever

873
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,120
 you open any self-driving car, it'll be full of monitors.

874
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:01,880
 But just every time you got to any destination, you still have the door, and a sea of monitors

875
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,880
 comes out.

876
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,080
 Well, the future is terrible.

877
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,600
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

878
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:17,960
 My fact this week is to honor the US Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia, Virginia's George

879
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:24,320
 Mason University School of Law, renamed itself Antonin Scalia School of Law, then immediately

880
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,640
 renamed itself again after it was pointed out that the acronym would be Asshole.

881
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,640
 That's right.

882
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
 Fair enough.

883
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
 Yeah.

884
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
 Asshole.

885
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
 Asshole.

886
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,640
 Asshole.

887
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
 I said Asshole, didn't I?

888
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
 Yeah.

889
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
 I went too far on that one.

890
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
 Asshole.

891
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
 Asshole.

892
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,320
 So this was, I think, the way it worked out is they sort of announced this, let's say, on

893
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,400
 a Thursday, and by Tuesday, there was so much public ridicule online that the school's

894
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,880
 dean made an announcement that it was going to be renamed off the back of it.

895
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,640
 And they named it because they just got a massive donation from a few people, right?

896
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:03,320
 They got $30 million donation. 10 million of it came from the Charles Koch Foundation.

897
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,040
 So they could have called it the Charles Koch School of Law, which would have been much

898
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
 better.

899
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
 That's true.

900
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,360
 It's now the Antonin Scalia Law School, but that's still ASLS, which looks in an uncharitable

901
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,760
 light like Assholes.

902
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
 Mm.

903
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,760
 What?

904
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
 What?

905
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
 I see when I see that.

906
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
 Oh, yes.

907
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
 Okay.

908
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
 Some more stuff on acronyms.

909
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
 Yeah.

910
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:29,720
 What the acronym or what the word spam stands for, you know, the food stuff, rather than

911
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
 this.

912
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,200
 I would think it's something.

913
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,600
 Is it something ham?

914
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
 Okay.

915
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
 What would it be?

916
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
 Yes.

917
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
 Spurious ham.

918
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
 Spurious ham.

919
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
 That's it.

920
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,560
 Well, most people would tell you that it stands for Spiced Ham.

921
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:49,520
 That's what everyone thought it used to mean, but then according to spam the company, they

922
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,600
 now tell us that it stands for Sizzle Park and mm.

923
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
 What?

924
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,400
 So, which I imagine might be a back formation.

925
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
 Yeah.

926
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,600
 Is it, is it saying Sizzle, comma, pork?

927
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:12,080
 Actually, they're saying Sizzle, full stop, pork, full stop, and full stop, mm, full stop.

928
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
 Mm.

929
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,840
 I also say mm to that, but in a more skeptical way, I think that they would have wanted.

930
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,120
 You always come to the question mark at the end every time.

931
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
 Wow.

932
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,080
 That's a terrible back formation, yeah, it's so clunky.

933
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,360
 So there's a difference between an acronym and an initialism.

934
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,320
 I think it's very important that we nail down.

935
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,320
 Yeah.

936
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,320
 Okay.

937
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:39,080
 So an acronym, well, some, all of these things are acronyms, but some people say, it's not

938
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,560
 really hard and fast, that initialisms are things where it's just strings of letters.

939
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:53,680
 So the FBI is an initialism, YMCA, YMCA, yeah, so that's the difference, right?

940
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,120
 If it became a word.

941
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
 Exactly.

942
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:03,080
 So if people started saying, I go to the IMPCA or SCUBA, SCUBA is initials, but it's also become

943
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
 a word in its own right.

944
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
 So that's an acronym.

945
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,240
 Contained underwater breathing equipment.

946
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
 Apparatus.

947
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,040
 That would be SCUBA.

948
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,040
 SCUBA.

949
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,040
 SCUBA.

950
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,640
 Also, you get the very exciting marriage of the two, don't you?

951
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,520
 This is where the two come together.

952
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,160
 It's a bit frowned upon in the communities of initialisms with acronyms.

953
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,240
 It's like Romeo and Juliet, but you've got CD-ROM, of course.

954
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
 Okay.

955
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,720
 You've got JPEG, and that's it, actually.

956
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,400
 There are only two Romeo and Juliet's of the initials that were in the world.

957
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
 Okay.

958
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
 What's the deal with a JPEG then?

959
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,360
 So a JPEG is J, is a joint photographic expert's group.

960
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,600
 So part of it, you're just saying the letter and part of it, you're saying a word.

961
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
 Exactly.

962
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
 Wow.

963
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
 Holy.

964
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
 Wow, God, that is more amazement than that deserves.

965
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
 Wow, I just didn't know what it was.

966
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
 You couldn't say JPEG, though.

967
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
 And now JPEG, though.

968
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
 You couldn't say JPEG.

969
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
 You couldn't say KIDROM.

970
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
 KIDROM.

971
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
 KIDROM.

972
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
 You could, but we just don't.

973
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
 In fact, we rarely refer to CD-ROMs.

974
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
 Speak for us.

975
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,720
 I've got a few things on just name changes.

976
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
 Okay.

977
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:12,680
 So one of the things I guess it comes up a lot in newspapers is that Peter and the animal

978
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:18,040
 rights group, they constantly want places to change their name if there's something that's

979
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
 associated.

980
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
 Oh, yeah.

981
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
 For example.

982
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,200
 We did on the podcast that they wanted to change great fry up to great vegan fry up.

983
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
 That's right.

984
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
 That's right.

985
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
 Yeah, exactly.

986
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,680
 So there's a town that they wanted to have changed.

987
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,520
 It's a village called Wool, it's an English village.

988
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,760
 They wanted it to be changed to vegan wool.

989
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
 That was their big pitch.

990
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
 Did they?

991
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,760
 No, they didn't.

992
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,680
 In fact, I can't find a single instance where people got a letter from Peter saying change

993
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
 your name.

994
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
 They went absolutely.

995
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,680
 I've not found that yet.

996
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,960
 There's a place called Leatherhead, which they wanted to be changed to Pleatherhead, which

997
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,400
 Pleatherhead is an imitation synthetic leather alternative, so that was quite nice.

998
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,480
 There was the chicken dinner road, which is a road they wanted to call chicken roads.

999
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,480
 It happens all the time, but my favorite one is sausage street.

1000
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
 So sausage street.

1001
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,360
 This is a town, which is in France.

1002
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,600
 Sorry, there's a town in France called sausage street.

1003
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
 No, sorry, sorry.

1004
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,240
 There's a street in a town in France.

1005
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,840
 It's called Rudella Sousie, which is sausage street.

1006
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,960
 So they wrote a letter to them, say, can you change it from sausage street?

1007
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
 And they obviously refuse.

1008
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,520
 The town may say absolutely not.

1009
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,640
 But someone from the town also pointed out that the change would be completely out of place

1010
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,480
 because it is not named after the sausage itself, but rather the sausage street is off the

1011
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,680
 back of a woman who they called the sausage, called Suzanne Tessier, and she lived in the

1012
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,680
 area.

1013
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,200
 Do we know why they called her the sausage street?

1014
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
 Yeah, we do.

1015
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
 We do.

1016
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,240
 Because when she walked, she stooped over like a sausage bending, and that was the name.

1017
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,440
 I'll let Maggie to about to jump.

1018
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
 Exactly.

1019
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,480
 So the street supposedly is named after Susan the sausage Tessier.

1020
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
 No.

1021
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
 Yeah.

1022
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
 That's amazing.

1023
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
 That is so funny.

1024
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,320
 So if you have a name of a company, and you're not sure if it's going to be okay, or if it's

1025
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:14,680
 going to be a bit of another asshole debacle, then asshole, sorry, then you just need to

1026
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,400
 try and register it because the government will tell you if it's too rude.

1027
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,440
 So you have the its company's house, and it's the government body which registers company

1028
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
 names.

1029
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,160
 And every year they released their list of names that they said no to.

1030
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,240
 So this year they banned 87 company names that they refused to register.

1031
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,600
 And so when we didn't get, so first of all there was purple helmet bikes.

1032
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
 Right.

1033
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,040
 Which, so I sort of kind of I think guess we did a podcast the other week about what we

1034
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:45,120
 called people from West Bromwich Albion, and purple helmet is a synonym for that.

1035
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,120
 Oh, yeah.

1036
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,120
 Okay.

1037
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,120
 Oh, that is.

1038
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,120
 It's a convoluted way of explaining.

1039
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,120
 No, but that's a great way of getting listeners to go to the previous episode.

1040
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,560
 And in that episode, we referenced the one before, and it's a constant change.

1041
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,200
 And so that's purple helmet bikes, and there's also company names that weren't allowed.

1042
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,400
 Fanny's cabal, this wasn't allowed.

1043
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
 Okay.

1044
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,040
 Solid systems, which I just like, I like the idea of hiring someone to fix your computer when

1045
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
 they call it.

1046
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
 Solid systems.

1047
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,040
 Then just fucking, I'm going to get a new one.

1048
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,040
 Royal nuts.

1049
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
 Aina's beauty.

1050
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,040
 Aina's beauty.

1051
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,040
 Aina's beauty.

1052
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,520
 Who thought that would get her?

1053
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,360
 It's not exactly a crafty bit of wordplay like purple helmet bikes, isn't it?

1054
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,320
 It does what it says on the tin.

1055
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,160
 It puts a bit of redness down like that.

1056
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,240
 Sit on a beat shoot for three hours.

1057
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,640
 Is there a first line of advice?

1058
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,640
 Oh, my god.

1059
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,640
 Nick has knackers knackers.

1060
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
 Don't know what they do.

1061
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,640
 I like to know.

1062
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,080
 Because the problem is, we don't find now what they do, because these companies don't

1063
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,080
 get registered.

1064
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:48,400
 Don't they make underwear door knockers and they kill horses?

1065
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,440
 It was three best friends with three very different talents.

1066
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,480
 In 2015, lots of people called Brian protested after Thames Valley police announced that they

1067
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,920
 were going to change the name of one of their police horses from Brian to they said a god-like

1068
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,920
 name such as Hercules.

1069
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,000
 And people, so this was, if the horse passed its tests to be a good police horse basically

1070
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,680
 and to be a qualified police horse.

1071
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,160
 And various people called Brian kicked up a fuss.

1072
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,320
 So Brian Lewis from Ascot said, I think it's outrageous.

1073
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,360
 Brian is a good name for a horse.

1074
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,360
 Brian.

1075
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,360
 It's not god-like though, is it?

1076
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:28,200
 He's very famously, he's not the son of god, he's a very naughty mind.

1077
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,080
 Yes, that's such a good point.

1078
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,560
 There was another guy called Brian Pulson from Bracknell who said there is no way they should

1079
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,960
 be changing the name.

1080
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,960
 Every horse should be called Brian.

1081
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,200
 He's such an extreme alternative.

1082
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,840
 What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world.

1083
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,440
 Pulsuring all Brian's coming up the back, we're Brian, we're Brian, we're Brian, we're

1084
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,240
 Brian, we're Brian, we're Brian, we're Brian.

1085
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,640
 Okay, that's it.

1086
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,640
 That is all of our facts.

1087
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,160
