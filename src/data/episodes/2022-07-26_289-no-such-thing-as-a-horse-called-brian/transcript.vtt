 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.520
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.880
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Aniches enski, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.120
 James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.640
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go, starting with you, James.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.080
 Okay my fact this week is that using too much red lipstick can make your urine turn red.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.920
 That's weird so it gets into your kidney somehow.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 Yeah, I reckon.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.920
 How do you wear lipstick?

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.680
 I must have worn it wrong before at times I've worn it, not wearing it on the outside,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 are you?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.440
 I screwed it up, you put it on your tongue didn't you?

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:04.000
 So I found this on the website of improbable research our friends who also make the Ig Nobel

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.080
 Prizes and this was a case for 28 year old woman who turned up at a nephrology clinic with

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.800
 a five day history of passing red colored urine but she didn't have any other symptoms,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.240
 she had no pain, she didn't have chills, she didn't have anything else that could have

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.120
 caused this like blood in your urine for instance and the doctor said that the only noticeable

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.920
 feature was her bright red lipstick, which I think is a bit harsh actually, I'm sure she

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.480
 had lots of other great features but anyway they tested all the other things like her liver

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.100
 function and her blood counts and everything like that and they found out that she would

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.120
 apply her lipstick 20 to 25 times a day and they worked out that it was the lipstick that

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.160
 was causing the urine to turn red.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.120
 It kind of makes sense because like lots of things can make your urine turn colors like

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.660
 lots of food so if she's accidentally ingesting this stuff then it could happen.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.000
 So that's an abnormal number of times to reapply lipstick over the course of the day?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.200
 It's certainly more than I've ever done.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 Wow.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.920
 It's weird because just the idea that it's like say beetroot not known to color your urine

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.200
 I don't think so much as the back passage when you go to the toilet.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.000
 No, it doesn't pass.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 What?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.720
 It's more commonly known to color your urine, yeah it is.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.720
 So discreet the way you said back passage.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.920
 It doesn't color your back passage, although it might do.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.920
 No.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.920
 It's more like the thing that comes out of your back passage.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.920
 I mean it's a bit of a stain on me.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.960
 How have you been eating it?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.440
 Have you been having the beetroot supposed to trees again?

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440
 Exactly.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440
 I've been smuggling.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440
 Do you get that then?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440
 Yeah, I do.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.800
 Yeah, I've stopped eating beetroot off the back of that.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.440
 I found it too scary to look down to a blood bath in my toilet.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.040
 But you are quite special.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.880
 So it's only like maximum 14% of people who get any kind of coloration from beetroot.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.880
 So it's quite lucky to have it.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.880
 Lucky you.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.040
 And what percentage is through the ages?

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.720
 We should say in case people start to panic at home, it does also come in the poo.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.560
 It comes back at both sides.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560
 Oh okay.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.280
 But it's, yeah and it's called beeturia, the condition and it's harmless but if you suddenly

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.000
 start doing it and you've never done it before.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.880
 So if suddenly you beetroot, you're wee red or you poo red and it hasn't happened before,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.760
 then you should get checked out because it might be an iron deficiency because the reason

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.840
 that most of us don't have red wee when we eat beetroot is because the iron reacts with

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.600
 the red pigment which is called better lane.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.120
 So any iron in our stomach reacts with that and so that creates a different compound

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.360
 which isn't red.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.320
 And so you might be iron deficient if you're not doing that.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.480
 That's interesting because you I know and also I don't like beetroot.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.640
 I never eat it and I love it.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.000
 So if I ever have iron deficiency, I'm going to be one of the first to know about it.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.200
 You are one of the first people on earth.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.000
 We could be an even guy to might be.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.720
 Yeah exactly, but you would never know right?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.720
 Yeah.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.520
 Maybe this is why I faint 15 times.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.600
 And it's only some lipsticks I think that can do it and it just happened that this lady

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.280
 was doing it because apparently most of them dissolve in fats and so once, even if you

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.880
 apply certain lipsticks lots of times a day, you might be alright.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.440
 We won't turn red but this will.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.280
 When we go on tar, we ask people to send their own fats and one of the most common ones

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.280
 that I get is that if you want to choose the perfect shade of nude lipstick that looks

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.480
 natural, then you should get the color that is the same color as your nipples.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.480
 Oh.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.480
 This is an unbelievably common fact that I get said.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.320
 It's so weird that it's one of the few that I get like five or six times every tar.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.320
 Wow.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.280
 It's because you keep wearing lipstick that really clashes with the rest of your face because

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.080
 I do the tar topless because I think he's got green nipples.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.440
 And this apparently is kind of half true.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.920
 So it came from, most people got it from a show called The Doctors on NBC.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.120
 They famously mentioned this and they say that it generally does work.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.200
 But then Washington University Medical Centre when asked about this did point out that your

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.720
 nipple color does change throughout your life.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.120
 So it's kind of an average works, but if your nipples have changed color recently, then

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.120
 maybe...

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.120
 Yeah.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.120
 Well, they go gray, don't they?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.120
 You age.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.120
 I have.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120
 That's right.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.440
 Yeah, and you should wear gray lipstick too.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.440
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.400
 So wait, should you take an average of your lifetime nipple color and always use that lipstick

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.000
 or should you have your lipstick vary in accordance with your nipple color?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.680
 I think you should go into the lipstick shop.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680
 Yeah.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.360
 And if you have a color of your nipples, then if it doesn't look right...

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.720
 I've tried that, but whenever I expose myself in lipstick shops, I get removed from the building.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.120
 What you need is a top that only exposes your nipple so you can subtly compare the lipstick

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120
 color to the nipple color.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.680
 I don't know how subtle that kind of top is going to be.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.560
 I've just got a thing, just as we were talking about beetroot before, because beetroot

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.920
 was actually a substitute for lipstick during the war, during the Second World War.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.880
 Yeah, so there was a big push that the English government did, which they had a slogan

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.320
 for, which was "Beauty is duty."

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.160
 And this was a thing because Hitler supposedly really disapproved of makeup.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.920
 So the British government wanted to make it a proud thing in the country.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.920
 And they released...

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.360
 There were certain lipsticks that were released during World War II that were called like

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.560
 "Regimental Red" or "Lips in Uniform."

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.880
 But this was before rationing became, you know, the materials were sort of depleting.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.880
 And so they stopped doing it.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.480
 But as a result, women still wanted to sort of keep up the appearance of makeup.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.080
 So beetroot juice was done in place of lipstick, and mascara and so on, and boot polish was

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.400
 used as well as...

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.560
 But yeah, it was interesting, you know, beetroot juice.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.520
 Yeah, didn't know I Hitler didn't like lipstick.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.520
 No.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.520
 Excuse the vegetarian.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.520
 He said that lipstick was evil because it was made from animal fat, rescued from sewage.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.880
 Ah, so wait a minute.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.320
 But it is kind of made with animal products, a lot of makeup, right?

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.240
 Yes, it is much less than used to be, but yes.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.760
 But the red in lipstick for centuries has come from these bugs, cochineal, yeah.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.760
 Cochineal, yeah.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.760
 Cochineal, yeah.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.760
 I think now they often make plant-based.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.760
 But yeah.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.720
 But in Hitler's time, they didn't use cochineal law.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.760
 I think maybe some times they did.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.760
 Not necessarily rescued from sewage, though.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.760
 They would have definitely.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.840
 But it's had this weird history lipstick where it's just gone in and out of fashion and

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.840
 popularity.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.960
 And it's been condemned and then praised and then condemned and then praised.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.000
 And so just before the Elizabethan period, it was basically evil.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.400
 So Catholic priests would say that, you know, a woman wearing lipstick was essentially

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.880
 the spawn of Satan.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.800
 You'd have to go to confession and confess that you'd worn lipstick.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.720
 And it was, I was thought as being deceitful, so you were deceiving men into falling in love

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.720
 with you.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.200
 And you could, it was grounds for a nulment, for instance, in a lot of places in Pennsylvania,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.200
 I think.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.560
 And in Britain for a time, it was grounds for a nulment.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.560
 It's grounds for nulment, yeah.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:03.000
 If you married a woman who had worn lipstick at some point while seducing you, it's false

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 advertising.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 It's false advertising.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 It's false advertising.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 The nulments were there.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.400
 I imagine there were a few, but they were mostly loopholes as they were looking for an

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.400
 nulment.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.400
 Yeah.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.400
 It wasn't any man who got home, woke up next to his wife the next morning, went, oh, my

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400
 god, what are they?

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.400
 Yeah.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.400
 Wait a minute.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.040
 Your nipples and lips are completely different colors.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.560
 So in Egypt, prostitutes had to wear lipstick.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.960
 And the reason being that if they didn't, they would be punished because it implied that

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.600
 they were deceitfully posing as ladies.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 Hmm.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.640
 God, it's just, it's a rough beat being a woman wearing lipstick or not wearing lipstick,

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.640
 isn't it?

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.640
 Yeah.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.040
 When you get your marriage cancelled or you get mistaken for a prostitute or...

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.080
 But then in other times, then you're really popular, like Queen Elizabeth loved it and

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.160
 so it became popular then.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.400
 So I think it's important, if you're a woman time-traveling, to know exactly what time

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.400
 period you've been dropped in.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.400
 Hmm.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.400
 So whether you wear the lipstick.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.360
 Also important to be a queen rather than a prostitute.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.360
 Yeah.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.760
 Generally speaking, you see a life.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.720
 If you did, if you wear a prostitute wearing lipstick in ancient Egypt or ancient Greece,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.800
 then you made it out of quite weird stuff.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.240
 But actually one reason why being a prostitute might have been better than a queen is that you

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.640
 couldn't afford the good stuff, which was actually often the materials that really

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.960
 damaged you in poison to you.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.560
 Oh, I learned and stuff, man.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.560
 Yeah.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.520
 So you made a prostitute, so they'd make it from sheep sweat, was a very popular apparently.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.120
 I don't even know how you harvest that.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.400
 And human saliva and crocodile excrement in ancient Greece.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.360
 I have the thing about crocodile excrement that I don't think it's actually crocodile excrement.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360
 No, you think it's...

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.360
 I think it's a metaphor for Egyptian soil.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.440
 I knew that you thought that for contraceptives, but do you think it's the same for this?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440
 Yeah.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440
 Maybe wrong, though.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.440
 I mean, it seems likely it doesn't.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.400
 It's actually going around French kissing a crocodile pat and then...

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.880
 What sheep sweat a metaphor for?

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.880
 Or something?

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.880
 I don't know.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.280
 How do you get sheep sweat?

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.280
 Do you ring them out?

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.280
 How do you...

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.280
 How do you get it?

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.080
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.760
 And that wouldn't be red, though, I imagine.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.880
 I think the earth would be red, but the sheep sweat was just going to make your lips taste

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.880
 a bit salty.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.880
 Wet.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.120
 Don't hippo sweat red or purple?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.120
 They do.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.080
 And they were very popular around there, don't want to get up and harvest hippo sweat.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.320
 Maybe you just for a bit of lipstick.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.320
 No, but you could...

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.720
 I suppose if you lived with a bunch of sisters, maybe you'd have a room where you kept the

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.920
 hippo and you just ran and smogged it quickly, and then ran away.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.920
 What?

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.920
 What was smoking the hippo?

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.920
 It's the quickest way to get the lipstick on.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.920
 Yeah.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.920
 No, it's hippo sweat.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.920
 Yes.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.920
 No, you're not kissing it in the mouth.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.920
 You're just wearing sweater.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.920
 Or you're just kissing the hippo's side.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.920
 Yeah.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.920
 Right.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.920
 Queen Elizabeth was wearing an inch of lipstick when she died, apparently.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.920
 No, she wasn't.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.920
 Come on.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.920
 Yeah.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.920
 And then...

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.920
 Do you know how big an inch is?

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.920
 It's ridiculous.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.920
 I'm just reporting what people reported at the time.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.240
 It's like those trout pups that you get these days when you put Botox in your lips, and

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.600
 that kind of makes them stick out about half a bench.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600
 She looked like one of those.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.680
 Botox was gone wrong.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.680
 She was lipstick gone wrong.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.680
 It can't be true, Anna.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.680
 It can't be true.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.520
 I think an inch is probably an exaggeration from the time.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.000
 You know, people are seeing a bit blurry when someone's died.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.840
 You would say the only way is the Earl of Essex, because he was one of her favourites.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.560
 And of course, that's a big lip look that's popular on that TV show.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560
 Of course.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.560
 That's very nice.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.560
 Of course.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:21.280
 Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.760
 My fact is that some maggots can jump 40 times their own length, but only in August.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.560
 Well, I know.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.560
 It's true.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560
 So we've just missed it.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.560
 If you want to see it, you've got to wait another year.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.560
 Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:41.280
 So this is a specific species of maggot or fly, because maggots are the larvae of fly.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.400
 It's called Asphondylia, and they're only a third of a centimeter long, but they've

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.960
 been observed jumping up to 12 centimeters, which is really impressive.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.960
 Yeah.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.240
 It's the equivalent of a human jumping 200 feet.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240
 Yeah.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.240
 Yeah.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.240
 Although, we always say this.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.240
 I know.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.800
 It's not an exact equivalent, because it's much easier for small things to jump these distances

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800
 of big things.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.360
 It's the equivalent of a miniaturised human jumping 12 centimeters.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.360
 Yeah.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.360
 And what's the...

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.360
 And what's the size of a maggot?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.360
 It's very impressive.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.040
 And are they practicing for when they fly?

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.040
 Is that...

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040
 Yeah, I do.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.040
 Yes, they are.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.040
 Yeah.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.120
 Um, no, it's actually an escape plan.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.800
 So they're hatched out onto these plants, and then they need to make a swift exit, because

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.480
 they're very easy prey when they're just sitting around on these plants.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.760
 So they need to jump quite far.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.240
 They're born in Gauls, you know, the larvae are laid in plants, the mother's lay the eggs

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.880
 in plants, and these create swelling school Gauls, and they hatch out of them.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.360
 So then they need to escape.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.120
 And the cool thing is, they have no legs, and yet they jump.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.120
 Yeah, how are they doing that?

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.120
 What?

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.200
 Like a slinky, is it sort of like the suppressed spring?

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.200
 Yeah, basically, yeah.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.200
 Cool.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.200
 They sort of improvise a leg.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200
 Uh.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:59.680
 I see you're improvising, man, and very good as it is, you don't suddenly sprout a leg.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.680
 No, you're right.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.200
 We don't do whole limb work.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.840
 Well, that's why he's recently been replaced with a maggot in his fantasies, isn't he?

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.880
 They sort of fold themselves up.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.280
 So you know how octopuses sometimes make artificial elbows, right?

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.920
 You know, they just fold their limb at a certain point.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.720
 So they do that, and they build up a load of pressure leaning against that slightly folded

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.240
 leg, and then they flick.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.920
 They release, and they flick themselves into the air.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.200
 But they also have, on either end, these kind of little hairs that when they touch each

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.400
 other, so when they bend forward, it's like touching your toes.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.000
 It's like an adhesive, so it holds on really strong.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.800
 And as they push all this liquid down into their bottom, the tension gets greater and

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.200
 greater, but they're still hanging on.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.200
 And when that snaps, they just fling into the air, yeah.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.200
 Nice.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.680
 So we have a very relatable octopus-based analogy to help me understand that better.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.680
 No.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.480
 Who knows the octopus elbow thing?

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.480
 I'm sure.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.480
 I've never heard of what we've talked about that.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.800
 We probably have, but it's pretty arcane, isn't it?

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.400
 People are going to remember all those things.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.400
 That's not it.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.400
 Yeah, you're right.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.640
 So a related fact is that octopus is sometimes improvised elbows, which is pretty cool.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.200
 Like, if you're chatting to me in the pub, you can say that because you know that I'm

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.200
 going to tell that.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.200
 Yeah.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.200
 Do not improvise your own limbs at home.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.120
 So we've missed the big one here, though.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.400
 Why just August?

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.400
 What's going on?

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.400
 One month of the year.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.640
 Is it because the football season's just started?

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.640
 That's right.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.640
 I'm really excited.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.640
 Yeah.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.640
 Do you know?

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.680
 I don't think we do know exactly why it is.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.400
 It may be because they hatch in August.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.400
 Yes.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.920
 And then after August, they've turned into flies.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.920
 Yeah.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.920
 And they don't need to do this jumping trick anymore.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.920
 Okay.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.920
 I think that's a bit of a...

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.920
 I'm genuinely not sure.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.120
 I did have a look at the paper and it wasn't actually very clear why this happens.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.120
 Okay.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.120
 Okay.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.480
 Currently, this study came after the group had a load of these gold maggots in a peatry

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480
 dish.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.160
 And then they came to look at them and there were only two left because they were jumping

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.160
 all around the office.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.160
 That's so good.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.920
 And they thought, "Oh, I'm going to have to probably study this."

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.920
 Oh.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920
 That's so funny.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.920
 Yeah.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.920
 maggots are really cool.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.920
 What?

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.920
 No.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.920
 Actually, they can get really hot.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920
 Go on.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:08.120
 Because when they eat, they increase their temperature because of all the digestive juices

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.920
 and they're kind of wriggling around and stuff like that.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.240
 And there's usually a load of them in one little place and they're all wriggling and they're

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.760
 all getting hotter and hotter and hotter and sometimes it can get so hot that they start

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.760
 to die.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.760
 Oh.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.520
 That doesn't have a funny jockey facty ending at all.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.360
 But sure it's God.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360
 But they do.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.560
 I think they can sometimes recognise that this is starting to happen.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.560
 They do.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.120
 Like, you know, the guy next to him has just died, so this is getting too hot.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.360
 So what they'll do is they'll, as a group, just retreat to a cooler place.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.040
 Well, actually, it's like the ones that are in, it's a bit like, you know, groups of

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.040
 penguins.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.920
 Again, this is the kind of thing that, me and I, and I, and our conversation about those people

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.920
 want.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.560
 So like, the ones on the outside, move to the inside, the ones to the inside, move to the

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.560
 outside.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560
 Yeah.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.560
 Yeah.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.560
 Kind of keep the temperature.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.560
 And do they do that?

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.560
 Yeah.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.560
 Imagine being in a restaurant and people are just going so crazy about the food, they start

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.560
 dying.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.040
 That is an exciting but also stressful restaurant opening, isn't it?

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.840
 I think it's one of being in a mosh pit and getting so hot people dying, which maybe

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.840
 they would.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.840
 Yeah.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.880
 But the thing that's like the penguins is also how they manage to eat so fast.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.720
 So maggots are useful for things like clearing up garbage, you can use maggots for clearing

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.720
 up our trash and stuff because they can consume stuff at an amazing rate for their size.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.400
 They can't carry it away quite as quickly as the bin man.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.000
 They're working up to it.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.640
 And your neighbours really hate you, by the way, Anna, pouring bags and bags of maggots

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.680
 over your bins every week.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.680
 It's got to stop.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.720
 They're very efficient, we've got to give them work.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.320
 So they do this and they are less efficient than the bin man, but the reason they are still

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.840
 efficient is that if you've got a lump of food, then they'll be, let's say, a hundred maggots

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:50.680
 and they'll form a little mountain that climbs up the mound and the maggots can eat solidly

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.440
 for about five minutes and then they get a bit tired and they need a break.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.880
 And so they'll be maggots pushing them further and further up the mound of food because

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.840
 their own maggots queuing behind them.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.560
 And then once they get to the top of the mound, then they've had enough food and they tumble

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.880
 off the top and back to the back of the queue.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.800
 And the next maggot is up there eating it.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800
 So amazing.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800
 Do you see what I mean?

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800
 It's like a cycle if you might see this.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.120
 It's like going up the escalator on the tube and you have to eat one doughnut every time

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.480
 you go three feet up, but then you get to the top and you're full of doughnuts and then

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.880
 you go down the aisle.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.920
 Sure, you also go down the aisle.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.120
 Like, this analogy did start to fall apart quite well this time.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:32.320
 So the other thing, they can, so this thing of mounting themselves up, I read an article

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.840
 saying that they can be mischievous sometimes, maggots and it's a bit of a stretch, but if

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:42.680
 you keep them in a glass enclosure without food and without a lid, they will organise

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.400
 themselves into a prison break because they will all get together in a corner and they

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.200
 will push up and up and up, they will pile up until the ones at the top can escape.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.200
 Cool.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.800
 So if you keep maggots, if you're a scientist, you sometimes have to have a moat around

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.800
 them to stop them escaping.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.800
 Wow.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.800
 Isn't that crazy?

00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800
 Yeah, that's awesome.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.320
 Besides who the poor Bruce Willis and Armageddon guy is who stays behind and gives them

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.320
 another leg out.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.320
 I don't know.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.320
 But I think most of them stay behind, don't they?

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.320
 Yeah.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.320
 It's really.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.680
 It's on a few brave souls making out.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.680
 Yeah.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.680
 Gosh.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.520
 I guess the most intelligent ones get to go out to town.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.520
 No, well, it'd be the strongest ones, but they've got to find a way of busting the rest

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.520
 out.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.520
 So who do you three?

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.520
 Of course.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.520
 Probably a group of maybe five or six you'd have one quite strong one, one really smart

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.520
 one, one sexy one.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.520
 Yeah.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:34.120
 Well, just to keep the others entertained.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.280
 Speaking of sexy, they can breathe through their bottoms.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.280
 Cool.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.280
 Cool.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.280
 And that's breathe.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.280
 Breathe.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.280
 Yeah, not breathe.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.000
 They breathe through their bottoms and that's had another way that they eat really quickly

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.560
 because they can just continuously eat, like you say, until they get tired because they're

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.560
 breathing out their bum.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.560
 Yeah.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.560
 So they don't need to breathe out their mouths.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.560
 That's great.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.560
 That's amazing.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.560
 That's so cool.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.240
 What they mean is they can't poo as quickly as we can because they need to break constantly

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.240
 during pooing.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.240
 Yeah.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.440
 But they don't switch back to mouth breathing while they're having a poo.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440
 Yeah.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.400
 So what they can't do is eat a hot dog and have a poo at the same time.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.400
 Actually, they can do that.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.400
 Yeah.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.400
 So that's why we are a higher being with maggots.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.400
 Yeah.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:22.680
 I mean, again, I'm not coming to any of your restaurant openings, that's the big pitch.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:29.120
 You'll notice your seats are also toilets and go, so they do love rotting meat.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.280
 And that was the cause of this massive misinformation campaign about maggots that went

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.640
 on until about 200 years ago, which is the spontaneous generation thing, which I don't

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.800
 think we've talked about before.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.080
 But so everyone used to think that maggots were spontaneously generated out of dead flesh

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.960
 because you'd have a rotting carcass and then maggots would suddenly appear and flies

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.560
 would come out of that.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.840
 And that's just how people thought life happened.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.600
 It would have made sense when you think of it if you didn't know we...

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.600
 It does.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.600
 You know.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.760
 There's absolutely no reason you wouldn't think it if you didn't know what we know now.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.240
 And it was finally proven in 1668 by this guy called Francesco Ready.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:09.160
 That flies come from maggots and flies aren't just spontaneously produced from carcasses.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.840
 And he did that by putting sort of rotting meat in jars and some of the jars he'd cover

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840
 up and some he wouldn't.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.600
 And he'd be like, look, life isn't in the jars that I covered up.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.200
 But he had to, because he was around about the time of Galileo and lots of other scientists

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.720
 who were getting in trouble with the church.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.240
 So every time he found something out like this, he had to go through the Bible and find

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.480
 a bit of Bible passage that supported it.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.560
 So he'd find the Bible passage that said, all life comes from life.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.560
 So it's okay.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.560
 Got some nice lines.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.560
 Oh, no.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.560
 Don't worry about it.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.560
 No.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.080
 I mean, it sounds like he would have been quite low on the church's inquisition list after

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.080
 Galileo.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.080
 Galileo is saying some pretty punchy things about the relationship between the earth and

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080
 the sun.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.080
 This is just a guy with meat jars.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.080
 I don't know.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.080
 I do.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.080
 It was a huge deal.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.080
 It really is.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.000
 Well, life couldn't come out of nothing questioning where life came from.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.440
 It was a massive deal.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.440
 Okay.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:01.200
 Because where did Jesus, not Jesus, where did God, Jesus wasn't a maggot, I think.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.600
 But how did God make life, if we're saying life always comes from life and you need the

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.240
 original thing, how did God make it in one day?

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.240
 Okay.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.240
 Okay.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.240
 Let's get him in for some inquisitioning.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.240
 Who's a big man?

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.240
 Yeah.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.080
 But his ideas, his ideas, he debunked.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:22.400
 The debunked idea is dated back to an aximander of myletus and he thought something really cool.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.640
 So he was seven century BC.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.040
 He was the first person who posited this idea of spontaneous generation of life.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.040
 And he thought how it happened was.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.920
 He looked at fetuses of children and he thought they look kind of fishy.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.680
 And so what he thought was that he thought that if water warmed up with the sun, then

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.760
 it sort of created a fish.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.760
 Okay.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.880
 So there'd be this reaction which created a living fish.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.920
 And then some fish gestated and gave birth to other fish.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.740
 And then others that decided to gestate for longer would eventually create a human.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:55.440
 And so he said fish would crawl up onto the bank when they were really far into their pregnancy,

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.580
 give birth to an adult human.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.680
 And then that adult human would go in and have his...

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.960
 He's kind of right in a way.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.040
 He's just missing out millions and millions of years of evolution.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.120
 He's kind of right that you end up with a human and you start with a fish.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.120
 Yeah.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.120
 You're right.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.120
 Yeah.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.120
 He just sped it up a lot.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120
 It was fast forward.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.120
 It was Darwin in fast forward.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:22.480
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.320
 My fact this week is that humans may have developed motion sickness to stop us falling out

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.320
 of trees.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.320
 Hmm.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:30.600
 And read the rest of it.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.360
 I've got just a theory but an interesting one for what you said round.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360
 Yeah.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.360
 Whenever I pitch that.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.360
 It gets a flat out.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.360
 No.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.360
 And here we are.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.360
 Just an idea.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.360
 Just a crazy idea.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:48.560
 An idea from scientists, not from some crazy yeti-finantic in Arkansas.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.560
 I'm sorry.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.040
 She doesn't mean that Mike.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.200
 The theory is about how we and other great apes lived up trees as many of them do.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.200
 Great apes, I guess.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.200
 I guess so.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.200
 Well, it's one of the greatest of all the apes.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.200
 All right.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.200
 Donald Trump.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.400
 Let's calm down.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.680
 And basically if we ever lived up trees millions of years ago, hundreds of thousands of

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.800
 years ago, then it was quite bad for us to want to climb really, really high up onto the

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.360
 really wobbly branches because that made it more likely that it would snap and you'd fall

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.560
 off and die.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.520
 And that's why we developed motion sickness.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.880
 And the fact is that chimps and things that still do live in trees do avoid going on those

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.320
 wobbly branches and lots of other animals do have motion sickness.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.080
 So it does seem to be like a risk aversion thing.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.960
 Because if you don't, the thing about falling out of a tree, I guess, is it's quite hard

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.040
 to learn from your mistakes gradually and evolve that gradually.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.080
 Because once you fall and out, you're either really severely injured or you're dead.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.080
 And they've looked, they looked into this.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.440
 I was reading a book about this and it talks about the actual frequency that elicits motion

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.960
 sickness, the amount of wobble, the pace of the wobble.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.680
 And it is about the same frequency as the trees that people would have been in would

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.680
 have swayed at.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:04.520
 So I've also read that it's about the same frequency as is generated by wind generated

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.520
 waves.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.400
 So there's another theory that it's from under the water because fish also get motion sickness.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.880
 And if you get wind blowing waves, it makes you feel a bit woozy.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.160
 You get to a certain point where actually it's quite dangerous.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.760
 And so you get away from those areas.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.760
 Same thing.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.760
 Fish have the aversion.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.400
 Because then you get disorientated if you're being swept around by the waves.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400
 Fish gets sick.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.400
 Yeah, fish gets sick.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.400
 No, that's nice.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.400
 Well, humans get lansick.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.400
 Yes.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.000
 If you go on a boat for too long and then you walk off the boat for a while, you feel really

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 woozy.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.200
 It's a French thing called mal de debaachmol, which is like mal de mer.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.200
 It's easy to say.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.640
 Mal de debaachmol is illness from disembarking.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.640
 Yeah.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.640
 I mean, you also can just call it lansickness.

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.240
 I mean, that's what the French do call it, I suppose.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.240
 Yeah.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.360
 There's a French podcast right now saying it is called lansickness.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:00.800
 It's so weird to think of all the ancestors of ours as in the, you know, eight-like ancestors

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.760
 of ours who didn't have motion sickness, who then died as a result because they were climbing.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.120
 They didn't know not to climb a wobbly tree.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.120
 Yeah.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.880
 And as a result, they died out because they're in many ways the superior beings.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.880
 Because they could climb so much higher.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.880
 They don't get seasick.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.880
 Yeah.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.880
 You're right.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.880
 You're right.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.880
 You're right.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.880
 You're right.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.880
 You're right.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.640
 And just on their seething as well, just because it's a fact, the word nausea comes from

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.400
 the same word as nautical or something like that, because it's to do with the sea.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.600
 Because it's to do with sea sickness originally.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.600
 Yeah.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.600
 Nails, ancient Greek.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.960
 Well, just on sea sickness as well.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:41.320
 I was reading that Nelson suffered severe sea sickness his entire life from age 12 onwards

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.320
 to his death.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.600
 The guy was constantly vomiting on both.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.840
 Why do you not become a treason exactly?

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.920
 Well, he wrote letters about it, didn't he?

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.920
 Yeah.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.560
 And his letters to his lovers, he'd sign off your affectionate seasick Nelson.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.400
 And he said, "I am ill every time it blows hard."

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.400
 And...

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.400
 Maybe this means something else.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.400
 Yeah.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.880
 That he was writing to his lovers.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880
 We're on clear.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.040
 He said, "Nothing but my love of the profession keeps me at sea for more than an hour."

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.400
 So you really love what you do, doesn't matter if you vomit throughout.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.200
 Do you know another great nautical hero who had sea sickness?

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.200
 Who?

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200
 Jacques Cousteau.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.840
 Well, Captain A. Hab.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.840
 It's entirely possible.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.640
 But it's the last Captain Bird's Eye.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.640
 Yeah.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.640
 He was really seasick.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.640
 Really?

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.640
 The fish finger guy.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.640
 The fish finger guy.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.640
 But was he an actual captain that one?

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.640
 Well, was he an actor?

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.640
 He was an actor.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640
 Oh, okay.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.640
 For TV Airvotes.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.640
 Sorry, sir.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.760
 But this was the big pitch where they unveiled him to the public.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.640
 His call Mitch Cummins, he was a South African.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.640
 And he really looked apart.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.520
 You know, great big bushy beard.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.400
 And probably looked like Captain Bird's Eye.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.400
 But then he got very recently replaced by a man called Riccardo Aserby, an Italian who

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.960
 is basically a model.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960
 He's really, really...

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.360
 He's too good looking to be Captain Bird's Eye.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.360
 Seriously?

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.360
 Yeah.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.360
 How bizarre.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.360
 And he's quite young as well.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.360
 And the whole thing just stinks.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.360
 Does he have a big gray beard?

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.360
 Doesn't he have a beard?

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.360
 He's got a beard.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.680
 So is it like a big white beard?

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.440
 It's more like an iron gray, hunky, modally beard.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.040
 If you want to get off with this guy, you just give him a call at me.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.040
 Yeah.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.040
 If you want a bird's eye view.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:23.400
 It's better than the fish finger.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:28.240
 The thing is that a lot of people get motion sickness now because we drive in cars, which

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.320
 we didn't evolve to do.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.160
 And people use VR stuff, like headset and stuff.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.800
 And that's a real problem with people getting motion sickness.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:43.600
 Apparently, there are some VR games where 100% of users get motion sickness, like literally

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.600
 everyone.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.880
 And usually for most games, it's between 40 and 70% of people get it.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.600
 So it's like a really common thing, motion sickness.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.080
 And yet admirably, like Rachel Ordenelson, they're so passionate about the pursuit that they

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.080
 will make this happen.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.760
 Exactly, my wife plays them all the time.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.160
 It's almost as if being in a virtual reality is preferable to be buried to me.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.760
 She's throwing up constantly, but...

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.760
 Does she write your list?

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.760
 But then she puts the VR set up.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.760
 Sure.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:15.200
 Does she write your letters from inside the game, saying, "Your affectionate seasick ballina,

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.840
 have you heard of the SS Bessamer?"

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.320
 This is a very cool anti-seasickness innovation from the Victorian times.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.160
 It was a steamer ship across the English channel for passengers.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160
 And it was experimental.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.120
 It was a guy called Henry Bessamer who invented it.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:38.080
 And the idea was it had a room inside it, which would be suspended using incredibly elaborate

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.680
 counterweight and counterbalances and all sorts of mechanics to keep it exactly in position

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.680
 while the ship moved up and down the waves and left to right.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.360
 Yeah.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.280
 So he built a model of it at its house, huge model, which could, you know, the thing would

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.400
 move around and the room would stay the same.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.000
 And it got a lot of investment.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.200
 And on its first trial, it couldn't quite sail properly.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.480
 I think partly due to this stuff inside it.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.720
 And it smashed into the pier at Calais.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.480
 It was slightly fixed.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.120
 And then on its side, he said, "Oh, we haven't had enough time to fix it properly."

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:18.800
 So it had only one public voyage, and it crashed into the Calais pier again.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.760
 Could it have a massive magnet in it or something?

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.160
 It was a disaster.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.160
 How was it?

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.560
 I wonder if that's the same Bessamer as did the Bessamer process for smelting aluminium or

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.560
 whatever it is.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.560
 I don't know.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.560
 Was that profound cock-up as well?

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.560
 It was.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.080
 Sounds like it doesn't know what he's doing.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.680
 He designed something that's not a boat, clearly, if it's just constantly crashing.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.680
 I don't know.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.680
 Was there nobody steering it?

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680
 It had people steering it.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.680
 You can't say it's not a boat just because it crashes.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.480
 You can't say Titanic is not a boat.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.680
 Not a boat.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.000
 Just a rock, as far as I'm concerned.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.600
 We should talk about what's actually going on.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.360
 So it's just the difference of information between what your eyes are seeing, when you're

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.640
 on a ship, this is.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:06.640
 So your eyes are seeing, let's say, a stable room, because you're in a ship room and you're

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.920
 moving with the ship, so it's all the same to you, but your body, your inner ear, can tell

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.920
 that you're moving around.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.080
 Actually, that's the case in all these things, right?

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:19.160
 So if you're in a car, it's the same, you're reading the book, which is still, but actually

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.160
 everything else is moving around you.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.040
 But there's a third thing as well.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.720
 So apart from your eyes and your inner ear, there's a third bit of your body, which is also

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:40.640
 getting sending you conflicting information about what it does, what you're saying, your eyes,

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.240
 your ears, and the little boxing bag at the back of your mouth, the uvula.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.240
 Yeah.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240
 Yeah.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.240
 You can imagine that with work.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.240
 If it's tilting over, look at it.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.240
 It's insane.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240
 Okay.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240
 No.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.240
 Great guess.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.240
 Great guess.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.240
 Is it somewhere, is it sort of in your crop somewhere?

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.240
 Oh, it's close.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.240
 You're so close.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.240
 Oh, is it in your bottom?

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.240
 If you're sitting down, it's in your bottom.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.360
 It's outside of my bottom when I've standing up, but inside my bottom when I sit down.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.360
 Your feet.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.440
 If you're standing up, you can tell this through your feet, and if you're sitting down

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.440
 through your bottom.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.440
 Got it.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:09.600
 And it's a sense called proprioception, and it's where, if you're swaying, there's more

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.680
 pressure on one side of your feet, and then on the other, you know what I mean, if your

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.480
 body senses this, and that is another thing that can give you motion sickness, or if you're

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.720
 sitting down, it's on your bottom.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.720
 Yeah.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.160
 And it's like when you're on a tube train, you know, you can feel the acceleration really

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.360
 stronger on one side, and it doesn't take off, yeah.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.360
 That's really quick.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:32.240
 And other things that get seasickness, I mean loads of stuff does really dot so dogs, people

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.680
 anyone who's had a dog will know that they get motion sickness, it's blood irritating in

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:41.680
 a car, mice, amphibians, fish who said frogs get it quite badly.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.480
 So they tested this, but they often test it by putting them in parabolic conditions.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.960
 So it's simulating weightlessness by sort of spinning or spinning them round to simulate

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.880
 this sort of concentric movement.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:57.360
 And so I was reading a study about whether frogs get motion sick, and they said the way we

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.080
 find out is we put them in these containers, and then we subject them to parabolic flight,

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.480
 and then we open the containers, and the presence of vomitus in their containers after

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.640
 flight will be used to indicate if they get motion sick.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.920
 My wife, we brought her up far today, but she's going on one of these parabolic flights

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.920
 next year.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.920
 Why?

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.920
 Yeah.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.920
 Yeah.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:18.920
 So I wonder if she'll vomit.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.920
 Yeah.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.400
 So what you can tell is by the presence of vomitus in the...

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.400
 Vomitus.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.400
 I mean, is that just vomitus?

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.400
 It's Latin for vomit.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.400
 I mean, why do they need to still say vomitus?

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.400
 It's bizarre.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.880
 I looked this up, so I thought they must have made that up.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.560
 Yep, it's just vomitus, the definition is the stuff that comes out of your mouth when

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.560
 you vomit.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.560
 It's vomit.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.560
 Wow.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.360
 But anyway, it turns out they are different to us and how they see sick themselves.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.920
 Oh, we talked about frogs.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.920
 Frogs?

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.720
 Yes, because they don't throw up at the time, they throw up afterwards, which is actually

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.720
 quite considerate.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.320
 They will wait until the car's stopped or they won't do it on the roller coaster, but usually

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.800
 happens between a few minutes and 24 hours afterwards.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.560
 Almost like a hangover vomit, right?

00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.560
 Yes.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:04.320
 I was reading that the guys who built the Golden Gate Bridge, the builders supposedly were

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.920
 put on a special diet by the leader of the construction works guy called Strauss.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:14.600
 I can't find any detail though about what that diet was, but the idea was the diet was

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.600
 for motion sickness.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.000
 It was for dizziness because people were very scared when they were building this bridge.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.800
 You know, you had to climb very high, you had to get to, and so supposedly there was a diet

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.800
 to stop that.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:28.200
 But a really cool extra thing about that was what they ended up doing was they built a giant

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:33.560
 net under the bridge, cost $130,000, and it was like a circus trapeze net.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.280
 The idea was the dizziness would have been a huge factor in the construction pace that was

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.280
 going on.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.880
 And by building this little netting, it meant that people could go and work harder with

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:49.760
 the knowledge that they would probably survive if they fell off.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.760
 And 19 people did fall off.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.760
 Oh my god, did they all live?

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.480
 Yeah, and they became what was known as part of the Halfway to Hell Club.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.480
 Yeah.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480
 When was that built, did you see that?

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.480
 It was 19.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.480
 Oh, 36.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.480
 Oh, 36.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.480
 Okay.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.840
 So they probably wouldn't have had any effective actual medicines at that time to deal with

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.680
 sea sickness, because the drugs weren't invented until the 50s, and the drugs just switched

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.680
 off the information coming from the inner ear that we've today.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.600
 So the Victorian Cures evolved sucking lemons, which did absolutely no good.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.600
 No.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.600
 Just did not help.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.200
 There were loads of cures which didn't do any good, actually.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.320
 Opium, I think, did some good, but opium's gone for everything.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.320
 Yeah.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.800
 Something that removes you mentally from any kind of reality is probably going to stop

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.800
 you being aware of your sea sickness.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.800
 Exactly.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:38.400
 But if you're the captain of the ship, unfortunately, that's why it crashed.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.640
 There are some special glasses you can buy that have been made by Citroen, their car

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.640
 company.

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.080
 They're called C-Troen.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.080
 Very C-Troen.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.080
 Oh, nice.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080
 C-Troen, C-Troen.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:57.320
 I don't think they thought of the C-Troen, C-Troen, but yeah, they have this blue liquid inside

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:02.440
 them, and it gives you an artificial horizon, because a lot of it is being able to see the

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.440
 horizon, isn't it?

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.320
 Being able to see that moving at the same way as you're feeling it's moving.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.360
 So whichever way you move, it makes the horizon look like it's in that direction.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:14.680
 Apparently, they do work after about 10 to 12 minutes, your motion sickness will just disappear.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.920
 That's really clever.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.640
 But what is the point in them, because the only time that you're not looking at the horizon,

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:25.200
 the reason you get travel sick is when you're reading or something, and then that, therefore,

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.920
 you're not looking outside, you're not seeing the world go by, but if you're wearing these

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.640
 weird horizon glasses, can you read a book with them?

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.720
 I guess that's what I want to know.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.720
 Can you read a book?

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.720
 Can you read a book?

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.720
 I think you're not wearing the Citroen.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.720
 Can you?

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.720
 I think so.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.480
 And the answer to them actually is because when we have self-driving cars, people won't be

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.840
 driving and looking at the road, they'll be playing video games or they'll be reading books

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.840
 or doing whatever.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:51.480
 So you need to come up with a new way of dealing with that, because otherwise, whenever

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.120
 you open any self-driving car, it'll be full of monitors.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:01.880
 But just every time you got to any destination, you still have the door, and a sea of monitors

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.880
 comes out.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:08.080
 Well, the future is terrible.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.600
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:17.960
 My fact this week is to honor the US Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia, Virginia's George

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:24.320
 Mason University School of Law, renamed itself Antonin Scalia School of Law, then immediately

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.640
 renamed itself again after it was pointed out that the acronym would be Asshole.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.640
 That's right.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.640
 Fair enough.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.640
 Yeah.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.640
 Asshole.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.640
 Asshole.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.640
 Asshole.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.640
 I said Asshole, didn't I?

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640
 Yeah.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.640
 I went too far on that one.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.640
 Asshole.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.640
 Asshole.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.320
 So this was, I think, the way it worked out is they sort of announced this, let's say, on

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.400
 a Thursday, and by Tuesday, there was so much public ridicule online that the school's

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.880
 dean made an announcement that it was going to be renamed off the back of it.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.640
 And they named it because they just got a massive donation from a few people, right?

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:03.320
 They got $30 million donation. 10 million of it came from the Charles Koch Foundation.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.040
 So they could have called it the Charles Koch School of Law, which would have been much

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.040
 better.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.040
 That's true.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.360
 It's now the Antonin Scalia Law School, but that's still ASLS, which looks in an uncharitable

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.760
 light like Assholes.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.760
 Mm.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.760
 What?

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.760
 What?

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.760
 I see when I see that.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760
 Oh, yes.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760
 Okay.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.760
 Some more stuff on acronyms.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.760
 Yeah.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:29.720
 What the acronym or what the word spam stands for, you know, the food stuff, rather than

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.720
 this.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.200
 I would think it's something.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.600
 Is it something ham?

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.600
 Okay.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.600
 What would it be?

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.600
 Yes.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.600
 Spurious ham.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.600
 Spurious ham.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.600
 That's it.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.560
 Well, most people would tell you that it stands for Spiced Ham.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.520
 That's what everyone thought it used to mean, but then according to spam the company, they

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:55.600
 now tell us that it stands for Sizzle Park and mm.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.600
 What?

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:01.400
 So, which I imagine might be a back formation.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.400
 Yeah.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.600
 Is it, is it saying Sizzle, comma, pork?

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:12.080
 Actually, they're saying Sizzle, full stop, pork, full stop, and full stop, mm, full stop.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.080
 Mm.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.840
 I also say mm to that, but in a more skeptical way, I think that they would have wanted.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.120
 You always come to the question mark at the end every time.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.120
 Wow.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.080
 That's a terrible back formation, yeah, it's so clunky.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.360
 So there's a difference between an acronym and an initialism.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.320
 I think it's very important that we nail down.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.320
 Yeah.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.320
 Okay.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:39.080
 So an acronym, well, some, all of these things are acronyms, but some people say, it's not

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.560
 really hard and fast, that initialisms are things where it's just strings of letters.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:53.680
 So the FBI is an initialism, YMCA, YMCA, yeah, so that's the difference, right?

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.120
 If it became a word.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.120
 Exactly.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:03.080
 So if people started saying, I go to the IMPCA or SCUBA, SCUBA is initials, but it's also become

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.080
 a word in its own right.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.080
 So that's an acronym.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.240
 Contained underwater breathing equipment.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.240
 Apparatus.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.040
 That would be SCUBA.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.040
 SCUBA.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.040
 SCUBA.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.640
 Also, you get the very exciting marriage of the two, don't you?

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.520
 This is where the two come together.

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.160
 It's a bit frowned upon in the communities of initialisms with acronyms.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.240
 It's like Romeo and Juliet, but you've got CD-ROM, of course.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.240
 Okay.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.720
 You've got JPEG, and that's it, actually.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.400
 There are only two Romeo and Juliet's of the initials that were in the world.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.400
 Okay.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.400
 What's the deal with a JPEG then?

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.360
 So a JPEG is J, is a joint photographic expert's group.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.600
 So part of it, you're just saying the letter and part of it, you're saying a word.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.600
 Exactly.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.600
 Wow.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.600
 Holy.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.600
 Wow, God, that is more amazement than that deserves.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.600
 Wow, I just didn't know what it was.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.600
 You couldn't say JPEG, though.

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:51.600
 And now JPEG, though.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.600
 You couldn't say JPEG.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.600
 You couldn't say KIDROM.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.600
 KIDROM.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.600
 KIDROM.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.600
 You could, but we just don't.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.600
 In fact, we rarely refer to CD-ROMs.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.600
 Speak for us.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.720
 I've got a few things on just name changes.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.720
 Okay.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:12.680
 So one of the things I guess it comes up a lot in newspapers is that Peter and the animal

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:18.040
 rights group, they constantly want places to change their name if there's something that's

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040
 associated.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.040
 For example.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.200
 We did on the podcast that they wanted to change great fry up to great vegan fry up.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.200
 That's right.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.200
 That's right.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.200
 Yeah, exactly.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.680
 So there's a town that they wanted to have changed.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.520
 It's a village called Wool, it's an English village.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.760
 They wanted it to be changed to vegan wool.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.760
 That was their big pitch.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.760
 Did they?

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.760
 No, they didn't.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.680
 In fact, I can't find a single instance where people got a letter from Peter saying change

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.680
 your name.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.680
 They went absolutely.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.680
 I've not found that yet.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.960
 There's a place called Leatherhead, which they wanted to be changed to Pleatherhead, which

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:55.400
 Pleatherhead is an imitation synthetic leather alternative, so that was quite nice.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.480
 There was the chicken dinner road, which is a road they wanted to call chicken roads.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.480
 It happens all the time, but my favorite one is sausage street.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.480
 So sausage street.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.360
 This is a town, which is in France.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.600
 Sorry, there's a town in France called sausage street.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.600
 No, sorry, sorry.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.240
 There's a street in a town in France.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:18.840
 It's called Rudella Sousie, which is sausage street.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:23.960
 So they wrote a letter to them, say, can you change it from sausage street?

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.960
 And they obviously refuse.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.520
 The town may say absolutely not.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.640
 But someone from the town also pointed out that the change would be completely out of place

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.480
 because it is not named after the sausage itself, but rather the sausage street is off the

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:42.680
 back of a woman who they called the sausage, called Suzanne Tessier, and she lived in the

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.680
 area.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.200
 Do we know why they called her the sausage street?

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.200
 Yeah, we do.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.200
 We do.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:51.240
 Because when she walked, she stooped over like a sausage bending, and that was the name.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.440
 I'll let Maggie to about to jump.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.440
 Exactly.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.480
 So the street supposedly is named after Susan the sausage Tessier.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.480
 No.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.480
 Yeah.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.480
 That's amazing.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.480
 That is so funny.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:08.320
 So if you have a name of a company, and you're not sure if it's going to be okay, or if it's

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:14.680
 going to be a bit of another asshole debacle, then asshole, sorry, then you just need to

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.400
 try and register it because the government will tell you if it's too rude.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:21.440
 So you have the its company's house, and it's the government body which registers company

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.440
 names.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.160
 And every year they released their list of names that they said no to.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:30.240
 So this year they banned 87 company names that they refused to register.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:34.600
 And so when we didn't get, so first of all there was purple helmet bikes.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.600
 Right.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.040
 Which, so I sort of kind of I think guess we did a podcast the other week about what we

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:45.120
 called people from West Bromwich Albion, and purple helmet is a synonym for that.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.120
 Okay.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.120
 Oh, that is.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.120
 It's a convoluted way of explaining.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.120
 No, but that's a great way of getting listeners to go to the previous episode.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.560
 And in that episode, we referenced the one before, and it's a constant change.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.200
 And so that's purple helmet bikes, and there's also company names that weren't allowed.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.400
 Fanny's cabal, this wasn't allowed.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.400
 Okay.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.040
 Solid systems, which I just like, I like the idea of hiring someone to fix your computer when

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.040
 they call it.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.040
 Solid systems.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.040
 Then just fucking, I'm going to get a new one.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.040
 Royal nuts.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.040
 Aina's beauty.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.040
 Aina's beauty.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.040
 Aina's beauty.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.520
 Who thought that would get her?

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:25.360
 It's not exactly a crafty bit of wordplay like purple helmet bikes, isn't it?

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.320
 It does what it says on the tin.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.160
 It puts a bit of redness down like that.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.240
 Sit on a beat shoot for three hours.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.640
 Is there a first line of advice?

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.640
 Oh, my god.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.640
 Nick has knackers knackers.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.640
 Don't know what they do.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.640
 I like to know.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.080
 Because the problem is, we don't find now what they do, because these companies don't

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.080
 get registered.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:48.400
 Don't they make underwear door knockers and they kill horses?

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:55.440
 It was three best friends with three very different talents.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.480
 In 2015, lots of people called Brian protested after Thames Valley police announced that they

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:05.920
 were going to change the name of one of their police horses from Brian to they said a god-like

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.920
 name such as Hercules.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:13.000
 And people, so this was, if the horse passed its tests to be a good police horse basically

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.680
 and to be a qualified police horse.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.160
 And various people called Brian kicked up a fuss.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.320
 So Brian Lewis from Ascot said, I think it's outrageous.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.360
 Brian is a good name for a horse.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.360
 Brian.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.360
 It's not god-like though, is it?

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.200
 He's very famously, he's not the son of god, he's a very naughty mind.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.080
 Yes, that's such a good point.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.560
 There was another guy called Brian Pulson from Bracknell who said there is no way they should

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.960
 be changing the name.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.960
 Every horse should be called Brian.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:41.200
 He's such an extreme alternative.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.840
 What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.440
 Pulsuring all Brian's coming up the back, we're Brian, we're Brian, we're Brian, we're

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:50.240
 Brian, we're Brian, we're Brian, we're Brian.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.640
 Okay, that's it.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:52.640
 That is all of our facts.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.160
