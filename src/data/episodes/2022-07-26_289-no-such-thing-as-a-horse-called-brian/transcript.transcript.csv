00:00:00,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:22,coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:26,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Aniches enski, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:00:26,00:00:31,James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:31,00:00:37,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go, starting with you, James."
00:00:37,00:00:43,Okay my fact this week is that using too much red lipstick can make your urine turn red.
00:00:43,00:00:47,That's weird so it gets into your kidney somehow.
00:00:47,00:00:48,"Yeah, I reckon."
00:00:48,00:00:49,How do you wear lipstick?
00:00:49,00:00:52,"I must have worn it wrong before at times I've worn it, not wearing it on the outside,"
00:00:52,00:00:53,are you?
00:00:53,00:00:56,"I screwed it up, you put it on your tongue didn't you?"
00:00:56,00:01:04,So I found this on the website of improbable research our friends who also make the Ig Nobel
00:01:04,00:01:10,Prizes and this was a case for 28 year old woman who turned up at a nephrology clinic with
00:01:10,00:01:15,"a five day history of passing red colored urine but she didn't have any other symptoms,"
00:01:15,00:01:19,"she had no pain, she didn't have chills, she didn't have anything else that could have"
00:01:19,00:01:25,caused this like blood in your urine for instance and the doctor said that the only noticeable
00:01:25,00:01:30,"feature was her bright red lipstick, which I think is a bit harsh actually, I'm sure she"
00:01:30,00:01:35,had lots of other great features but anyway they tested all the other things like her liver
00:01:35,00:01:40,function and her blood counts and everything like that and they found out that she would
00:01:40,00:01:45,apply her lipstick 20 to 25 times a day and they worked out that it was the lipstick that
00:01:45,00:01:48,was causing the urine to turn red.
00:01:48,00:01:52,It kind of makes sense because like lots of things can make your urine turn colors like
00:01:52,00:01:56,lots of food so if she's accidentally ingesting this stuff then it could happen.
00:01:56,00:02:01,So that's an abnormal number of times to reapply lipstick over the course of the day?
00:02:01,00:02:03,It's certainly more than I've ever done.
00:02:03,00:02:04,Wow.
00:02:04,00:02:09,It's weird because just the idea that it's like say beetroot not known to color your urine
00:02:09,00:02:14,I don't think so much as the back passage when you go to the toilet.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"No, it doesn't pass."
00:02:16,00:02:17,What?
00:02:17,00:02:21,"It's more commonly known to color your urine, yeah it is."
00:02:21,00:02:24,So discreet the way you said back passage.
00:02:24,00:02:26,"It doesn't color your back passage, although it might do."
00:02:26,00:02:27,No.
00:02:27,00:02:29,It's more like the thing that comes out of your back passage.
00:02:29,00:02:31,I mean it's a bit of a stain on me.
00:02:31,00:02:33,How have you been eating it?
00:02:33,00:02:39,Have you been having the beetroot supposed to trees again?
00:02:39,00:02:40,Exactly.
00:02:40,00:02:41,I've been smuggling.
00:02:41,00:02:43,Do you get that then?
00:02:43,00:02:44,"Yeah, I do."
00:02:44,00:02:45,"Yeah, I've stopped eating beetroot off the back of that."
00:02:45,00:02:49,I found it too scary to look down to a blood bath in my toilet.
00:02:49,00:02:51,But you are quite special.
00:02:51,00:02:55,So it's only like maximum 14% of people who get any kind of coloration from beetroot.
00:02:55,00:02:57,So it's quite lucky to have it.
00:02:57,00:02:58,Lucky you.
00:02:58,00:03:03,And what percentage is through the ages?
00:03:03,00:03:06,"We should say in case people start to panic at home, it does also come in the poo."
00:03:06,00:03:08,It comes back at both sides.
00:03:08,00:03:09,Oh okay.
00:03:09,00:03:15,"But it's, yeah and it's called beeturia, the condition and it's harmless but if you suddenly"
00:03:15,00:03:17,start doing it and you've never done it before.
00:03:17,00:03:20,"So if suddenly you beetroot, you're wee red or you poo red and it hasn't happened before,"
00:03:20,00:03:24,then you should get checked out because it might be an iron deficiency because the reason
00:03:24,00:03:29,that most of us don't have red wee when we eat beetroot is because the iron reacts with
00:03:29,00:03:31,the red pigment which is called better lane.
00:03:31,00:03:36,So any iron in our stomach reacts with that and so that creates a different compound
00:03:36,00:03:37,which isn't red.
00:03:37,00:03:40,And so you might be iron deficient if you're not doing that.
00:03:40,00:03:44,That's interesting because you I know and also I don't like beetroot.
00:03:44,00:03:47,I never eat it and I love it.
00:03:47,00:03:52,"So if I ever have iron deficiency, I'm going to be one of the first to know about it."
00:03:52,00:03:55,You are one of the first people on earth.
00:03:55,00:03:57,We could be an even guy to might be.
00:03:57,00:03:58,"Yeah exactly, but you would never know right?"
00:03:58,00:03:59,Yeah.
00:03:59,00:04:04,Maybe this is why I faint 15 times.
00:04:04,00:04:08,And it's only some lipsticks I think that can do it and it just happened that this lady
00:04:08,00:04:13,"was doing it because apparently most of them dissolve in fats and so once, even if you"
00:04:13,00:04:16,"apply certain lipsticks lots of times a day, you might be alright."
00:04:16,00:04:18,We won't turn red but this will.
00:04:18,00:04:23,"When we go on tar, we ask people to send their own fats and one of the most common ones"
00:04:23,00:04:29,that I get is that if you want to choose the perfect shade of nude lipstick that looks
00:04:29,00:04:33,"natural, then you should get the color that is the same color as your nipples."
00:04:33,00:04:34,Oh.
00:04:34,00:04:37,This is an unbelievably common fact that I get said.
00:04:37,00:04:41,It's so weird that it's one of the few that I get like five or six times every tar.
00:04:41,00:04:42,Wow.
00:04:42,00:04:46,It's because you keep wearing lipstick that really clashes with the rest of your face because
00:04:46,00:04:53,I do the tar topless because I think he's got green nipples.
00:04:53,00:04:55,And this apparently is kind of half true.
00:04:55,00:05:01,"So it came from, most people got it from a show called The Doctors on NBC."
00:05:01,00:05:06,They famously mentioned this and they say that it generally does work.
00:05:06,00:05:10,But then Washington University Medical Centre when asked about this did point out that your
00:05:10,00:05:13,nipple color does change throughout your life.
00:05:13,00:05:18,"So it's kind of an average works, but if your nipples have changed color recently, then"
00:05:18,00:05:19,maybe...
00:05:19,00:05:20,Yeah.
00:05:20,00:05:21,"Well, they go gray, don't they?"
00:05:21,00:05:22,You age.
00:05:22,00:05:23,I have.
00:05:23,00:05:24,That's right.
00:05:24,00:05:26,"Yeah, and you should wear gray lipstick too."
00:05:26,00:05:27,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:05:27,00:05:32,"So wait, should you take an average of your lifetime nipple color and always use that lipstick"
00:05:32,00:05:35,or should you have your lipstick vary in accordance with your nipple color?
00:05:35,00:05:37,I think you should go into the lipstick shop.
00:05:37,00:05:38,Yeah.
00:05:38,00:05:42,"And if you have a color of your nipples, then if it doesn't look right..."
00:05:42,00:05:46,"I've tried that, but whenever I expose myself in lipstick shops, I get removed from the building."
00:05:46,00:05:51,What you need is a top that only exposes your nipple so you can subtly compare the lipstick
00:05:51,00:05:52,color to the nipple color.
00:05:52,00:05:55,I don't know how subtle that kind of top is going to be.
00:05:55,00:05:58,"I've just got a thing, just as we were talking about beetroot before, because beetroot"
00:05:58,00:06:03,"was actually a substitute for lipstick during the war, during the Second World War."
00:06:03,00:06:07,"Yeah, so there was a big push that the English government did, which they had a slogan"
00:06:07,00:06:10,"for, which was ""Beauty is duty."""
00:06:10,00:06:15,And this was a thing because Hitler supposedly really disapproved of makeup.
00:06:15,00:06:18,So the British government wanted to make it a proud thing in the country.
00:06:18,00:06:19,And they released...
00:06:19,00:06:22,There were certain lipsticks that were released during World War II that were called like
00:06:22,00:06:25,"""Regimental Red"" or ""Lips in Uniform."""
00:06:25,00:06:29,"But this was before rationing became, you know, the materials were sort of depleting."
00:06:29,00:06:30,And so they stopped doing it.
00:06:30,00:06:35,"But as a result, women still wanted to sort of keep up the appearance of makeup."
00:06:35,00:06:41,"So beetroot juice was done in place of lipstick, and mascara and so on, and boot polish was"
00:06:41,00:06:42,used as well as...
00:06:42,00:06:44,"But yeah, it was interesting, you know, beetroot juice."
00:06:44,00:06:47,"Yeah, didn't know I Hitler didn't like lipstick."
00:06:47,00:06:48,No.
00:06:48,00:06:49,Excuse the vegetarian.
00:06:49,00:06:54,"He said that lipstick was evil because it was made from animal fat, rescued from sewage."
00:06:54,00:06:56,"Ah, so wait a minute."
00:06:56,00:07:00,"But it is kind of made with animal products, a lot of makeup, right?"
00:07:00,00:07:03,"Yes, it is much less than used to be, but yes."
00:07:03,00:07:08,"But the red in lipstick for centuries has come from these bugs, cochineal, yeah."
00:07:08,00:07:09,"Cochineal, yeah."
00:07:09,00:07:10,"Cochineal, yeah."
00:07:10,00:07:11,I think now they often make plant-based.
00:07:11,00:07:12,But yeah.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"But in Hitler's time, they didn't use cochineal law."
00:07:14,00:07:16,I think maybe some times they did.
00:07:16,00:07:18,"Not necessarily rescued from sewage, though."
00:07:18,00:07:20,They would have definitely.
00:07:20,00:07:24,But it's had this weird history lipstick where it's just gone in and out of fashion and
00:07:24,00:07:25,popularity.
00:07:25,00:07:28,And it's been condemned and then praised and then condemned and then praised.
00:07:28,00:07:33,"And so just before the Elizabethan period, it was basically evil."
00:07:33,00:07:36,"So Catholic priests would say that, you know, a woman wearing lipstick was essentially"
00:07:36,00:07:37,the spawn of Satan.
00:07:37,00:07:41,You'd have to go to confession and confess that you'd worn lipstick.
00:07:41,00:07:47,"And it was, I was thought as being deceitful, so you were deceiving men into falling in love"
00:07:47,00:07:48,with you.
00:07:48,00:07:52,"And you could, it was grounds for a nulment, for instance, in a lot of places in Pennsylvania,"
00:07:52,00:07:53,I think.
00:07:53,00:07:55,"And in Britain for a time, it was grounds for a nulment."
00:07:55,00:07:56,"It's grounds for nulment, yeah."
00:07:56,00:08:03,"If you married a woman who had worn lipstick at some point while seducing you, it's false"
00:08:03,00:08:04,advertising.
00:08:04,00:08:05,It's false advertising.
00:08:05,00:08:06,It's false advertising.
00:08:06,00:08:07,The nulments were there.
00:08:07,00:08:12,"I imagine there were a few, but they were mostly loopholes as they were looking for an"
00:08:12,00:08:13,nulment.
00:08:13,00:08:14,Yeah.
00:08:14,00:08:17,"It wasn't any man who got home, woke up next to his wife the next morning, went, oh, my"
00:08:17,00:08:18,"god, what are they?"
00:08:18,00:08:19,Yeah.
00:08:19,00:08:20,Wait a minute.
00:08:20,00:08:24,Your nipples and lips are completely different colors.
00:08:24,00:08:28,"So in Egypt, prostitutes had to wear lipstick."
00:08:28,00:08:31,"And the reason being that if they didn't, they would be punished because it implied that"
00:08:31,00:08:34,they were deceitfully posing as ladies.
00:08:34,00:08:35,Hmm.
00:08:35,00:08:39,"God, it's just, it's a rough beat being a woman wearing lipstick or not wearing lipstick,"
00:08:39,00:08:40,isn't it?
00:08:40,00:08:41,Yeah.
00:08:41,00:08:44,When you get your marriage cancelled or you get mistaken for a prostitute or...
00:08:44,00:08:48,"But then in other times, then you're really popular, like Queen Elizabeth loved it and"
00:08:48,00:08:49,so it became popular then.
00:08:49,00:08:53,"So I think it's important, if you're a woman time-traveling, to know exactly what time"
00:08:53,00:08:54,period you've been dropped in.
00:08:54,00:08:55,Hmm.
00:08:55,00:08:56,So whether you wear the lipstick.
00:08:56,00:08:59,Also important to be a queen rather than a prostitute.
00:08:59,00:09:00,Yeah.
00:09:00,00:09:04,"Generally speaking, you see a life."
00:09:04,00:09:09,"If you did, if you wear a prostitute wearing lipstick in ancient Egypt or ancient Greece,"
00:09:09,00:09:11,then you made it out of quite weird stuff.
00:09:11,00:09:15,But actually one reason why being a prostitute might have been better than a queen is that you
00:09:15,00:09:19,"couldn't afford the good stuff, which was actually often the materials that really"
00:09:19,00:09:20,damaged you in poison to you.
00:09:20,00:09:22,"Oh, I learned and stuff, man."
00:09:22,00:09:23,Yeah.
00:09:23,00:09:27,"So you made a prostitute, so they'd make it from sheep sweat, was a very popular apparently."
00:09:27,00:09:29,I don't even know how you harvest that.
00:09:29,00:09:33,And human saliva and crocodile excrement in ancient Greece.
00:09:33,00:09:37,I have the thing about crocodile excrement that I don't think it's actually crocodile excrement.
00:09:37,00:09:38,"No, you think it's..."
00:09:38,00:09:41,I think it's a metaphor for Egyptian soil.
00:09:41,00:09:46,"I knew that you thought that for contraceptives, but do you think it's the same for this?"
00:09:46,00:09:47,Yeah.
00:09:47,00:09:48,"Maybe wrong, though."
00:09:48,00:09:49,"I mean, it seems likely it doesn't."
00:09:49,00:09:52,It's actually going around French kissing a crocodile pat and then...
00:09:52,00:09:53,What sheep sweat a metaphor for?
00:09:53,00:09:54,Or something?
00:09:54,00:09:55,I don't know.
00:09:55,00:09:57,How do you get sheep sweat?
00:09:57,00:09:58,Do you ring them out?
00:09:58,00:09:59,How do you...
00:09:59,00:10:00,How do you get it?
00:10:00,00:10:03,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:10:03,00:10:04,"And that wouldn't be red, though, I imagine."
00:10:04,00:10:08,"I think the earth would be red, but the sheep sweat was just going to make your lips taste"
00:10:08,00:10:09,a bit salty.
00:10:09,00:10:10,Wet.
00:10:10,00:10:13,Don't hippo sweat red or purple?
00:10:13,00:10:14,They do.
00:10:14,00:10:18,"And they were very popular around there, don't want to get up and harvest hippo sweat."
00:10:18,00:10:20,Maybe you just for a bit of lipstick.
00:10:20,00:10:21,"No, but you could..."
00:10:21,00:10:23,"I suppose if you lived with a bunch of sisters, maybe you'd have a room where you kept the"
00:10:23,00:10:26,"hippo and you just ran and smogged it quickly, and then ran away."
00:10:26,00:10:27,What?
00:10:27,00:10:28,What was smoking the hippo?
00:10:28,00:10:29,It's the quickest way to get the lipstick on.
00:10:29,00:10:30,Yeah.
00:10:30,00:10:31,"No, it's hippo sweat."
00:10:31,00:10:32,Yes.
00:10:32,00:10:33,"No, you're not kissing it in the mouth."
00:10:33,00:10:34,You're just wearing sweater.
00:10:34,00:10:35,Or you're just kissing the hippo's side.
00:10:35,00:10:36,Yeah.
00:10:36,00:10:37,Right.
00:10:37,00:10:39,"Queen Elizabeth was wearing an inch of lipstick when she died, apparently."
00:10:39,00:10:40,"No, she wasn't."
00:10:40,00:10:41,Come on.
00:10:41,00:10:42,Yeah.
00:10:42,00:10:43,And then...
00:10:43,00:10:44,Do you know how big an inch is?
00:10:44,00:10:45,It's ridiculous.
00:10:45,00:10:47,I'm just reporting what people reported at the time.
00:10:47,00:10:52,"It's like those trout pups that you get these days when you put Botox in your lips, and"
00:10:52,00:10:54,that kind of makes them stick out about half a bench.
00:10:54,00:10:55,She looked like one of those.
00:10:55,00:10:56,Botox was gone wrong.
00:10:56,00:10:57,She was lipstick gone wrong.
00:10:57,00:10:58,"It can't be true, Anna."
00:10:58,00:10:59,It can't be true.
00:10:59,00:11:02,I think an inch is probably an exaggeration from the time.
00:11:02,00:11:05,"You know, people are seeing a bit blurry when someone's died."
00:11:05,00:11:09,"You would say the only way is the Earl of Essex, because he was one of her favourites."
00:11:09,00:11:12,"And of course, that's a big lip look that's popular on that TV show."
00:11:12,00:11:13,Of course.
00:11:13,00:11:14,That's very nice.
00:11:14,00:11:15,Of course.
00:11:15,00:11:21,"Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:11:21,00:11:26,"My fact is that some maggots can jump 40 times their own length, but only in August."
00:11:26,00:11:30,"Well, I know."
00:11:30,00:11:31,It's true.
00:11:31,00:11:32,So we've just missed it.
00:11:32,00:11:33,"If you want to see it, you've got to wait another year."
00:11:33,00:11:34,"Yeah, I'm sorry."
00:11:34,00:11:41,"So this is a specific species of maggot or fly, because maggots are the larvae of fly."
00:11:41,00:11:45,"It's called Asphondylia, and they're only a third of a centimeter long, but they've"
00:11:45,00:11:48,"been observed jumping up to 12 centimeters, which is really impressive."
00:11:48,00:11:49,Yeah.
00:11:49,00:11:52,It's the equivalent of a human jumping 200 feet.
00:11:52,00:11:53,Yeah.
00:11:53,00:11:54,Yeah.
00:11:54,00:11:55,"Although, we always say this."
00:11:55,00:11:56,I know.
00:11:56,00:11:59,"It's not an exact equivalent, because it's much easier for small things to jump these distances"
00:11:59,00:12:00,of big things.
00:12:00,00:12:04,It's the equivalent of a miniaturised human jumping 12 centimeters.
00:12:04,00:12:05,Yeah.
00:12:05,00:12:06,And what's the...
00:12:06,00:12:07,And what's the size of a maggot?
00:12:07,00:12:08,It's very impressive.
00:12:08,00:12:10,And are they practicing for when they fly?
00:12:10,00:12:11,Is that...
00:12:11,00:12:12,"Yeah, I do."
00:12:12,00:12:13,"Yes, they are."
00:12:13,00:12:14,Yeah.
00:12:14,00:12:18,"Um, no, it's actually an escape plan."
00:12:18,00:12:21,"So they're hatched out onto these plants, and then they need to make a swift exit, because"
00:12:21,00:12:26,they're very easy prey when they're just sitting around on these plants.
00:12:26,00:12:28,So they need to jump quite far.
00:12:28,00:12:33,"They're born in Gauls, you know, the larvae are laid in plants, the mother's lay the eggs"
00:12:33,00:12:36,"in plants, and these create swelling school Gauls, and they hatch out of them."
00:12:36,00:12:38,So then they need to escape.
00:12:38,00:12:43,"And the cool thing is, they have no legs, and yet they jump."
00:12:43,00:12:45,"Yeah, how are they doing that?"
00:12:45,00:12:46,What?
00:12:46,00:12:48,"Like a slinky, is it sort of like the suppressed spring?"
00:12:48,00:12:49,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:49,00:12:50,"Yeah, basically, yeah."
00:12:50,00:12:51,Cool.
00:12:51,00:12:52,They sort of improvise a leg.
00:12:52,00:12:53,Uh.
00:12:53,00:12:59,"I see you're improvising, man, and very good as it is, you don't suddenly sprout a leg."
00:12:59,00:13:00,"No, you're right."
00:13:00,00:13:02,We don't do whole limb work.
00:13:02,00:13:06,"Well, that's why he's recently been replaced with a maggot in his fantasies, isn't he?"
00:13:06,00:13:08,They sort of fold themselves up.
00:13:08,00:13:12,"So you know how octopuses sometimes make artificial elbows, right?"
00:13:12,00:13:14,"You know, they just fold their limb at a certain point."
00:13:14,00:13:19,"So they do that, and they build up a load of pressure leaning against that slightly folded"
00:13:19,00:13:21,"leg, and then they flick."
00:13:21,00:13:22,"They release, and they flick themselves into the air."
00:13:22,00:13:27,"But they also have, on either end, these kind of little hairs that when they touch each"
00:13:27,00:13:29,"other, so when they bend forward, it's like touching your toes."
00:13:29,00:13:33,"It's like an adhesive, so it holds on really strong."
00:13:33,00:13:36,"And as they push all this liquid down into their bottom, the tension gets greater and"
00:13:36,00:13:38,"greater, but they're still hanging on."
00:13:38,00:13:41,"And when that snaps, they just fling into the air, yeah."
00:13:41,00:13:42,Nice.
00:13:42,00:13:45,So we have a very relatable octopus-based analogy to help me understand that better.
00:13:45,00:13:46,No.
00:13:46,00:13:49,Who knows the octopus elbow thing?
00:13:49,00:13:50,I'm sure.
00:13:50,00:13:51,I've never heard of what we've talked about that.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"We probably have, but it's pretty arcane, isn't it?"
00:13:53,00:13:55,People are going to remember all those things.
00:13:55,00:13:56,That's not it.
00:13:56,00:13:57,"Yeah, you're right."
00:13:57,00:14:01,"So a related fact is that octopus is sometimes improvised elbows, which is pretty cool."
00:14:01,00:14:05,"Like, if you're chatting to me in the pub, you can say that because you know that I'm"
00:14:05,00:14:07,going to tell that.
00:14:07,00:14:08,Yeah.
00:14:08,00:14:10,Do not improvise your own limbs at home.
00:14:10,00:14:11,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:11,00:14:13,"So we've missed the big one here, though."
00:14:13,00:14:14,Why just August?
00:14:14,00:14:15,What's going on?
00:14:15,00:14:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:16,00:14:17,One month of the year.
00:14:17,00:14:18,Is it because the football season's just started?
00:14:18,00:14:19,That's right.
00:14:19,00:14:20,I'm really excited.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Yeah.
00:14:21,00:14:22,Do you know?
00:14:22,00:14:24,I don't think we do know exactly why it is.
00:14:24,00:14:26,It may be because they hatch in August.
00:14:26,00:14:27,Yes.
00:14:27,00:14:28,"And then after August, they've turned into flies."
00:14:28,00:14:29,Yeah.
00:14:29,00:14:31,And they don't need to do this jumping trick anymore.
00:14:31,00:14:32,Okay.
00:14:32,00:14:34,I think that's a bit of a...
00:14:34,00:14:35,I'm genuinely not sure.
00:14:35,00:14:39,I did have a look at the paper and it wasn't actually very clear why this happens.
00:14:39,00:14:40,Okay.
00:14:40,00:14:41,Okay.
00:14:41,00:14:47,"Currently, this study came after the group had a load of these gold maggots in a peatry"
00:14:47,00:14:48,dish.
00:14:48,00:14:51,And then they came to look at them and there were only two left because they were jumping
00:14:51,00:14:52,all around the office.
00:14:52,00:14:53,That's so good.
00:14:53,00:14:54,"And they thought, ""Oh, I'm going to have to probably study this."""
00:14:54,00:14:55,Oh.
00:14:55,00:14:56,That's so funny.
00:14:56,00:14:57,Yeah.
00:14:57,00:14:58,maggots are really cool.
00:14:58,00:14:59,What?
00:14:59,00:15:00,No.
00:15:00,00:15:01,"Actually, they can get really hot."
00:15:01,00:15:02,Go on.
00:15:02,00:15:08,"Because when they eat, they increase their temperature because of all the digestive juices"
00:15:08,00:15:10,and they're kind of wriggling around and stuff like that.
00:15:10,00:15:14,And there's usually a load of them in one little place and they're all wriggling and they're
00:15:14,00:15:17,all getting hotter and hotter and hotter and sometimes it can get so hot that they start
00:15:17,00:15:18,to die.
00:15:18,00:15:19,Oh.
00:15:19,00:15:22,That doesn't have a funny jockey facty ending at all.
00:15:22,00:15:24,But sure it's God.
00:15:24,00:15:25,But they do.
00:15:25,00:15:28,I think they can sometimes recognise that this is starting to happen.
00:15:28,00:15:29,They do.
00:15:29,00:15:32,"Like, you know, the guy next to him has just died, so this is getting too hot."
00:15:32,00:15:35,"So what they'll do is they'll, as a group, just retreat to a cooler place."
00:15:35,00:15:40,"Well, actually, it's like the ones that are in, it's a bit like, you know, groups of"
00:15:40,00:15:41,penguins.
00:15:41,00:15:44,"Again, this is the kind of thing that, me and I, and I, and our conversation about those people"
00:15:44,00:15:45,want.
00:15:45,00:15:48,"So like, the ones on the outside, move to the inside, the ones to the inside, move to the"
00:15:48,00:15:49,outside.
00:15:49,00:15:50,Yeah.
00:15:50,00:15:51,Yeah.
00:15:51,00:15:52,Kind of keep the temperature.
00:15:52,00:15:53,And do they do that?
00:15:53,00:15:54,Yeah.
00:15:54,00:15:55,"Imagine being in a restaurant and people are just going so crazy about the food, they start"
00:15:55,00:15:56,dying.
00:15:56,00:15:59,"That is an exciting but also stressful restaurant opening, isn't it?"
00:15:59,00:16:02,"I think it's one of being in a mosh pit and getting so hot people dying, which maybe"
00:16:02,00:16:03,they would.
00:16:03,00:16:04,Yeah.
00:16:04,00:16:07,But the thing that's like the penguins is also how they manage to eat so fast.
00:16:07,00:16:12,"So maggots are useful for things like clearing up garbage, you can use maggots for clearing"
00:16:12,00:16:16,up our trash and stuff because they can consume stuff at an amazing rate for their size.
00:16:16,00:16:19,They can't carry it away quite as quickly as the bin man.
00:16:19,00:16:23,They're working up to it.
00:16:23,00:16:27,"And your neighbours really hate you, by the way, Anna, pouring bags and bags of maggots"
00:16:27,00:16:29,over your bins every week.
00:16:29,00:16:30,It's got to stop.
00:16:30,00:16:35,"They're very efficient, we've got to give them work."
00:16:35,00:16:40,"So they do this and they are less efficient than the bin man, but the reason they are still"
00:16:40,00:16:44,"efficient is that if you've got a lump of food, then they'll be, let's say, a hundred maggots"
00:16:44,00:16:50,and they'll form a little mountain that climbs up the mound and the maggots can eat solidly
00:16:50,00:16:53,for about five minutes and then they get a bit tired and they need a break.
00:16:53,00:16:56,And so they'll be maggots pushing them further and further up the mound of food because
00:16:56,00:16:58,their own maggots queuing behind them.
00:16:58,00:17:02,"And then once they get to the top of the mound, then they've had enough food and they tumble"
00:17:02,00:17:04,off the top and back to the back of the queue.
00:17:04,00:17:06,And the next maggot is up there eating it.
00:17:06,00:17:07,So amazing.
00:17:07,00:17:08,Do you see what I mean?
00:17:08,00:17:09,It's like a cycle if you might see this.
00:17:09,00:17:14,It's like going up the escalator on the tube and you have to eat one doughnut every time
00:17:14,00:17:18,"you go three feet up, but then you get to the top and you're full of doughnuts and then"
00:17:18,00:17:19,you go down the aisle.
00:17:19,00:17:22,"Sure, you also go down the aisle."
00:17:22,00:17:26,"Like, this analogy did start to fall apart quite well this time."
00:17:26,00:17:32,"So the other thing, they can, so this thing of mounting themselves up, I read an article"
00:17:32,00:17:36,"saying that they can be mischievous sometimes, maggots and it's a bit of a stretch, but if"
00:17:36,00:17:42,"you keep them in a glass enclosure without food and without a lid, they will organise"
00:17:42,00:17:47,themselves into a prison break because they will all get together in a corner and they
00:17:47,00:17:51,"will push up and up and up, they will pile up until the ones at the top can escape."
00:17:51,00:17:52,Cool.
00:17:52,00:17:55,"So if you keep maggots, if you're a scientist, you sometimes have to have a moat around"
00:17:55,00:17:56,them to stop them escaping.
00:17:56,00:17:57,Wow.
00:17:57,00:17:58,Isn't that crazy?
00:17:58,00:17:59,"Yeah, that's awesome."
00:17:59,00:18:04,Besides who the poor Bruce Willis and Armageddon guy is who stays behind and gives them
00:18:04,00:18:05,another leg out.
00:18:05,00:18:06,I don't know.
00:18:06,00:18:07,"But I think most of them stay behind, don't they?"
00:18:07,00:18:08,Yeah.
00:18:08,00:18:09,It's really.
00:18:09,00:18:10,It's on a few brave souls making out.
00:18:10,00:18:11,Yeah.
00:18:11,00:18:12,Gosh.
00:18:12,00:18:15,I guess the most intelligent ones get to go out to town.
00:18:15,00:18:19,"No, well, it'd be the strongest ones, but they've got to find a way of busting the rest"
00:18:19,00:18:20,out.
00:18:20,00:18:21,So who do you three?
00:18:21,00:18:22,Of course.
00:18:22,00:18:26,"Probably a group of maybe five or six you'd have one quite strong one, one really smart"
00:18:26,00:18:27,"one, one sexy one."
00:18:27,00:18:28,Yeah.
00:18:28,00:18:34,"Well, just to keep the others entertained."
00:18:34,00:18:36,"Speaking of sexy, they can breathe through their bottoms."
00:18:36,00:18:37,Cool.
00:18:37,00:18:38,Cool.
00:18:38,00:18:39,And that's breathe.
00:18:39,00:18:40,Breathe.
00:18:40,00:18:41,"Yeah, not breathe."
00:18:41,00:18:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:42,00:18:46,They breathe through their bottoms and that's had another way that they eat really quickly
00:18:46,00:18:49,"because they can just continuously eat, like you say, until they get tired because they're"
00:18:49,00:18:50,breathing out their bum.
00:18:50,00:18:51,Yeah.
00:18:51,00:18:52,So they don't need to breathe out their mouths.
00:18:52,00:18:53,That's great.
00:18:53,00:18:54,That's amazing.
00:18:54,00:18:55,That's so cool.
00:18:55,00:18:59,What they mean is they can't poo as quickly as we can because they need to break constantly
00:18:59,00:19:00,during pooing.
00:19:00,00:19:01,Yeah.
00:19:01,00:19:05,But they don't switch back to mouth breathing while they're having a poo.
00:19:05,00:19:06,Yeah.
00:19:06,00:19:09,So what they can't do is eat a hot dog and have a poo at the same time.
00:19:09,00:19:10,"Actually, they can do that."
00:19:10,00:19:11,Yeah.
00:19:11,00:19:14,So that's why we are a higher being with maggots.
00:19:14,00:19:15,Yeah.
00:19:15,00:19:22,"I mean, again, I'm not coming to any of your restaurant openings, that's the big pitch."
00:19:22,00:19:29,"You'll notice your seats are also toilets and go, so they do love rotting meat."
00:19:29,00:19:33,And that was the cause of this massive misinformation campaign about maggots that went
00:19:33,00:19:37,"on until about 200 years ago, which is the spontaneous generation thing, which I don't"
00:19:37,00:19:39,think we've talked about before.
00:19:39,00:19:44,But so everyone used to think that maggots were spontaneously generated out of dead flesh
00:19:44,00:19:47,because you'd have a rotting carcass and then maggots would suddenly appear and flies
00:19:47,00:19:49,would come out of that.
00:19:49,00:19:51,And that's just how people thought life happened.
00:19:51,00:19:54,It would have made sense when you think of it if you didn't know we...
00:19:54,00:19:55,It does.
00:19:55,00:19:56,You know.
00:19:56,00:19:58,There's absolutely no reason you wouldn't think it if you didn't know what we know now.
00:19:58,00:20:03,And it was finally proven in 1668 by this guy called Francesco Ready.
00:20:03,00:20:09,That flies come from maggots and flies aren't just spontaneously produced from carcasses.
00:20:09,00:20:12,And he did that by putting sort of rotting meat in jars and some of the jars he'd cover
00:20:12,00:20:13,up and some he wouldn't.
00:20:13,00:20:17,"And he'd be like, look, life isn't in the jars that I covered up."
00:20:17,00:20:21,"But he had to, because he was around about the time of Galileo and lots of other scientists"
00:20:21,00:20:23,who were getting in trouble with the church.
00:20:23,00:20:27,"So every time he found something out like this, he had to go through the Bible and find"
00:20:27,00:20:29,a bit of Bible passage that supported it.
00:20:29,00:20:32,"So he'd find the Bible passage that said, all life comes from life."
00:20:32,00:20:33,So it's okay.
00:20:33,00:20:34,Got some nice lines.
00:20:34,00:20:35,"Oh, no."
00:20:35,00:20:36,Don't worry about it.
00:20:36,00:20:37,No.
00:20:37,00:20:41,"I mean, it sounds like he would have been quite low on the church's inquisition list after"
00:20:41,00:20:42,Galileo.
00:20:42,00:20:45,Galileo is saying some pretty punchy things about the relationship between the earth and
00:20:45,00:20:46,the sun.
00:20:46,00:20:47,This is just a guy with meat jars.
00:20:47,00:20:48,I don't know.
00:20:48,00:20:49,I do.
00:20:49,00:20:50,It was a huge deal.
00:20:50,00:20:51,It really is.
00:20:51,00:20:54,"Well, life couldn't come out of nothing questioning where life came from."
00:20:54,00:20:55,It was a massive deal.
00:20:55,00:20:56,Okay.
00:20:56,00:21:01,"Because where did Jesus, not Jesus, where did God, Jesus wasn't a maggot, I think."
00:21:01,00:21:05,"But how did God make life, if we're saying life always comes from life and you need the"
00:21:05,00:21:08,"original thing, how did God make it in one day?"
00:21:08,00:21:09,Okay.
00:21:09,00:21:10,Okay.
00:21:10,00:21:11,Let's get him in for some inquisitioning.
00:21:11,00:21:12,Who's a big man?
00:21:12,00:21:13,Yeah.
00:21:13,00:21:16,"But his ideas, his ideas, he debunked."
00:21:16,00:21:22,The debunked idea is dated back to an aximander of myletus and he thought something really cool.
00:21:22,00:21:23,So he was seven century BC.
00:21:23,00:21:28,He was the first person who posited this idea of spontaneous generation of life.
00:21:28,00:21:29,And he thought how it happened was.
00:21:29,00:21:32,He looked at fetuses of children and he thought they look kind of fishy.
00:21:32,00:21:37,"And so what he thought was that he thought that if water warmed up with the sun, then"
00:21:37,00:21:39,it sort of created a fish.
00:21:39,00:21:40,Okay.
00:21:40,00:21:42,So there'd be this reaction which created a living fish.
00:21:42,00:21:45,And then some fish gestated and gave birth to other fish.
00:21:45,00:21:50,And then others that decided to gestate for longer would eventually create a human.
00:21:50,00:21:55,"And so he said fish would crawl up onto the bank when they were really far into their pregnancy,"
00:21:55,00:21:57,give birth to an adult human.
00:21:57,00:21:59,And then that adult human would go in and have his...
00:21:59,00:22:00,He's kind of right in a way.
00:22:00,00:22:05,He's just missing out millions and millions of years of evolution.
00:22:05,00:22:08,He's kind of right that you end up with a human and you start with a fish.
00:22:08,00:22:09,Yeah.
00:22:09,00:22:10,You're right.
00:22:10,00:22:11,Yeah.
00:22:11,00:22:12,He just sped it up a lot.
00:22:12,00:22:13,It was fast forward.
00:22:13,00:22:14,It was Darwin in fast forward.
00:22:14,00:22:22,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna."
00:22:22,00:22:27,My fact this week is that humans may have developed motion sickness to stop us falling out
00:22:27,00:22:28,of trees.
00:22:28,00:22:29,Hmm.
00:22:29,00:22:30,And read the rest of it.
00:22:30,00:22:34,I've got just a theory but an interesting one for what you said round.
00:22:34,00:22:35,Yeah.
00:22:35,00:22:36,Whenever I pitch that.
00:22:36,00:22:37,It gets a flat out.
00:22:37,00:22:38,No.
00:22:38,00:22:39,And here we are.
00:22:39,00:22:40,Just an idea.
00:22:40,00:22:41,Just a crazy idea.
00:22:41,00:22:48,"An idea from scientists, not from some crazy yeti-finantic in Arkansas."
00:22:48,00:22:49,I'm sorry.
00:22:49,00:22:53,She doesn't mean that Mike.
00:22:53,00:22:58,The theory is about how we and other great apes lived up trees as many of them do.
00:22:58,00:22:59,"Great apes, I guess."
00:22:59,00:23:00,I guess so.
00:23:00,00:23:02,"Well, it's one of the greatest of all the apes."
00:23:02,00:23:03,All right.
00:23:03,00:23:04,Donald Trump.
00:23:04,00:23:05,Let's calm down.
00:23:05,00:23:08,"And basically if we ever lived up trees millions of years ago, hundreds of thousands of"
00:23:08,00:23:12,"years ago, then it was quite bad for us to want to climb really, really high up onto the"
00:23:12,00:23:16,really wobbly branches because that made it more likely that it would snap and you'd fall
00:23:16,00:23:17,off and die.
00:23:17,00:23:20,And that's why we developed motion sickness.
00:23:20,00:23:24,And the fact is that chimps and things that still do live in trees do avoid going on those
00:23:24,00:23:28,wobbly branches and lots of other animals do have motion sickness.
00:23:28,00:23:31,So it does seem to be like a risk aversion thing.
00:23:31,00:23:34,"Because if you don't, the thing about falling out of a tree, I guess, is it's quite hard"
00:23:34,00:23:39,to learn from your mistakes gradually and evolve that gradually.
00:23:39,00:23:43,"Because once you fall and out, you're either really severely injured or you're dead."
00:23:43,00:23:44,"And they've looked, they looked into this."
00:23:44,00:23:49,I was reading a book about this and it talks about the actual frequency that elicits motion
00:23:49,00:23:52,"sickness, the amount of wobble, the pace of the wobble."
00:23:52,00:23:56,And it is about the same frequency as the trees that people would have been in would
00:23:56,00:23:57,have swayed at.
00:23:57,00:24:04,So I've also read that it's about the same frequency as is generated by wind generated
00:24:04,00:24:05,waves.
00:24:05,00:24:10,So there's another theory that it's from under the water because fish also get motion sickness.
00:24:10,00:24:13,"And if you get wind blowing waves, it makes you feel a bit woozy."
00:24:13,00:24:17,You get to a certain point where actually it's quite dangerous.
00:24:17,00:24:19,And so you get away from those areas.
00:24:19,00:24:20,Same thing.
00:24:20,00:24:21,Fish have the aversion.
00:24:21,00:24:24,Because then you get disorientated if you're being swept around by the waves.
00:24:24,00:24:25,Fish gets sick.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"Yeah, fish gets sick."
00:24:26,00:24:27,"No, that's nice."
00:24:27,00:24:29,"Well, humans get lansick."
00:24:29,00:24:30,Yes.
00:24:30,00:24:34,"If you go on a boat for too long and then you walk off the boat for a while, you feel really"
00:24:34,00:24:35,woozy.
00:24:35,00:24:39,"It's a French thing called mal de debaachmol, which is like mal de mer."
00:24:39,00:24:40,It's easy to say.
00:24:40,00:24:42,Mal de debaachmol is illness from disembarking.
00:24:42,00:24:43,Yeah.
00:24:43,00:24:45,"I mean, you also can just call it lansickness."
00:24:45,00:24:49,"I mean, that's what the French do call it, I suppose."
00:24:49,00:24:50,Yeah.
00:24:50,00:24:54,There's a French podcast right now saying it is called lansickness.
00:24:54,00:25:00,"It's so weird to think of all the ancestors of ours as in the, you know, eight-like ancestors"
00:25:00,00:25:05,"of ours who didn't have motion sickness, who then died as a result because they were climbing."
00:25:05,00:25:08,They didn't know not to climb a wobbly tree.
00:25:08,00:25:09,Yeah.
00:25:09,00:25:12,"And as a result, they died out because they're in many ways the superior beings."
00:25:12,00:25:13,Because they could climb so much higher.
00:25:13,00:25:14,They don't get seasick.
00:25:14,00:25:15,Yeah.
00:25:15,00:25:16,You're right.
00:25:16,00:25:17,You're right.
00:25:17,00:25:18,You're right.
00:25:18,00:25:19,You're right.
00:25:19,00:25:20,You're right.
00:25:20,00:25:25,"And just on their seething as well, just because it's a fact, the word nausea comes from"
00:25:25,00:25:29,"the same word as nautical or something like that, because it's to do with the sea."
00:25:29,00:25:31,Because it's to do with sea sickness originally.
00:25:31,00:25:32,Yeah.
00:25:32,00:25:33,"Nails, ancient Greek."
00:25:33,00:25:34,"Well, just on sea sickness as well."
00:25:34,00:25:41,I was reading that Nelson suffered severe sea sickness his entire life from age 12 onwards
00:25:41,00:25:42,to his death.
00:25:42,00:25:44,The guy was constantly vomiting on both.
00:25:44,00:25:48,Why do you not become a treason exactly?
00:25:48,00:25:50,"Well, he wrote letters about it, didn't he?"
00:25:50,00:25:51,Yeah.
00:25:51,00:25:56,"And his letters to his lovers, he'd sign off your affectionate seasick Nelson."
00:25:56,00:25:59,"And he said, ""I am ill every time it blows hard."""
00:25:59,00:26:00,And...
00:26:00,00:26:01,Maybe this means something else.
00:26:01,00:26:02,Yeah.
00:26:02,00:26:04,That he was writing to his lovers.
00:26:04,00:26:05,We're on clear.
00:26:05,00:26:09,"He said, ""Nothing but my love of the profession keeps me at sea for more than an hour."""
00:26:09,00:26:12,"So you really love what you do, doesn't matter if you vomit throughout."
00:26:12,00:26:16,Do you know another great nautical hero who had sea sickness?
00:26:16,00:26:17,Who?
00:26:17,00:26:18,Jacques Cousteau.
00:26:18,00:26:19,"Well, Captain A. Hab."
00:26:19,00:26:20,It's entirely possible.
00:26:20,00:26:23,But it's the last Captain Bird's Eye.
00:26:23,00:26:24,Yeah.
00:26:24,00:26:25,He was really seasick.
00:26:25,00:26:26,Really?
00:26:26,00:26:27,The fish finger guy.
00:26:27,00:26:28,The fish finger guy.
00:26:28,00:26:30,But was he an actual captain that one?
00:26:30,00:26:31,"Well, was he an actor?"
00:26:31,00:26:32,He was an actor.
00:26:32,00:26:33,"Oh, okay."
00:26:33,00:26:34,For TV Airvotes.
00:26:34,00:26:35,"Sorry, sir."
00:26:35,00:26:38,But this was the big pitch where they unveiled him to the public.
00:26:38,00:26:41,"His call Mitch Cummins, he was a South African."
00:26:41,00:26:42,And he really looked apart.
00:26:42,00:26:44,"You know, great big bushy beard."
00:26:44,00:26:46,And probably looked like Captain Bird's Eye.
00:26:46,00:26:51,"But then he got very recently replaced by a man called Riccardo Aserby, an Italian who"
00:26:51,00:26:52,is basically a model.
00:26:52,00:26:53,"He's really, really..."
00:26:53,00:26:56,He's too good looking to be Captain Bird's Eye.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Seriously?
00:26:57,00:26:58,Yeah.
00:26:58,00:26:59,How bizarre.
00:26:59,00:27:00,And he's quite young as well.
00:27:00,00:27:01,And the whole thing just stinks.
00:27:01,00:27:02,Does he have a big gray beard?
00:27:02,00:27:03,Doesn't he have a beard?
00:27:03,00:27:04,He's got a beard.
00:27:04,00:27:06,So is it like a big white beard?
00:27:06,00:27:09,"It's more like an iron gray, hunky, modally beard."
00:27:09,00:27:12,"If you want to get off with this guy, you just give him a call at me."
00:27:12,00:27:13,Yeah.
00:27:13,00:27:17,If you want a bird's eye view.
00:27:17,00:27:23,It's better than the fish finger.
00:27:23,00:27:28,"The thing is that a lot of people get motion sickness now because we drive in cars, which"
00:27:28,00:27:30,we didn't evolve to do.
00:27:30,00:27:33,"And people use VR stuff, like headset and stuff."
00:27:33,00:27:36,And that's a real problem with people getting motion sickness.
00:27:36,00:27:43,"Apparently, there are some VR games where 100% of users get motion sickness, like literally"
00:27:43,00:27:44,everyone.
00:27:44,00:27:48,"And usually for most games, it's between 40 and 70% of people get it."
00:27:48,00:27:51,"So it's like a really common thing, motion sickness."
00:27:51,00:27:56,"And yet admirably, like Rachel Ordenelson, they're so passionate about the pursuit that they"
00:27:56,00:27:57,will make this happen.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"Exactly, my wife plays them all the time."
00:27:58,00:28:03,It's almost as if being in a virtual reality is preferable to be buried to me.
00:28:03,00:28:05,"She's throwing up constantly, but..."
00:28:05,00:28:06,Does she write your list?
00:28:06,00:28:08,But then she puts the VR set up.
00:28:08,00:28:09,Sure.
00:28:09,00:28:15,"Does she write your letters from inside the game, saying, ""Your affectionate seasick ballina,"
00:28:15,00:28:17,"have you heard of the SS Bessamer?"""
00:28:17,00:28:23,This is a very cool anti-seasickness innovation from the Victorian times.
00:28:23,00:28:27,It was a steamer ship across the English channel for passengers.
00:28:27,00:28:28,And it was experimental.
00:28:28,00:28:31,It was a guy called Henry Bessamer who invented it.
00:28:31,00:28:38,"And the idea was it had a room inside it, which would be suspended using incredibly elaborate"
00:28:38,00:28:42,counterweight and counterbalances and all sorts of mechanics to keep it exactly in position
00:28:42,00:28:46,while the ship moved up and down the waves and left to right.
00:28:46,00:28:48,Yeah.
00:28:48,00:28:52,"So he built a model of it at its house, huge model, which could, you know, the thing would"
00:28:52,00:28:54,move around and the room would stay the same.
00:28:54,00:28:56,And it got a lot of investment.
00:28:56,00:29:00,"And on its first trial, it couldn't quite sail properly."
00:29:00,00:29:02,I think partly due to this stuff inside it.
00:29:02,00:29:04,And it smashed into the pier at Calais.
00:29:04,00:29:06,It was slightly fixed.
00:29:06,00:29:11,"And then on its side, he said, ""Oh, we haven't had enough time to fix it properly."""
00:29:11,00:29:18,"So it had only one public voyage, and it crashed into the Calais pier again."
00:29:18,00:29:22,Could it have a massive magnet in it or something?
00:29:22,00:29:24,It was a disaster.
00:29:24,00:29:25,How was it?
00:29:25,00:29:30,I wonder if that's the same Bessamer as did the Bessamer process for smelting aluminium or
00:29:30,00:29:31,whatever it is.
00:29:31,00:29:32,I don't know.
00:29:32,00:29:33,Was that profound cock-up as well?
00:29:33,00:29:34,It was.
00:29:34,00:29:37,Sounds like it doesn't know what he's doing.
00:29:37,00:29:41,"He designed something that's not a boat, clearly, if it's just constantly crashing."
00:29:41,00:29:42,I don't know.
00:29:42,00:29:43,Was there nobody steering it?
00:29:43,00:29:44,It had people steering it.
00:29:44,00:29:46,You can't say it's not a boat just because it crashes.
00:29:46,00:29:48,You can't say Titanic is not a boat.
00:29:48,00:29:50,Not a boat.
00:29:50,00:29:54,"Just a rock, as far as I'm concerned."
00:29:54,00:29:55,We should talk about what's actually going on.
00:29:55,00:30:00,"So it's just the difference of information between what your eyes are seeing, when you're"
00:30:00,00:30:01,"on a ship, this is."
00:30:01,00:30:06,"So your eyes are seeing, let's say, a stable room, because you're in a ship room and you're"
00:30:06,00:30:11,"moving with the ship, so it's all the same to you, but your body, your inner ear, can tell"
00:30:11,00:30:12,that you're moving around.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"Actually, that's the case in all these things, right?"
00:30:15,00:30:19,"So if you're in a car, it's the same, you're reading the book, which is still, but actually"
00:30:19,00:30:21,everything else is moving around you.
00:30:21,00:30:23,But there's a third thing as well.
00:30:23,00:30:26,"So apart from your eyes and your inner ear, there's a third bit of your body, which is also"
00:30:26,00:30:40,"getting sending you conflicting information about what it does, what you're saying, your eyes,"
00:30:40,00:30:41,"your ears, and the little boxing bag at the back of your mouth, the uvula."
00:30:41,00:30:42,Yeah.
00:30:42,00:30:43,Yeah.
00:30:43,00:30:44,You can imagine that with work.
00:30:44,00:30:45,"If it's tilting over, look at it."
00:30:45,00:30:46,It's insane.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Okay.
00:30:47,00:30:48,No.
00:30:48,00:30:49,Great guess.
00:30:49,00:30:50,Great guess.
00:30:50,00:30:51,"Is it somewhere, is it sort of in your crop somewhere?"
00:30:51,00:30:52,"Oh, it's close."
00:30:52,00:30:53,You're so close.
00:30:53,00:30:54,"Oh, is it in your bottom?"
00:30:54,00:30:55,"If you're sitting down, it's in your bottom."
00:30:55,00:30:58,"It's outside of my bottom when I've standing up, but inside my bottom when I sit down."
00:30:58,00:30:59,Your feet.
00:30:59,00:31:01,"If you're standing up, you can tell this through your feet, and if you're sitting down"
00:31:01,00:31:02,through your bottom.
00:31:02,00:31:03,Got it.
00:31:03,00:31:09,"And it's a sense called proprioception, and it's where, if you're swaying, there's more"
00:31:09,00:31:14,"pressure on one side of your feet, and then on the other, you know what I mean, if your"
00:31:14,00:31:18,"body senses this, and that is another thing that can give you motion sickness, or if you're"
00:31:18,00:31:19,"sitting down, it's on your bottom."
00:31:19,00:31:20,Yeah.
00:31:20,00:31:23,"And it's like when you're on a tube train, you know, you can feel the acceleration really"
00:31:23,00:31:25,"stronger on one side, and it doesn't take off, yeah."
00:31:25,00:31:26,That's really quick.
00:31:26,00:31:32,"And other things that get seasickness, I mean loads of stuff does really dot so dogs, people"
00:31:32,00:31:35,"anyone who's had a dog will know that they get motion sickness, it's blood irritating in"
00:31:35,00:31:41,"a car, mice, amphibians, fish who said frogs get it quite badly."
00:31:41,00:31:45,"So they tested this, but they often test it by putting them in parabolic conditions."
00:31:45,00:31:49,So it's simulating weightlessness by sort of spinning or spinning them round to simulate
00:31:49,00:31:52,this sort of concentric movement.
00:31:52,00:31:57,"And so I was reading a study about whether frogs get motion sick, and they said the way we"
00:31:57,00:32:02,"find out is we put them in these containers, and then we subject them to parabolic flight,"
00:32:02,00:32:05,"and then we open the containers, and the presence of vomitus in their containers after"
00:32:05,00:32:09,flight will be used to indicate if they get motion sick.
00:32:09,00:32:13,"My wife, we brought her up far today, but she's going on one of these parabolic flights"
00:32:13,00:32:14,next year.
00:32:14,00:32:15,Why?
00:32:15,00:32:16,Yeah.
00:32:16,00:32:17,Yeah.
00:32:17,00:32:18,So I wonder if she'll vomit.
00:32:18,00:32:19,Yeah.
00:32:19,00:32:24,So what you can tell is by the presence of vomitus in the...
00:32:24,00:32:25,Vomitus.
00:32:25,00:32:26,"I mean, is that just vomitus?"
00:32:26,00:32:27,It's Latin for vomit.
00:32:27,00:32:29,"I mean, why do they need to still say vomitus?"
00:32:29,00:32:30,It's bizarre.
00:32:30,00:32:31,"I looked this up, so I thought they must have made that up."
00:32:31,00:32:35,"Yep, it's just vomitus, the definition is the stuff that comes out of your mouth when"
00:32:35,00:32:36,you vomit.
00:32:36,00:32:37,It's vomit.
00:32:37,00:32:38,Wow.
00:32:38,00:32:42,"But anyway, it turns out they are different to us and how they see sick themselves."
00:32:42,00:32:43,"Oh, we talked about frogs."
00:32:43,00:32:44,Frogs?
00:32:44,00:32:48,"Yes, because they don't throw up at the time, they throw up afterwards, which is actually"
00:32:48,00:32:49,quite considerate.
00:32:49,00:32:53,"They will wait until the car's stopped or they won't do it on the roller coaster, but usually"
00:32:53,00:32:55,happens between a few minutes and 24 hours afterwards.
00:32:55,00:32:58,"Almost like a hangover vomit, right?"
00:32:58,00:32:59,Yes.
00:32:59,00:33:04,"I was reading that the guys who built the Golden Gate Bridge, the builders supposedly were"
00:33:04,00:33:09,put on a special diet by the leader of the construction works guy called Strauss.
00:33:09,00:33:14,"I can't find any detail though about what that diet was, but the idea was the diet was"
00:33:14,00:33:15,for motion sickness.
00:33:15,00:33:19,It was for dizziness because people were very scared when they were building this bridge.
00:33:19,00:33:22,"You know, you had to climb very high, you had to get to, and so supposedly there was a diet"
00:33:22,00:33:23,to stop that.
00:33:23,00:33:28,But a really cool extra thing about that was what they ended up doing was they built a giant
00:33:28,00:33:33,"net under the bridge, cost $130,000, and it was like a circus trapeze net."
00:33:33,00:33:38,The idea was the dizziness would have been a huge factor in the construction pace that was
00:33:38,00:33:39,going on.
00:33:39,00:33:44,"And by building this little netting, it meant that people could go and work harder with"
00:33:44,00:33:49,the knowledge that they would probably survive if they fell off.
00:33:49,00:33:51,And 19 people did fall off.
00:33:51,00:33:52,"Oh my god, did they all live?"
00:33:52,00:33:55,"Yeah, and they became what was known as part of the Halfway to Hell Club."
00:33:55,00:33:56,Yeah.
00:33:56,00:33:57,"When was that built, did you see that?"
00:33:57,00:33:58,It was 19.
00:33:58,00:33:59,"Oh, 36."
00:33:59,00:34:00,"Oh, 36."
00:34:00,00:34:01,Okay.
00:34:01,00:34:05,So they probably wouldn't have had any effective actual medicines at that time to deal with
00:34:05,00:34:09,"sea sickness, because the drugs weren't invented until the 50s, and the drugs just switched"
00:34:09,00:34:13,off the information coming from the inner ear that we've today.
00:34:13,00:34:17,"So the Victorian Cures evolved sucking lemons, which did absolutely no good."
00:34:17,00:34:18,No.
00:34:18,00:34:19,Just did not help.
00:34:19,00:34:22,"There were loads of cures which didn't do any good, actually."
00:34:22,00:34:26,"Opium, I think, did some good, but opium's gone for everything."
00:34:26,00:34:27,Yeah.
00:34:27,00:34:30,Something that removes you mentally from any kind of reality is probably going to stop
00:34:30,00:34:31,you being aware of your sea sickness.
00:34:31,00:34:32,Exactly.
00:34:32,00:34:38,"But if you're the captain of the ship, unfortunately, that's why it crashed."
00:34:38,00:34:42,"There are some special glasses you can buy that have been made by Citroen, their car"
00:34:42,00:34:43,company.
00:34:43,00:34:45,They're called C-Troen.
00:34:45,00:34:46,Very C-Troen.
00:34:46,00:34:47,"Oh, nice."
00:34:47,00:34:48,"C-Troen, C-Troen."
00:34:48,00:34:57,"I don't think they thought of the C-Troen, C-Troen, but yeah, they have this blue liquid inside"
00:34:57,00:35:02,"them, and it gives you an artificial horizon, because a lot of it is being able to see the"
00:35:02,00:35:03,"horizon, isn't it?"
00:35:03,00:35:07,Being able to see that moving at the same way as you're feeling it's moving.
00:35:07,00:35:10,"So whichever way you move, it makes the horizon look like it's in that direction."
00:35:10,00:35:14,"Apparently, they do work after about 10 to 12 minutes, your motion sickness will just disappear."
00:35:14,00:35:15,That's really clever.
00:35:15,00:35:20,"But what is the point in them, because the only time that you're not looking at the horizon,"
00:35:20,00:35:25,"the reason you get travel sick is when you're reading or something, and then that, therefore,"
00:35:25,00:35:27,"you're not looking outside, you're not seeing the world go by, but if you're wearing these"
00:35:27,00:35:30,"weird horizon glasses, can you read a book with them?"
00:35:30,00:35:31,I guess that's what I want to know.
00:35:31,00:35:32,Can you read a book?
00:35:32,00:35:33,Can you read a book?
00:35:33,00:35:34,I think you're not wearing the Citroen.
00:35:34,00:35:35,Can you?
00:35:35,00:35:36,I think so.
00:35:36,00:35:41,"And the answer to them actually is because when we have self-driving cars, people won't be"
00:35:41,00:35:45,"driving and looking at the road, they'll be playing video games or they'll be reading books"
00:35:45,00:35:46,or doing whatever.
00:35:46,00:35:51,"So you need to come up with a new way of dealing with that, because otherwise, whenever"
00:35:51,00:35:56,"you open any self-driving car, it'll be full of monitors."
00:35:56,00:36:01,"But just every time you got to any destination, you still have the door, and a sea of monitors"
00:36:01,00:36:02,comes out.
00:36:02,00:36:08,"Well, the future is terrible."
00:36:08,00:36:11,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:36:11,00:36:17,"My fact this week is to honor the US Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia, Virginia's George"
00:36:17,00:36:24,"Mason University School of Law, renamed itself Antonin Scalia School of Law, then immediately"
00:36:24,00:36:28,renamed itself again after it was pointed out that the acronym would be Asshole.
00:36:28,00:36:29,That's right.
00:36:29,00:36:30,Fair enough.
00:36:30,00:36:31,Yeah.
00:36:31,00:36:32,Asshole.
00:36:32,00:36:33,Asshole.
00:36:33,00:36:34,Asshole.
00:36:34,00:36:35,"I said Asshole, didn't I?"
00:36:35,00:36:36,Yeah.
00:36:36,00:36:37,I went too far on that one.
00:36:37,00:36:38,Asshole.
00:36:38,00:36:39,Asshole.
00:36:39,00:36:42,"So this was, I think, the way it worked out is they sort of announced this, let's say, on"
00:36:42,00:36:47,"a Thursday, and by Tuesday, there was so much public ridicule online that the school's"
00:36:47,00:36:51,dean made an announcement that it was going to be renamed off the back of it.
00:36:51,00:36:56,"And they named it because they just got a massive donation from a few people, right?"
00:36:56,00:37:03,They got $30 million donation. 10 million of it came from the Charles Koch Foundation.
00:37:03,00:37:07,"So they could have called it the Charles Koch School of Law, which would have been much"
00:37:07,00:37:08,better.
00:37:08,00:37:09,That's true.
00:37:09,00:37:13,"It's now the Antonin Scalia Law School, but that's still ASLS, which looks in an uncharitable"
00:37:13,00:37:14,light like Assholes.
00:37:14,00:37:15,Mm.
00:37:15,00:37:16,What?
00:37:16,00:37:17,What?
00:37:17,00:37:18,I see when I see that.
00:37:18,00:37:19,"Oh, yes."
00:37:19,00:37:20,Okay.
00:37:20,00:37:21,Some more stuff on acronyms.
00:37:21,00:37:22,Yeah.
00:37:22,00:37:29,"What the acronym or what the word spam stands for, you know, the food stuff, rather than"
00:37:29,00:37:30,this.
00:37:30,00:37:32,I would think it's something.
00:37:32,00:37:33,Is it something ham?
00:37:33,00:37:34,Okay.
00:37:34,00:37:35,What would it be?
00:37:35,00:37:36,Yes.
00:37:36,00:37:37,Spurious ham.
00:37:37,00:37:38,Spurious ham.
00:37:38,00:37:39,That's it.
00:37:39,00:37:43,"Well, most people would tell you that it stands for Spiced Ham."
00:37:43,00:37:49,"That's what everyone thought it used to mean, but then according to spam the company, they"
00:37:49,00:37:55,now tell us that it stands for Sizzle Park and mm.
00:37:55,00:37:56,What?
00:37:56,00:38:01,"So, which I imagine might be a back formation."
00:38:01,00:38:02,Yeah.
00:38:02,00:38:05,"Is it, is it saying Sizzle, comma, pork?"
00:38:05,00:38:12,"Actually, they're saying Sizzle, full stop, pork, full stop, and full stop, mm, full stop."
00:38:12,00:38:13,Mm.
00:38:13,00:38:16,"I also say mm to that, but in a more skeptical way, I think that they would have wanted."
00:38:16,00:38:20,You always come to the question mark at the end every time.
00:38:20,00:38:21,Wow.
00:38:21,00:38:26,"That's a terrible back formation, yeah, it's so clunky."
00:38:26,00:38:29,So there's a difference between an acronym and an initialism.
00:38:29,00:38:31,I think it's very important that we nail down.
00:38:31,00:38:32,Yeah.
00:38:32,00:38:33,Okay.
00:38:33,00:38:39,"So an acronym, well, some, all of these things are acronyms, but some people say, it's not"
00:38:39,00:38:43,"really hard and fast, that initialisms are things where it's just strings of letters."
00:38:43,00:38:53,"So the FBI is an initialism, YMCA, YMCA, yeah, so that's the difference, right?"
00:38:53,00:38:55,If it became a word.
00:38:55,00:38:56,Exactly.
00:38:56,00:39:03,"So if people started saying, I go to the IMPCA or SCUBA, SCUBA is initials, but it's also become"
00:39:03,00:39:04,a word in its own right.
00:39:04,00:39:05,So that's an acronym.
00:39:05,00:39:07,Contained underwater breathing equipment.
00:39:07,00:39:08,Apparatus.
00:39:08,00:39:10,That would be SCUBA.
00:39:10,00:39:11,SCUBA.
00:39:11,00:39:14,SCUBA.
00:39:14,00:39:17,"Also, you get the very exciting marriage of the two, don't you?"
00:39:17,00:39:19,This is where the two come together.
00:39:19,00:39:22,It's a bit frowned upon in the communities of initialisms with acronyms.
00:39:22,00:39:25,"It's like Romeo and Juliet, but you've got CD-ROM, of course."
00:39:25,00:39:26,Okay.
00:39:26,00:39:29,"You've got JPEG, and that's it, actually."
00:39:29,00:39:33,There are only two Romeo and Juliet's of the initials that were in the world.
00:39:33,00:39:34,Okay.
00:39:34,00:39:35,What's the deal with a JPEG then?
00:39:35,00:39:39,"So a JPEG is J, is a joint photographic expert's group."
00:39:39,00:39:43,"So part of it, you're just saying the letter and part of it, you're saying a word."
00:39:43,00:39:44,Exactly.
00:39:44,00:39:45,Wow.
00:39:45,00:39:46,Holy.
00:39:46,00:39:48,"Wow, God, that is more amazement than that deserves."
00:39:48,00:39:49,"Wow, I just didn't know what it was."
00:39:49,00:39:50,"You couldn't say JPEG, though."
00:39:50,00:39:51,"And now JPEG, though."
00:39:51,00:39:52,You couldn't say JPEG.
00:39:52,00:39:54,You couldn't say KIDROM.
00:39:54,00:39:55,KIDROM.
00:39:55,00:39:56,KIDROM.
00:39:56,00:39:57,"You could, but we just don't."
00:39:57,00:39:59,"In fact, we rarely refer to CD-ROMs."
00:39:59,00:40:00,Speak for us.
00:40:00,00:40:04,I've got a few things on just name changes.
00:40:04,00:40:05,Okay.
00:40:05,00:40:12,So one of the things I guess it comes up a lot in newspapers is that Peter and the animal
00:40:12,00:40:18,"rights group, they constantly want places to change their name if there's something that's"
00:40:18,00:40:19,associated.
00:40:19,00:40:20,"Oh, yeah."
00:40:20,00:40:21,For example.
00:40:21,00:40:25,We did on the podcast that they wanted to change great fry up to great vegan fry up.
00:40:25,00:40:26,That's right.
00:40:26,00:40:27,That's right.
00:40:27,00:40:28,"Yeah, exactly."
00:40:28,00:40:29,So there's a town that they wanted to have changed.
00:40:29,00:40:32,"It's a village called Wool, it's an English village."
00:40:32,00:40:34,They wanted it to be changed to vegan wool.
00:40:34,00:40:36,That was their big pitch.
00:40:36,00:40:37,Did they?
00:40:37,00:40:38,"No, they didn't."
00:40:38,00:40:42,"In fact, I can't find a single instance where people got a letter from Peter saying change"
00:40:42,00:40:43,your name.
00:40:43,00:40:44,They went absolutely.
00:40:44,00:40:45,I've not found that yet.
00:40:45,00:40:49,"There's a place called Leatherhead, which they wanted to be changed to Pleatherhead, which"
00:40:49,00:40:55,"Pleatherhead is an imitation synthetic leather alternative, so that was quite nice."
00:40:55,00:40:59,"There was the chicken dinner road, which is a road they wanted to call chicken roads."
00:40:59,00:41:03,"It happens all the time, but my favorite one is sausage street."
00:41:03,00:41:04,So sausage street.
00:41:04,00:41:07,"This is a town, which is in France."
00:41:07,00:41:10,"Sorry, there's a town in France called sausage street."
00:41:10,00:41:11,"No, sorry, sorry."
00:41:11,00:41:13,There's a street in a town in France.
00:41:13,00:41:18,"It's called Rudella Sousie, which is sausage street."
00:41:18,00:41:23,"So they wrote a letter to them, say, can you change it from sausage street?"
00:41:23,00:41:24,And they obviously refuse.
00:41:24,00:41:27,The town may say absolutely not.
00:41:27,00:41:31,But someone from the town also pointed out that the change would be completely out of place
00:41:31,00:41:36,"because it is not named after the sausage itself, but rather the sausage street is off the"
00:41:36,00:41:42,"back of a woman who they called the sausage, called Suzanne Tessier, and she lived in the"
00:41:42,00:41:43,area.
00:41:43,00:41:45,Do we know why they called her the sausage street?
00:41:45,00:41:46,"Yeah, we do."
00:41:46,00:41:47,We do.
00:41:47,00:41:51,"Because when she walked, she stooped over like a sausage bending, and that was the name."
00:41:51,00:41:54,I'll let Maggie to about to jump.
00:41:54,00:41:55,Exactly.
00:41:55,00:41:59,So the street supposedly is named after Susan the sausage Tessier.
00:41:59,00:42:00,No.
00:42:00,00:42:01,Yeah.
00:42:01,00:42:02,That's amazing.
00:42:02,00:42:03,That is so funny.
00:42:03,00:42:08,"So if you have a name of a company, and you're not sure if it's going to be okay, or if it's"
00:42:08,00:42:14,"going to be a bit of another asshole debacle, then asshole, sorry, then you just need to"
00:42:14,00:42:17,try and register it because the government will tell you if it's too rude.
00:42:17,00:42:21,"So you have the its company's house, and it's the government body which registers company"
00:42:21,00:42:22,names.
00:42:22,00:42:25,And every year they released their list of names that they said no to.
00:42:25,00:42:30,So this year they banned 87 company names that they refused to register.
00:42:30,00:42:34,"And so when we didn't get, so first of all there was purple helmet bikes."
00:42:34,00:42:35,Right.
00:42:35,00:42:40,"Which, so I sort of kind of I think guess we did a podcast the other week about what we"
00:42:40,00:42:45,"called people from West Bromwich Albion, and purple helmet is a synonym for that."
00:42:45,00:42:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:42:46,00:42:47,Okay.
00:42:47,00:42:48,"Oh, that is."
00:42:48,00:42:49,It's a convoluted way of explaining.
00:42:49,00:42:53,"No, but that's a great way of getting listeners to go to the previous episode."
00:42:53,00:42:57,"And in that episode, we referenced the one before, and it's a constant change."
00:42:57,00:43:01,"And so that's purple helmet bikes, and there's also company names that weren't allowed."
00:43:01,00:43:03,"Fanny's cabal, this wasn't allowed."
00:43:03,00:43:04,Okay.
00:43:04,00:43:08,"Solid systems, which I just like, I like the idea of hiring someone to fix your computer when"
00:43:08,00:43:09,they call it.
00:43:09,00:43:10,Solid systems.
00:43:10,00:43:13,"Then just fucking, I'm going to get a new one."
00:43:13,00:43:14,Royal nuts.
00:43:14,00:43:15,Aina's beauty.
00:43:15,00:43:16,Aina's beauty.
00:43:16,00:43:17,Aina's beauty.
00:43:17,00:43:19,Who thought that would get her?
00:43:19,00:43:25,"It's not exactly a crafty bit of wordplay like purple helmet bikes, isn't it?"
00:43:25,00:43:27,It does what it says on the tin.
00:43:27,00:43:30,It puts a bit of redness down like that.
00:43:30,00:43:33,Sit on a beat shoot for three hours.
00:43:33,00:43:34,Is there a first line of advice?
00:43:34,00:43:35,"Oh, my god."
00:43:35,00:43:36,Nick has knackers knackers.
00:43:36,00:43:37,Don't know what they do.
00:43:37,00:43:38,I like to know.
00:43:38,00:43:41,"Because the problem is, we don't find now what they do, because these companies don't"
00:43:41,00:43:42,get registered.
00:43:42,00:43:48,Don't they make underwear door knockers and they kill horses?
00:43:48,00:43:55,It was three best friends with three very different talents.
00:43:55,00:44:00,"In 2015, lots of people called Brian protested after Thames Valley police announced that they"
00:44:00,00:44:05,were going to change the name of one of their police horses from Brian to they said a god-like
00:44:05,00:44:07,name such as Hercules.
00:44:07,00:44:13,"And people, so this was, if the horse passed its tests to be a good police horse basically"
00:44:13,00:44:14,and to be a qualified police horse.
00:44:14,00:44:17,And various people called Brian kicked up a fuss.
00:44:17,00:44:20,"So Brian Lewis from Ascot said, I think it's outrageous."
00:44:20,00:44:22,Brian is a good name for a horse.
00:44:22,00:44:23,Brian.
00:44:23,00:44:24,"It's not god-like though, is it?"
00:44:24,00:44:28,"He's very famously, he's not the son of god, he's a very naughty mind."
00:44:28,00:44:30,"Yes, that's such a good point."
00:44:30,00:44:33,There was another guy called Brian Pulson from Bracknell who said there is no way they should
00:44:33,00:44:34,be changing the name.
00:44:34,00:44:37,Every horse should be called Brian.
00:44:37,00:44:41,He's such an extreme alternative.
00:44:41,00:44:43,"What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world."
00:44:43,00:44:46,"Pulsuring all Brian's coming up the back, we're Brian, we're Brian, we're Brian, we're"
00:44:46,00:44:50,"Brian, we're Brian, we're Brian, we're Brian."
00:44:50,00:44:51,"Okay, that's it."
