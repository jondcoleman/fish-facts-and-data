00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,840
 [ I can't wait to get back to the recording ]

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:19,160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,100
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,200
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin, and once again

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,100
 we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,260
 days and in no particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,020
 Starting with you, James.

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,660
 Okay, my fact this week is that when the world's largest bottle of wine sprung a leak this

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,300
 year, the owner called the local fire department who stopped the spillage with sandbags.

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,460
 Wow, how big are we talking?

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,020
 We're talking big.

13
00:00:53,020 --> 00:01:02,760
 It was 9.8 feet tall, 2.6 tonnes in weight, and 1,590 litres, which is about the equivalent

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,440
 of 2,000 bottles of wine.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,700
 If we lived in a truly circular recycling economy, then they would have gone, solved the

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,140
 wine problem, retained the wine and used it to put out their next fire.

17
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,380
 Well, they could have done that, apart from the wine is still drinkable.

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,380
 Believe it or not.

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,620
 Not the stuff they squeegeed off the floor.

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,100
 Well, it depends on your standards, right?

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,100
 That's true.

22
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,980
 So, they took this bottle of wine and they got all the stuff off the floor, and then they

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,780
 took the wine from the bottle and put it into barrels, and they've checked it, they took

24
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,460
 it to a winery to test, and it's been deemed fit for consumption, and they're going to sell

25
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,460
 it by the glass at an upcoming event.

26
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,460
 Cool.

27
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,300
 That's going to take some ages, isn't it?

28
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,900
 So, why did they build it in the first place?

29
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,380
 Well, they build it because people like building large things.

30
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,940
 It was just like a publicity stunt, I suppose.

31
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,380
 It was sold to a Chinese restaurant in Austria, and they had it on display.

32
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,900
 It was in a giant climate controlled glass chamber, really cool, so it was like a big fridge,

33
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,460
 and they think that's where the problem came from.

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:12,740
 They think the electricity went off, and so when it was not as heated, then wine expands,

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,100
 or liquids expand in a bottle when the temperatures are changed, and they think that's what led

36
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,100
 to the leaking.

37
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,580
 Was it got cooler in it?

38
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,620
 No, it got warmer, so it was in the fridge, and it got warmer, so it expanded, and it pushed

39
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,820
 the cork up, and left a little bit of a gap where the wine could come out.

40
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,820
 Yeah.

41
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,340
 And I guess they brought the fire department, because they were a bit scared about what was

42
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,340
 going to happen.

43
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,340
 They couldn't tell where it was leaking from to begin with.

44
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,180
 Well, it's a big lot of glass, and they were worried it might explode.

45
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,620
 Exactly, so it could have just shattered onto them, and that's a lot of less than a restaurant.

46
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,380
 If you order a glass of wine out of this bottle, they have a sort of bodybuilder who has to

47
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,380
 come and pour it.

48
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,100
 How does that work?

49
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
 Yeah.

50
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,620
 I think the idea was that the wine in the big bottle was probably never supposed to be

51
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,620
 drunk.

52
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,020
 It was just a display thing.

53
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,660
 But then once it started leaking out, they were like, "Oh, I'm going to have to drink it

54
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,660
 now."

55
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,700
 It's like, you know, when you have a bottle of wine in your fridge, and suddenly the electricity

56
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,180
 goes off, and you're like, "Well, I'm going to have to drink all the wine in the fridge

57
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,180
 now.

58
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,180
 That's a thing, James."

59
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,180
 I don't think so.

60
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,180
 I've had a lot of electricity problems in my house recently.

61
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,180
 So, yeah.

62
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,740
 So you were mentioning another rival bottle of wine.

63
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,100
 Okay, yeah, I forgot about that.

64
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,500
 This has the Guinness World Record for being the largest filled glass wine bottle, but when

65
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,780
 I was doing the research for this fact, I found another one in Switzerland that was wavy.

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,540
 Like, way, way bigger.

67
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,700
 And so I can only think there's some technicality that it's not made of glass, because I couldn't

68
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,820
 quite tell from the images, or maybe it wasn't full of wine.

69
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,820
 Right, right, right.

70
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,820
 I couldn't really tell.

71
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,260
 So these giant bottles of wine, they are a thing, but I didn't know that most of the wine

72
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,620
 on earth is transported in giant bottles, or a huge amount of it, yeah.

73
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,900
 So I, okay, I didn't know this, and then I told a few people who are a generation older

74
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,900
 than me, and they all knew it.

75
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,500
 So maybe this is a generational thing.

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,620
 But loads of wine, when it's shipped, it's not shipped in bottles, it's shipped in bulk

77
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,620
 tankers.

78
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,620
 Did you guys know this?

79
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,060
 Do you mean like a petrol tanker?

80
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,060
 Kind of.

81
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,060
 Yeah, really.

82
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,060
 Like in a shipping container.

83
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,540
 But obviously a special container, they don't just pour it into a shipping container and

84
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,060
 then see it up.

85
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,700
 But basically, a 45% of the wine imported into the UK arrives not in a bottle.

86
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,740
 It arrives in these massive containers.

87
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
 The crappier wine, right?

88
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,820
 Because I think if you're getting the really hardcore good Sather France stuff, then it's

89
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
 bottled in the place.

90
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,820
 It's quite a lot, though.

91
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,100
 I mean, they bottle so much here, and they have labels, which are from, you know, overseas

92
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,020
 wines, just here that they put on.

93
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,580
 So there's a place in South Helsingland called Avenmouth, and Avenmouth, near the Muth of

94
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,060
 the River Aven, Aven Muth.

95
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,060
 Okay, anyway.

96
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,060
 They've got...

97
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,620
 They have a hangar there, which is the size of 12 football pitches, and it's owned by a firm

98
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,420
 who are a specialist bottleer, and they fill up 720,000 bottles of wine there alone every

99
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,420
 day.

100
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,740
 They believe that, and the wine arrives in these massive plastic bladders, basically, they're

101
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,340
 called flexitanks, right?

102
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,980
 And then they have a special pump and tilt system, they call it, to get the last 150 litres

103
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,100
 out of each bladder.

104
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,380
 Is that when you're sort of shaking to get the jugs out?

105
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,380
 Basically.

106
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,180
 And do you have to get it directly into the bottles?

107
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,180
 That must be quite difficult.

108
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,580
 Do you submerge the bottles and get into the bottles?

109
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,580
 I don't know.

110
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,580
 How do you do it?

111
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,580
 I don't know.

112
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:35,820
 It must be a tap, it's probably a tap, it's probably a tap test, I don't know.

113
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,980
 But these bags are then soaked with wine, because they're obviously, you know, liquid proof

114
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,620
 on the outside, but on the inside, they're completely soaked with wine, but those bags

115
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,860
 are then shredded and turned into traffic cones.

116
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
 No way.

117
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,300
 And that's why traffic cones are like R&G red and colour.

118
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
 Exactly.

119
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
 Not like that.

120
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,300
 No, not maybe not.

121
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,740
 It is maybe why drunk people are drawn to traffic cones, because they didn't know at some level.

122
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,740
 It's another hit.

123
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,740
 That's amazing.

124
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
 That's really cool.

125
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,740
 Yeah, that's very cool.

126
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,620
 That's like the kind of inheritor of butlers, because butlers are originally bottleers,

127
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,620
 right?

128
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,620
 That's, I didn't know that was where that comes from.

129
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,620
 Oh, it's a bottleier.

130
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,340
 It was the King's bottleer who would bottle up all his wine, and I suppose they're your

131
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,580
 modern-day butlers, an even myth.

132
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,180
 You know that from 1636 to 1860, it was illegal to sell wine by the bottle in the UK.

133
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,700
 You would go to the shop and you'd have your own bottle with your initials on it, and they

134
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,220
 would fill it up and they'd work out how much you'd bought and by volume and you'd pay

135
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,300
 by volume.

136
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,020
 And the reason was wine bottle making was kind of quite common in the 17th century, but

137
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,060
 not until the 19th century could you make it so they were all the same size.

138
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,860
 So duplicitous shopkeepers might kind of sell you a bottle, which is a lot smaller than

139
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,260
 the normal bottles, so that's why they made it illegal.

140
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:00,100
 That's going to be hard to hide your alcohol problem when you rock up with 10 bottles.

141
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,820
 Another big party, Mr. Schreiber?

142
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,820
 Yeah, yeah.

143
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,380
 Isn't that just the same as leaving the shop, I mean at least it was 10 bottles, which

144
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,380
 is what we do today.

145
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,380
 Exactly.

146
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,340
 How do you hide your alcohol problem normally if you're leaving the supermarket with 10

147
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,340
 bottles of wine every day?

148
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,940
 I've got it mustache.

149
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,780
 You've got a full facial beard, how is it mustache going to happen?

150
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,780
 I know.

151
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,780
 It's so distracting.

152
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,780
 They're like, whoa, that guy's weird.

153
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,780
 Let's not question his story.

154
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,660
 I'm kind of annoyed with wine bottles, though, having done the research for this fact.

155
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,660
 Go on.

156
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
 Nice of them.

157
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,660
 Well, they're so inefficient.

158
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,660
 They're so heavy.

159
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,660
 Yeah.

160
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,020
 Most of them are made from green glass, which is quite hard to recycle, and also we import

161
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,900
 so much and bottle so much here that actually even if you recycle it, it's quite hard to find

162
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
 uses for all of it.

163
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,860
 Well, you can get, or you could get paper wine bottles, which are an answer to this, cause-

164
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,860
 I read about those.

165
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,540
 Yeah, but it's kind of sad because it was in 2014, wasn't it, that they start, they've sort

166
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,500
 of went global with them, this company, and they're made from compressed recycled paper,

167
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,100
 and so they're incredibly light, and they, so they weighed 65 grams, which is a seventh

168
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,740
 of a wine bottle, of a wine bottle's empty, and then they had the little sort of bagging

169
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,340
 inside, you get inside box wine, and really quickly the company unfolded.

170
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,340
 Very clever.

171
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,340
 So that was a real shame.

172
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,900
 Was that intentional though, that when you said folded?

173
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,380
 It was, but I stole it, so, yeah, but it did the company fold it.

174
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,220
 Okay, you could have said crumbles, like that common phrase, the company crumbles.

175
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,580
 That's the way the company crumbles, as they all say.

176
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,460
 Do you know who is known as the father of the modern bottle?

177
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,460
 Ooh.

178
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,020
 Is it someone famous who we will have heard of?

179
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,940
 It's someone not famous who you will have heard of.

180
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,940
 Oh, who we will.

181
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,100
 Is it someone who's around around Guy Fork's area?

182
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,900
 Quite close to Guy Fork's, one generation away from Guy Fork's area.

183
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,900
 Is it everyone dig me?

184
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
 It's not.

185
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,700
 But it's someone I was confused with him.

186
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,700
 It's Kennell.

187
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
 Kennell's son.

188
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
 Kennell's son.

189
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
 Kennell's dig me.

190
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,700
 Wow.

191
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,700
 They're back.

192
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
 The dig me is a back.

193
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
 For anyone just listening.

194
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
 This is a four-year callback.

195
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,940
 I really have to put the hours in to be having a good time now.

196
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,840
 Okay, so, ever had dig me, who was the gunpowder plotter, his son was a Kennell

197
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,620
 dig bee and he kind of came up with ways of making really good glass because he was an alchemist

198
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,620
 and he was like taking stuff.

199
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,720
 Really feel like you're going to say alcoholic.

200
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,300
 And he was like adding metals and oxides to his son and making it really, really hard to

201
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,600
 make in really good glass and he could make darker glass as well which would make the wine

202
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,960
 not spoil as quickly.

203
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
 Yeah.

204
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,000
 So that's a high achieving family, the dig bees, weren't they?

205
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,800
 I've found a story about, so this fact is about wine leaking out.

206
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,000
 I'm losing precious wine.

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,880
 I found a story similar to this.

208
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,480
 In Canada, there's a company called Mission Hill, they make wine.

209
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,880
 And they had an employee called Brent Crosio and he was a sellummon, so he worked inside

210
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,880
 the factory and for years his job was blending wines and he was transferring them between tanks.

211
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,760
 He accidentally left a valve open when he wasn't meant to.

212
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,840
 As a result, 5,680 liters of subion blanc spilled to the ground and went down a drain.

213
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,640
 So it cost them $162,500.

214
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,920
 He was fired, obviously, for losing that amount, but it's not the first time he did it.

215
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,200
 So back 18 months earlier, he left a valve open and he flushed 11,000 liters of wine down

216
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,880
 a drain and they gave him a second chance.

217
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,600
 But it does sound to me like there's someone in that drain with a massive bladder.

218
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,400
 It's like an accomplice, doesn't it?

219
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,720
 You're right, it's a con job, yeah.

220
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
 Did you guys see the story?

221
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,520
 Remember the story last year that Tweet that was put out by Hawkesmore restaurant in Manchester,

222
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,560
 which was to the customer who accidentally got given a bottle of chateau, a pound pommel

223
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,120
 roll, 2001, which is £4,500 on our menu last night, hope you enjoy your evening.

224
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,800
 To the member of staff who accidentally gave it away, chin up, one of mistakes happened,

225
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
 we love you anyway.

226
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
 Wow.

227
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
 Okay.

228
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 What a good employer.

229
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
 Yeah, that's amazing.

230
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
 Has that happened again since, though?

231
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 He's been fired.

232
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,120
 Yeah, I remember basically how that must have been.

233
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,240
 But the thing is, a lot of enjoying wine they've shown is if you know it's more expensive,

234
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,560
 you like it more, right?

235
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,040
 And if you're thinking you're buying the 399 bottle of wine on the Hawkesmore menu, which

236
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,240
 I don't know if they go down that low, but if you think you're buying the cheap one,

237
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
 you get the expensive one.

238
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
 You might not enjoy it as much.

239
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,080
 No, they probably would have, I mean, no one can be good enough to surely be, to be,

240
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,120
 I can't differentiate anything above about eight or ten quid, basically.

241
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
 Okay.

242
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,960
 But have you ever tasted the 4,500?

243
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,480
 Do you never know that might be such a explosion?

244
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,480
 Yeah, I have one every other week, and I can't taste the difference.

245
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
 Line testing.

246
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,400
 This massive bottle of wine that I talked about at the start, you could, if you had drank

247
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,880
 one bottle of wine to yourself every day since we started this podcast six years ago,

248
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,600
 also, you'd just be draining the bottom of the bottle now.

249
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,200
 That's a great cup of wine, and you would, you would need it after listening to this

250
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,520
 six years.

251
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

252
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,800
 My fact this week is that when Michelangelo sculpted David, the town mayor told him that

253
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,640
 the nose was too big, so Michelangelo picked up some dust, climbed to the top of the statue,

254
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,040
 sprinkled the dust down, and claimed they had fixed it.

255
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,680
 So was he making like sculpting noises while he was doing that?

256
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
 Yeah, he must have been, right?

257
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,560
 He went even further, he went even more method, he did take up a hammer and chisel and stuff.

258
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,520
 So this is in 1504, and it was when David was just being displayed in Florence, it was revealed.

259
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,640
 And Pietro Sotarini was the town's sort of mayor chief, anyway, Sotarini said probably

260
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,120
 displaying his artistic appreciation, you know, I think the nose is a bit outproportant

261
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,880
 with the rest of the rest of the thing, isn't it?

262
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,280
 You want to go up and fix it.

263
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,920
 And Michelangelo, everyone was surprised at the time, because Michelangelo was very touchy

264
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,200
 and really just like criticism.

265
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,120
 And but he said, yeah, absolutely, I'm so sorry, absolutely right, it's enormous.

266
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,400
 And so he picked up a hammer and a chisel and secretly a handful of dust, climbed to the

267
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,880
 top, pretended to chip away at it, and then Sotarini went, that's absolutely perfect.

268
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,080
 He nailed it, stopped there, came back down again.

269
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,400
 This is like the wine tasting thing with the prices.

270
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
 Absolutely.

271
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,000
 If you've told something is better.

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 You believe it.

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Do you believe it?

274
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,600
 Do we know that this fact is completely true?

275
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,200
 Well, it comes from this amazing book, which is sort of the foundational book of all art

276
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,120
 history, which is by George O. Vassari, and it's called The Lives of Most Excellent Painters,

277
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,720
 Sculptors and Architects, and yeah, so he's sort of founded art history, and it's incredible

278
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,360
 biographies of all the great artists up until them, or, you know, not all of them, but many

279
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,160
 of them, many of the Florentine ones, especially.

280
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,280
 And so there are a lot of facts, and very, very true.

281
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,480
 And then we think he had an eye for drama and liked to embellish, so he was friends with

282
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,760
 Michelangelo and he was.

283
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,760
 He was.

284
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,760
 But even this book, The Lives of the Artists, so the origin story of this book is that he

285
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
 was sitting at a dinner.

286
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,080
 This is in the 1500s at the Roman Palazzo with the Cardinal at the time, and the Cardinal

287
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,720
 was talking about a collection of paintings along with the other people, and he kept

288
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,480
 noticing they were getting dates wrong, and certain, they were attributing certain bits

289
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
 of art to different people.

290
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,440
 So he said that if someone was going to collect all this information together, they should

291
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,480
 have someone who knows it really well, and they suggested that he do it.

292
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,040
 So that was his sort of claim for it.

293
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,320
 And the reality is that two of the people he claimed that we're at the dinner with him

294
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,040
 had died already, and they don't think he was even in Rome at the time when that dinner

295
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,280
 was said to have happened.

296
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,240
 So he was someone who did have a bit of a sort of like bride-blessed or-

297
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,600
 Yeah, definitely the bride-blessed was day, maybe, because he also claimed that he rescued

298
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,280
 David at one point.

299
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,720
 So he was born, he was very young when David was sculpted, but in 1527 there were these

300
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,800
 massive riots in Florence, and one of the rioters was anti-Madeuchi riots, and one of the rioters

301
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,960
 threw a bench from a parapet, which knocked off David's arm.

302
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
 Through a bench.

303
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
 Yeah.

304
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
 Who was this, Goliath?

305
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:05,640
 Yes, it was arm came off, and Vassari says that he was a boy at the time, he was about 16,

306
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,800
 and he fought his way through these rioting, marauding crowds to rescue the various pieces

307
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
 of the arm.

308
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 It can't be true.

309
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
 And take what's a safety.

310
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,560
 Actually, what they didn't say is that this was a miniature bench that are travelling

311
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
 salesmen had brought in.

312
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
 Wow, we're getting.

313
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
 Oh, I'm mega and cold.

314
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
 I love mixed episode.

315
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
 Cool back.

316
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
 I love it.

317
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
 He had a broken nose.

318
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
 Michael Angelo?

319
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
 Yeah.

320
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
 David, supposedly, did.

321
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
 Yes.

322
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
 Oh, yeah.

323
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
 Because he got into an argument with one of his friends or something.

324
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
 Is that right?

325
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,880
 His friend threw a bench at him.

326
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:42,320
 He was called Pietro Toregiano, and he was supposedly envious of Michelangelo's skills,

327
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,880
 and then, but he also had a very bad temper.

328
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,040
 So smashed him in the face, and he said, "I gave him such a blow on the nose that I felt

329
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,000
 bone and cartilage go down like biscuits beneath my knuckles."

330
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,520
 And this mark of mine, he will carry with him to the grave, but it basically screwed his

331
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,160
 life because everyone loved Michael Angelo, because Michael Angelo was with the Medici's

332
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
 at the time, wasn't he?

333
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,040
 So he had the protection of the people who ran everything.

334
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,000
 And so Toregiano had to leave Florence.

335
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,640
 He went all the way to England, where possibly he was hired by Henry VIII, and then he started

336
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,840
 sculpting nobles in England.

337
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,920
 And then wanted to go back to Florence to try and get some help, some students and stuff,

338
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,760
 but when he went back, no one would go with him because they remembered what he did to

339
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
 Michael Angelo.

340
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
 Wow.

341
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
 Wow.

342
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
 Yeah.

343
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,520
 This is why you should bully and pick on people who are inferior to or smaller or less

344
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,400
 handed than you are, because if you pick on people above you, then you will reap the

345
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
 consequences, weren't you?

346
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
 Yeah, absolutely right.

347
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
 You're bullied league.

348
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
 It's going pretty well.

349
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
 It's going pretty well.

350
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
 Thanks, Andy.

351
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,400
 You're next, by the way.

352
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,240
 So I was looking for Michael Angelo, just what he looked like, and he's in the Sistine

353
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,600
 Chapel as a self-portrait, we think, which is, but it's not him as a person, it's not him

354
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,160
 looking healthy, it's him as a piece of flayed skin.

355
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

356
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,880
 So there's an image of the last judgment, there's one of the bits of the Sistine Chapel,

357
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,560
 and there's Saint Bartholomew trying to get into heaven and kind of get God's attention,

358
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,200
 so hey, I'm saying, let me in, and in one hand he's holding a knife, and in one hand he's

359
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,760
 holding his own flayed skin, and it says he has got skin as well, so it's not clear when

360
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,080
 he grew this second skin.

361
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,040
 Well, you can't see him 360, presumably, so maybe it's off his back or something else.

362
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
 No, no, you can see it.

363
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
 It's the face.

364
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,040
 He's got, what is it saying is he's got two faces, it's not completely accurate.

365
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
 I see.

366
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,080
 Michael Angelo didn't paint a completely flayed Saint Bartholomew, because it might have been

367
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,880
 correct, but the hanging skin that this guy's clutching is Michael Angelo, and we know

368
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,440
 because he's got a little broken nose.

369
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,360
 But then again, if you break your nose, it's the bone that breaks, it's not the skin that

370
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,680
 breaks, and so how can you tell if you flay someone's skin, how can you tell if they've

371
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
 got a broken nose?

372
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
 That's a good point.

373
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
 That's true, that's a good point.

374
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,920
 So you knew nothing about anatomy, did he?

375
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,600
 But he used to paint sort of very buff people with an eight pack, as opposed to a six

376
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
 pack.

377
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,560
 Does that exist in eight pack?

378
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
 Yeah, it does.

379
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
 It's extremely rare.

380
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
 Oh, I can't, but it does exist.

381
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
 I've got one.

382
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
 Yeah, I've got one.

383
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,000
 We're not talking about cans of beer, though, I mean.

384
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,040
 Oh, I haven't got one, though.

385
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:20,320
 So six pack is your basic muscles of your abdomen, but a very small percentage of people

386
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,200
 do have eight muscles down there, and they think this is a clue as to who might have been

387
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,720
 one of his main people who he based his paintings and his sculptures off, because if you look

388
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,920
 at a lot of his sculptures, they all have this particular unusual anatomical thing.

389
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,760
 Well, in 2015, it helped to verify two pieces that they were tiny bronze statues that someone

390
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,400
 had claimed as Michelangelo's, and they said there's no way proving.

391
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,120
 They did years and years of research on it, and they had eight packs.

392
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,480
 They had sort of oddly shaped toes, which was another classic feature of Michelangelo's,

393
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,240
 and they confirmed them as a result of one of his other things.

394
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,240
 So toes, eight pack, what's another thing that might be classic Michelangelo?

395
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
 Tiny toger.

396
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,280
 No, but you're in the right area.

397
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
 Enormous.

398
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
 Stasticles.

399
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,280
 Anatomically correct pubic hair.

400
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
 Okay.

401
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
 Oh, no.

402
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
 Supposedly it's something that to look out for.

403
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,800
 Do you say bronze these are?

404
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
 Yeah, these are in bronze.

405
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
 That's a tough cast in bronze.

406
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 Yeah.

407
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
 Very fine.

408
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 Yeah.

409
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,200
 I mean, if you're doing pubic hair, I'd be surprised if it wasn't anatomically correct.

410
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,760
 Where are you going to put it on the belly button?

411
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,520
 As soon as you're choosing to do pubic hair, you're putting it over the pubic region, aren't

412
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
 you?

413
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:35,840
 It's classically an auto to have the pubic hair in the ears of the people you do.

414
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,880
 If he wanted to send someone a present, Michelangelo would send them 33 pairs of apples.

415
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
 Okay.

416
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
 33 pairs as a present.

417
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
 Okay.

418
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
 One for every year of Christ's life.

419
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
 Oh, okay.

420
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
 Okay.

421
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,200
 Do you know why he did that?

422
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
 One for every year.

423
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
 No, he's Christ's life.

424
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
 Okay.

425
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,560
 So I now understand the number, but I don't understand why that particular object.

426
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
 No, I don't know.

427
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
 Oh, I don't know.

428
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
 He was very stingy.

429
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
 I know that.

430
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
 I think he had a reputation for that.

431
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,280
 So maybe they were the cheapest thing around at the sign.

432
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
 Really?

433
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,880
 Apparently, he was kind of horrible, quite mean, but of a very difficult to work with, a terrible

434
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,360
 snob.

435
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,680
 And when he died, they found absolute fortune in his house because he was so penny-pinching

436
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
 throughout his life.

437
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,920
 He had just dockets in jars all over the house.

438
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
 He was very old.

439
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
 He was scruged.

440
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
 That's scrooge.

441
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
 That is scrooge, isn't it?

442
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
 Wow.

443
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
 Yeah.

444
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
 It's scrooge, but duck, isn't it?

445
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
 Like that?

446
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
 Kind of swimming in his own dockets.

447
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
 Yes.

448
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
 Yes.

449
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
 You're right.

450
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
 Scrooge muck duck it.

451
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
 Yeah.

452
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
 As you say, he was very rich.

453
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,480
 Do you know what his estimated worth was of all the stuff that grows on that, 1.6 million

454
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
 dockets?

455
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
 So 50,000 florins.

456
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
 Oh, great.

457
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
 There we go.

458
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
 Yeah.

459
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
 Yeah.

460
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
 So James was bang on.

461
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
 50,000 florins.

462
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
 Yeah.

463
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
 So it's about 35 million in today's money.

464
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
 James, what?

465
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
 For an artist.

466
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
 That is...

467
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
 Well, he was one of the big ones, I suppose.

468
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
 Yeah, yeah.

469
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,840
 And he lived a long, old time, 88 is ancient for someone to get to, so I suppose...

470
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,040
 And he kept working as well.

471
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
 Yes, he did, didn't he?

472
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,080
 So he would have been getting royalties, I guess, from earlier works all the way through.

473
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,320
 Is a royalty system exist for that?

474
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,080
 Well, it's more kind of dukes, wasn't it, at the time, to have to joke about the Medici family.

475
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,120
 It's a very good, if you're an artist or an artist.

476
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
 Cool.

477
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,120
 I'll do some research and get back to you with one of my historians how they're absolutely

478
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
 crap.

479
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,240
 He apparently, despite all his wealth, was not into personal hygiene.

480
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,600
 There's a lot of legends about him, and George Iversari is one of the people to perpetuate

481
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,440
 a lot of those.

482
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,000
 So this is not from him, I don't believe, but another legend is that when he died, because

483
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,640
 he showered so little or bathed, so little, they had to peel his clothes off him, because

484
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,520
 he hadn't changed in so long, it had sort of congealed to his body.

485
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,680
 Yeah, it wasn't a very striptease ever.

486
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,920
 I'm your Michelangelo grant tonight, I'd be happy to feel my congealed clothes off my body,

487
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,760
 which is wait for me to die.

488
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,600
 Don't be shocked when you see where my pubic hair is.

489
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,920
 Jesus, I was upset not to go to your stagdool last weekend, Andy, but no, I'm saying

490
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:19,880
 I've got a bit of a lightly, okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

491
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,400
 My fact is that a plane was once built, which had nine wings.

492
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,280
 You would think it would have to be an even number?

493
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
 I know.

494
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,400
 I think this plane actually had 18 wings, but that is a controversial theory.

495
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,200
 Well, okay, explain what it is and we'll decide whether it's nine or 18.

496
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:45,240
 Alright, so this comes from an article on airspacemag.com, which is a great website about air and space.

497
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:51,280
 This plane was built in 1921, it was called the novoplano, and so you know how you have a normal

498
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,800
 plane, two wings, then you've got a biplane, which has two layers of wings, although that technically

499
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,520
 the top one only counts as one wing, supposedly, okay, so does a biplane have four wings or two?

500
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,080
 Okay, the novoplano was another level.

501
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,400
 It had three sets of wings front to back, and each one was three layers high.

502
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
 Okay.

503
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
 Okay.

504
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,880
 So, like a biplane, but turn it into a triplane, and then do that three times.

505
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
 Yes.

506
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,720
 So, if you're going by a biplane logic, it just had six wings, right?

507
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,880
 No, no, because it had three decks.

508
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,280
 No, I know, but it didn't have...

509
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
 Three wings each.

510
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,440
 I know, but are you saying that a biplane has two wings?

511
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,800
 I thought you were saying that a biplane had three wings, because it's got two wings as

512
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,720
 a normal plane, and then it's got one at the top, which I thought he was saying that too,

513
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
 but he wasn't.

514
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,080
 He then confirmed that you think a biplane officially has two wings, because they count as one

515
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
 each.

516
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
 It's very weird.

517
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,880
 A monoplane has two wings, and so does a biplane.

518
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
 That's frustrating.

519
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,440
 I think then, by your logic, it doesn't matter how many layers up, it's still just one wing.

520
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
 No way.

521
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
 Okay, this plane has one wing.

522
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
 Stop trying to destroy the fact.

523
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
 It looks insane.

524
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
 It looks insane.

525
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,880
 I'm going to put a picture up on Twitter.

526
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,480
 I think you better have the one you've explained.

527
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,040
 So why do we not have this same plane taking us to, you know, Tenerife?

528
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,240
 Well, it crashed almost immediately.

529
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
 It's second-ever test flight.

530
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
 It crashed.

531
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,800
 I'm amazed it didn't crash on its first flight, just because it's so hard to land on water

532
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
 because it was a...

533
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
 What's a sea plane, though, right?

534
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,200
 It was a flying boat, which is slightly different to a sea plane.

535
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,920
 Is that about a floating plane or a flying boat, and they're different things?

536
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
 They are different things.

537
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
 Yeah, yeah.

538
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
 Is this about how they identify?

539
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,440
 Is it like the flying boat sees itself as mostly a boat?

540
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,160
 So the sea plane is, you know the one where Indiana Jones gets onto, it's got floats under

541
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
 its feet, right?

542
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
 Yes.

543
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
 So they land on water.

544
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
 On these feet, hey.

545
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
 On these things.

546
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
 Land on.

547
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
 Okay.

548
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
 We tried to get into there.

549
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
 Okay.

550
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,160
 Those are the planes which are basically look like the wearing massive shoes, okay?

551
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
 Because they float on those.

552
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
 Okay.

553
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
 Thanks.

554
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,960
 Then there's flying boats, and they have the buoyancy built into the fuselage.

555
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,680
 So they land basically on water.

556
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,560
 The main body of the plane is the thing that's floating on the water.

557
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:06,600
 But in the USA, sea planes are called float planes and they use the term sea plane to describe

558
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,720
 both float planes and flying boats.

559
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
 Oh my gosh.

560
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
 Right.

561
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,200
 So which one was this?

562
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,200
 This is a flying boat.

563
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
 Flying boat.

564
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
 This is a flying boat.

565
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,400
 So the fuselage was basically a boat, but that had wings.

566
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
 Yeah, exactly.

567
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
 Yeah.

568
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,320
 And it got smashed up on its second ever flight and it now exists as a model and a few bits

569
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
 of wreckage in the museum.

570
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
 It was in Italy.

571
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
 It was flying.

572
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
 Like Maggiore.

573
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
 Really?

574
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
 The passenger plane, wasn't it?

575
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
 Yeah.

576
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
 Yeah.

577
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
 The wings were made of linen as far as I can tell.

578
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
 Well, linen.

579
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
 Well canvas, you know.

580
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,160
 It was a really early days of flight, obviously.

581
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,040
 God, if someone's just attached a sheet to the outside of my planes and is hoping it's going

582
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,520
 to fly, I'm not surprised at crash.

583
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
 Nine sheets.

584
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
 Nine sheets.

585
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,040
 That's one of the phrase nine sheets to the windwinds, isn't it?

586
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
 Is that a phrase?

587
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
 I don't think it's three sheets to the windwinds.

588
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
 Oh, is that what it meant?

589
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
 Now you're counting them.

590
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
 Yeah.

591
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,320
 So there's been lots of really cool planes in history, haven't they?

592
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,020
 There's loads of, especially during military times, they always try and invent new things and,

593
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:09,000
 you know, even when they started making airplanes, they didn't really know how they worked and

594
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 stuff like that.

595
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,920
 So there was lots of different ideas.

596
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,600
 I really like these parasite flight fighters that they tried to do for most of the 20th

597
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
 century.

598
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,280
 And the idea is you have one big plane and then inside it, you have lots of little planes

599
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,280
 and then they fly out and attack like the town.

600
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,720
 So the big plane takes you there and saves all the petrol for the other guys and then they

601
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,240
 can go on little forays.

602
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,640
 Has it landed or are you flying out of the plane?

603
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,520
 You're flying out of the plane, mid-flight.

604
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,520
 What?

605
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
 Yeah.

606
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
 And they try to do it loads and loads of times.

607
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,000
 Usually the problem is that they just all crash into each other, that happens quite a lot.

608
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 But they experimented from the 19, from 1915 all the way through to the late 1950s.

609
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,520
 The USSR were the only ones who really made anything that was kind of useful.

610
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,040
 Everyone else tried it and couldn't.

611
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,080
 And the reason we don't do it anymore and I didn't realize this is a thing is these days

612
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,760
 you can refuel your aeroplane while it's flying.

613
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,560
 Oh, isn't that amazing?

614
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,560
 I don't.

615
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,400
 I've never noticed a plane I'm on stopping at a petrol station ever.

616
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,680
 Well, that's when you're in the airport.

617
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,880
 That's what the petrol station is.

618
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,560
 They come and fill you with petrol, right?

619
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,960
 Yeah, but so how do you refuel while it's flying?

620
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
 It's really weird.

621
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,960
 You just get one aeroplane with loads of petrol in it and you fly it next to the aeroplane

622
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,360
 with not much petrol in it and then you attach them together.

623
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,920
 So it's not my planes that I've been on that are getting refueled.

624
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,200
 No, no, you're probably not.

625
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,120
 Yeah, but if you've seen the movie Air Force One, they refuel the plane mid-flight.

626
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,120
 Today.

627
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,880
 Yeah, and Harrison Ford uses that as the big moment to sort of get to another plane.

628
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
 I think I'm right.

629
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,120
 You must not have a really long, you know, the toggles you put in because you know it's

630
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,880
 someone that's quite hard when you park your car on the wrong side of a petrol plane.

631
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
 Yeah.

632
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
 And you have to stretch it all the way around.

633
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
 Yeah.

634
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
 Yeah.

635
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,760
 If you fly on the wrong side of the aeroplane, that's going to be really awkward here.

636
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
 Okay.

637
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,280
 On this, on this mid-air thing, it is insane.

638
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:57,320
 So there was a flying boat, okay, in the 1930s called the short empire, right?

639
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,520
 And the problem was they couldn't get enough fuel into it for it to make it all the way across

640
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,680
 the Atlantic, okay?

641
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
 Okay.

642
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
 So that's the problem.

643
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:10,120
 But it could be loaded with more fuel than it could take off with.

644
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,880
 So it can only get into the air if it has under a certain amount of fuel on it.

645
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,880
 But once you get it into the air, you can load it with extra fuel.

646
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
 Yeah.

647
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:26,080
 The idea was this plane took off towards the USA from Britain with not enough fuel to get

648
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
 there.

649
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
 Yeah.

650
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,080
 And then while it was over island, it would be refueled by another plane, as it went.

651
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,840
 It would take off without enough fuel to get to where it was meant to go.

652
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,800
 And it had to refuel with 800 extra gallons of fuel.

653
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
 Yeah.

654
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
 That's extraordinary.

655
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:48,680
 We do have planes now that can carry other, well, flying machines.

656
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,520
 There's a plane called White Knight II.

657
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,080
 And this is the, so it's not operational yet, but it will be within a few years, I think.

658
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,760
 It looks like a catamaran, really.

659
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,480
 So it, or it looks kind of like two planes, a simultaneous twins, and one of their wings

660
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
 is fused.

661
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
 Yes.

662
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
 Oh, yeah.

663
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
 It's an incredible looking thing.

664
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,000
 But it's actually built to be able to take off like two planes stuck together.

665
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,680
 And then hanging underneath this shed wing will be the Virgin rocket, which will then take

666
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
 tourists into space.

667
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,520
 So not only do you get to go to space if you pay for this, but you get the bonus of things

668
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,080
 suspended under a weird double-cyme plane catamaran thing.

669
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
 It's extraordinary.

670
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,040
 Have you ever seen footage of it when it drops the plane?

671
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
 Oh, no.

672
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
 I haven't seen that.

673
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
 So that's the thing.

674
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,160
 Obviously, the rocket can't thrust its, or boost its thrusters while it's still attached

675
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,480
 to this other plane.

676
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,920
 So it literally plummets and they have to turn on the engine as they're dropping a pump

677
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
 of fuel.

678
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,440
 And then it kind of just finds its way.

679
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,120
 So you're in sort of freefall for a while when you're inside this.

680
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
 Is this in the rocket or in the plane?

681
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
 In the rocket?

682
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
 Wow.

683
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
 Yeah, that's it.

684
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,160
 God, imagine if people have bought tickets and they're listening to this now, having

685
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
 not realized.

686
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,680
 Because that sounds terrifying.

687
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,560
 I think you would have watched a YouTube video before pressing, and you catch us.

688
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
 You're right.

689
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,760
 You just mentioned two planes being stuck together is what this looks like.

690
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
 Yeah.

691
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,080
 One time, as far as I'm aware, that two planes have stuck together mid-flight, right?

692
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,400
 This was in 1940.

693
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,640
 This was a training flight above Australia.

694
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,280
 Two bomber planes crashed together, okay?

695
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,880
 Disaster, obviously, except that one of them basically jammed over the other one, and they

696
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,680
 just got stuck together in mid-air.

697
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,320
 So the one on top had its wings and its controls still intact, and the one beneath had the engine

698
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,800
 working.

699
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:36,600
 And the pilot of the plane on top managed to land successfully, but that's ridiculous.

700
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,720
 That doesn't sound like it's made up by Dan Zitalion, Ryan Blessed Guy.

701
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
 I know.

702
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
 Nobody died.

703
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,480
 One person jumped out and was hit by a propeller.

704
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
 Even he was fine eventually.

705
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
 He just covered.

706
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,720
 But it's amazing that just so happens that the engine works for this one, and the steering

707
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
 works.

708
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,760
 It's like, oh, the coffee machine works for this one, but luckily the sandwich maker works

709
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
 on the other one.

710
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,520
 Do you think they had a chat between the planes going, "We're like Jack Spratt and his wife,

711
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,080
 aren't we?"

712
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,760
 Just on this thing that you were talking about carrying space shuttles, the largest plane

713
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,600
 that's ever been made, which was the Anatov AN225 Maria, which was made in Ukraine in

714
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,440
 Soviet times.

715
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,320
 This has the record for the biggest payload ever taken, and they carried shuttles from

716
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,640
 one part of Russia to the other, the Soviet Union to the other.

717
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:35,440
 That was the main job of them, and one time they carried a generator for a gas power plant

718
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,920
 in Armenia, which weighed 247,000 kilograms, which is the weight of 80 elephants.

719
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,640
 That's the largest payload of any aeroplane ever.

720
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,240
 That is so amazing.

721
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
 That's amazing.

722
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,000
 And then it went into commercial service in the early 2000s.

723
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 And by the way, do you have extra luggage because it doesn't matter?

724
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,120
 Emotional support elephant with me.

725
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,360
 When I say commercial, I don't mean you can buy a flight on it.

726
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,920
 It was used for companies, and actually at one stage, the American military took it and

727
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,960
 took 216,000 ready meals to military personnel in Oman.

728
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
 Wow.

729
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
 So that's cool.

730
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,240
 It was out of chicken or fish, but it's fine.

731
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,680
 It was transported on 375 pallets weighing 187.5 tons of ready meals.

732
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
 Oh man.

733
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,480
 Do you know why nuclear planes have never been tried?

734
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
 Because they sound dangerous.

735
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,000
 They do sound dangerous.

736
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,320
 They are dangerous.

737
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,360
 So people have kept trying all the way through, kind of like the thing you were mentioning

738
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
 James of Parasite.

739
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,360
 Parasite ones.

740
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,360
 Yeah, the Parasite planes.

741
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
 Yeah.

742
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,000
 So I think the USA have tried, I'm sure the Soviet Union tried as well.

743
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,680
 Basically, they could not work out how to deal with radiation and to keep the planes light.

744
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,720
 Because obviously, to protect against radiation, you need a very heavy thick armor stuff.

745
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,880
 So one thing they considered doing, this was in the 50s in the USA, was just hiring pilots

746
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,840
 who were so elderly that they would certainly die before any effects of radiation got through

747
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
 to them.

748
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
 Wow.

749
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,840
 That was the plan.

750
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
 What a move.

751
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
 That's crazy.

752
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,160
 JFK cancelled that plan.

753
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
 Yeah.

754
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
 Yeah.

755
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:20,800
 I've found a few sort of, as we were saying earlier, those that military period of plane

756
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,680
 innovation, which is extraordinary decisions they had to make.

757
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,600
 So when the Navy was out and they needed planes that were on their ships, in the early days,

758
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
 they didn't have landing strips that were long enough.

759
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,680
 So they could launch with some help, but they couldn't get back because it was too short.

760
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,600
 So what they did was they started toying with ideas like building a plane, which this

761
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,480
 was prototype called the Blackburn Blackbird.

762
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,320
 And the idea was that you could take off, but you weren't meant to return.

763
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,800
 The plane was designed to be ditched in the ocean by the ship.

764
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,600
 But luckily all the pilots were so old that they were expected to die before they got

765
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
 to them.

766
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
 Yeah, exactly.

767
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
 Wait, sorry.

768
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
 These were single-use planes.

769
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
 No.

770
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,400
 If you were successful, you came back and you ditched the plane as close to the ship as possible,

771
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,480
 and hopefully the ship got to you before both you and the plane sank.

772
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,920
 If it did, they would lift the plane back onto the ship and then they would rebuild it

773
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
 and you could reuse it.

774
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
 What?

775
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
 Well, they had no choice because it was...

776
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
 No, I'm sorry, I'm confused.

777
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
 When you say ditched a plane, do you mean fly it into the sea?

778
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,920
 Yeah, fly into the ocean.

779
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

780
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,240
 So the pilot would be waiting with the plane while it's sinking.

781
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,360
 Another thing they tried to solve that was something called the Flying Pancake, which the Flying

782
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:32,400
 Pancake either had no wings, one wing, or an infinite number of wings, depending on how

783
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
 you're looking at it.

784
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
 It's a whole wing.

785
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,560
 It's a pancake shape, so it's flat, and it's kind of tilted, and it's got massive

786
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,600
 propellers on it, and so if you were sailing into a headwind, then the wind can help you

787
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,800
 just take off by using the shape of your flying pancake.

788
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,840
 And if you weren't going into a headwind, it had these massive propellers that you could

789
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:58,320
 create your own headwind, and so it could blow air over your aerophile and help you take

790
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
 off that way.

791
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
 That sounds amazing.

792
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
 Yeah.

793
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
 And it looked kind of like a flying saucer, right?

794
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
 They do, yeah, yeah.

795
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,280
 Don't like the idea of flying something called a pancake, because I imagine pancakes flipping

796
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,560
 at 180 degrees in the air.

797
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,080
 And the reason we don't use them now is basically because jet engines came in, so we didn't need

798
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
 them anymore.

799
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,080
 Once you had jet engines, you could get to a really high speed really quickly.

800
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,120
 So it did work, fine.

801
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
 Yeah, work.

802
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,400
 Oh god, we've got to talk about the inflator plane quickly, just very quickly.

803
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,160
 This was a sort of foldable collapsible plane that was commissioned by Good Year, of course,

804
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,680
 in the 1950s, and it could deflate and be transported in like a three and a half foot

805
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,640
 container, a little container.

806
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,280
 And it was actually a brilliant idea.

807
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,240
 So it was built in just 12 weeks, which doesn't have a worry any short time in which to build

808
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,200
 an entire plane, designed and built.

809
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,840
 But Good Year, the idea was that a single person would be able to hand pump it, and so you

810
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,200
 could drop it behind enemy lines, so you'd drop it from your plane, behind enemy lines where

811
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,880
 your men were captured, and they'd have that little hand pump on the ground, I suppose,

812
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,720
 waiting for this moment, and they'd pump it up until it got big enough, and then they

813
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
 could take off.

814
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,040
 So it would have like a little tube in case your pump wasn't working so you could blow it

815
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
 by mouth.

816
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
 I think it must have.

817
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
 Yeah, yeah.

818
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:20,320
 Anyway, look, it had a test flight in 1957, and it sort of went into a spiral, and one of

819
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,640
 the wings got floppy and folded on top of it, and got chopped off by the propeller.

820
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,640
 Oh, I know.

821
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,560
 So it never really, it really never took off.

822
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,000
 I'll tell you what, with that of your paper company, Folding, it's been a bad day, it's been

823
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,680
 a bad day for puns all the way.

824
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,920
 Okay, it is time for our final factor, the show, and that is my fact.

825
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:50,040
 My fact is that this year a sperm bank lost a court case to a man named Dick Weiner.

826
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,680
 So this has happened in Oregon, in America, and the jury, who is dealing with the case,

827
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,720
 afforded $400,000 American dollars to two Oregon dog breeders, because the international

828
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,000
 canine semen bank accidentally destroyed both of their Labrador sperms.

829
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,920
 Why did you not tell us the name of the other breeder?

830
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,200
 Yeah, because Fanny vagina is not as interesting to be fair.

831
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,680
 So this is from Oregon Live, which is a big newspaper in Oregon.

832
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,760
 But in every other report I've seen, it's Richard Weiner, and only just discovered that

833
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,320
 before we came upstairs to record this, so, but he's still, it's still, you know, parents

834
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,320
 should have known.

835
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
 His name's Dick Weiner.

836
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
 His name's Dick Weiner, exactly.

837
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,920
 So, yeah, this is amazing.

838
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
 Yeah.

839
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,120
 I didn't know there was an international canine semen bank.

840
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
 Did you not?

841
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
 No, I did.

842
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
 I did.

843
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
 I did.

844
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
 I did.

845
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
 I did.

846
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
 I did.

847
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,120
 I did.

848
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
 I did.

849
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
 I did.

850
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,120
 I did.

851
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
 I did.

852
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
 I did.

853
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,120
 I did.

854
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
 I did.

855
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,120
 I did.

856
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,120
 I did.

857
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
 I just keep all of mine in Bargley's.

858
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
 I think bigger.

859
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,520
 So it used to exist mainly for professional dog breeders, so that if you had, you know, a top

860
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,120
 dog, then you could pass on their genes for generations, but now it seems to be just sentimental

861
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,120
 dog owners who want an exact copy of their beloved pet before, you know, after they've

862
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,120
 died.

863
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,920
 It's probably not people who don't know how genetics works, basically.

864
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
 Yeah.

865
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,320
 It's, you know, you will get a quarter of the dog you had.

866
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,320
 Well, it's better than nothing, isn't it, Andy?

867
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
 Okay.

868
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,240
 I should say, this mistake with the dog seeming that Dick Weiner found this happened 20 years

869
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
 ago.

870
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,240
 Yeah.

871
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
 This story goes all the way back.

872
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
 Wow.

873
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,240
 I know.

874
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,240
 Well, no, no.

875
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,440
 It's, it's, they, they knew that they stuffed up 20 years ago.

876
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
 Exactly.

877
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,000
 Dick Weiner only found out a few years ago, because of ex-employee told him randomly, as I

878
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 probably don't know.

879
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Yeah.

880
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 He was a whistle bar.

881
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Yeah.

882
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 So that he deposited the sperm in the 90s, I think.

883
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Yeah.

884
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,200
 And then in the, maybe late 90s, early 90s, it was accidentally thawed out, making it worthless.

885
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,720
 And 20, nearly 20 years later, it disgruntled ex-employee must have told him.

886
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,460
 Unfortunately, this guy who thawed out the sperm had done the same thing 18 months earlier,

887
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,460
 hadn't he?

888
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,460
 [laughter]

889
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,680
 For 500,000 liters was flushed away.

890
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,680
 [laughter]

891
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
 Okay.

892
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:11,800
 Well, I looked up their costs, the International Seaman Bank, K9 Seaman Bank, very important.

893
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,560
 For, to store your dog Seaman for a year, it's $324 to deposit and store it for a year.

894
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:24,600
 But then every year after that, it's $79 a year, which is, I think, what Amazon Prime used

895
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
 to cost.

896
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
 [laughter]

897
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,120
 That's a very different service, isn't it?

898
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
 [laughter]

899
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,280
 You've got to weigh it up when you're making your budget choices, yeah?

900
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
 [laughter]

901
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,560
 But, and you, another thing you can do with this, these banks, and this is not, we should

902
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,680
 say, other dog Seaman banks are available, when, you know.

903
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,700
 But another thing you can do, I think, is ship your dog's testicles to them after your dog

904
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,700
 has been neutered.

905
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,700
 You have to, you can't, yeah?

906
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,700
 What?

907
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,500
 Snipp 'em off, and ship 'em off, and ship 'em off, and ship 'em off.

908
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
 [laughter]

909
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,300
 That's what you do.

910
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,300
 Wow.

911
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,240
 You can get instructions for how to do it yourself, I think.

912
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,160
 So most people can do it at a vet and say, "Would you mind sending these balls to the

913
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,160
 bank?"

914
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:05,520
 But, um, some banks do give, some banks do give instructions on how to package up your

915
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,680
 testicles, and you have to send them off ASAP.

916
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,080
 Like, within a two or three hours, yeah.

917
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,200
 You must have to send them in a special, cool, cool box.

918
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
 Yeah, I think you must do, yeah.

919
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
 You've got it all to the package, ain't it?

920
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,160
 I just walk into the, into the Royal Mail, in a pair of, I don't know, dogmackers, and

921
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,160
 by an envelope, can you?

922
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,300
 No, and what if you do, you've got to go first class, 'cause it really is time for the

923
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,300
 rest of us.

924
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,300
 [laughter]

925
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,880
 Do you know, um, who did the first ever artificial insemination of a dog?

926
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:40,080
 No, it was none of the digby clans.

927
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:46,360
 It was an Italian physiologist called Lazaro Spalanzini, and we probably, do you guys have

928
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
 heard of him?

929
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
 I've heard of him.

930
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
 What was his thing?

931
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
 Frogs and pants?

932
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
 Frogs and pants?

933
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
 Exactly.

934
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,560
 Abonanas and pajamas, was the sequel, isn't it?

935
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:02,200
 He is most famous among QI research, at least, for putting male frogs in form-fitting rubber

936
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:10,040
 pants, to prove that, that they couldn't fertilize eggs if they couldn't get what was in the genitals

937
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
 out over the eggs.

938
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
 Right.

939
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
 If you know what I mean, yeah, yeah.

940
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,280
 So he basically proved how reproduction worked.

941
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,480
 He also was the first person to note the effect of cooling on human sperm.

942
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,000
 So you know how they say that you should wear, at least, warm-ish underpants if you want

943
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 to conceive babies.

944
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Is that right, Dan?

945
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 Yeah, you, well, not too tight, but you need to keep it.

946
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Who's flowing?

947
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,680
 No, Lucy's not as good for you.

948
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,760
 They need to be kept reasonably warm.

949
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,760
 Yes.

950
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,280
 And you don't put your testicles on ice, basically.

951
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
 Okay.

952
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
 You don't need your underpants.

953
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,560
 So it's a very odd sort of warm, not hot.

954
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,840
 You need to keep it at the right temperature, but he was the first person to notice that.

955
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:53,840
 And he noted that if you put sperm on snow, they would stop swimming around.

956
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
 Wow.

957
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
 Wow.

958
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,160
 So he would have, he would have had microscopy, technology, I guess.

959
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,280
 This was after what's his name, yeah, Liv and Hook.

960
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,920
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

961
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
 Gosh.

962
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,320
 That was really very cool.

963
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
 Yeah.

964
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
 It was a cool guy.

965
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,320
 Cool guy.

966
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,320
 I got ski.

967
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,320
 That was fun.

968
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,320
 That was ski.

969
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
 They just don't get a public school.

970
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:21,560
 And the first person to make puppies from frozen dog semen was a guy called Steven W.J.

971
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
 Siga.

972
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,040
 He's still alive, actually.

973
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,720
 He's a veterinarian from Ireland who moved to Oregon.

974
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:35,840
 And this was in 1969 and they made some baby Labrador's and they called them popsicles because

975
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,920
 they came from frozen semen.

976
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,920
 Very cool.

977
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,880
 Do you say popsicles?

978
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,040
 Well, that would have been good, wouldn't it?

979
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,640
 The article I read says popsicles, but popsicles would have been way better.

980
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,640
 Yeah.

981
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,640
 So maybe that's not a correct thing.

982
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,000
 Guys, have you ever seen fish being artificially insuminated?

983
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 No.

984
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Oh, my gosh.

985
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 It's incredible.

986
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,680
 I can't emphasize enough how much you have to watch this video.

987
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,400
 But basically, on a lot of fish farms, it's more efficient, or if you really want to control

988
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,120
 how many fish are being insuminated, then you do it artificially.

989
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,320
 And the way they do it, I actually learned this in an interview with a guy called Mike Freeze,

990
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:16,920
 which seems kind of almost suitable, who is a fish farmer in the US.

991
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,680
 And then I was led to this video of coy fish breeding, so coy car, very expensive.

992
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,200
 And they are being bred at Kentucky State University.

993
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,200
 Look it up, basically.

994
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,360
 You get the female out of the water, and she's alive and gets laying down in some paper towel

995
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:37,440
 for some reason, and then just lifted up and massaged from top to bottom, and you squeeze

996
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
 the eggs out.

997
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:44,560
 And what the eggs are, is this thick, brownie green slime that just spouts out, it's incredible.

998
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:49,040
 It's like sludge coming out, so they put that in a bowl, pop her back in the water, get

999
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,040
 the ladder out.

1000
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,200
 Do exactly the same with him, and it's a little bit less.

1001
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,200
 But you squeeze it out.

1002
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,920
 Like, maybe it looks like mayonnaise coming out of mayonnaise thing.

1003
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,000
 And then you just stir it up together, like you're making a cake, and they mix it together,

1004
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,840
 and then you leave that for three to five minutes, and pop it back in the water.

1005
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,360
 It sounds like a recipe, isn't it?

1006
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,360
 A recipe for fish.

1007
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
 Mark, sorry.

1008
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:14,280
 It's very apart stewed, this with coy car, because they're very shy, aren't they?

1009
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,560
 I have something about Crofts, because it's about champion dogs.

1010
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,560
 Yes.

1011
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,840
 Only one dog has ever pooed live in the middle of a crush's event.

1012
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,840
 Did he win?

1013
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,840
 Or did he win?

1014
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,840
 Instant disqualification.

1015
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
 No.

1016
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,840
 It's, the video is on YouTube.

1017
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,840
 We did a lot of YouTube recommendations today.

1018
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,120
 YouTube's going to be getting some real hits after this podcast.

1019
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,120
 It's incredible.

1020
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,120
 It's 2012.

1021
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,120
 This is the only one I've found.

1022
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,120
 We should say, sorry, quickly, we should say for international listeners, Crofts, is

1023
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,120
 the biggest dog show in the world.

1024
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
 Sorry, yeah.

1025
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,120
 I don't think he's as well known outside of this country, but it's the massive dog show.

1026
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,120
 In UK, it's all we talk about.

1027
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,120
 But, yeah, sorry.

1028
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,720
 Crofts, biggest dog show in the world, and it was in 2012, and the video is online of

1029
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,960
 the full attempt, because, you know, they have to do the full course, and they do the

1030
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,320
 slalom, and they do the seasore, and they do the jumping over things.

1031
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:04,880
 Anyway, the reaction of the crowd is so funny, because it's an amazing run.

1032
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
 It's going so well.

1033
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,800
 And then the dog just absolutely stops dead and squats down, and the whole crowd goes,

1034
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
 "Oh!"

1035
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
 That's amazing.

1036
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,000
 And he only gets handed a plastic bag by a crossbow boy.

1037
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Oh, no!

1038
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,360
 It's very much the Paul the Radcliffe of the dog breeding world.

1039
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,360
 It's a really funny video.

1040
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,720
 Why do they have such mad names in Crofts?

1041
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,720
 It's bizarre.

1042
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,240
 Because you have to have, your dog name has to be involved the name of the breeder somewhere,

1043
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,040
 but I was looking at the best in shows, and the list.

1044
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:41,440
 So the most recent was called "Planet Waves for Ever Young Daydream Believers".

1045
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,840
 I think last year or the year before, it was McVan's "Torussia with Love".

1046
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,080
 There's also Afterglow Maverick Saber, Iraqi Fabulous Willy.

1047
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,080
 They're crazy.

1048
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:56,480
 They're crazy, Dalga, a good spice, and I can't find any good reason why, except that you're

1049
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
 not supposed to have replicated names.

1050
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,080
 But they can't have run out of words so much that all you could use is in "Raki Fabulous

1051
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,080
 Willy".

1052
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:13,280
 That's a wish list on a dating profile, isn't it?

1053
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,440
 That's it, that's all of our facts, thank you so much for listening.
