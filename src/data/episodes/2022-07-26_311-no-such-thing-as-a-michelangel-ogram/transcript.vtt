00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840
 [ I can't wait to get back to the recording ]

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:19.160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.100
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.100
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.200
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin, and once again

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.100
 we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.260
 days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.020
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.660
 Okay, my fact this week is that when the world's largest bottle of wine sprung a leak this

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.300
 year, the owner called the local fire department who stopped the spillage with sandbags.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.460
 Wow, how big are we talking?

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.020
 We're talking big.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:02.760
 It was 9.8 feet tall, 2.6 tonnes in weight, and 1,590 litres, which is about the equivalent

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.440
 of 2,000 bottles of wine.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.700
 If we lived in a truly circular recycling economy, then they would have gone, solved the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.140
 wine problem, retained the wine and used it to put out their next fire.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.380
 Well, they could have done that, apart from the wine is still drinkable.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 Believe it or not.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.620
 Not the stuff they squeegeed off the floor.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.100
 Well, it depends on your standards, right?

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 That's true.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.980
 So, they took this bottle of wine and they got all the stuff off the floor, and then they

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.780
 took the wine from the bottle and put it into barrels, and they've checked it, they took

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.460
 it to a winery to test, and it's been deemed fit for consumption, and they're going to sell

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 it by the glass at an upcoming event.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 Cool.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.300
 That's going to take some ages, isn't it?

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.900
 So, why did they build it in the first place?

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.380
 Well, they build it because people like building large things.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.940
 It was just like a publicity stunt, I suppose.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.380
 It was sold to a Chinese restaurant in Austria, and they had it on display.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.900
 It was in a giant climate controlled glass chamber, really cool, so it was like a big fridge,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.460
 and they think that's where the problem came from.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.740
 They think the electricity went off, and so when it was not as heated, then wine expands,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.100
 or liquids expand in a bottle when the temperatures are changed, and they think that's what led

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.100
 to the leaking.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.580
 Was it got cooler in it?

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.620
 No, it got warmer, so it was in the fridge, and it got warmer, so it expanded, and it pushed

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.820
 the cork up, and left a little bit of a gap where the wine could come out.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.820
 Yeah.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.340
 And I guess they brought the fire department, because they were a bit scared about what was

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.340
 going to happen.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.340
 They couldn't tell where it was leaking from to begin with.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.180
 Well, it's a big lot of glass, and they were worried it might explode.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.620
 Exactly, so it could have just shattered onto them, and that's a lot of less than a restaurant.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.380
 If you order a glass of wine out of this bottle, they have a sort of bodybuilder who has to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.380
 come and pour it.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.100
 How does that work?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.100
 Yeah.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.620
 I think the idea was that the wine in the big bottle was probably never supposed to be

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.620
 drunk.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.020
 It was just a display thing.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.660
 But then once it started leaking out, they were like, "Oh, I'm going to have to drink it

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.660
 now."

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.700
 It's like, you know, when you have a bottle of wine in your fridge, and suddenly the electricity

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.180
 goes off, and you're like, "Well, I'm going to have to drink all the wine in the fridge

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.180
 now.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.180
 That's a thing, James."

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.180
 I don't think so.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.180
 I've had a lot of electricity problems in my house recently.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.180
 So, yeah.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.740
 So you were mentioning another rival bottle of wine.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.100
 Okay, yeah, I forgot about that.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.500
 This has the Guinness World Record for being the largest filled glass wine bottle, but when

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.780
 I was doing the research for this fact, I found another one in Switzerland that was wavy.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.540
 Like, way, way bigger.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.700
 And so I can only think there's some technicality that it's not made of glass, because I couldn't

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.820
 quite tell from the images, or maybe it wasn't full of wine.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.820
 Right, right, right.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.820
 I couldn't really tell.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.260
 So these giant bottles of wine, they are a thing, but I didn't know that most of the wine

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.620
 on earth is transported in giant bottles, or a huge amount of it, yeah.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.900
 So I, okay, I didn't know this, and then I told a few people who are a generation older

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.900
 than me, and they all knew it.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.500
 So maybe this is a generational thing.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.620
 But loads of wine, when it's shipped, it's not shipped in bottles, it's shipped in bulk

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.620
 tankers.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.620
 Did you guys know this?

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.060
 Do you mean like a petrol tanker?

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.060
 Kind of.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.060
 Yeah, really.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.060
 Like in a shipping container.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.540
 But obviously a special container, they don't just pour it into a shipping container and

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.060
 then see it up.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.700
 But basically, a 45% of the wine imported into the UK arrives not in a bottle.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.740
 It arrives in these massive containers.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.740
 The crappier wine, right?

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.820
 Because I think if you're getting the really hardcore good Sather France stuff, then it's

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.820
 bottled in the place.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.820
 It's quite a lot, though.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.100
 I mean, they bottle so much here, and they have labels, which are from, you know, overseas

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.020
 wines, just here that they put on.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.580
 So there's a place in South Helsingland called Avenmouth, and Avenmouth, near the Muth of

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.060
 the River Aven, Aven Muth.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.060
 Okay, anyway.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.060
 They've got...

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.620
 They have a hangar there, which is the size of 12 football pitches, and it's owned by a firm

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.420
 who are a specialist bottleer, and they fill up 720,000 bottles of wine there alone every

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.420
 day.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.740
 They believe that, and the wine arrives in these massive plastic bladders, basically, they're

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.340
 called flexitanks, right?

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.980
 And then they have a special pump and tilt system, they call it, to get the last 150 litres

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.100
 out of each bladder.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.380
 Is that when you're sort of shaking to get the jugs out?

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.380
 Basically.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.180
 And do you have to get it directly into the bottles?

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.180
 That must be quite difficult.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.580
 Do you submerge the bottles and get into the bottles?

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.580
 I don't know.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.580
 How do you do it?

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.580
 I don't know.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.820
 It must be a tap, it's probably a tap, it's probably a tap test, I don't know.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.980
 But these bags are then soaked with wine, because they're obviously, you know, liquid proof

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.620
 on the outside, but on the inside, they're completely soaked with wine, but those bags

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.860
 are then shredded and turned into traffic cones.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.860
 No way.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.300
 And that's why traffic cones are like R&G red and colour.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.300
 Exactly.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.300
 Not like that.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.300
 No, not maybe not.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.740
 It is maybe why drunk people are drawn to traffic cones, because they didn't know at some level.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.740
 It's another hit.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.740
 That's amazing.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.740
 That's really cool.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.740
 Yeah, that's very cool.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.620
 That's like the kind of inheritor of butlers, because butlers are originally bottleers,

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.620
 right?

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.620
 That's, I didn't know that was where that comes from.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.620
 Oh, it's a bottleier.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.340
 It was the King's bottleer who would bottle up all his wine, and I suppose they're your

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.580
 modern-day butlers, an even myth.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.180
 You know that from 1636 to 1860, it was illegal to sell wine by the bottle in the UK.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.700
 You would go to the shop and you'd have your own bottle with your initials on it, and they

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.220
 would fill it up and they'd work out how much you'd bought and by volume and you'd pay

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.300
 by volume.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.020
 And the reason was wine bottle making was kind of quite common in the 17th century, but

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.060
 not until the 19th century could you make it so they were all the same size.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.860
 So duplicitous shopkeepers might kind of sell you a bottle, which is a lot smaller than

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.260
 the normal bottles, so that's why they made it illegal.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.100
 That's going to be hard to hide your alcohol problem when you rock up with 10 bottles.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.820
 Another big party, Mr. Schreiber?

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.820
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.380
 Isn't that just the same as leaving the shop, I mean at least it was 10 bottles, which

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.380
 is what we do today.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.380
 Exactly.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.340
 How do you hide your alcohol problem normally if you're leaving the supermarket with 10

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.340
 bottles of wine every day?

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.940
 I've got it mustache.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.780
 You've got a full facial beard, how is it mustache going to happen?

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.780
 I know.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.780
 It's so distracting.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.780
 They're like, whoa, that guy's weird.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.780
 Let's not question his story.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.660
 I'm kind of annoyed with wine bottles, though, having done the research for this fact.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.660
 Go on.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.660
 Nice of them.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.660
 Well, they're so inefficient.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.660
 They're so heavy.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.660
 Yeah.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.020
 Most of them are made from green glass, which is quite hard to recycle, and also we import

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.900
 so much and bottle so much here that actually even if you recycle it, it's quite hard to find

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.900
 uses for all of it.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.860
 Well, you can get, or you could get paper wine bottles, which are an answer to this, cause-

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.860
 I read about those.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.540
 Yeah, but it's kind of sad because it was in 2014, wasn't it, that they start, they've sort

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.500
 of went global with them, this company, and they're made from compressed recycled paper,

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.100
 and so they're incredibly light, and they, so they weighed 65 grams, which is a seventh

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.740
 of a wine bottle, of a wine bottle's empty, and then they had the little sort of bagging

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:11.340
 inside, you get inside box wine, and really quickly the company unfolded.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.340
 Very clever.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.340
 So that was a real shame.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.900
 Was that intentional though, that when you said folded?

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.380
 It was, but I stole it, so, yeah, but it did the company fold it.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:26.220
 Okay, you could have said crumbles, like that common phrase, the company crumbles.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.580
 That's the way the company crumbles, as they all say.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.460
 Do you know who is known as the father of the modern bottle?

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.460
 Ooh.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.020
 Is it someone famous who we will have heard of?

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.940
 It's someone not famous who you will have heard of.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:39.940
 Oh, who we will.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.100
 Is it someone who's around around Guy Fork's area?

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.900
 Quite close to Guy Fork's, one generation away from Guy Fork's area.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.900
 Is it everyone dig me?

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.900
 It's not.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.700
 But it's someone I was confused with him.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.700
 It's Kennell.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.700
 Kennell's son.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.700
 Kennell's son.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.700
 Kennell's dig me.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.700
 Wow.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.700
 They're back.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.700
 The dig me is a back.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.700
 For anyone just listening.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.700
 This is a four-year callback.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.940
 I really have to put the hours in to be having a good time now.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.840
 Okay, so, ever had dig me, who was the gunpowder plotter, his son was a Kennell

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:16.620
 dig bee and he kind of came up with ways of making really good glass because he was an alchemist

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.620
 and he was like taking stuff.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.720
 Really feel like you're going to say alcoholic.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.300
 And he was like adding metals and oxides to his son and making it really, really hard to

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.600
 make in really good glass and he could make darker glass as well which would make the wine

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.960
 not spoil as quickly.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.960
 Yeah.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.000
 So that's a high achieving family, the dig bees, weren't they?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.800
 I've found a story about, so this fact is about wine leaking out.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.000
 I'm losing precious wine.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.880
 I found a story similar to this.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.480
 In Canada, there's a company called Mission Hill, they make wine.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.880
 And they had an employee called Brent Crosio and he was a sellummon, so he worked inside

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:57.880
 the factory and for years his job was blending wines and he was transferring them between tanks.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.760
 He accidentally left a valve open when he wasn't meant to.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:08.840
 As a result, 5,680 liters of subion blanc spilled to the ground and went down a drain.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.640
 So it cost them $162,500.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.920
 He was fired, obviously, for losing that amount, but it's not the first time he did it.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.200
 So back 18 months earlier, he left a valve open and he flushed 11,000 liters of wine down

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.880
 a drain and they gave him a second chance.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.600
 But it does sound to me like there's someone in that drain with a massive bladder.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.400
 It's like an accomplice, doesn't it?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.720
 You're right, it's a con job, yeah.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.720
 Did you guys see the story?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.520
 Remember the story last year that Tweet that was put out by Hawkesmore restaurant in Manchester,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.560
 which was to the customer who accidentally got given a bottle of chateau, a pound pommel

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:53.120
 roll, 2001, which is £4,500 on our menu last night, hope you enjoy your evening.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.800
 To the member of staff who accidentally gave it away, chin up, one of mistakes happened,

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.800
 we love you anyway.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.800
 Wow.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800
 Okay.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.800
 What a good employer.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.800
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800
 Has that happened again since, though?

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800
 He's been fired.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.120
 Yeah, I remember basically how that must have been.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.240
 But the thing is, a lot of enjoying wine they've shown is if you know it's more expensive,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.560
 you like it more, right?

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.040
 And if you're thinking you're buying the 399 bottle of wine on the Hawkesmore menu, which

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.240
 I don't know if they go down that low, but if you think you're buying the cheap one,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.240
 you get the expensive one.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.240
 You might not enjoy it as much.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.080
 No, they probably would have, I mean, no one can be good enough to surely be, to be,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.120
 I can't differentiate anything above about eight or ten quid, basically.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120
 Okay.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.960
 But have you ever tasted the 4,500?

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.480
 Do you never know that might be such a explosion?

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.480
 Yeah, I have one every other week, and I can't taste the difference.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480
 Line testing.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.400
 This massive bottle of wine that I talked about at the start, you could, if you had drank

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.880
 one bottle of wine to yourself every day since we started this podcast six years ago,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.600
 also, you'd just be draining the bottom of the bottle now.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.200
 That's a great cup of wine, and you would, you would need it after listening to this

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.520
 six years.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.800
 My fact this week is that when Michelangelo sculpted David, the town mayor told him that

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.640
 the nose was too big, so Michelangelo picked up some dust, climbed to the top of the statue,

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.040
 sprinkled the dust down, and claimed they had fixed it.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.680
 So was he making like sculpting noises while he was doing that?

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.680
 Yeah, he must have been, right?

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:31.560
 He went even further, he went even more method, he did take up a hammer and chisel and stuff.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.520
 So this is in 1504, and it was when David was just being displayed in Florence, it was revealed.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.640
 And Pietro Sotarini was the town's sort of mayor chief, anyway, Sotarini said probably

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.120
 displaying his artistic appreciation, you know, I think the nose is a bit outproportant

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.880
 with the rest of the rest of the thing, isn't it?

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.280
 You want to go up and fix it.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.920
 And Michelangelo, everyone was surprised at the time, because Michelangelo was very touchy

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.200
 and really just like criticism.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.120
 And but he said, yeah, absolutely, I'm so sorry, absolutely right, it's enormous.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.400
 And so he picked up a hammer and a chisel and secretly a handful of dust, climbed to the

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.880
 top, pretended to chip away at it, and then Sotarini went, that's absolutely perfect.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.080
 He nailed it, stopped there, came back down again.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.400
 This is like the wine tasting thing with the prices.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.400
 Absolutely.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.000
 If you've told something is better.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 You believe it.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Do you believe it?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.600
 Do we know that this fact is completely true?

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.200
 Well, it comes from this amazing book, which is sort of the foundational book of all art

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.120
 history, which is by George O. Vassari, and it's called The Lives of Most Excellent Painters,

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.720
 Sculptors and Architects, and yeah, so he's sort of founded art history, and it's incredible

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.360
 biographies of all the great artists up until them, or, you know, not all of them, but many

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.160
 of them, many of the Florentine ones, especially.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.280
 And so there are a lot of facts, and very, very true.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.480
 And then we think he had an eye for drama and liked to embellish, so he was friends with

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.760
 Michelangelo and he was.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.760
 He was.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.760
 But even this book, The Lives of the Artists, so the origin story of this book is that he

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.760
 was sitting at a dinner.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:03.080
 This is in the 1500s at the Roman Palazzo with the Cardinal at the time, and the Cardinal

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.720
 was talking about a collection of paintings along with the other people, and he kept

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.480
 noticing they were getting dates wrong, and certain, they were attributing certain bits

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.480
 of art to different people.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.440
 So he said that if someone was going to collect all this information together, they should

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.480
 have someone who knows it really well, and they suggested that he do it.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.040
 So that was his sort of claim for it.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.320
 And the reality is that two of the people he claimed that we're at the dinner with him

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:29.040
 had died already, and they don't think he was even in Rome at the time when that dinner

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.280
 was said to have happened.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.240
 So he was someone who did have a bit of a sort of like bride-blessed or-

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.600
 Yeah, definitely the bride-blessed was day, maybe, because he also claimed that he rescued

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.280
 David at one point.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.720
 So he was born, he was very young when David was sculpted, but in 1527 there were these

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.800
 massive riots in Florence, and one of the rioters was anti-Madeuchi riots, and one of the rioters

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.960
 threw a bench from a parapet, which knocked off David's arm.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.960
 Through a bench.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960
 Yeah.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.960
 Who was this, Goliath?

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:05.640
 Yes, it was arm came off, and Vassari says that he was a boy at the time, he was about 16,

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.800
 and he fought his way through these rioting, marauding crowds to rescue the various pieces

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.800
 of the arm.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800
 It can't be true.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800
 And take what's a safety.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.560
 Actually, what they didn't say is that this was a miniature bench that are travelling

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.560
 salesmen had brought in.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.560
 Wow, we're getting.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.560
 Oh, I'm mega and cold.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.560
 I love mixed episode.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.560
 Cool back.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.560
 I love it.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.560
 He had a broken nose.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.560
 Michael Angelo?

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.560
 Yeah.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.560
 David, supposedly, did.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560
 Yes.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.560
 Because he got into an argument with one of his friends or something.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.560
 Is that right?

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.880
 His friend threw a bench at him.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:42.320
 He was called Pietro Toregiano, and he was supposedly envious of Michelangelo's skills,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.880
 and then, but he also had a very bad temper.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.040
 So smashed him in the face, and he said, "I gave him such a blow on the nose that I felt

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.000
 bone and cartilage go down like biscuits beneath my knuckles."

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.520
 And this mark of mine, he will carry with him to the grave, but it basically screwed his

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.160
 life because everyone loved Michael Angelo, because Michael Angelo was with the Medici's

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.160
 at the time, wasn't he?

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.040
 So he had the protection of the people who ran everything.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.000
 And so Toregiano had to leave Florence.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.640
 He went all the way to England, where possibly he was hired by Henry VIII, and then he started

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.840
 sculpting nobles in England.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.920
 And then wanted to go back to Florence to try and get some help, some students and stuff,

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.760
 but when he went back, no one would go with him because they remembered what he did to

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.760
 Michael Angelo.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.760
 Wow.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.760
 Wow.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.760
 Yeah.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.520
 This is why you should bully and pick on people who are inferior to or smaller or less

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.400
 handed than you are, because if you pick on people above you, then you will reap the

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.400
 consequences, weren't you?

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.400
 Yeah, absolutely right.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.400
 You're bullied league.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.400
 It's going pretty well.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.400
 It's going pretty well.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.400
 Thanks, Andy.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.400
 You're next, by the way.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.240
 So I was looking for Michael Angelo, just what he looked like, and he's in the Sistine

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.600
 Chapel as a self-portrait, we think, which is, but it's not him as a person, it's not him

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.160
 looking healthy, it's him as a piece of flayed skin.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.880
 So there's an image of the last judgment, there's one of the bits of the Sistine Chapel,

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.560
 and there's Saint Bartholomew trying to get into heaven and kind of get God's attention,

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.200
 so hey, I'm saying, let me in, and in one hand he's holding a knife, and in one hand he's

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.760
 holding his own flayed skin, and it says he has got skin as well, so it's not clear when

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.080
 he grew this second skin.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.040
 Well, you can't see him 360, presumably, so maybe it's off his back or something else.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.040
 No, no, you can see it.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.040
 It's the face.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.040
 He's got, what is it saying is he's got two faces, it's not completely accurate.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.040
 I see.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.080
 Michael Angelo didn't paint a completely flayed Saint Bartholomew, because it might have been

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.880
 correct, but the hanging skin that this guy's clutching is Michael Angelo, and we know

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.440
 because he's got a little broken nose.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.360
 But then again, if you break your nose, it's the bone that breaks, it's not the skin that

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.680
 breaks, and so how can you tell if you flay someone's skin, how can you tell if they've

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.680
 got a broken nose?

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.680
 That's a good point.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680
 That's true, that's a good point.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.920
 So you knew nothing about anatomy, did he?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.600
 But he used to paint sort of very buff people with an eight pack, as opposed to a six

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.600
 pack.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.560
 Does that exist in eight pack?

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560
 Yeah, it does.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.560
 It's extremely rare.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.560
 Oh, I can't, but it does exist.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.560
 I've got one.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560
 Yeah, I've got one.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.000
 We're not talking about cans of beer, though, I mean.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.040
 Oh, I haven't got one, though.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:20.320
 So six pack is your basic muscles of your abdomen, but a very small percentage of people

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.200
 do have eight muscles down there, and they think this is a clue as to who might have been

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.720
 one of his main people who he based his paintings and his sculptures off, because if you look

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.920
 at a lot of his sculptures, they all have this particular unusual anatomical thing.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:41.760
 Well, in 2015, it helped to verify two pieces that they were tiny bronze statues that someone

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.400
 had claimed as Michelangelo's, and they said there's no way proving.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.120
 They did years and years of research on it, and they had eight packs.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:53.480
 They had sort of oddly shaped toes, which was another classic feature of Michelangelo's,

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.240
 and they confirmed them as a result of one of his other things.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.240
 So toes, eight pack, what's another thing that might be classic Michelangelo?

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.240
 Tiny toger.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.280
 No, but you're in the right area.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.280
 Enormous.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.280
 Stasticles.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.280
 Anatomically correct pubic hair.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.280
 Okay.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.280
 Oh, no.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.280
 Supposedly it's something that to look out for.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.800
 Do you say bronze these are?

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.800
 Yeah, these are in bronze.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.800
 That's a tough cast in bronze.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800
 Yeah.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.800
 Very fine.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.800
 Yeah.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.200
 I mean, if you're doing pubic hair, I'd be surprised if it wasn't anatomically correct.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.760
 Where are you going to put it on the belly button?

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.520
 As soon as you're choosing to do pubic hair, you're putting it over the pubic region, aren't

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.520
 you?

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:35.840
 It's classically an auto to have the pubic hair in the ears of the people you do.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:42.880
 If he wanted to send someone a present, Michelangelo would send them 33 pairs of apples.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.880
 Okay.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.880
 33 pairs as a present.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.880
 Okay.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.880
 One for every year of Christ's life.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.880
 Oh, okay.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.880
 Okay.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.200
 Do you know why he did that?

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.200
 One for every year.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.200
 No, he's Christ's life.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200
 Okay.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.560
 So I now understand the number, but I don't understand why that particular object.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.560
 No, I don't know.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.560
 Oh, I don't know.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.560
 He was very stingy.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.560
 I know that.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.560
 I think he had a reputation for that.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.280
 So maybe they were the cheapest thing around at the sign.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.280
 Really?

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.880
 Apparently, he was kind of horrible, quite mean, but of a very difficult to work with, a terrible

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.360
 snob.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.680
 And when he died, they found absolute fortune in his house because he was so penny-pinching

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.680
 throughout his life.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.920
 He had just dockets in jars all over the house.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.920
 He was very old.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.920
 He was scruged.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.920
 That's scrooge.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.920
 That is scrooge, isn't it?

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.920
 Wow.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.920
 Yeah.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.920
 It's scrooge, but duck, isn't it?

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.920
 Like that?

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.920
 Kind of swimming in his own dockets.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.920
 Yes.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.920
 Yes.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.920
 You're right.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.920
 Scrooge muck duck it.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.920
 Yeah.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.920
 As you say, he was very rich.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:41.480
 Do you know what his estimated worth was of all the stuff that grows on that, 1.6 million

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.480
 dockets?

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.480
 So 50,000 florins.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.480
 Oh, great.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.480
 There we go.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.480
 Yeah.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.480
 Yeah.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.480
 So James was bang on.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.480
 50,000 florins.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.480
 Yeah.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.480
 So it's about 35 million in today's money.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.480
 James, what?

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.480
 For an artist.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.480
 That is...

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.480
 Well, he was one of the big ones, I suppose.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.840
 And he lived a long, old time, 88 is ancient for someone to get to, so I suppose...

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.040
 And he kept working as well.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.040
 Yes, he did, didn't he?

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.080
 So he would have been getting royalties, I guess, from earlier works all the way through.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.320
 Is a royalty system exist for that?

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:16.080
 Well, it's more kind of dukes, wasn't it, at the time, to have to joke about the Medici family.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.120
 It's a very good, if you're an artist or an artist.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.120
 Cool.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.120
 I'll do some research and get back to you with one of my historians how they're absolutely

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.120
 crap.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:30.240
 He apparently, despite all his wealth, was not into personal hygiene.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.600
 There's a lot of legends about him, and George Iversari is one of the people to perpetuate

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.440
 a lot of those.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.000
 So this is not from him, I don't believe, but another legend is that when he died, because

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.640
 he showered so little or bathed, so little, they had to peel his clothes off him, because

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.520
 he hadn't changed in so long, it had sort of congealed to his body.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:53.680
 Yeah, it wasn't a very striptease ever.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.920
 I'm your Michelangelo grant tonight, I'd be happy to feel my congealed clothes off my body,

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.760
 which is wait for me to die.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:06.600
 Don't be shocked when you see where my pubic hair is.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.920
 Jesus, I was upset not to go to your stagdool last weekend, Andy, but no, I'm saying

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:19.880
 I've got a bit of a lightly, okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:25.400
 My fact is that a plane was once built, which had nine wings.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.280
 You would think it would have to be an even number?

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.280
 I know.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:33.400
 I think this plane actually had 18 wings, but that is a controversial theory.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.200
 Well, okay, explain what it is and we'll decide whether it's nine or 18.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:45.240
 Alright, so this comes from an article on airspacemag.com, which is a great website about air and space.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:51.280
 This plane was built in 1921, it was called the novoplano, and so you know how you have a normal

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:58.800
 plane, two wings, then you've got a biplane, which has two layers of wings, although that technically

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:04.520
 the top one only counts as one wing, supposedly, okay, so does a biplane have four wings or two?

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.080
 Okay, the novoplano was another level.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:12.400
 It had three sets of wings front to back, and each one was three layers high.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.400
 Okay.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400
 Okay.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.880
 So, like a biplane, but turn it into a triplane, and then do that three times.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.880
 Yes.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.720
 So, if you're going by a biplane logic, it just had six wings, right?

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.880
 No, no, because it had three decks.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.280
 No, I know, but it didn't have...

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.280
 Three wings each.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.440
 I know, but are you saying that a biplane has two wings?

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.800
 I thought you were saying that a biplane had three wings, because it's got two wings as

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.720
 a normal plane, and then it's got one at the top, which I thought he was saying that too,

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.720
 but he wasn't.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.080
 He then confirmed that you think a biplane officially has two wings, because they count as one

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080
 each.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.080
 It's very weird.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.880
 A monoplane has two wings, and so does a biplane.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.880
 That's frustrating.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.440
 I think then, by your logic, it doesn't matter how many layers up, it's still just one wing.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.440
 No way.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440
 Okay, this plane has one wing.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.440
 Stop trying to destroy the fact.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.440
 It looks insane.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.440
 It looks insane.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.880
 I'm going to put a picture up on Twitter.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.480
 I think you better have the one you've explained.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.040
 So why do we not have this same plane taking us to, you know, Tenerife?

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.240
 Well, it crashed almost immediately.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.760
 It's second-ever test flight.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.760
 It crashed.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:17.800
 I'm amazed it didn't crash on its first flight, just because it's so hard to land on water

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.800
 because it was a...

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.800
 What's a sea plane, though, right?

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.200
 It was a flying boat, which is slightly different to a sea plane.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.920
 Is that about a floating plane or a flying boat, and they're different things?

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.920
 They are different things.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.920
 Is this about how they identify?

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.440
 Is it like the flying boat sees itself as mostly a boat?

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:38.160
 So the sea plane is, you know the one where Indiana Jones gets onto, it's got floats under

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.160
 its feet, right?

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.160
 Yes.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.160
 So they land on water.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.160
 On these feet, hey.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.160
 On these things.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.160
 Land on.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.160
 Okay.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.160
 We tried to get into there.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160
 Okay.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.160
 Those are the planes which are basically look like the wearing massive shoes, okay?

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.160
 Because they float on those.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.160
 Okay.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.160
 Thanks.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.960
 Then there's flying boats, and they have the buoyancy built into the fuselage.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.680
 So they land basically on water.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.560
 The main body of the plane is the thing that's floating on the water.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:06.600
 But in the USA, sea planes are called float planes and they use the term sea plane to describe

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.720
 both float planes and flying boats.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.720
 Oh my gosh.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.720
 Right.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.200
 So which one was this?

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.200
 This is a flying boat.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.200
 Flying boat.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.200
 This is a flying boat.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.400
 So the fuselage was basically a boat, but that had wings.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.400
 Yeah.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:26.320
 And it got smashed up on its second ever flight and it now exists as a model and a few bits

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.320
 of wreckage in the museum.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.320
 It was in Italy.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320
 It was flying.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.320
 Like Maggiore.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.320
 Really?

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.320
 The passenger plane, wasn't it?

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.320
 Yeah.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.320
 Yeah.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.320
 The wings were made of linen as far as I can tell.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.320
 Well, linen.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.320
 Well canvas, you know.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.160
 It was a really early days of flight, obviously.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.040
 God, if someone's just attached a sheet to the outside of my planes and is hoping it's going

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.520
 to fly, I'm not surprised at crash.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.520
 Nine sheets.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.520
 Nine sheets.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.040
 That's one of the phrase nine sheets to the windwinds, isn't it?

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.040
 Is that a phrase?

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.040
 I don't think it's three sheets to the windwinds.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.040
 Oh, is that what it meant?

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.040
 Now you're counting them.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.040
 Yeah.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.320
 So there's been lots of really cool planes in history, haven't they?

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:04.020
 There's loads of, especially during military times, they always try and invent new things and,

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:09.000
 you know, even when they started making airplanes, they didn't really know how they worked and

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 stuff like that.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.920
 So there was lots of different ideas.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.600
 I really like these parasite flight fighters that they tried to do for most of the 20th

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.600
 century.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.280
 And the idea is you have one big plane and then inside it, you have lots of little planes

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.280
 and then they fly out and attack like the town.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.720
 So the big plane takes you there and saves all the petrol for the other guys and then they

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.240
 can go on little forays.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.640
 Has it landed or are you flying out of the plane?

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.520
 You're flying out of the plane, mid-flight.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.520
 What?

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.520
 Yeah.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.520
 And they try to do it loads and loads of times.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:44.000
 Usually the problem is that they just all crash into each other, that happens quite a lot.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 But they experimented from the 19, from 1915 all the way through to the late 1950s.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.520
 The USSR were the only ones who really made anything that was kind of useful.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.040
 Everyone else tried it and couldn't.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.080
 And the reason we don't do it anymore and I didn't realize this is a thing is these days

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.760
 you can refuel your aeroplane while it's flying.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.560
 Oh, isn't that amazing?

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.560
 I don't.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.400
 I've never noticed a plane I'm on stopping at a petrol station ever.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.680
 Well, that's when you're in the airport.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.880
 That's what the petrol station is.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.560
 They come and fill you with petrol, right?

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.960
 Yeah, but so how do you refuel while it's flying?

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.960
 It's really weird.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.960
 You just get one aeroplane with loads of petrol in it and you fly it next to the aeroplane

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.360
 with not much petrol in it and then you attach them together.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.920
 So it's not my planes that I've been on that are getting refueled.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.200
 No, no, you're probably not.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.120
 Yeah, but if you've seen the movie Air Force One, they refuel the plane mid-flight.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.120
 Today.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.880
 Yeah, and Harrison Ford uses that as the big moment to sort of get to another plane.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.880
 I think I'm right.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.120
 You must not have a really long, you know, the toggles you put in because you know it's

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.880
 someone that's quite hard when you park your car on the wrong side of a petrol plane.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.880
 Yeah.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.880
 And you have to stretch it all the way around.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.880
 Yeah.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.880
 Yeah.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.760
 If you fly on the wrong side of the aeroplane, that's going to be really awkward here.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.760
 Okay.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.280
 On this, on this mid-air thing, it is insane.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:57.320
 So there was a flying boat, okay, in the 1930s called the short empire, right?

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.520
 And the problem was they couldn't get enough fuel into it for it to make it all the way across

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.680
 the Atlantic, okay?

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.680
 Okay.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680
 So that's the problem.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:10.120
 But it could be loaded with more fuel than it could take off with.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.880
 So it can only get into the air if it has under a certain amount of fuel on it.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.880
 But once you get it into the air, you can load it with extra fuel.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.880
 Yeah.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:26.080
 The idea was this plane took off towards the USA from Britain with not enough fuel to get

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.080
 there.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.080
 Yeah.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.080
 And then while it was over island, it would be refueled by another plane, as it went.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.840
 It would take off without enough fuel to get to where it was meant to go.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.800
 And it had to refuel with 800 extra gallons of fuel.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.800
 Yeah.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.800
 That's extraordinary.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:48.680
 We do have planes now that can carry other, well, flying machines.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.520
 There's a plane called White Knight II.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.080
 And this is the, so it's not operational yet, but it will be within a few years, I think.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.760
 It looks like a catamaran, really.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.480
 So it, or it looks kind of like two planes, a simultaneous twins, and one of their wings

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.480
 is fused.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.480
 Yes.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480
 It's an incredible looking thing.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:09.000
 But it's actually built to be able to take off like two planes stuck together.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.680
 And then hanging underneath this shed wing will be the Virgin rocket, which will then take

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.680
 tourists into space.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.520
 So not only do you get to go to space if you pay for this, but you get the bonus of things

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.080
 suspended under a weird double-cyme plane catamaran thing.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.080
 It's extraordinary.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.040
 Have you ever seen footage of it when it drops the plane?

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.040
 Oh, no.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.040
 I haven't seen that.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.040
 So that's the thing.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:34.160
 Obviously, the rocket can't thrust its, or boost its thrusters while it's still attached

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.480
 to this other plane.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.920
 So it literally plummets and they have to turn on the engine as they're dropping a pump

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.920
 of fuel.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.440
 And then it kind of just finds its way.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.120
 So you're in sort of freefall for a while when you're inside this.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.120
 Is this in the rocket or in the plane?

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.120
 In the rocket?

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.120
 Wow.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.120
 Yeah, that's it.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.160
 God, imagine if people have bought tickets and they're listening to this now, having

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.160
 not realized.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.680
 Because that sounds terrifying.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.560
 I think you would have watched a YouTube video before pressing, and you catch us.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.560
 You're right.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.760
 You just mentioned two planes being stuck together is what this looks like.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.760
 Yeah.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:09.080
 One time, as far as I'm aware, that two planes have stuck together mid-flight, right?

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.400
 This was in 1940.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.640
 This was a training flight above Australia.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.280
 Two bomber planes crashed together, okay?

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.880
 Disaster, obviously, except that one of them basically jammed over the other one, and they

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.680
 just got stuck together in mid-air.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.320
 So the one on top had its wings and its controls still intact, and the one beneath had the engine

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.800
 working.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:36.600
 And the pilot of the plane on top managed to land successfully, but that's ridiculous.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:41.720
 That doesn't sound like it's made up by Dan Zitalion, Ryan Blessed Guy.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.720
 I know.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.720
 Nobody died.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.480
 One person jumped out and was hit by a propeller.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.480
 Even he was fine eventually.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.480
 He just covered.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:54.720
 But it's amazing that just so happens that the engine works for this one, and the steering

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.720
 works.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.760
 It's like, oh, the coffee machine works for this one, but luckily the sandwich maker works

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.760
 on the other one.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.520
 Do you think they had a chat between the planes going, "We're like Jack Spratt and his wife,

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.080
 aren't we?"

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.760
 Just on this thing that you were talking about carrying space shuttles, the largest plane

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:18.600
 that's ever been made, which was the Anatov AN225 Maria, which was made in Ukraine in

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.440
 Soviet times.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:26.320
 This has the record for the biggest payload ever taken, and they carried shuttles from

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.640
 one part of Russia to the other, the Soviet Union to the other.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:35.440
 That was the main job of them, and one time they carried a generator for a gas power plant

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:41.920
 in Armenia, which weighed 247,000 kilograms, which is the weight of 80 elephants.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.640
 That's the largest payload of any aeroplane ever.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.240
 That is so amazing.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.240
 That's amazing.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.000
 And then it went into commercial service in the early 2000s.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 And by the way, do you have extra luggage because it doesn't matter?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.120
 Emotional support elephant with me.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.360
 When I say commercial, I don't mean you can buy a flight on it.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.920
 It was used for companies, and actually at one stage, the American military took it and

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:16.960
 took 216,000 ready meals to military personnel in Oman.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.960
 Wow.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.960
 So that's cool.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.240
 It was out of chicken or fish, but it's fine.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:28.680
 It was transported on 375 pallets weighing 187.5 tons of ready meals.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.680
 Oh man.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.480
 Do you know why nuclear planes have never been tried?

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.480
 Because they sound dangerous.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.000
 They do sound dangerous.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.320
 They are dangerous.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.360
 So people have kept trying all the way through, kind of like the thing you were mentioning

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.360
 James of Parasite.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.360
 Parasite ones.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.360
 Yeah, the Parasite planes.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.360
 Yeah.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.000
 So I think the USA have tried, I'm sure the Soviet Union tried as well.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.680
 Basically, they could not work out how to deal with radiation and to keep the planes light.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.720
 Because obviously, to protect against radiation, you need a very heavy thick armor stuff.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.880
 So one thing they considered doing, this was in the 50s in the USA, was just hiring pilots

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:06.840
 who were so elderly that they would certainly die before any effects of radiation got through

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.840
 to them.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.840
 Wow.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.840
 That was the plan.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.840
 What a move.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.840
 That's crazy.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.160
 JFK cancelled that plan.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160
 Yeah.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.160
 Yeah.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:20.800
 I've found a few sort of, as we were saying earlier, those that military period of plane

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.680
 innovation, which is extraordinary decisions they had to make.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.600
 So when the Navy was out and they needed planes that were on their ships, in the early days,

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.600
 they didn't have landing strips that were long enough.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.680
 So they could launch with some help, but they couldn't get back because it was too short.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.600
 So what they did was they started toying with ideas like building a plane, which this

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.480
 was prototype called the Blackburn Blackbird.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.320
 And the idea was that you could take off, but you weren't meant to return.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.800
 The plane was designed to be ditched in the ocean by the ship.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.600
 But luckily all the pilots were so old that they were expected to die before they got

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.600
 to them.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.600
 Wait, sorry.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.600
 These were single-use planes.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.600
 No.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.400
 If you were successful, you came back and you ditched the plane as close to the ship as possible,

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.480
 and hopefully the ship got to you before both you and the plane sank.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.920
 If it did, they would lift the plane back onto the ship and then they would rebuild it

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.920
 and you could reuse it.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.920
 What?

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.920
 Well, they had no choice because it was...

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.920
 No, I'm sorry, I'm confused.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.920
 When you say ditched a plane, do you mean fly it into the sea?

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.920
 Yeah, fly into the ocean.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.240
 So the pilot would be waiting with the plane while it's sinking.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:26.360
 Another thing they tried to solve that was something called the Flying Pancake, which the Flying

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:32.400
 Pancake either had no wings, one wing, or an infinite number of wings, depending on how

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.400
 you're looking at it.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.400
 It's a whole wing.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:39.560
 It's a pancake shape, so it's flat, and it's kind of tilted, and it's got massive

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:45.600
 propellers on it, and so if you were sailing into a headwind, then the wind can help you

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.800
 just take off by using the shape of your flying pancake.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.840
 And if you weren't going into a headwind, it had these massive propellers that you could

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:58.320
 create your own headwind, and so it could blow air over your aerophile and help you take

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.320
 off that way.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.320
 That sounds amazing.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.320
 Yeah.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.320
 And it looked kind of like a flying saucer, right?

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.320
 They do, yeah, yeah.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.280
 Don't like the idea of flying something called a pancake, because I imagine pancakes flipping

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.560
 at 180 degrees in the air.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.080
 And the reason we don't use them now is basically because jet engines came in, so we didn't need

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.080
 them anymore.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.080
 Once you had jet engines, you could get to a really high speed really quickly.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.120
 So it did work, fine.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.120
 Yeah, work.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:26.400
 Oh god, we've got to talk about the inflator plane quickly, just very quickly.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.160
 This was a sort of foldable collapsible plane that was commissioned by Good Year, of course,

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.680
 in the 1950s, and it could deflate and be transported in like a three and a half foot

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.640
 container, a little container.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.280
 And it was actually a brilliant idea.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.240
 So it was built in just 12 weeks, which doesn't have a worry any short time in which to build

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.200
 an entire plane, designed and built.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.840
 But Good Year, the idea was that a single person would be able to hand pump it, and so you

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:55.200
 could drop it behind enemy lines, so you'd drop it from your plane, behind enemy lines where

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.880
 your men were captured, and they'd have that little hand pump on the ground, I suppose,

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.720
 waiting for this moment, and they'd pump it up until it got big enough, and then they

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.720
 could take off.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:08.040
 So it would have like a little tube in case your pump wasn't working so you could blow it

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.040
 by mouth.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.040
 I think it must have.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:20.320
 Anyway, look, it had a test flight in 1957, and it sort of went into a spiral, and one of

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.640
 the wings got floppy and folded on top of it, and got chopped off by the propeller.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.640
 Oh, I know.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.560
 So it never really, it really never took off.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:35.000
 I'll tell you what, with that of your paper company, Folding, it's been a bad day, it's been

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.680
 a bad day for puns all the way.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.920
 Okay, it is time for our final factor, the show, and that is my fact.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:50.040
 My fact is that this year a sperm bank lost a court case to a man named Dick Weiner.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:55.680
 So this has happened in Oregon, in America, and the jury, who is dealing with the case,

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.720
 afforded $400,000 American dollars to two Oregon dog breeders, because the international

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.000
 canine semen bank accidentally destroyed both of their Labrador sperms.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.920
 Why did you not tell us the name of the other breeder?

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:14.200
 Yeah, because Fanny vagina is not as interesting to be fair.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.680
 So this is from Oregon Live, which is a big newspaper in Oregon.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:23.760
 But in every other report I've seen, it's Richard Weiner, and only just discovered that

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.320
 before we came upstairs to record this, so, but he's still, it's still, you know, parents

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.320
 should have known.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.320
 His name's Dick Weiner.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.320
 His name's Dick Weiner, exactly.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.920
 So, yeah, this is amazing.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.920
 Yeah.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.120
 I didn't know there was an international canine semen bank.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.120
 Did you not?

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.120
 No, I did.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.120
 I did.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.120
 I did.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.120
 I did.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.120
 I did.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.120
 I did.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:44.120
 I did.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.120
 I did.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.120
 I did.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:46.120
 I did.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.120
 I did.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.120
 I did.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.120
 I did.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.120
 I did.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.120
 I did.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.120
 I did.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.120
 I just keep all of mine in Bargley's.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.120
 I think bigger.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:58.520
 So it used to exist mainly for professional dog breeders, so that if you had, you know, a top

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:03.120
 dog, then you could pass on their genes for generations, but now it seems to be just sentimental

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:08.120
 dog owners who want an exact copy of their beloved pet before, you know, after they've

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.120
 died.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.920
 It's probably not people who don't know how genetics works, basically.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.920
 Yeah.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.320
 It's, you know, you will get a quarter of the dog you had.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.320
 Well, it's better than nothing, isn't it, Andy?

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.320
 Okay.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:24.240
 I should say, this mistake with the dog seeming that Dick Weiner found this happened 20 years

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.240
 ago.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.240
 Yeah.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.240
 This story goes all the way back.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.240
 Wow.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.240
 I know.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.240
 Well, no, no.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.440
 It's, it's, they, they knew that they stuffed up 20 years ago.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.440
 Exactly.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.000
 Dick Weiner only found out a few years ago, because of ex-employee told him randomly, as I

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 probably don't know.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Yeah.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 He was a whistle bar.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Yeah.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 So that he deposited the sperm in the 90s, I think.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 Yeah.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.200
 And then in the, maybe late 90s, early 90s, it was accidentally thawed out, making it worthless.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:50.720
 And 20, nearly 20 years later, it disgruntled ex-employee must have told him.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:55.460
 Unfortunately, this guy who thawed out the sperm had done the same thing 18 months earlier,

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.460
 hadn't he?

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.460
 [laughter]

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:01.680
 For 500,000 liters was flushed away.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.680
 [laughter]

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.680
 Okay.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:11.800
 Well, I looked up their costs, the International Seaman Bank, K9 Seaman Bank, very important.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:17.560
 For, to store your dog Seaman for a year, it's $324 to deposit and store it for a year.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:24.600
 But then every year after that, it's $79 a year, which is, I think, what Amazon Prime used

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.600
 to cost.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600
 [laughter]

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.120
 That's a very different service, isn't it?

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.120
 [laughter]

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.280
 You've got to weigh it up when you're making your budget choices, yeah?

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.280
 [laughter]

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.560
 But, and you, another thing you can do with this, these banks, and this is not, we should

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.680
 say, other dog Seaman banks are available, when, you know.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.700
 But another thing you can do, I think, is ship your dog's testicles to them after your dog

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:44.700
 has been neutered.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.700
 You have to, you can't, yeah?

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.700
 What?

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.500
 Snipp 'em off, and ship 'em off, and ship 'em off, and ship 'em off.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.500
 [laughter]

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.300
 That's what you do.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.300
 Wow.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.240
 You can get instructions for how to do it yourself, I think.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.160
 So most people can do it at a vet and say, "Would you mind sending these balls to the

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.160
 bank?"

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:05.520
 But, um, some banks do give, some banks do give instructions on how to package up your

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.680
 testicles, and you have to send them off ASAP.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.080
 Like, within a two or three hours, yeah.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.200
 You must have to send them in a special, cool, cool box.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.200
 Yeah, I think you must do, yeah.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.200
 You've got it all to the package, ain't it?

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:23.160
 I just walk into the, into the Royal Mail, in a pair of, I don't know, dogmackers, and

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.160
 by an envelope, can you?

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.300
 No, and what if you do, you've got to go first class, 'cause it really is time for the

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.300
 rest of us.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.300
 [laughter]

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.880
 Do you know, um, who did the first ever artificial insemination of a dog?

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:40.080
 No, it was none of the digby clans.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:46.360
 It was an Italian physiologist called Lazaro Spalanzini, and we probably, do you guys have

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.360
 heard of him?

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.360
 I've heard of him.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.360
 What was his thing?

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.360
 Frogs and pants?

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.360
 Frogs and pants?

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.360
 Exactly.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.560
 Abonanas and pajamas, was the sequel, isn't it?

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:02.200
 He is most famous among QI research, at least, for putting male frogs in form-fitting rubber

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:10.040
 pants, to prove that, that they couldn't fertilize eggs if they couldn't get what was in the genitals

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.040
 out over the eggs.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.040
 Right.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.040
 If you know what I mean, yeah, yeah.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.280
 So he basically proved how reproduction worked.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:20.480
 He also was the first person to note the effect of cooling on human sperm.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:25.000
 So you know how they say that you should wear, at least, warm-ish underpants if you want

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 to conceive babies.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 Is that right, Dan?

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 Yeah, you, well, not too tight, but you need to keep it.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 Who's flowing?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.680
 No, Lucy's not as good for you.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.760
 They need to be kept reasonably warm.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.760
 Yes.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.280
 And you don't put your testicles on ice, basically.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.280
 Okay.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.280
 You don't need your underpants.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.560
 So it's a very odd sort of warm, not hot.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.840
 You need to keep it at the right temperature, but he was the first person to notice that.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:53.840
 And he noted that if you put sperm on snow, they would stop swimming around.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.840
 Wow.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.840
 Wow.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:59.160
 So he would have, he would have had microscopy, technology, I guess.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.280
 This was after what's his name, yeah, Liv and Hook.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.920
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.920
 Gosh.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.320
 That was really very cool.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.320
 Yeah.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.320
 It was a cool guy.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320
 Cool guy.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.320
 I got ski.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.320
 That was fun.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.320
 That was ski.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.320
 They just don't get a public school.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:21.560
 And the first person to make puppies from frozen dog semen was a guy called Steven W.J.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.560
 Siga.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.040
 He's still alive, actually.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:27.720
 He's a veterinarian from Ireland who moved to Oregon.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:35.840
 And this was in 1969 and they made some baby Labrador's and they called them popsicles because

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.920
 they came from frozen semen.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.920
 Very cool.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.880
 Do you say popsicles?

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.040
 Well, that would have been good, wouldn't it?

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.640
 The article I read says popsicles, but popsicles would have been way better.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.640
 Yeah.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.640
 So maybe that's not a correct thing.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.000
 Guys, have you ever seen fish being artificially insuminated?

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 No.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Oh, my gosh.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 It's incredible.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.680
 I can't emphasize enough how much you have to watch this video.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:03.400
 But basically, on a lot of fish farms, it's more efficient, or if you really want to control

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:07.120
 how many fish are being insuminated, then you do it artificially.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.320
 And the way they do it, I actually learned this in an interview with a guy called Mike Freeze,

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:16.920
 which seems kind of almost suitable, who is a fish farmer in the US.

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:22.680
 And then I was led to this video of coy fish breeding, so coy car, very expensive.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.200
 And they are being bred at Kentucky State University.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.200
 Look it up, basically.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:31.360
 You get the female out of the water, and she's alive and gets laying down in some paper towel

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:37.440
 for some reason, and then just lifted up and massaged from top to bottom, and you squeeze

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.440
 the eggs out.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:44.560
 And what the eggs are, is this thick, brownie green slime that just spouts out, it's incredible.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:49.040
 It's like sludge coming out, so they put that in a bowl, pop her back in the water, get

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040
 the ladder out.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.200
 Do exactly the same with him, and it's a little bit less.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.200
 But you squeeze it out.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.920
 Like, maybe it looks like mayonnaise coming out of mayonnaise thing.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:00.000
 And then you just stir it up together, like you're making a cake, and they mix it together,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.840
 and then you leave that for three to five minutes, and pop it back in the water.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.360
 It sounds like a recipe, isn't it?

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.360
 A recipe for fish.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.360
 Mark, sorry.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:14.280
 It's very apart stewed, this with coy car, because they're very shy, aren't they?

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:18.560
 I have something about Crofts, because it's about champion dogs.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.560
 Yes.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.840
 Only one dog has ever pooed live in the middle of a crush's event.

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.840
 Did he win?

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.840
 Or did he win?

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.840
 Instant disqualification.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.840
 No.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.840
 It's, the video is on YouTube.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.840
 We did a lot of YouTube recommendations today.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.120
 YouTube's going to be getting some real hits after this podcast.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.120
 It's incredible.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.120
 It's 2012.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.120
 This is the only one I've found.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.120
 We should say, sorry, quickly, we should say for international listeners, Crofts, is

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.120
 the biggest dog show in the world.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.120
 Sorry, yeah.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.120
 I don't think he's as well known outside of this country, but it's the massive dog show.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.120
 In UK, it's all we talk about.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.120
 But, yeah, sorry.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:52.720
 Crofts, biggest dog show in the world, and it was in 2012, and the video is online of

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.960
 the full attempt, because, you know, they have to do the full course, and they do the

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.320
 slalom, and they do the seasore, and they do the jumping over things.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.880
 Anyway, the reaction of the crowd is so funny, because it's an amazing run.

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.880
 It's going so well.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.800
 And then the dog just absolutely stops dead and squats down, and the whole crowd goes,

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.800
 "Oh!"

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.800
 That's amazing.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:17.000
 And he only gets handed a plastic bag by a crossbow boy.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 Oh, no!

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.360
 It's very much the Paul the Radcliffe of the dog breeding world.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.360
 It's a really funny video.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.720
 Why do they have such mad names in Crofts?

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.720
 It's bizarre.

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:33.240
 Because you have to have, your dog name has to be involved the name of the breeder somewhere,

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.040
 but I was looking at the best in shows, and the list.

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:41.440
 So the most recent was called "Planet Waves for Ever Young Daydream Believers".

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.840
 I think last year or the year before, it was McVan's "Torussia with Love".

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:49.080
 There's also Afterglow Maverick Saber, Iraqi Fabulous Willy.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.080
 They're crazy.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:56.480
 They're crazy, Dalga, a good spice, and I can't find any good reason why, except that you're

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.480
 not supposed to have replicated names.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:03.080
 But they can't have run out of words so much that all you could use is in "Raki Fabulous

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.080
 Willy".

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:13.280
 That's a wish list on a dating profile, isn't it?

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:16.440
 That's it, that's all of our facts, thank you so much for listening.
