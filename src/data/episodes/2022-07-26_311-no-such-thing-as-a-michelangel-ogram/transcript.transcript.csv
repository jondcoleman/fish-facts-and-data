00:00:00,00:00:10,[ I can't wait to get back to the recording ]
00:00:10,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:22,to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:23,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin, and once again"
00:00:28,00:00:32,we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven
00:00:32,00:00:36,"days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"Starting with you, James."
00:00:38,00:00:42,"Okay, my fact this week is that when the world's largest bottle of wine sprung a leak this"
00:00:42,00:00:48,"year, the owner called the local fire department who stopped the spillage with sandbags."
00:00:48,00:00:51,"Wow, how big are we talking?"
00:00:51,00:00:53,We're talking big.
00:00:53,00:01:02,"It was 9.8 feet tall, 2.6 tonnes in weight, and 1,590 litres, which is about the equivalent"
00:01:02,00:01:05,"of 2,000 bottles of wine."
00:01:05,00:01:10,"If we lived in a truly circular recycling economy, then they would have gone, solved the"
00:01:10,00:01:14,"wine problem, retained the wine and used it to put out their next fire."
00:01:14,00:01:18,"Well, they could have done that, apart from the wine is still drinkable."
00:01:18,00:01:19,Believe it or not.
00:01:19,00:01:21,Not the stuff they squeegeed off the floor.
00:01:21,00:01:25,"Well, it depends on your standards, right?"
00:01:25,00:01:26,That's true.
00:01:26,00:01:30,"So, they took this bottle of wine and they got all the stuff off the floor, and then they"
00:01:30,00:01:35,"took the wine from the bottle and put it into barrels, and they've checked it, they took"
00:01:35,00:01:40,"it to a winery to test, and it's been deemed fit for consumption, and they're going to sell"
00:01:40,00:01:42,it by the glass at an upcoming event.
00:01:42,00:01:43,Cool.
00:01:43,00:01:45,"That's going to take some ages, isn't it?"
00:01:45,00:01:47,"So, why did they build it in the first place?"
00:01:47,00:01:51,"Well, they build it because people like building large things."
00:01:51,00:01:53,"It was just like a publicity stunt, I suppose."
00:01:53,00:01:59,"It was sold to a Chinese restaurant in Austria, and they had it on display."
00:01:59,00:02:04,"It was in a giant climate controlled glass chamber, really cool, so it was like a big fridge,"
00:02:04,00:02:06,and they think that's where the problem came from.
00:02:06,00:02:12,"They think the electricity went off, and so when it was not as heated, then wine expands,"
00:02:12,00:02:16,"or liquids expand in a bottle when the temperatures are changed, and they think that's what led"
00:02:16,00:02:17,to the leaking.
00:02:17,00:02:18,Was it got cooler in it?
00:02:18,00:02:23,"No, it got warmer, so it was in the fridge, and it got warmer, so it expanded, and it pushed"
00:02:23,00:02:27,"the cork up, and left a little bit of a gap where the wine could come out."
00:02:27,00:02:28,Yeah.
00:02:28,00:02:31,"And I guess they brought the fire department, because they were a bit scared about what was"
00:02:31,00:02:32,going to happen.
00:02:32,00:02:34,They couldn't tell where it was leaking from to begin with.
00:02:34,00:02:37,"Well, it's a big lot of glass, and they were worried it might explode."
00:02:37,00:02:42,"Exactly, so it could have just shattered onto them, and that's a lot of less than a restaurant."
00:02:42,00:02:48,"If you order a glass of wine out of this bottle, they have a sort of bodybuilder who has to"
00:02:48,00:02:49,come and pour it.
00:02:49,00:02:51,How does that work?
00:02:51,00:02:52,Yeah.
00:02:52,00:02:55,I think the idea was that the wine in the big bottle was probably never supposed to be
00:02:55,00:02:56,drunk.
00:02:56,00:02:58,It was just a display thing.
00:02:58,00:03:01,"But then once it started leaking out, they were like, ""Oh, I'm going to have to drink it"
00:03:01,00:03:02,"now."""
00:03:02,00:03:07,"It's like, you know, when you have a bottle of wine in your fridge, and suddenly the electricity"
00:03:07,00:03:10,"goes off, and you're like, ""Well, I'm going to have to drink all the wine in the fridge"
00:03:10,00:03:11,now.
00:03:11,00:03:12,"That's a thing, James."""
00:03:12,00:03:13,I don't think so.
00:03:13,00:03:18,I've had a lot of electricity problems in my house recently.
00:03:18,00:03:19,"So, yeah."
00:03:19,00:03:21,So you were mentioning another rival bottle of wine.
00:03:21,00:03:24,"Okay, yeah, I forgot about that."
00:03:24,00:03:29,"This has the Guinness World Record for being the largest filled glass wine bottle, but when"
00:03:29,00:03:33,"I was doing the research for this fact, I found another one in Switzerland that was wavy."
00:03:33,00:03:35,"Like, way, way bigger."
00:03:35,00:03:39,"And so I can only think there's some technicality that it's not made of glass, because I couldn't"
00:03:39,00:03:42,"quite tell from the images, or maybe it wasn't full of wine."
00:03:42,00:03:43,"Right, right, right."
00:03:43,00:03:44,I couldn't really tell.
00:03:44,00:03:50,"So these giant bottles of wine, they are a thing, but I didn't know that most of the wine"
00:03:50,00:03:55,"on earth is transported in giant bottles, or a huge amount of it, yeah."
00:03:55,00:03:59,"So I, okay, I didn't know this, and then I told a few people who are a generation older"
00:03:59,00:04:00,"than me, and they all knew it."
00:04:00,00:04:02,So maybe this is a generational thing.
00:04:02,00:04:06,"But loads of wine, when it's shipped, it's not shipped in bottles, it's shipped in bulk"
00:04:06,00:04:07,tankers.
00:04:07,00:04:08,Did you guys know this?
00:04:08,00:04:11,Do you mean like a petrol tanker?
00:04:11,00:04:12,Kind of.
00:04:12,00:04:13,"Yeah, really."
00:04:13,00:04:14,Like in a shipping container.
00:04:14,00:04:17,"But obviously a special container, they don't just pour it into a shipping container and"
00:04:17,00:04:19,then see it up.
00:04:19,00:04:24,"But basically, a 45% of the wine imported into the UK arrives not in a bottle."
00:04:24,00:04:26,It arrives in these massive containers.
00:04:26,00:04:27,"The crappier wine, right?"
00:04:27,00:04:30,"Because I think if you're getting the really hardcore good Sather France stuff, then it's"
00:04:30,00:04:31,bottled in the place.
00:04:31,00:04:32,"It's quite a lot, though."
00:04:32,00:04:37,"I mean, they bottle so much here, and they have labels, which are from, you know, overseas"
00:04:37,00:04:39,"wines, just here that they put on."
00:04:39,00:04:44,"So there's a place in South Helsingland called Avenmouth, and Avenmouth, near the Muth of"
00:04:44,00:04:47,"the River Aven, Aven Muth."
00:04:47,00:04:48,"Okay, anyway."
00:04:48,00:04:49,They've got...
00:04:49,00:04:55,"They have a hangar there, which is the size of 12 football pitches, and it's owned by a firm"
00:04:55,00:05:02,"who are a specialist bottleer, and they fill up 720,000 bottles of wine there alone every"
00:05:02,00:05:03,day.
00:05:03,00:05:08,"They believe that, and the wine arrives in these massive plastic bladders, basically, they're"
00:05:08,00:05:10,"called flexitanks, right?"
00:05:10,00:05:14,"And then they have a special pump and tilt system, they call it, to get the last 150 litres"
00:05:14,00:05:17,out of each bladder.
00:05:17,00:05:19,Is that when you're sort of shaking to get the jugs out?
00:05:19,00:05:20,Basically.
00:05:20,00:05:22,And do you have to get it directly into the bottles?
00:05:22,00:05:23,That must be quite difficult.
00:05:23,00:05:25,Do you submerge the bottles and get into the bottles?
00:05:25,00:05:26,I don't know.
00:05:26,00:05:27,How do you do it?
00:05:27,00:05:28,I don't know.
00:05:28,00:05:35,"It must be a tap, it's probably a tap, it's probably a tap test, I don't know."
00:05:35,00:05:40,"But these bags are then soaked with wine, because they're obviously, you know, liquid proof"
00:05:40,00:05:44,"on the outside, but on the inside, they're completely soaked with wine, but those bags"
00:05:44,00:05:47,are then shredded and turned into traffic cones.
00:05:47,00:05:48,No way.
00:05:48,00:05:51,And that's why traffic cones are like R&G red and colour.
00:05:51,00:05:52,Exactly.
00:05:52,00:05:53,Not like that.
00:05:53,00:05:54,"No, not maybe not."
00:05:54,00:05:59,"It is maybe why drunk people are drawn to traffic cones, because they didn't know at some level."
00:05:59,00:06:00,It's another hit.
00:06:00,00:06:01,That's amazing.
00:06:01,00:06:02,That's really cool.
00:06:02,00:06:03,"Yeah, that's very cool."
00:06:03,00:06:08,"That's like the kind of inheritor of butlers, because butlers are originally bottleers,"
00:06:08,00:06:09,right?
00:06:09,00:06:10,"That's, I didn't know that was where that comes from."
00:06:10,00:06:11,"Oh, it's a bottleier."
00:06:11,00:06:16,"It was the King's bottleer who would bottle up all his wine, and I suppose they're your"
00:06:16,00:06:19,"modern-day butlers, an even myth."
00:06:19,00:06:26,"You know that from 1636 to 1860, it was illegal to sell wine by the bottle in the UK."
00:06:26,00:06:31,"You would go to the shop and you'd have your own bottle with your initials on it, and they"
00:06:31,00:06:36,would fill it up and they'd work out how much you'd bought and by volume and you'd pay
00:06:36,00:06:37,by volume.
00:06:37,00:06:43,"And the reason was wine bottle making was kind of quite common in the 17th century, but"
00:06:43,00:06:47,not until the 19th century could you make it so they were all the same size.
00:06:47,00:06:52,"So duplicitous shopkeepers might kind of sell you a bottle, which is a lot smaller than"
00:06:52,00:06:55,"the normal bottles, so that's why they made it illegal."
00:06:55,00:07:00,That's going to be hard to hide your alcohol problem when you rock up with 10 bottles.
00:07:00,00:07:01,"Another big party, Mr. Schreiber?"
00:07:01,00:07:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:02,00:07:06,"Isn't that just the same as leaving the shop, I mean at least it was 10 bottles, which"
00:07:06,00:07:07,is what we do today.
00:07:07,00:07:08,Exactly.
00:07:08,00:07:12,How do you hide your alcohol problem normally if you're leaving the supermarket with 10
00:07:12,00:07:13,bottles of wine every day?
00:07:13,00:07:17,I've got it mustache.
00:07:17,00:07:20,"You've got a full facial beard, how is it mustache going to happen?"
00:07:20,00:07:21,I know.
00:07:21,00:07:22,It's so distracting.
00:07:22,00:07:23,"They're like, whoa, that guy's weird."
00:07:23,00:07:24,Let's not question his story.
00:07:24,00:07:29,"I'm kind of annoyed with wine bottles, though, having done the research for this fact."
00:07:29,00:07:30,Go on.
00:07:30,00:07:31,Nice of them.
00:07:31,00:07:32,"Well, they're so inefficient."
00:07:32,00:07:33,They're so heavy.
00:07:33,00:07:34,Yeah.
00:07:34,00:07:39,"Most of them are made from green glass, which is quite hard to recycle, and also we import"
00:07:39,00:07:42,"so much and bottle so much here that actually even if you recycle it, it's quite hard to find"
00:07:42,00:07:43,uses for all of it.
00:07:43,00:07:47,"Well, you can get, or you could get paper wine bottles, which are an answer to this, cause-"
00:07:47,00:07:48,I read about those.
00:07:48,00:07:52,"Yeah, but it's kind of sad because it was in 2014, wasn't it, that they start, they've sort"
00:07:52,00:07:57,"of went global with them, this company, and they're made from compressed recycled paper,"
00:07:57,00:08:02,"and so they're incredibly light, and they, so they weighed 65 grams, which is a seventh"
00:08:02,00:08:05,"of a wine bottle, of a wine bottle's empty, and then they had the little sort of bagging"
00:08:05,00:08:11,"inside, you get inside box wine, and really quickly the company unfolded."
00:08:11,00:08:13,Very clever.
00:08:13,00:08:14,So that was a real shame.
00:08:14,00:08:16,"Was that intentional though, that when you said folded?"
00:08:16,00:08:21,"It was, but I stole it, so, yeah, but it did the company fold it."
00:08:21,00:08:26,"Okay, you could have said crumbles, like that common phrase, the company crumbles."
00:08:26,00:08:30,"That's the way the company crumbles, as they all say."
00:08:30,00:08:34,Do you know who is known as the father of the modern bottle?
00:08:34,00:08:35,Ooh.
00:08:35,00:08:37,Is it someone famous who we will have heard of?
00:08:37,00:08:38,It's someone not famous who you will have heard of.
00:08:38,00:08:39,"Oh, who we will."
00:08:39,00:08:43,Is it someone who's around around Guy Fork's area?
00:08:43,00:08:45,"Quite close to Guy Fork's, one generation away from Guy Fork's area."
00:08:45,00:08:47,Is it everyone dig me?
00:08:47,00:08:48,It's not.
00:08:48,00:08:50,But it's someone I was confused with him.
00:08:50,00:08:51,It's Kennell.
00:08:51,00:08:52,Kennell's son.
00:08:52,00:08:53,Kennell's son.
00:08:53,00:08:54,Kennell's dig me.
00:08:54,00:08:55,Wow.
00:08:55,00:08:56,They're back.
00:08:56,00:08:57,The dig me is a back.
00:08:57,00:08:58,For anyone just listening.
00:08:58,00:08:59,This is a four-year callback.
00:08:59,00:09:03,I really have to put the hours in to be having a good time now.
00:09:03,00:09:09,"Okay, so, ever had dig me, who was the gunpowder plotter, his son was a Kennell"
00:09:09,00:09:16,dig bee and he kind of came up with ways of making really good glass because he was an alchemist
00:09:16,00:09:17,and he was like taking stuff.
00:09:17,00:09:21,Really feel like you're going to say alcoholic.
00:09:21,00:09:25,"And he was like adding metals and oxides to his son and making it really, really hard to"
00:09:25,00:09:30,make in really good glass and he could make darker glass as well which would make the wine
00:09:30,00:09:31,not spoil as quickly.
00:09:31,00:09:32,Yeah.
00:09:32,00:09:36,"So that's a high achieving family, the dig bees, weren't they?"
00:09:36,00:09:39,"I've found a story about, so this fact is about wine leaking out."
00:09:39,00:09:42,I'm losing precious wine.
00:09:42,00:09:43,I found a story similar to this.
00:09:43,00:09:47,"In Canada, there's a company called Mission Hill, they make wine."
00:09:47,00:09:51,"And they had an employee called Brent Crosio and he was a sellummon, so he worked inside"
00:09:51,00:09:57,the factory and for years his job was blending wines and he was transferring them between tanks.
00:09:57,00:10:01,He accidentally left a valve open when he wasn't meant to.
00:10:01,00:10:08,"As a result, 5,680 liters of subion blanc spilled to the ground and went down a drain."
00:10:08,00:10:12,"So it cost them $162,500."
00:10:12,00:10:17,"He was fired, obviously, for losing that amount, but it's not the first time he did it."
00:10:17,00:10:24,"So back 18 months earlier, he left a valve open and he flushed 11,000 liters of wine down"
00:10:24,00:10:26,a drain and they gave him a second chance.
00:10:26,00:10:31,But it does sound to me like there's someone in that drain with a massive bladder.
00:10:31,00:10:33,"It's like an accomplice, doesn't it?"
00:10:33,00:10:35,"You're right, it's a con job, yeah."
00:10:35,00:10:36,Did you guys see the story?
00:10:36,00:10:41,"Remember the story last year that Tweet that was put out by Hawkesmore restaurant in Manchester,"
00:10:41,00:10:46,"which was to the customer who accidentally got given a bottle of chateau, a pound pommel"
00:10:46,00:10:53,"roll, 2001, which is £4,500 on our menu last night, hope you enjoy your evening."
00:10:53,00:10:56,"To the member of staff who accidentally gave it away, chin up, one of mistakes happened,"
00:10:56,00:10:57,we love you anyway.
00:10:57,00:10:58,Wow.
00:10:58,00:10:59,Okay.
00:10:59,00:11:00,What a good employer.
00:11:00,00:11:01,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:11:01,00:11:02,"Has that happened again since, though?"
00:11:02,00:11:03,He's been fired.
00:11:03,00:11:07,"Yeah, I remember basically how that must have been."
00:11:07,00:11:12,"But the thing is, a lot of enjoying wine they've shown is if you know it's more expensive,"
00:11:12,00:11:13,"you like it more, right?"
00:11:13,00:11:18,"And if you're thinking you're buying the 399 bottle of wine on the Hawkesmore menu, which"
00:11:18,00:11:21,"I don't know if they go down that low, but if you think you're buying the cheap one,"
00:11:21,00:11:22,you get the expensive one.
00:11:22,00:11:23,You might not enjoy it as much.
00:11:23,00:11:28,"No, they probably would have, I mean, no one can be good enough to surely be, to be,"
00:11:28,00:11:31,"I can't differentiate anything above about eight or ten quid, basically."
00:11:31,00:11:32,Okay.
00:11:32,00:11:33,"But have you ever tasted the 4,500?"
00:11:33,00:11:35,Do you never know that might be such a explosion?
00:11:35,00:11:39,"Yeah, I have one every other week, and I can't taste the difference."
00:11:39,00:11:40,Line testing.
00:11:40,00:11:45,"This massive bottle of wine that I talked about at the start, you could, if you had drank"
00:11:45,00:11:50,"one bottle of wine to yourself every day since we started this podcast six years ago,"
00:11:50,00:11:53,"also, you'd just be draining the bottom of the bottle now."
00:11:53,00:11:58,"That's a great cup of wine, and you would, you would need it after listening to this"
00:11:58,00:12:02,six years.
00:12:02,00:12:06,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:12:06,00:12:11,"My fact this week is that when Michelangelo sculpted David, the town mayor told him that"
00:12:11,00:12:16,"the nose was too big, so Michelangelo picked up some dust, climbed to the top of the statue,"
00:12:16,00:12:20,"sprinkled the dust down, and claimed they had fixed it."
00:12:20,00:12:23,So was he making like sculpting noises while he was doing that?
00:12:23,00:12:24,"Yeah, he must have been, right?"
00:12:24,00:12:31,"He went even further, he went even more method, he did take up a hammer and chisel and stuff."
00:12:31,00:12:36,"So this is in 1504, and it was when David was just being displayed in Florence, it was revealed."
00:12:36,00:12:41,"And Pietro Sotarini was the town's sort of mayor chief, anyway, Sotarini said probably"
00:12:41,00:12:46,"displaying his artistic appreciation, you know, I think the nose is a bit outproportant"
00:12:46,00:12:48,"with the rest of the rest of the thing, isn't it?"
00:12:48,00:12:50,You want to go up and fix it.
00:12:50,00:12:53,"And Michelangelo, everyone was surprised at the time, because Michelangelo was very touchy"
00:12:53,00:12:56,and really just like criticism.
00:12:56,00:13:00,"And but he said, yeah, absolutely, I'm so sorry, absolutely right, it's enormous."
00:13:00,00:13:04,"And so he picked up a hammer and a chisel and secretly a handful of dust, climbed to the"
00:13:04,00:13:08,"top, pretended to chip away at it, and then Sotarini went, that's absolutely perfect."
00:13:08,00:13:11,"He nailed it, stopped there, came back down again."
00:13:11,00:13:13,This is like the wine tasting thing with the prices.
00:13:13,00:13:14,Absolutely.
00:13:14,00:13:16,If you've told something is better.
00:13:16,00:13:17,You believe it.
00:13:17,00:13:18,Do you believe it?
00:13:18,00:13:20,Do we know that this fact is completely true?
00:13:20,00:13:25,"Well, it comes from this amazing book, which is sort of the foundational book of all art"
00:13:25,00:13:30,"history, which is by George O. Vassari, and it's called The Lives of Most Excellent Painters,"
00:13:30,00:13:34,"Sculptors and Architects, and yeah, so he's sort of founded art history, and it's incredible"
00:13:34,00:13:40,"biographies of all the great artists up until them, or, you know, not all of them, but many"
00:13:40,00:13:43,"of them, many of the Florentine ones, especially."
00:13:43,00:13:46,"And so there are a lot of facts, and very, very true."
00:13:46,00:13:50,"And then we think he had an eye for drama and liked to embellish, so he was friends with"
00:13:50,00:13:51,Michelangelo and he was.
00:13:51,00:13:52,He was.
00:13:52,00:13:56,"But even this book, The Lives of the Artists, so the origin story of this book is that he"
00:13:56,00:13:57,was sitting at a dinner.
00:13:57,00:14:03,"This is in the 1500s at the Roman Palazzo with the Cardinal at the time, and the Cardinal"
00:14:03,00:14:07,"was talking about a collection of paintings along with the other people, and he kept"
00:14:07,00:14:10,"noticing they were getting dates wrong, and certain, they were attributing certain bits"
00:14:10,00:14:11,of art to different people.
00:14:11,00:14:15,"So he said that if someone was going to collect all this information together, they should"
00:14:15,00:14:18,"have someone who knows it really well, and they suggested that he do it."
00:14:18,00:14:20,So that was his sort of claim for it.
00:14:20,00:14:23,And the reality is that two of the people he claimed that we're at the dinner with him
00:14:23,00:14:29,"had died already, and they don't think he was even in Rome at the time when that dinner"
00:14:29,00:14:30,was said to have happened.
00:14:30,00:14:35,So he was someone who did have a bit of a sort of like bride-blessed or-
00:14:35,00:14:39,"Yeah, definitely the bride-blessed was day, maybe, because he also claimed that he rescued"
00:14:39,00:14:41,David at one point.
00:14:41,00:14:46,"So he was born, he was very young when David was sculpted, but in 1527 there were these"
00:14:46,00:14:51,"massive riots in Florence, and one of the rioters was anti-Madeuchi riots, and one of the rioters"
00:14:51,00:14:54,"threw a bench from a parapet, which knocked off David's arm."
00:14:54,00:14:55,Through a bench.
00:14:55,00:14:56,Yeah.
00:14:56,00:14:57,"Who was this, Goliath?"
00:14:57,00:15:05,"Yes, it was arm came off, and Vassari says that he was a boy at the time, he was about 16,"
00:15:05,00:15:09,"and he fought his way through these rioting, marauding crowds to rescue the various pieces"
00:15:09,00:15:10,of the arm.
00:15:10,00:15:11,It can't be true.
00:15:11,00:15:12,And take what's a safety.
00:15:12,00:15:15,"Actually, what they didn't say is that this was a miniature bench that are travelling"
00:15:15,00:15:17,salesmen had brought in.
00:15:17,00:15:18,"Wow, we're getting."
00:15:18,00:15:19,"Oh, I'm mega and cold."
00:15:19,00:15:20,I love mixed episode.
00:15:20,00:15:21,Cool back.
00:15:21,00:15:22,I love it.
00:15:22,00:15:23,He had a broken nose.
00:15:23,00:15:24,Michael Angelo?
00:15:24,00:15:25,Yeah.
00:15:25,00:15:26,"David, supposedly, did."
00:15:26,00:15:27,Yes.
00:15:27,00:15:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:28,00:15:30,Because he got into an argument with one of his friends or something.
00:15:30,00:15:31,Is that right?
00:15:31,00:15:34,His friend threw a bench at him.
00:15:34,00:15:42,"He was called Pietro Toregiano, and he was supposedly envious of Michelangelo's skills,"
00:15:42,00:15:44,"and then, but he also had a very bad temper."
00:15:44,00:15:50,"So smashed him in the face, and he said, ""I gave him such a blow on the nose that I felt"
00:15:50,00:15:55,"bone and cartilage go down like biscuits beneath my knuckles."""
00:15:55,00:16:00,"And this mark of mine, he will carry with him to the grave, but it basically screwed his"
00:16:00,00:16:04,"life because everyone loved Michael Angelo, because Michael Angelo was with the Medici's"
00:16:04,00:16:05,"at the time, wasn't he?"
00:16:05,00:16:09,So he had the protection of the people who ran everything.
00:16:09,00:16:12,And so Toregiano had to leave Florence.
00:16:12,00:16:17,"He went all the way to England, where possibly he was hired by Henry VIII, and then he started"
00:16:17,00:16:20,sculpting nobles in England.
00:16:20,00:16:25,"And then wanted to go back to Florence to try and get some help, some students and stuff,"
00:16:25,00:16:28,"but when he went back, no one would go with him because they remembered what he did to"
00:16:28,00:16:29,Michael Angelo.
00:16:29,00:16:30,Wow.
00:16:30,00:16:31,Wow.
00:16:31,00:16:32,Yeah.
00:16:32,00:16:35,This is why you should bully and pick on people who are inferior to or smaller or less
00:16:35,00:16:39,"handed than you are, because if you pick on people above you, then you will reap the"
00:16:39,00:16:40,"consequences, weren't you?"
00:16:40,00:16:41,"Yeah, absolutely right."
00:16:41,00:16:42,You're bullied league.
00:16:42,00:16:43,It's going pretty well.
00:16:43,00:16:44,It's going pretty well.
00:16:44,00:16:45,"Thanks, Andy."
00:16:45,00:16:48,"You're next, by the way."
00:16:48,00:16:53,"So I was looking for Michael Angelo, just what he looked like, and he's in the Sistine"
00:16:53,00:16:58,"Chapel as a self-portrait, we think, which is, but it's not him as a person, it's not him"
00:16:58,00:17:01,"looking healthy, it's him as a piece of flayed skin."
00:17:01,00:17:02,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:17:02,00:17:06,"So there's an image of the last judgment, there's one of the bits of the Sistine Chapel,"
00:17:06,00:17:10,"and there's Saint Bartholomew trying to get into heaven and kind of get God's attention,"
00:17:10,00:17:15,"so hey, I'm saying, let me in, and in one hand he's holding a knife, and in one hand he's"
00:17:15,00:17:20,"holding his own flayed skin, and it says he has got skin as well, so it's not clear when"
00:17:20,00:17:23,he grew this second skin.
00:17:23,00:17:27,"Well, you can't see him 360, presumably, so maybe it's off his back or something else."
00:17:27,00:17:28,"No, no, you can see it."
00:17:28,00:17:29,It's the face.
00:17:29,00:17:32,"He's got, what is it saying is he's got two faces, it's not completely accurate."
00:17:32,00:17:33,I see.
00:17:33,00:17:36,"Michael Angelo didn't paint a completely flayed Saint Bartholomew, because it might have been"
00:17:36,00:17:40,"correct, but the hanging skin that this guy's clutching is Michael Angelo, and we know"
00:17:40,00:17:42,because he's got a little broken nose.
00:17:42,00:17:46,"But then again, if you break your nose, it's the bone that breaks, it's not the skin that"
00:17:46,00:17:50,"breaks, and so how can you tell if you flay someone's skin, how can you tell if they've"
00:17:50,00:17:51,got a broken nose?
00:17:51,00:17:52,That's a good point.
00:17:52,00:17:53,"That's true, that's a good point."
00:17:53,00:17:54,"So you knew nothing about anatomy, did he?"
00:17:54,00:18:00,"But he used to paint sort of very buff people with an eight pack, as opposed to a six"
00:18:00,00:18:01,pack.
00:18:01,00:18:03,Does that exist in eight pack?
00:18:03,00:18:04,"Yeah, it does."
00:18:04,00:18:05,It's extremely rare.
00:18:05,00:18:07,"Oh, I can't, but it does exist."
00:18:07,00:18:08,I've got one.
00:18:08,00:18:09,"Yeah, I've got one."
00:18:09,00:18:12,"We're not talking about cans of beer, though, I mean."
00:18:12,00:18:14,"Oh, I haven't got one, though."
00:18:14,00:18:20,"So six pack is your basic muscles of your abdomen, but a very small percentage of people"
00:18:20,00:18:25,"do have eight muscles down there, and they think this is a clue as to who might have been"
00:18:25,00:18:30,"one of his main people who he based his paintings and his sculptures off, because if you look"
00:18:30,00:18:35,"at a lot of his sculptures, they all have this particular unusual anatomical thing."
00:18:35,00:18:41,"Well, in 2015, it helped to verify two pieces that they were tiny bronze statues that someone"
00:18:41,00:18:44,"had claimed as Michelangelo's, and they said there's no way proving."
00:18:44,00:18:48,"They did years and years of research on it, and they had eight packs."
00:18:48,00:18:53,"They had sort of oddly shaped toes, which was another classic feature of Michelangelo's,"
00:18:53,00:18:56,and they confirmed them as a result of one of his other things.
00:18:56,00:19:00,"So toes, eight pack, what's another thing that might be classic Michelangelo?"
00:19:00,00:19:02,Tiny toger.
00:19:02,00:19:04,"No, but you're in the right area."
00:19:04,00:19:05,Enormous.
00:19:05,00:19:06,Stasticles.
00:19:06,00:19:08,Anatomically correct pubic hair.
00:19:08,00:19:09,Okay.
00:19:09,00:19:10,"Oh, no."
00:19:10,00:19:12,Supposedly it's something that to look out for.
00:19:12,00:19:13,Do you say bronze these are?
00:19:13,00:19:14,"Yeah, these are in bronze."
00:19:14,00:19:15,That's a tough cast in bronze.
00:19:15,00:19:16,Yeah.
00:19:16,00:19:17,Very fine.
00:19:17,00:19:18,Yeah.
00:19:18,00:19:22,"I mean, if you're doing pubic hair, I'd be surprised if it wasn't anatomically correct."
00:19:22,00:19:24,Where are you going to put it on the belly button?
00:19:24,00:19:29,"As soon as you're choosing to do pubic hair, you're putting it over the pubic region, aren't"
00:19:29,00:19:30,you?
00:19:30,00:19:35,It's classically an auto to have the pubic hair in the ears of the people you do.
00:19:35,00:19:42,"If he wanted to send someone a present, Michelangelo would send them 33 pairs of apples."
00:19:42,00:19:43,Okay.
00:19:43,00:19:45,33 pairs as a present.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Okay.
00:19:46,00:19:47,One for every year of Christ's life.
00:19:47,00:19:48,"Oh, okay."
00:19:48,00:19:49,Okay.
00:19:49,00:19:51,Do you know why he did that?
00:19:51,00:19:52,One for every year.
00:19:52,00:19:53,"No, he's Christ's life."
00:19:53,00:19:54,Okay.
00:19:54,00:19:57,"So I now understand the number, but I don't understand why that particular object."
00:19:57,00:19:58,"No, I don't know."
00:19:58,00:19:59,"Oh, I don't know."
00:19:59,00:20:00,He was very stingy.
00:20:00,00:20:01,I know that.
00:20:01,00:20:02,I think he had a reputation for that.
00:20:02,00:20:04,So maybe they were the cheapest thing around at the sign.
00:20:04,00:20:05,Really?
00:20:05,00:20:10,"Apparently, he was kind of horrible, quite mean, but of a very difficult to work with, a terrible"
00:20:10,00:20:12,snob.
00:20:12,00:20:16,"And when he died, they found absolute fortune in his house because he was so penny-pinching"
00:20:16,00:20:17,throughout his life.
00:20:17,00:20:19,He had just dockets in jars all over the house.
00:20:19,00:20:20,He was very old.
00:20:20,00:20:21,He was scruged.
00:20:21,00:20:22,That's scrooge.
00:20:22,00:20:23,"That is scrooge, isn't it?"
00:20:23,00:20:24,Wow.
00:20:24,00:20:25,Yeah.
00:20:25,00:20:26,"It's scrooge, but duck, isn't it?"
00:20:26,00:20:27,Like that?
00:20:27,00:20:28,Kind of swimming in his own dockets.
00:20:28,00:20:29,Yes.
00:20:29,00:20:30,Yes.
00:20:30,00:20:31,You're right.
00:20:31,00:20:33,Scrooge muck duck it.
00:20:33,00:20:34,Yeah.
00:20:34,00:20:35,"As you say, he was very rich."
00:20:35,00:20:41,"Do you know what his estimated worth was of all the stuff that grows on that, 1.6 million"
00:20:41,00:20:42,dockets?
00:20:42,00:20:44,"So 50,000 florins."
00:20:44,00:20:45,"Oh, great."
00:20:45,00:20:46,There we go.
00:20:46,00:20:47,Yeah.
00:20:47,00:20:48,Yeah.
00:20:48,00:20:49,So James was bang on.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"50,000 florins."
00:20:50,00:20:51,Yeah.
00:20:51,00:20:52,So it's about 35 million in today's money.
00:20:52,00:20:53,"James, what?"
00:20:53,00:20:54,For an artist.
00:20:54,00:20:55,That is...
00:20:55,00:20:56,"Well, he was one of the big ones, I suppose."
00:20:56,00:20:57,"Yeah, yeah."
00:20:57,00:21:01,"And he lived a long, old time, 88 is ancient for someone to get to, so I suppose..."
00:21:01,00:21:03,And he kept working as well.
00:21:03,00:21:04,"Yes, he did, didn't he?"
00:21:04,00:21:08,"So he would have been getting royalties, I guess, from earlier works all the way through."
00:21:08,00:21:10,Is a royalty system exist for that?
00:21:10,00:21:16,"Well, it's more kind of dukes, wasn't it, at the time, to have to joke about the Medici family."
00:21:16,00:21:18,"It's a very good, if you're an artist or an artist."
00:21:18,00:21:19,Cool.
00:21:19,00:21:22,I'll do some research and get back to you with one of my historians how they're absolutely
00:21:22,00:21:23,crap.
00:21:23,00:21:30,"He apparently, despite all his wealth, was not into personal hygiene."
00:21:30,00:21:34,"There's a lot of legends about him, and George Iversari is one of the people to perpetuate"
00:21:34,00:21:36,a lot of those.
00:21:36,00:21:40,"So this is not from him, I don't believe, but another legend is that when he died, because"
00:21:40,00:21:44,"he showered so little or bathed, so little, they had to peel his clothes off him, because"
00:21:44,00:21:48,"he hadn't changed in so long, it had sort of congealed to his body."
00:21:48,00:21:53,"Yeah, it wasn't a very striptease ever."
00:21:53,00:21:58,"I'm your Michelangelo grant tonight, I'd be happy to feel my congealed clothes off my body,"
00:21:58,00:22:00,which is wait for me to die.
00:22:00,00:22:06,Don't be shocked when you see where my pubic hair is.
00:22:06,00:22:09,"Jesus, I was upset not to go to your stagdool last weekend, Andy, but no, I'm saying"
00:22:09,00:22:19,"I've got a bit of a lightly, okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:22:19,00:22:25,"My fact is that a plane was once built, which had nine wings."
00:22:25,00:22:27,You would think it would have to be an even number?
00:22:27,00:22:28,I know.
00:22:28,00:22:33,"I think this plane actually had 18 wings, but that is a controversial theory."
00:22:33,00:22:37,"Well, okay, explain what it is and we'll decide whether it's nine or 18."
00:22:37,00:22:45,"Alright, so this comes from an article on airspacemag.com, which is a great website about air and space."
00:22:45,00:22:51,"This plane was built in 1921, it was called the novoplano, and so you know how you have a normal"
00:22:51,00:22:58,"plane, two wings, then you've got a biplane, which has two layers of wings, although that technically"
00:22:58,00:23:04,"the top one only counts as one wing, supposedly, okay, so does a biplane have four wings or two?"
00:23:04,00:23:07,"Okay, the novoplano was another level."
00:23:07,00:23:12,"It had three sets of wings front to back, and each one was three layers high."
00:23:12,00:23:13,Okay.
00:23:13,00:23:14,Okay.
00:23:14,00:23:18,"So, like a biplane, but turn it into a triplane, and then do that three times."
00:23:18,00:23:19,Yes.
00:23:19,00:23:22,"So, if you're going by a biplane logic, it just had six wings, right?"
00:23:22,00:23:24,"No, no, because it had three decks."
00:23:24,00:23:26,"No, I know, but it didn't have..."
00:23:26,00:23:27,Three wings each.
00:23:27,00:23:30,"I know, but are you saying that a biplane has two wings?"
00:23:30,00:23:34,"I thought you were saying that a biplane had three wings, because it's got two wings as"
00:23:34,00:23:38,"a normal plane, and then it's got one at the top, which I thought he was saying that too,"
00:23:38,00:23:39,but he wasn't.
00:23:39,00:23:44,"He then confirmed that you think a biplane officially has two wings, because they count as one"
00:23:44,00:23:45,each.
00:23:45,00:23:46,It's very weird.
00:23:46,00:23:47,"A monoplane has two wings, and so does a biplane."
00:23:47,00:23:48,That's frustrating.
00:23:48,00:23:52,"I think then, by your logic, it doesn't matter how many layers up, it's still just one wing."
00:23:52,00:23:53,No way.
00:23:53,00:23:54,"Okay, this plane has one wing."
00:23:54,00:23:55,Stop trying to destroy the fact.
00:23:55,00:23:56,It looks insane.
00:23:56,00:23:57,It looks insane.
00:23:57,00:23:59,I'm going to put a picture up on Twitter.
00:23:59,00:24:02,I think you better have the one you've explained.
00:24:02,00:24:07,"So why do we not have this same plane taking us to, you know, Tenerife?"
00:24:07,00:24:10,"Well, it crashed almost immediately."
00:24:10,00:24:11,It's second-ever test flight.
00:24:11,00:24:12,It crashed.
00:24:12,00:24:17,"I'm amazed it didn't crash on its first flight, just because it's so hard to land on water"
00:24:17,00:24:18,because it was a...
00:24:18,00:24:19,"What's a sea plane, though, right?"
00:24:19,00:24:23,"It was a flying boat, which is slightly different to a sea plane."
00:24:23,00:24:26,"Is that about a floating plane or a flying boat, and they're different things?"
00:24:26,00:24:27,They are different things.
00:24:27,00:24:28,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:28,00:24:29,Is this about how they identify?
00:24:29,00:24:32,Is it like the flying boat sees itself as mostly a boat?
00:24:32,00:24:38,"So the sea plane is, you know the one where Indiana Jones gets onto, it's got floats under"
00:24:38,00:24:39,"its feet, right?"
00:24:39,00:24:40,Yes.
00:24:40,00:24:41,So they land on water.
00:24:41,00:24:42,"On these feet, hey."
00:24:42,00:24:43,On these things.
00:24:43,00:24:44,Land on.
00:24:44,00:24:45,Okay.
00:24:45,00:24:46,We tried to get into there.
00:24:46,00:24:47,Okay.
00:24:47,00:24:49,"Those are the planes which are basically look like the wearing massive shoes, okay?"
00:24:49,00:24:50,Because they float on those.
00:24:50,00:24:51,Okay.
00:24:51,00:24:52,Thanks.
00:24:52,00:24:55,"Then there's flying boats, and they have the buoyancy built into the fuselage."
00:24:55,00:24:58,So they land basically on water.
00:24:58,00:25:01,The main body of the plane is the thing that's floating on the water.
00:25:01,00:25:06,"But in the USA, sea planes are called float planes and they use the term sea plane to describe"
00:25:06,00:25:08,both float planes and flying boats.
00:25:08,00:25:09,Oh my gosh.
00:25:09,00:25:10,Right.
00:25:10,00:25:13,So which one was this?
00:25:13,00:25:14,This is a flying boat.
00:25:14,00:25:15,Flying boat.
00:25:15,00:25:16,This is a flying boat.
00:25:16,00:25:19,"So the fuselage was basically a boat, but that had wings."
00:25:19,00:25:20,"Yeah, exactly."
00:25:20,00:25:21,Yeah.
00:25:21,00:25:26,And it got smashed up on its second ever flight and it now exists as a model and a few bits
00:25:26,00:25:27,of wreckage in the museum.
00:25:27,00:25:28,It was in Italy.
00:25:28,00:25:29,It was flying.
00:25:29,00:25:30,Like Maggiore.
00:25:30,00:25:31,Really?
00:25:31,00:25:32,"The passenger plane, wasn't it?"
00:25:32,00:25:33,Yeah.
00:25:33,00:25:34,Yeah.
00:25:34,00:25:36,The wings were made of linen as far as I can tell.
00:25:36,00:25:37,"Well, linen."
00:25:37,00:25:38,"Well canvas, you know."
00:25:38,00:25:40,"It was a really early days of flight, obviously."
00:25:40,00:25:44,"God, if someone's just attached a sheet to the outside of my planes and is hoping it's going"
00:25:44,00:25:45,"to fly, I'm not surprised at crash."
00:25:45,00:25:46,Nine sheets.
00:25:46,00:25:47,Nine sheets.
00:25:47,00:25:50,"That's one of the phrase nine sheets to the windwinds, isn't it?"
00:25:50,00:25:51,Is that a phrase?
00:25:51,00:25:53,I don't think it's three sheets to the windwinds.
00:25:53,00:25:54,"Oh, is that what it meant?"
00:25:54,00:25:55,Now you're counting them.
00:25:55,00:25:56,Yeah.
00:25:56,00:25:59,"So there's been lots of really cool planes in history, haven't they?"
00:25:59,00:26:04,"There's loads of, especially during military times, they always try and invent new things and,"
00:26:04,00:26:09,"you know, even when they started making airplanes, they didn't really know how they worked and"
00:26:09,00:26:10,stuff like that.
00:26:10,00:26:11,So there was lots of different ideas.
00:26:11,00:26:17,I really like these parasite flight fighters that they tried to do for most of the 20th
00:26:17,00:26:18,century.
00:26:18,00:26:22,"And the idea is you have one big plane and then inside it, you have lots of little planes"
00:26:22,00:26:25,and then they fly out and attack like the town.
00:26:25,00:26:29,So the big plane takes you there and saves all the petrol for the other guys and then they
00:26:29,00:26:31,can go on little forays.
00:26:31,00:26:34,Has it landed or are you flying out of the plane?
00:26:34,00:26:36,"You're flying out of the plane, mid-flight."
00:26:36,00:26:37,What?
00:26:37,00:26:38,Yeah.
00:26:38,00:26:39,And they try to do it loads and loads of times.
00:26:39,00:26:44,"Usually the problem is that they just all crash into each other, that happens quite a lot."
00:26:44,00:26:49,"But they experimented from the 19, from 1915 all the way through to the late 1950s."
00:26:49,00:26:52,The USSR were the only ones who really made anything that was kind of useful.
00:26:52,00:26:54,Everyone else tried it and couldn't.
00:26:54,00:26:58,And the reason we don't do it anymore and I didn't realize this is a thing is these days
00:26:58,00:27:00,you can refuel your aeroplane while it's flying.
00:27:00,00:27:02,"Oh, isn't that amazing?"
00:27:02,00:27:03,I don't.
00:27:03,00:27:06,I've never noticed a plane I'm on stopping at a petrol station ever.
00:27:06,00:27:08,"Well, that's when you're in the airport."
00:27:08,00:27:09,That's what the petrol station is.
00:27:09,00:27:11,"They come and fill you with petrol, right?"
00:27:11,00:27:13,"Yeah, but so how do you refuel while it's flying?"
00:27:13,00:27:14,It's really weird.
00:27:14,00:27:18,You just get one aeroplane with loads of petrol in it and you fly it next to the aeroplane
00:27:18,00:27:21,with not much petrol in it and then you attach them together.
00:27:21,00:27:24,So it's not my planes that I've been on that are getting refueled.
00:27:24,00:27:26,"No, no, you're probably not."
00:27:26,00:27:30,"Yeah, but if you've seen the movie Air Force One, they refuel the plane mid-flight."
00:27:30,00:27:31,Today.
00:27:31,00:27:33,"Yeah, and Harrison Ford uses that as the big moment to sort of get to another plane."
00:27:33,00:27:34,I think I'm right.
00:27:34,00:27:38,"You must not have a really long, you know, the toggles you put in because you know it's"
00:27:38,00:27:40,someone that's quite hard when you park your car on the wrong side of a petrol plane.
00:27:40,00:27:41,Yeah.
00:27:41,00:27:42,And you have to stretch it all the way around.
00:27:42,00:27:43,Yeah.
00:27:43,00:27:44,Yeah.
00:27:44,00:27:47,"If you fly on the wrong side of the aeroplane, that's going to be really awkward here."
00:27:47,00:27:48,Okay.
00:27:48,00:27:51,"On this, on this mid-air thing, it is insane."
00:27:51,00:27:57,"So there was a flying boat, okay, in the 1930s called the short empire, right?"
00:27:57,00:28:01,And the problem was they couldn't get enough fuel into it for it to make it all the way across
00:28:01,00:28:02,"the Atlantic, okay?"
00:28:02,00:28:03,Okay.
00:28:03,00:28:04,So that's the problem.
00:28:04,00:28:10,But it could be loaded with more fuel than it could take off with.
00:28:10,00:28:13,So it can only get into the air if it has under a certain amount of fuel on it.
00:28:13,00:28:16,"But once you get it into the air, you can load it with extra fuel."
00:28:16,00:28:17,Yeah.
00:28:17,00:28:26,The idea was this plane took off towards the USA from Britain with not enough fuel to get
00:28:26,00:28:27,there.
00:28:27,00:28:28,Yeah.
00:28:28,00:28:33,"And then while it was over island, it would be refueled by another plane, as it went."
00:28:33,00:28:35,It would take off without enough fuel to get to where it was meant to go.
00:28:35,00:28:39,And it had to refuel with 800 extra gallons of fuel.
00:28:39,00:28:40,Yeah.
00:28:40,00:28:41,That's extraordinary.
00:28:41,00:28:48,"We do have planes now that can carry other, well, flying machines."
00:28:48,00:28:51,There's a plane called White Knight II.
00:28:51,00:28:55,"And this is the, so it's not operational yet, but it will be within a few years, I think."
00:28:55,00:28:56,"It looks like a catamaran, really."
00:28:56,00:29:01,"So it, or it looks kind of like two planes, a simultaneous twins, and one of their wings"
00:29:01,00:29:02,is fused.
00:29:02,00:29:03,Yes.
00:29:03,00:29:04,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:04,00:29:05,It's an incredible looking thing.
00:29:05,00:29:09,But it's actually built to be able to take off like two planes stuck together.
00:29:09,00:29:13,"And then hanging underneath this shed wing will be the Virgin rocket, which will then take"
00:29:13,00:29:14,tourists into space.
00:29:14,00:29:18,"So not only do you get to go to space if you pay for this, but you get the bonus of things"
00:29:18,00:29:22,suspended under a weird double-cyme plane catamaran thing.
00:29:22,00:29:23,It's extraordinary.
00:29:23,00:29:26,Have you ever seen footage of it when it drops the plane?
00:29:26,00:29:27,"Oh, no."
00:29:27,00:29:28,I haven't seen that.
00:29:28,00:29:29,So that's the thing.
00:29:29,00:29:34,"Obviously, the rocket can't thrust its, or boost its thrusters while it's still attached"
00:29:34,00:29:35,to this other plane.
00:29:35,00:29:40,So it literally plummets and they have to turn on the engine as they're dropping a pump
00:29:40,00:29:41,of fuel.
00:29:41,00:29:43,And then it kind of just finds its way.
00:29:43,00:29:46,So you're in sort of freefall for a while when you're inside this.
00:29:46,00:29:47,Is this in the rocket or in the plane?
00:29:47,00:29:48,In the rocket?
00:29:48,00:29:49,Wow.
00:29:49,00:29:50,"Yeah, that's it."
00:29:50,00:29:52,"God, imagine if people have bought tickets and they're listening to this now, having"
00:29:52,00:29:53,not realized.
00:29:53,00:29:54,Because that sounds terrifying.
00:29:54,00:29:58,"I think you would have watched a YouTube video before pressing, and you catch us."
00:29:58,00:29:59,You're right.
00:29:59,00:30:01,You just mentioned two planes being stuck together is what this looks like.
00:30:01,00:30:02,Yeah.
00:30:02,00:30:09,"One time, as far as I'm aware, that two planes have stuck together mid-flight, right?"
00:30:09,00:30:10,This was in 1940.
00:30:10,00:30:12,This was a training flight above Australia.
00:30:12,00:30:16,"Two bomber planes crashed together, okay?"
00:30:16,00:30:20,"Disaster, obviously, except that one of them basically jammed over the other one, and they"
00:30:20,00:30:23,just got stuck together in mid-air.
00:30:23,00:30:28,"So the one on top had its wings and its controls still intact, and the one beneath had the engine"
00:30:28,00:30:29,working.
00:30:29,00:30:36,"And the pilot of the plane on top managed to land successfully, but that's ridiculous."
00:30:36,00:30:41,"That doesn't sound like it's made up by Dan Zitalion, Ryan Blessed Guy."
00:30:41,00:30:42,I know.
00:30:42,00:30:43,Nobody died.
00:30:43,00:30:47,One person jumped out and was hit by a propeller.
00:30:47,00:30:48,Even he was fine eventually.
00:30:48,00:30:49,He just covered.
00:30:49,00:30:54,"But it's amazing that just so happens that the engine works for this one, and the steering"
00:30:54,00:30:55,works.
00:30:55,00:30:58,"It's like, oh, the coffee machine works for this one, but luckily the sandwich maker works"
00:30:58,00:30:59,on the other one.
00:30:59,00:31:04,"Do you think they had a chat between the planes going, ""We're like Jack Spratt and his wife,"
00:31:04,00:31:07,"aren't we?"""
00:31:07,00:31:11,"Just on this thing that you were talking about carrying space shuttles, the largest plane"
00:31:11,00:31:18,"that's ever been made, which was the Anatov AN225 Maria, which was made in Ukraine in"
00:31:18,00:31:20,Soviet times.
00:31:20,00:31:26,"This has the record for the biggest payload ever taken, and they carried shuttles from"
00:31:26,00:31:29,"one part of Russia to the other, the Soviet Union to the other."
00:31:29,00:31:35,"That was the main job of them, and one time they carried a generator for a gas power plant"
00:31:35,00:31:41,"in Armenia, which weighed 247,000 kilograms, which is the weight of 80 elephants."
00:31:41,00:31:45,That's the largest payload of any aeroplane ever.
00:31:45,00:31:47,That is so amazing.
00:31:47,00:31:48,That's amazing.
00:31:48,00:31:52,And then it went into commercial service in the early 2000s.
00:31:52,00:31:59,"And by the way, do you have extra luggage because it doesn't matter?"
00:31:59,00:32:02,Emotional support elephant with me.
00:32:02,00:32:05,"When I say commercial, I don't mean you can buy a flight on it."
00:32:05,00:32:10,"It was used for companies, and actually at one stage, the American military took it and"
00:32:10,00:32:16,"took 216,000 ready meals to military personnel in Oman."
00:32:16,00:32:17,Wow.
00:32:17,00:32:18,So that's cool.
00:32:18,00:32:23,"It was out of chicken or fish, but it's fine."
00:32:23,00:32:28,It was transported on 375 pallets weighing 187.5 tons of ready meals.
00:32:28,00:32:29,Oh man.
00:32:29,00:32:33,Do you know why nuclear planes have never been tried?
00:32:33,00:32:34,Because they sound dangerous.
00:32:34,00:32:36,They do sound dangerous.
00:32:36,00:32:37,They are dangerous.
00:32:37,00:32:41,"So people have kept trying all the way through, kind of like the thing you were mentioning"
00:32:41,00:32:42,James of Parasite.
00:32:42,00:32:43,Parasite ones.
00:32:43,00:32:44,"Yeah, the Parasite planes."
00:32:44,00:32:45,Yeah.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"So I think the USA have tried, I'm sure the Soviet Union tried as well."
00:32:47,00:32:52,"Basically, they could not work out how to deal with radiation and to keep the planes light."
00:32:52,00:32:56,"Because obviously, to protect against radiation, you need a very heavy thick armor stuff."
00:32:56,00:33:00,"So one thing they considered doing, this was in the 50s in the USA, was just hiring pilots"
00:33:00,00:33:06,who were so elderly that they would certainly die before any effects of radiation got through
00:33:06,00:33:07,to them.
00:33:07,00:33:08,Wow.
00:33:08,00:33:09,That was the plan.
00:33:09,00:33:10,What a move.
00:33:10,00:33:11,That's crazy.
00:33:11,00:33:13,JFK cancelled that plan.
00:33:13,00:33:14,Yeah.
00:33:14,00:33:15,Yeah.
00:33:15,00:33:20,"I've found a few sort of, as we were saying earlier, those that military period of plane"
00:33:20,00:33:23,"innovation, which is extraordinary decisions they had to make."
00:33:23,00:33:28,"So when the Navy was out and they needed planes that were on their ships, in the early days,"
00:33:28,00:33:30,they didn't have landing strips that were long enough.
00:33:30,00:33:34,"So they could launch with some help, but they couldn't get back because it was too short."
00:33:34,00:33:38,"So what they did was they started toying with ideas like building a plane, which this"
00:33:38,00:33:41,was prototype called the Blackburn Blackbird.
00:33:41,00:33:44,"And the idea was that you could take off, but you weren't meant to return."
00:33:44,00:33:48,The plane was designed to be ditched in the ocean by the ship.
00:33:48,00:33:53,But luckily all the pilots were so old that they were expected to die before they got
00:33:53,00:33:54,to them.
00:33:54,00:33:55,"Yeah, exactly."
00:33:55,00:33:56,"Wait, sorry."
00:33:56,00:33:57,These were single-use planes.
00:33:57,00:33:58,No.
00:33:58,00:34:02,"If you were successful, you came back and you ditched the plane as close to the ship as possible,"
00:34:02,00:34:06,and hopefully the ship got to you before both you and the plane sank.
00:34:06,00:34:09,"If it did, they would lift the plane back onto the ship and then they would rebuild it"
00:34:09,00:34:10,and you could reuse it.
00:34:10,00:34:11,What?
00:34:11,00:34:12,"Well, they had no choice because it was..."
00:34:12,00:34:13,"No, I'm sorry, I'm confused."
00:34:13,00:34:15,"When you say ditched a plane, do you mean fly it into the sea?"
00:34:15,00:34:16,"Yeah, fly into the ocean."
00:34:16,00:34:17,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:17,00:34:20,So the pilot would be waiting with the plane while it's sinking.
00:34:20,00:34:26,"Another thing they tried to solve that was something called the Flying Pancake, which the Flying"
00:34:26,00:34:32,"Pancake either had no wings, one wing, or an infinite number of wings, depending on how"
00:34:32,00:34:33,you're looking at it.
00:34:33,00:34:34,It's a whole wing.
00:34:34,00:34:39,"It's a pancake shape, so it's flat, and it's kind of tilted, and it's got massive"
00:34:39,00:34:45,"propellers on it, and so if you were sailing into a headwind, then the wind can help you"
00:34:45,00:34:48,just take off by using the shape of your flying pancake.
00:34:48,00:34:51,"And if you weren't going into a headwind, it had these massive propellers that you could"
00:34:51,00:34:58,"create your own headwind, and so it could blow air over your aerophile and help you take"
00:34:58,00:34:59,off that way.
00:34:59,00:35:00,That sounds amazing.
00:35:00,00:35:01,Yeah.
00:35:01,00:35:02,"And it looked kind of like a flying saucer, right?"
00:35:02,00:35:03,"They do, yeah, yeah."
00:35:03,00:35:06,"Don't like the idea of flying something called a pancake, because I imagine pancakes flipping"
00:35:06,00:35:09,at 180 degrees in the air.
00:35:09,00:35:13,"And the reason we don't use them now is basically because jet engines came in, so we didn't need"
00:35:13,00:35:14,them anymore.
00:35:14,00:35:18,"Once you had jet engines, you could get to a really high speed really quickly."
00:35:18,00:35:20,"So it did work, fine."
00:35:20,00:35:21,"Yeah, work."
00:35:21,00:35:26,"Oh god, we've got to talk about the inflator plane quickly, just very quickly."
00:35:26,00:35:31,"This was a sort of foldable collapsible plane that was commissioned by Good Year, of course,"
00:35:31,00:35:35,"in the 1950s, and it could deflate and be transported in like a three and a half foot"
00:35:35,00:35:37,"container, a little container."
00:35:37,00:35:39,And it was actually a brilliant idea.
00:35:39,00:35:43,"So it was built in just 12 weeks, which doesn't have a worry any short time in which to build"
00:35:43,00:35:46,"an entire plane, designed and built."
00:35:46,00:35:50,"But Good Year, the idea was that a single person would be able to hand pump it, and so you"
00:35:50,00:35:55,"could drop it behind enemy lines, so you'd drop it from your plane, behind enemy lines where"
00:35:55,00:35:58,"your men were captured, and they'd have that little hand pump on the ground, I suppose,"
00:35:58,00:36:02,"waiting for this moment, and they'd pump it up until it got big enough, and then they"
00:36:02,00:36:03,could take off.
00:36:03,00:36:08,So it would have like a little tube in case your pump wasn't working so you could blow it
00:36:08,00:36:09,by mouth.
00:36:09,00:36:10,I think it must have.
00:36:10,00:36:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:36:11,00:36:20,"Anyway, look, it had a test flight in 1957, and it sort of went into a spiral, and one of"
00:36:20,00:36:24,"the wings got floppy and folded on top of it, and got chopped off by the propeller."
00:36:24,00:36:25,"Oh, I know."
00:36:25,00:36:28,"So it never really, it really never took off."
00:36:28,00:36:35,"I'll tell you what, with that of your paper company, Folding, it's been a bad day, it's been"
00:36:35,00:36:37,a bad day for puns all the way.
00:36:37,00:36:42,"Okay, it is time for our final factor, the show, and that is my fact."
00:36:42,00:36:50,My fact is that this year a sperm bank lost a court case to a man named Dick Weiner.
00:36:50,00:36:55,"So this has happened in Oregon, in America, and the jury, who is dealing with the case,"
00:36:55,00:37:00,"afforded $400,000 American dollars to two Oregon dog breeders, because the international"
00:37:00,00:37:05,canine semen bank accidentally destroyed both of their Labrador sperms.
00:37:05,00:37:07,Why did you not tell us the name of the other breeder?
00:37:07,00:37:14,"Yeah, because Fanny vagina is not as interesting to be fair."
00:37:14,00:37:18,"So this is from Oregon Live, which is a big newspaper in Oregon."
00:37:18,00:37:23,"But in every other report I've seen, it's Richard Weiner, and only just discovered that"
00:37:23,00:37:28,"before we came upstairs to record this, so, but he's still, it's still, you know, parents"
00:37:28,00:37:29,should have known.
00:37:29,00:37:30,His name's Dick Weiner.
00:37:30,00:37:31,"His name's Dick Weiner, exactly."
00:37:31,00:37:32,"So, yeah, this is amazing."
00:37:32,00:37:33,Yeah.
00:37:33,00:37:37,I didn't know there was an international canine semen bank.
00:37:37,00:37:38,Did you not?
00:37:38,00:37:39,"No, I did."
00:37:39,00:37:40,I did.
00:37:40,00:37:41,I did.
00:37:41,00:37:42,I did.
00:37:42,00:37:43,I did.
00:37:43,00:37:44,I did.
00:37:44,00:37:44,I did.
00:37:44,00:37:45,I did.
00:37:45,00:37:46,I did.
00:37:46,00:37:46,I did.
00:37:46,00:37:47,I did.
00:37:47,00:37:48,I did.
00:37:48,00:37:49,I did.
00:37:49,00:37:50,I did.
00:37:50,00:37:51,I did.
00:37:51,00:37:52,I did.
00:37:52,00:37:53,I just keep all of mine in Bargley's.
00:37:53,00:37:54,I think bigger.
00:37:54,00:37:58,"So it used to exist mainly for professional dog breeders, so that if you had, you know, a top"
00:37:58,00:38:03,"dog, then you could pass on their genes for generations, but now it seems to be just sentimental"
00:38:03,00:38:08,"dog owners who want an exact copy of their beloved pet before, you know, after they've"
00:38:08,00:38:09,died.
00:38:09,00:38:11,"It's probably not people who don't know how genetics works, basically."
00:38:11,00:38:12,Yeah.
00:38:12,00:38:15,"It's, you know, you will get a quarter of the dog you had."
00:38:15,00:38:17,"Well, it's better than nothing, isn't it, Andy?"
00:38:17,00:38:18,Okay.
00:38:18,00:38:24,"I should say, this mistake with the dog seeming that Dick Weiner found this happened 20 years"
00:38:24,00:38:25,ago.
00:38:25,00:38:26,Yeah.
00:38:26,00:38:27,This story goes all the way back.
00:38:27,00:38:28,Wow.
00:38:28,00:38:29,I know.
00:38:29,00:38:30,"Well, no, no."
00:38:30,00:38:31,"It's, it's, they, they knew that they stuffed up 20 years ago."
00:38:31,00:38:32,Exactly.
00:38:32,00:38:36,"Dick Weiner only found out a few years ago, because of ex-employee told him randomly, as I"
00:38:36,00:38:37,probably don't know.
00:38:37,00:38:38,Yeah.
00:38:38,00:38:39,He was a whistle bar.
00:38:39,00:38:40,Yeah.
00:38:40,00:38:41,"So that he deposited the sperm in the 90s, I think."
00:38:41,00:38:42,Yeah.
00:38:42,00:38:46,"And then in the, maybe late 90s, early 90s, it was accidentally thawed out, making it worthless."
00:38:46,00:38:50,"And 20, nearly 20 years later, it disgruntled ex-employee must have told him."
00:38:50,00:38:55,"Unfortunately, this guy who thawed out the sperm had done the same thing 18 months earlier,"
00:38:55,00:38:56,hadn't he?
00:38:56,00:38:57,[laughter]
00:38:57,00:39:01,"For 500,000 liters was flushed away."
00:39:01,00:39:02,[laughter]
00:39:02,00:39:03,Okay.
00:39:03,00:39:11,"Well, I looked up their costs, the International Seaman Bank, K9 Seaman Bank, very important."
00:39:11,00:39:17,"For, to store your dog Seaman for a year, it's $324 to deposit and store it for a year."
00:39:17,00:39:24,"But then every year after that, it's $79 a year, which is, I think, what Amazon Prime used"
00:39:24,00:39:25,to cost.
00:39:25,00:39:26,[laughter]
00:39:26,00:39:28,"That's a very different service, isn't it?"
00:39:28,00:39:29,[laughter]
00:39:29,00:39:31,"You've got to weigh it up when you're making your budget choices, yeah?"
00:39:31,00:39:32,[laughter]
00:39:32,00:39:35,"But, and you, another thing you can do with this, these banks, and this is not, we should"
00:39:35,00:39:39,"say, other dog Seaman banks are available, when, you know."
00:39:39,00:39:43,"But another thing you can do, I think, is ship your dog's testicles to them after your dog"
00:39:43,00:39:44,has been neutered.
00:39:44,00:39:45,"You have to, you can't, yeah?"
00:39:45,00:39:46,What?
00:39:46,00:39:49,"Snipp 'em off, and ship 'em off, and ship 'em off, and ship 'em off."
00:39:49,00:39:50,[laughter]
00:39:50,00:39:52,That's what you do.
00:39:52,00:39:53,Wow.
00:39:53,00:39:55,"You can get instructions for how to do it yourself, I think."
00:39:55,00:39:58,"So most people can do it at a vet and say, ""Would you mind sending these balls to the"
00:39:58,00:39:59,"bank?"""
00:39:59,00:40:05,"But, um, some banks do give, some banks do give instructions on how to package up your"
00:40:05,00:40:07,"testicles, and you have to send them off ASAP."
00:40:07,00:40:11,"Like, within a two or three hours, yeah."
00:40:11,00:40:14,"You must have to send them in a special, cool, cool box."
00:40:14,00:40:15,"Yeah, I think you must do, yeah."
00:40:15,00:40:17,"You've got it all to the package, ain't it?"
00:40:17,00:40:23,"I just walk into the, into the Royal Mail, in a pair of, I don't know, dogmackers, and"
00:40:23,00:40:24,"by an envelope, can you?"
00:40:24,00:40:27,"No, and what if you do, you've got to go first class, 'cause it really is time for the"
00:40:27,00:40:28,rest of us.
00:40:28,00:40:29,[laughter]
00:40:29,00:40:32,"Do you know, um, who did the first ever artificial insemination of a dog?"
00:40:32,00:40:40,"No, it was none of the digby clans."
00:40:40,00:40:46,"It was an Italian physiologist called Lazaro Spalanzini, and we probably, do you guys have"
00:40:46,00:40:47,heard of him?
00:40:47,00:40:48,I've heard of him.
00:40:48,00:40:49,What was his thing?
00:40:49,00:40:50,Frogs and pants?
00:40:50,00:40:51,Frogs and pants?
00:40:51,00:40:52,Exactly.
00:40:52,00:40:55,"Abonanas and pajamas, was the sequel, isn't it?"
00:40:55,00:41:02,"He is most famous among QI research, at least, for putting male frogs in form-fitting rubber"
00:41:02,00:41:10,"pants, to prove that, that they couldn't fertilize eggs if they couldn't get what was in the genitals"
00:41:10,00:41:11,out over the eggs.
00:41:11,00:41:12,Right.
00:41:12,00:41:13,"If you know what I mean, yeah, yeah."
00:41:13,00:41:15,So he basically proved how reproduction worked.
00:41:15,00:41:20,He also was the first person to note the effect of cooling on human sperm.
00:41:20,00:41:25,"So you know how they say that you should wear, at least, warm-ish underpants if you want"
00:41:25,00:41:26,to conceive babies.
00:41:26,00:41:28,"Is that right, Dan?"
00:41:28,00:41:31,"Yeah, you, well, not too tight, but you need to keep it."
00:41:31,00:41:32,Who's flowing?
00:41:32,00:41:34,"No, Lucy's not as good for you."
00:41:34,00:41:36,They need to be kept reasonably warm.
00:41:36,00:41:37,Yes.
00:41:37,00:41:40,"And you don't put your testicles on ice, basically."
00:41:40,00:41:41,Okay.
00:41:41,00:41:42,You don't need your underpants.
00:41:42,00:41:44,"So it's a very odd sort of warm, not hot."
00:41:44,00:41:47,"You need to keep it at the right temperature, but he was the first person to notice that."
00:41:47,00:41:53,"And he noted that if you put sperm on snow, they would stop swimming around."
00:41:53,00:41:54,Wow.
00:41:54,00:41:55,Wow.
00:41:55,00:41:59,"So he would have, he would have had microscopy, technology, I guess."
00:41:59,00:42:03,"This was after what's his name, yeah, Liv and Hook."
00:42:03,00:42:04,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:42:04,00:42:05,Gosh.
00:42:05,00:42:07,That was really very cool.
00:42:07,00:42:08,Yeah.
00:42:08,00:42:09,It was a cool guy.
00:42:09,00:42:10,Cool guy.
00:42:10,00:42:11,I got ski.
00:42:11,00:42:12,That was fun.
00:42:12,00:42:13,That was ski.
00:42:13,00:42:14,They just don't get a public school.
00:42:14,00:42:21,And the first person to make puppies from frozen dog semen was a guy called Steven W.J.
00:42:21,00:42:22,Siga.
00:42:22,00:42:24,"He's still alive, actually."
00:42:24,00:42:27,He's a veterinarian from Ireland who moved to Oregon.
00:42:27,00:42:35,And this was in 1969 and they made some baby Labrador's and they called them popsicles because
00:42:35,00:42:37,they came from frozen semen.
00:42:37,00:42:38,Very cool.
00:42:38,00:42:40,Do you say popsicles?
00:42:40,00:42:43,"Well, that would have been good, wouldn't it?"
00:42:43,00:42:46,"The article I read says popsicles, but popsicles would have been way better."
00:42:46,00:42:47,Yeah.
00:42:47,00:42:48,So maybe that's not a correct thing.
00:42:48,00:42:52,"Guys, have you ever seen fish being artificially insuminated?"
00:42:52,00:42:53,No.
00:42:53,00:42:54,"Oh, my gosh."
00:42:54,00:42:55,It's incredible.
00:42:55,00:42:57,I can't emphasize enough how much you have to watch this video.
00:42:57,00:43:03,"But basically, on a lot of fish farms, it's more efficient, or if you really want to control"
00:43:03,00:43:07,"how many fish are being insuminated, then you do it artificially."
00:43:07,00:43:11,"And the way they do it, I actually learned this in an interview with a guy called Mike Freeze,"
00:43:11,00:43:16,"which seems kind of almost suitable, who is a fish farmer in the US."
00:43:16,00:43:22,"And then I was led to this video of coy fish breeding, so coy car, very expensive."
00:43:22,00:43:25,And they are being bred at Kentucky State University.
00:43:25,00:43:26,"Look it up, basically."
00:43:26,00:43:31,"You get the female out of the water, and she's alive and gets laying down in some paper towel"
00:43:31,00:43:37,"for some reason, and then just lifted up and massaged from top to bottom, and you squeeze"
00:43:37,00:43:38,the eggs out.
00:43:38,00:43:44,"And what the eggs are, is this thick, brownie green slime that just spouts out, it's incredible."
00:43:44,00:43:49,"It's like sludge coming out, so they put that in a bowl, pop her back in the water, get"
00:43:49,00:43:50,the ladder out.
00:43:50,00:43:52,"Do exactly the same with him, and it's a little bit less."
00:43:52,00:43:53,But you squeeze it out.
00:43:53,00:43:55,"Like, maybe it looks like mayonnaise coming out of mayonnaise thing."
00:43:55,00:44:00,"And then you just stir it up together, like you're making a cake, and they mix it together,"
00:44:00,00:44:03,"and then you leave that for three to five minutes, and pop it back in the water."
00:44:03,00:44:06,"It sounds like a recipe, isn't it?"
00:44:06,00:44:07,A recipe for fish.
00:44:07,00:44:08,"Mark, sorry."
00:44:08,00:44:14,"It's very apart stewed, this with coy car, because they're very shy, aren't they?"
00:44:14,00:44:18,"I have something about Crofts, because it's about champion dogs."
00:44:18,00:44:19,Yes.
00:44:19,00:44:22,Only one dog has ever pooed live in the middle of a crush's event.
00:44:22,00:44:23,Did he win?
00:44:23,00:44:25,Or did he win?
00:44:25,00:44:26,Instant disqualification.
00:44:26,00:44:27,No.
00:44:27,00:44:28,"It's, the video is on YouTube."
00:44:28,00:44:30,We did a lot of YouTube recommendations today.
00:44:30,00:44:34,YouTube's going to be getting some real hits after this podcast.
00:44:34,00:44:35,It's incredible.
00:44:35,00:44:36,It's 2012.
00:44:36,00:44:37,This is the only one I've found.
00:44:37,00:44:40,"We should say, sorry, quickly, we should say for international listeners, Crofts, is"
00:44:40,00:44:41,the biggest dog show in the world.
00:44:41,00:44:42,"Sorry, yeah."
00:44:42,00:44:45,"I don't think he's as well known outside of this country, but it's the massive dog show."
00:44:45,00:44:46,"In UK, it's all we talk about."
00:44:46,00:44:47,"But, yeah, sorry."
00:44:47,00:44:52,"Crofts, biggest dog show in the world, and it was in 2012, and the video is online of"
00:44:52,00:44:55,"the full attempt, because, you know, they have to do the full course, and they do the"
00:44:55,00:44:59,"slalom, and they do the seasore, and they do the jumping over things."
00:44:59,00:45:04,"Anyway, the reaction of the crowd is so funny, because it's an amazing run."
00:45:04,00:45:05,It's going so well.
00:45:05,00:45:09,"And then the dog just absolutely stops dead and squats down, and the whole crowd goes,"
00:45:09,00:45:10,"""Oh!"""
00:45:10,00:45:12,That's amazing.
00:45:12,00:45:17,And he only gets handed a plastic bag by a crossbow boy.
00:45:17,00:45:18,"Oh, no!"
00:45:18,00:45:24,It's very much the Paul the Radcliffe of the dog breeding world.
00:45:24,00:45:25,It's a really funny video.
00:45:25,00:45:27,Why do they have such mad names in Crofts?
00:45:27,00:45:28,It's bizarre.
00:45:28,00:45:33,"Because you have to have, your dog name has to be involved the name of the breeder somewhere,"
00:45:33,00:45:36,"but I was looking at the best in shows, and the list."
00:45:36,00:45:41,"So the most recent was called ""Planet Waves for Ever Young Daydream Believers""."
00:45:41,00:45:44,"I think last year or the year before, it was McVan's ""Torussia with Love""."
00:45:44,00:45:49,"There's also Afterglow Maverick Saber, Iraqi Fabulous Willy."
00:45:49,00:45:51,They're crazy.
00:45:51,00:45:56,"They're crazy, Dalga, a good spice, and I can't find any good reason why, except that you're"
00:45:56,00:45:58,not supposed to have replicated names.
00:45:58,00:46:03,"But they can't have run out of words so much that all you could use is in ""Raki Fabulous"
00:46:03,00:46:04,"Willy""."
00:46:04,00:46:13,"That's a wish list on a dating profile, isn't it?"
00:46:13,00:46:16,"That's it, that's all of our facts, thank you so much for listening."
