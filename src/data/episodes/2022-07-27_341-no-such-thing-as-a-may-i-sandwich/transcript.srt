00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's No Such Thing as a Fish. Andrew Hunter Murray is off on his hollybabs this week

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:15,960
 And so we have been joined by the absolutely brilliant hilarious Kiwi actor and comedian Reese Derby

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,160
 We were lucky enough to get him because he is currently in quarantine in a hotel somewhere in New Zealand

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,280
 And frankly didn't have a lot more to do with his time

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,580
 Now you might know Reese from Flight of the Concord. You might know him from Jumanji and in podcast terms

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,240
 You might know him from the cryptid factor, which is his podcast all about the mysteries of the world

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,880
 Which he does with a certain Daniel Schreiber as well as another guy called Buttons

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,920
 Who I'll be honest is really the genius behind the whole thing, but we've got Reese and Dan on this week anyway

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,880
 I really hope you enjoy the show. We had a whole lot of fun making it

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,760
 Do check out the cryptid factor and for now on with a podcast

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:18,440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from four

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,080
 undisclosed locations three in the UK and one in New Zealand. My name is Dan Schreiber

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,280
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tichinski and Reese Derby

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,360
 And once again, we have gathered round our microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,880
 And in no particular order here we go starting with you, Reese

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,360
 Well in

17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,120
 1943 a spy who topped the Gestapo's most wanted list was New Zealander Nancy Wake

18
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,600
 Who once judo chopped a Nazi to death. I

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,160
 Don't even think that was possible. I don't know. Is it possible?

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,040
 I suppose you can if you can chop a brick in half you can chop a Nazi in half, can't you I suppose?

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,520
 I don't I don't think she chopped him in half. Oh, right

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,200
 Yeah, well, let me just check my notes. Yes in half. Wow. I mean those are strong hands guys

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,260
 So tell us more about her. Well, she was the and still is I believe them

24
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,920
 Most decorated female of any war. So she's a Kiwi

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:29,500
 She became a spy now. She actually left home at the age of 16. I'm gonna do the whole bio now take me 20 minutes

26
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,600
 She left home at 16 with 200 pounds in her pocket and went to London and

27
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,320
 self taught herself journalism and then

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,960
 She ended up in France

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,600
 And she was there during all the the Nazi build-up watching Hitler's

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,440
 Horrific actions in the early days and decided she into she interviewed Hitler didn't she or at least she was sent to interview him

31
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,820
 I couldn't find out if she actually got the interview. I couldn't find that maybe she didn't quite get through the crowds

32
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,540
 Mr. Hitler, please

33
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:12,540
 She's missed an opportunity if she has the karate skills

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 You know, it's got him early, right?

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,180
 It's weird because it would look like an erratic sig Heil wouldn't it look like come on

36
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,100
 Just keep it firming up and she's well

37
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,840
 You can start off and the full extension of the Heil and then come whacking down

38
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,480
 I mean that could be what she did, but I don't think she did in fact

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,600
 I think the whole judo thing might have just been a little bit of a kind of

40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,760
 Fluff it may not have been knowing her not that I do but knowing

41
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,300
 The way she was trained being ex-military myself a little bit of disclosure there

42
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:51,140
 Kill a man in four seconds using my bare hands. It was years ago now

43
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,100
 I was you know, 18 at the time, but it's more of a breaking of the neck from behind

44
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,660
 I'm assuming that's what she did. Well, but hey, you know judo sounds cooler

45
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:09,340
 It sounds a bit like judo. Have you actually been taught how to come up behind someone and kill them?

46
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,100
 To death with a neck shop kill them to death kill them to death

47
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,820
 It's not really a thing. I always thought there was a mix of people told each other in the playground when there were 12

48
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:24,580
 No, no, it's it's you learn unarmed combat. I was in the regular force cadets in the New Zealand Army

49
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:31,220
 So it was kind of an elite training school and then once I was I didn't actually do the the full-on hand-to-hand combat till I was a

50
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,500
 Signaler

51
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,380
 Two years later and I remember doing it in Hobbsonville Air Force Base

52
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,900
 And we were doing unarmed training and it was about yeah, there's a certain way you can kill someone in

53
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,100
 Under five seconds basically. I don't want to divulge too much information. No, it's a bit gross

54
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,980
 But yeah, you know, I was trained if anyone ever goes to one of Reese's gigs do not hackle in

55
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,140
 Well, I'd be enough they don't I think the word got out

56
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,700
 Once someone did heckle me and I went excuse me come here come here

57
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,460
 And I went no, please. No, please actually turn around

58
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,140
 And it was never seen again

59
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,540
 She was pretty um, she was pretty badass

60
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,800
 Wasn't she Nancy wake in terms of you know, I feel like if it hasn't been published yet a little book of quotes would be a

61
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,940
 Really enjoyable read because she did do bad stuff to people like you know

62
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,900
 She did a chop someone to death and she said I was not a very nice person and it didn't put me off my breakfast

63
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,580
 I just love that little extra like she was like I had to do what I had to do

64
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,300
 Isn't it it's quite like, you know from an action movie the kind of thing someone would say yeah

65
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,340
 Exactly, and and there's a sort of famous story about the fact that when she went to help out

66
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,140
 so she eventually helped out with the French resistance and

67
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,700
 There's a story involving the fact that she was married to a Frenchman

68
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,020
 She had to leave to London, but then she came back into France to help out and

69
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:58,380
 She parachuted back into the country and when she parachuted in she landed in a tree

70
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,960
 And that's where she was caught up and eventually her French contact found her hanging into this tree and

71
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,140
 You can guess her response then so the man who eventually finds her the Frenchman says

72
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,320
 I hope that all the trees in France bear such beautiful fruits this year

73
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,820
 Yeah, and she said she looked down at him. I've got a lovely pair

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,700
 She won't don't get me that French shit, and that's just again just wonderful badass. Well, this is interesting

75
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,940
 she was she was gorgeous and

76
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,980
 this is part of her charm so as a

77
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,740
 resistance fighter

78
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:44,780
 You know she used to get through the guards by actually using flirtatious behavior and saying would you like to search me?

79
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,740
 And she used her womanly charms, but also she had more balls than any man

80
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:57,080
 So she's an inspiration and coming from a country that she comes from that I come from New Zealand with a strong

81
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,020
 Feminist background. We were the first to give women the vote

82
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:10,500
 1893 we have a very strong female leader right now that the world is in awe of and I just feel it's kind of a this is a great

83
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,220
 person to talk about

84
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,940
 Yeah, because yeah, she's she's she's a

85
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,260
 Forced to be reckoned with and I wish she was alive today because she could she could turn a few heads

86
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,660
 I don't know. I mean she'd just be chopping people to death. I think I

87
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,300
 Quite I mean

88
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,300
 I think one of the very few areas where women get off better than men is that in stories like this

89
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,940
 You're badass if you're a woman, but if you're a man, you're really mean

90
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,500
 I mean she was she was vicious, right? She yeah time that she said that she wasn't

91
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,500
 She sort of had to be but apparently she didn't she had a very bad temper and she didn't survive very well in the post-war world because her

92
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,700
 Predelections were more for sort of

93
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,140
 Going around

94
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,780
 Upsetting people and killing people but when she said she wasn't put off her breakfast

95
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,860
 that was when she'd interrogated these French women and

96
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,900
 She decided that one of them was definitely a spy and so put her to death by firing squad and then was like, yeah

97
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,100
 Didn't put me off my breakfast. Yeah, she she was badass

98
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,900
 But I think yeah, she struggled in peacetime to I I believe that you know

99
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,380
 People are born for their time in some in some ways and when the war finished. She felt lost

100
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,100
 She felt like the action had stopped and she didn't know what to do after that because her purpose was

101
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,500
 Doing what she did and she did it so well and and I think there's a lot of people that fit into that the same bracket

102
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,580
 Yeah, she did say when he was saying that she was quite attractive

103
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,340
 I think she did she she wore Chanel lipstick everywhere

104
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,780
 I think she was never traveling without her Chanel lipstick her face cream and apparently her favorite red satin cushion

105
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:51,260
 Which seems like quite a cumbersome thing to carry around with you when you're supposed to be she she probably used it to

106
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,860
 Asphyxiate people to death. I would say that satin cushion. That's it when the chop didn't work

107
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,740
 Apparently she once fled a car that was under fire

108
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:05,500
 There was that she about to explode and then she ran back in order to collect a saucepan a jar of face cream a packet of tea and

109
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,440
 Her red satin cushion after which the car immediately exploded. I mean, that's a weird behavior

110
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,540
 She said that she never had any affairs didn't she during the war and the reason being because she was so attractive

111
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:25,040
 She said if I had accommodated one man, the world the word would have spread around and I would have had to accommodate the whole damn lot

112
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,820
 so

113
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,660
 If she'd have started shagging she would have never got anything else done. That's what she roll reverse

114
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,660
 You roll reverse that one and it just doesn't

115
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:42,300
 It does seem surprising that there hasn't been a big sort of film made of her life

116
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,260
 Maybe there has maybe this is there's a Kiwi film out there

117
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,220
 Well, I think there's one in the making right now and of course they say the movie Charlotte Gray

118
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,660
 Which was a book as well is partly

119
00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:00,660
 Inspired by her that I've got another quote here because in the end of her near the end of her days

120
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,620
 She ended up back in London and living in the the Stafford hotel

121
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,820
 By the way, so you guys have been there the American bar

122
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:17,060
 Which is which is in that hotel is where she would even in her 80s would get up in the morning and have a gin

123
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:24,020
 She's always a good drinker lived to 98 by the way. So that makes me feel good about my drinking, you know, it doesn't affect you at all

124
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,300
 Now here's a quote so she said in the end because she actually sold her medals

125
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,620
 There's all these medals she got she sold them. She says look, I'll probably go to hell anyway and that only melt

126
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,540
 Isn't that great

127
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,300
 That's so good

128
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,660
 Yeah, she this hotel that she lived in

129
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,460
 She was given a complete

130
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,060
 Everything was paid for and I it's a concept

131
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,140
 I love the idea of I think every hotel should have a resident badass or just someone with a history

132
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,740
 Yeah, you can find at the bar and just go and get their story and they live there completely free

133
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,940
 And so glad to know that that existed for her. I think that's really wonderful

134
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,020
 You're thinking of the major in Fulty Towers. Basically, she

135
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:19,800
 Was actually thinking when I when I found that fact out as well that I was thinking to myself in my older days

136
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,320
 I'm gonna end up in some cool hotel and I'm gonna be the guy there that gets free drinks

137
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,480
 I'm just gonna have to achieve a few more things

138
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,400
 That was a great way to end your days

139
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:36,140
 I don't know you can either do more impressive things or you can set your sights on a less impressive hotel

140
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:42,100
 So I think that maybe that's what the major did like the major kind of didn't do quite so well in the war

141
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,980
 So we had to go to Fulty Towers. Maybe yeah, if you if you just go for a travel lodge. You could probably do that right now

142
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,260
 Your premier in level

143
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,540
 Whichever you want the jokes on all of you because I'm already in a hotel

144
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,340
 I'm in an isolation hotel at the Christchurch Airport, and I'm never leaving here. I get three meals a day

145
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,320
 They knock on the door. They deliver it in a bag. I don't have to do shit

146
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,180
 It's living the dream

147
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,460
 Living the dream we should say that Reese isn't in prison or anything. He's just in quarantine

148
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,780
 It's not sort of that's very nice of you

149
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,620
 But there is a small courtyard where we are allowed to do a little bit of a run around

150
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,140
 I went out there yesterday and there was a guy out there having a smoke going

151
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:40,900
 So a part of what Nancy was doing was smuggling people out of France

152
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,740
 this is what a lot of people's roles was this time and to smuggle them to safety and

153
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,620
 Do you know this so a lot of resistance fighters would smuggle children over the border to safety?

154
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:58,500
 And they'd have to smuggle them out with their ID cards and it became policy amongst the resistance to smuggle children's ID cards

155
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:06,500
 Inside their sandwiches because apparently one resistance fighter realized that the Nazis never searched the sandwiches that had mayonnaise on them

156
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
 Because it might dirty their uniforms

157
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:19,420
 Why they called it may I back and that was called may. I isn't to inspect the sandwich and then they changed it over time to may oh

158
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,620
 That's an amazing fact

159
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,580
 Dan you have had your place taken as the dubious facts

160
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,300
 I knew it was a mistake, Brigitte Grison

161
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:41,660
 The French resistance is there's so many interesting stories of amazing characters

162
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:47,180
 Some quite well-known names one famous person who became famous later in life

163
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,220
 But was part of the French resistance was the great mime act Marcel Marceau

164
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,180
 And

165
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,700
 Yeah, and it's really a sweet he must have been he must have been a signal man as well. I reckon like

166
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:05,180
 He'd be able to get anything across. What's that Marcel? It's windy. Yeah, you're stuck in a box

167
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,340
 Hang on. He's pulling on a rope here. He's but he needs a rope does he know he's already got one what's

168
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,020
 Sorry doing some extravagant mine here, which you won't be able to feel the benefit of at home

169
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,480
 Only is it I was told this was a visual

170
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,580
 More of a physical comedian

171
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:39,480
 Yeah, he had been studying Marcel Marceau had been studying Mime already at that point and they snuck out a lot of children

172
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,220
 across the border and

173
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,620
 Part of the problem is, you know, children kind of don't get it

174
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,940
 It's really hard to get children to understand the concept of you have to be absolutely quiet and and so on and so Marcel

175
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,820
 Used to do my max to them and using his mime and sort of entertaining them

176
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,620
 Sort of as it were trick them into going silent so that they were part of this act

177
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,780
 He rescued over 70 children and his brother over 350 children

178
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,820
 And I believe his brother was involved in doing the mayonnaise trick as well with the ID cards

179
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,100
 They used to do things where they I think it was his brother

180
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:24,660
 But they did stuff like they'd go near the border and they would throw a stick over and

181
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,700
 They'd get the kid to chase it and the kid would go pick it up

182
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,900
 But then they'd be over the border and then they were fine and they had their ID card and their mayonnaise sandwich

183
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
 So they could just get on with life

184
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,540
 They were dogs we say children we mean dogs

185
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:45,780
 It was a ball come on down. It was a ball. They weren't throwing sticks for children sticks balls all sorts of things

186
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:52,980
 But he was I think it was more so as maybe his cousin George Luange and maybe it was cousin his cousin and brother

187
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,220
 But his cousin George sort of led a lot of these efforts and he died in 2018 age 108

188
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:06,340
 So maybe the key to longevity is gin in the morning and just saving loads of kids lives. Yes. Yeah. Well, we're halfway there

189
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,340
 Yeah

190
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:17,500
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James

191
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:25,140
 Okay, my fact this week is that John Cleese's silly walk is exactly six point seven times sillier than a normal walk

192
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,780
 Cause it is

193
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:34,660
 Okay, so first of all for anyone who's young listening to this. This is a sketch from Monty Python

194
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,780
 And for anyone you should not have to say that come on

195
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:46,500
 Please I know but you're young and you and you didn't know that ask yourself a question

196
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,620
 Why don't you know that?

197
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:56,260
 Wow, that's a real slam. See that's the kind of comedy slam you'd get from watching the comedy grapes

198
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,260
 So there was a couple of scientists called Nathaniel Domini and Erin Butler

199
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,740
 Who happened to be married and they are both at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire?

200
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:11,860
 And they looked at how John Cleese's knees flex when he was walking doing his silly walk

201
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,340
 And they found that occasionally his knees bent around

202
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:20,820
 110 degrees when he walked when in a normal person they would bend around 20 degrees and

203
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,460
 they kind of put in that and a whole load of other parameters and they worked out that his

204
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:31,300
 Walk is exact on the show is exactly six point seven times more variable than a normal walk

205
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,300
 Although when he did the live performance in 1980 it was only four point seven times more variable

206
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,100
 So they thought maybe as he was getting older. He was getting a bit less silly

207
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,180
 so

208
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,860
 But but it sounds to me like you're using well

209
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,460
 They are at least and you're reiterating the the scientific mathematical elements

210
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:59,020
 How does that adjoin to use a knee-term with silliness per se?

211
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,020
 I

212
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,900
 Feel like on a subject I don't understand

213
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,940
 But I'll answer that question anyway

214
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,380
 And they had to work out what silly meant and they decided that silliness was just basically variability

215
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,900
 And they kind of put the two together and said the more variable that you are the more silly you are

216
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,060
 and in the sketch for the young people who who don't know Monty Python and

217
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:31,020
 John Cleese kind of sees another guy called Mr. Putie and he says that his walk is three point three times and sorry

218
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,020
 And they've said that his walk is three point three times more variable

219
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,180
 So it's not quite as silly which is what John Cleese actually says in the sketch as well

220
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,980
 He's like, oh, it's not quite a silly walk

221
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,740
 but this is actually a point that the

222
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:49,820
 scientists were trying to make about funding right and they're saying that often when you're a scientist you have to go through this really

223
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,700
 Difficult peer review process to get your funding normally

224
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:01,660
 But what if you just had one person like John Cleese just assessing you when you walked in and seeing how silly you are or how good your

225
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,140
 Sciences, maybe that would be a better way of doing it than just this massive complicated peer review system

226
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,540
 So they're trying to they say they're trying to make an important point when actually just looking at the silly walk

227
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,500
 Right, so they think you should just have one bloat read read what you've written and say yeah, it's good to go

228
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,060
 That's what they were suggesting. Yeah. So did they find a is there

229
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,980
 Did they look at any actual walks of people being silly in real life and go?

230
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,980
 Do we have a measurement thing now where we can tell if people have a ten times sillier walk?

231
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,620
 Well, they you could use their system for sure

232
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,340
 But they didn't do that with other walks

233
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,140
 But there was another paper a few years ago in the proceedings of the Royal Society a

234
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:48,380
 mathematical and physical engineering sciences, which did a 19 page study on silly walks all the different silly walks

235
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:55,780
 They could think of and they analyzed them all and they worked out if there was any way of a silly walk being better than a normal walk

236
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:03,340
 And they said that basically there is no there is no silly walk, which is more efficient than a normal walk

237
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,300
 They always more calories and so there's no point having a ministry of silly walks at all

238
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:15,220
 They say that they should cut off all funding and there's no point in making a ministry of silly runs either because they're not better

239
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:22,180
 But reset I don't think you agree, but that in its fact is silly because for a start it's 19 pages long

240
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,180
 which is just silly and

241
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:31,980
 And also the fact that a walk is going to burn particularly with the silly nature more calories

242
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,300
 That's wonderful because you want to get more fit in other ways

243
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,740
 You're going to hurt your joints and let's move on to the fact that John

244
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,260
 Hated that sketch wished he'd never done it really

245
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,340
 Everywhere he would go because it was it's phenomenal

246
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,380
 It's an amazing piece of work and people would say every time do the silly walk do the silly walk

247
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:58,180
 You know and of course the older he got he couldn't he couldn't do it and he for a start didn't want to have to do that crazy walk

248
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:05,140
 Because it it you know it starts to hurt your limbs. This is also coming from me a physical comedian

249
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:13,900
 Who sort of you know obviously and very very much inspired by John over my tenure of which happened to be 10 years of

250
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:21,180
 It's actually small like 20, but what's what's half a career between friends? I

251
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,580
 Ended up hurting my joints and at the moment

252
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,100
 I mean the last couple years I haven't been able to do the physical comedy I once did

253
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,380
 But I never not liked it, but I don't like it now and I see why he

254
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,500
 Started to regret it. Yeah, and also he's had hip transplants

255
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,380
 His knees are shot to death and people still ask him to do it. And so yeah

256
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,660
 If you look at that walk, it does seem that maybe that's the reason he's had to have a lot of

257
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:58,980
 Replaced I mean that's gonna crack your crack your knees like you're not a hard one to

258
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,500
 emulate I don't know if anyone's tried to do it as well

259
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,960
 I mean a lot of it is the fact that he's so lanky yeah back in the day and he had such

260
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
 great

261
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:20,300
 Extensions and control over those would ridiculous limbs. Yeah. I like extensions as if he had some of some robotic

262
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:28,160
 But he was inspired by a guy called Max Wall who was

263
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,920
 Musical and kind of panto entertain a guy who was big in the 20s in the 30s

264
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,280
 And he played a character called Professor Wolofsky who did this really really stupid walk

265
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,440
 It's very similar if you watch it and oh wow still very funny

266
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,520
 And he played a pianist who also did this stupid walk, but he was a great character Max Wall

267
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,720
 so he married a woman called Marion and

268
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,520
 He's called Max and they had five children

269
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,680
 They called the first Michael and then they thought oh wow we've done the 3m thing

270
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,440
 And so they went on top of four more children and called them Melvin Martin Meredith and Maxine

271
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,800
 So they were

272
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:10,000
 I have the same thing in my family Mike and Maxine and they started calling their kids all m's as well

273
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,500
 I'd love to tell you their names, but they're cousins

274
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:20,820
 Yeah, they they've I should find out while you're well you guys are rambling on with the effects

275
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:27,720
 I'll find out what my cousins names. I think you should I think the listeners are really on tenterhooks at the moment

276
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,280
 It's annoying though, because whatever we say now all the fascinating stuff

277
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,840
 Are you there? What's what's your kid's names? I'm just on a an audio podcast

278
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,060
 Yeah, no, it's yeah, it's a bit. It's a bit dull. It's all facts and figures

279
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:52,380
 But they I want to yeah, they need to know your kid's names, right? So you got oh right Matthew

280
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,080
 Mint

281
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,760
 No, I'm gonna leave Craig. Yeah, I knew there was one with the seat

282
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,020
 Good luck on the farm

283
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:18,520
 Your family doesn't listen to this podcast because they're never gonna speak to you again if they do

284
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,040
 There's a place in New Zealand called John Cleese, isn't there?

285
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:27,960
 What yes, there is it is the tip in Palmerston North

286
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,400
 Because he famously visited Palmerston North and he said this place is a dump

287
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,880
 So they named the city dump after him

288
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,200
 Yeah, that's so funny

289
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,440
 Has he been because he's done tours of New Zealand Eric Eidel has been when John Cleese and Eric Eidel did a tour

290
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,040
 I think John's Cleese stayed in the hotel and Eric Eidel went for a walk up the up the dump

291
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,600
 That's so good

292
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,080
 Idled up the Cleese

293
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,280
 Yeah, the BBC didn't love Monty Python. Did they despite commissioning it?

294
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,560
 Yeah, what was commissioned by David Attenborough wasn't it? Oh, he was the original

295
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:13,520
 David Attenborough used to be the channel head for BBC 2 who's I think he was the original channel head and I

296
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:20,920
 Remember reading years ago and I can't find it since so this is I I want this to be true

297
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,120
 but I'm not sure that it is he didn't he wasn't on top of everything that was going out and

298
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:33,400
 Python was on quite late at night and it was very cult and it started getting this following which they didn't expect for something in

299
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:39,560
 That kind of late night slot and the story that I read is that Attenborough saw what this show was someone showed it to him

300
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,120
 Eventually and he went this is terrible and he wanted to decommission it

301
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,640
 But they said the numbers are so high that would be a stupid thing to do

302
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,280
 So he let it go on now. That's as I say I've read that years and years ago

303
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,800
 And I can't find where I've where I read that maybe because Attenborough's try to bury that if that's true

304
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,920
 But but he is responsible for it exists the one tarnish on his career

305
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:08,360
 As those and there's one time ish on my career and if I look back

306
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,840
 I was in a great excuse for me to do the voice that everyone literally everyone can do I've got three

307
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,640
 I've got that. Sorry. This is back on me again. Is it? Yeah, go for it

308
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:24,120
 I can do him John Wayne and

309
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,560
 Frank Spencer those are the only three and you know, I took those to Hollywood with me and

310
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,720
 Of course the only one I thought I might have a better chance with was John Wayne and they said no

311
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,720
 We're not I mean, it's not bad, but we're not gonna need it. I mean, he's long gone now and yeah, you know

312
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,080
 If we do a biopic, I don't think it's gonna be you dubs

313
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:52,080
 Well, I think it should I think it should be me. No, they'll pick a Frank Spencer in the offing in Hollywood

314
00:26:52,080 --> 00:27:01,280
 I wish you would be I mean, well, wouldn't it be I was in condor man

315
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:08,360
 Did you know that he was in a big Disney American film Michael Crawford? What's he who was still with us?

316
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,120
 Thank God called condor man

317
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,960
 I've always wanted to remake that so if there's any listeners out there and I know there's not any visual people

318
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,240
 But if there's any

319
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,880
 Audio wallabies, I think I think we've lost most of the listeners have dropped off at this point

320
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:31,000
 Remake condor man and put me in it. That's all I'm saying if there's one thing I want to get out tonight

321
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,720
 It's that and yeah, just just

322
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,640
 Try and get some visuals happening with this show

323
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
 Main points

324
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:52,440
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna

325
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:00,080
 My fact is that in 1814 there were days of rioting in Dublin because a dog who was supposed to be starring in a play

326
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,400
 Failed to show up on stage

327
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:09,400
 Why did he not turn up on stage what was well, he was actually demanding better pay

328
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,840
 Which the dogs had a very strong union in the early 19th century

329
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,880
 The dog actors union how talented was this dog could it talk?

330
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,560
 It couldn't it what it could talk in dog. It could bark

331
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:27,220
 Yeah, dogs could understand it, but well, how's you how's you treatment rough rough?

332
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,840
 Wow

333
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,520
 My dad literally told me that joke when I was 5 and even then whether you go. We're still rocking it. I want my eyes. Yeah

334
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,760
 Play that was very famous at the time actually it's called the forest of Bondi and it was based on a play called the dog of Montage

335
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,200
 It was shien the Montage which was written in France in 1814 and it was a

336
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:56,720
 Phenomenon it was so popular that it was immediately adapted into English and played around Britain and Ireland and

337
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,800
 Yeah, though it was being put on and there was a big hoo-ha about it being put on in Dublin

338
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:08,720
 But the dog's owner thought that the dog was not being reimbursed adequately given his extreme talent and people

339
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,320
 Turned up at the theatre and they thought they were going to see this play with a live dog

340
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,280
 And it which they were very excited about and a different place started because they haven't been able to secure the dog

341
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,880
 And they lost it and there was rioting and so like chandeliers were broken

342
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,640
 The whole orchestra fled so all the instruments were destroyed boxes were pulled down doors were flung off their hinges and

343
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,200
 This just went on so the following night the audience returned thinking surely they'll give us the dog tonight

344
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,880
 Same thing tried to put on a different play same riot and went on for days

345
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,280
 Hang on the whole place was destroyed and they turned up the next night going. Well, I'm sure it's reopened

346
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:55,320
 I was a bit confusing to me too because they did seem to be smashing the place to shreds every night

347
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,600
 But then the next night would come back and it would be miraculously

348
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,960
 They must have had like a joinery company who would come in every day and fix everything

349
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:12,240
 The next money going Dave you won't believe what's happened again. Yeah, we up again. Are we we're in okay?

350
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,120
 All right guys. We're back in there fix those instruments get those walls plastered. Anyway

351
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,480
 so the place kept being destroyed and then rebuilt in the night apparently and

352
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,800
 Eventually the deputy manager of the theatre came on stage to apologize

353
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,960
 But was sort of booed off on how to flee because projectiles were being thrown at him and the theatre manager just resigned

354
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,520
 I was it he resigned a letter to the paper saying he was emigrating. That was that

355
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:48,120
 Amazing the the play itself is as you say it was it was extremely popular and

356
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:54,320
 It was based on a legend that was written by Julius Caesar Scaliger

357
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,880
 The idea was that it was based on a real court case. So there was a French courtier

358
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:08,860
 To King Charles the fifth who was murdered and so they found the murderer and the only witness to the murder was the dog of

359
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,640
 This courtier and the dog recognized this murderer

360
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:20,320
 And so there was this weird thing whereby they made the dog and this murderer go into arm to arm combat

361
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,600
 they sort of like put them together to have a fight and

362
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,600
 The guy was given like a little club or something to fight against the dog

363
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,000
 And they had this big battle and the dog won and then the guy once he was defeated confessed to the murder

364
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,240
 And then he was himself executed and that's the sort of the basis of the story

365
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,800
 And it took place in this town that you mentioned Anna, which was Montagy

366
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:50,400
 Montagy, yeah Montagy and there's actually a statue there of the event of the dog and the man fighting

367
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,700
 Which you can go and visit if you go to this place. I like the way you say it's based on a myth

368
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,080
 by Julius Caesar

369
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:05,100
 Hoping that people will just think Julius Caesar wrote the myth when actually it's a completely unknown author from the 1500s called

370
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:13,680
 Julius Caesar Skelliger wasn't it or Skelliger? Yeah Skelliger Skelliger. Yeah, not Excalibur not Julius Caesar Excalibur

371
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,840
 It's not a name to live up to isn't it?

372
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:25,360
 It's a big one. Yeah, what's your name mate Julius Caesar Excalibur, okay? Alright, well, I'll get you just to do the mopping up at this stage

373
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
 and we'll

374
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,400
 Make sure you get Derby a drink at some point were you?

375
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,360
 Rolex caliber

376
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,640
 Yeah, so this this is a big deal this play. Yeah, what's a big deal when it was played at the court of Grand Duke

377
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,880
 Charles Augustus in the Weimar court

378
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,760
 Goethe

379
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,080
 Was like you can't put a dog on a stage like the stages for humans for actors

380
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,400
 You can't put a dog on there and they went no we're gonna do it anyway

381
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,240
 And he's like well if you do it then I'm gonna resign and by the way, I'm Goethe

382
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,360
 So really you've got to hear what I say and they said no we're gonna put it on and so he resigned and he was dismissed from the

383
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:08,120
 Grand Duke's theater just because he didn't want to have this dog on the stage. It's amazing Wow

384
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:16,440
 But Goethe just had a thing against dogs. He did he hates like why is he making such a fuss about this play?

385
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,600
 Just let it go Goethe but sounds like I mean obviously there's Faust where actually

386
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,640
 Metastopheles appears as a poodle at one point

387
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,560
 So that's bad, you know, he's like a demon but then in Goethe's semi-autobiographical novel

388
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:35,160
 There's a play that's disrupted by irresponsible dog owners in another play

389
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,160
 There's a couple of women who bitch about how they dislike dogs so much. He hates he had a thing against dogs

390
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,680
 Is this is this done after this him being fired has he is this revenge dog anger?

391
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,560
 He and the Duke basically the Duke loved dogs and go to hated dogs

392
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,480
 And their whole relationship was them just arguing about whether dogs are awesome or really shit

393
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,880
 It was like that's all they ever talked about

394
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,760
 Wow, they were very close

395
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,200
 It was like the only it was like a marriage where there's just one thing that wedged

396
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,680
 It's driven between you all the times, wasn't it? And that was the dogs dogs can be hard to work with and I come from

397
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,440
 Experience I have worked with a dog. I've worked with a few animals over the years

398
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,740
 But on a show called wrecked where I played an elderly man

399
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:28,080
 I said to them look, I'm not gonna play an older guy. Can I play a young handsome guy and

400
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:35,240
 They said all right, but we're gonna give you a dog. So it was a payoff. Anyway, I'm not a dog person

401
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
 I've said this many times over the years

402
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,200
 But they like you guys didn't listen and so I've got a massive dog

403
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,280
 They gave me a great day like it's the heaviest dog you can imagine and this is in Fiji

404
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,240
 We're shooting it and they said oh, yeah, these are all trained dogs. They're not they're just not wild dogs

405
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,560
 Okay, so they don't have acting dogs in Fiji. So when they say trained they mean, you know

406
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,560
 They know where their bowl is and there's got their name on the bowl. That's about it

407
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,680
 So I've got this ginormous dog sitting on me and I'm supposed to he's like he's meant to be my support dog

408
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:13,280
 Well, anyway, we're on a plane not a real one. It's an acting plane and this dog is on my lap and

409
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,720
 It's 200 pounds and I am is squashing my kahoonies

410
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:25,400
 And it was wanting to go away all the time and the only reason I would be staying on me is that I had to keep feeding it tiny sausages

411
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:34,160
 Anyway push comes to shove which I did do by the way and episode 2 I said to the team

412
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:42,560
 look either the dog goes or I go and the guy gave me a ticket for the plane and I called my lawyers who were also my agents and

413
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,760
 The dog was out on its beautiful hind ass

414
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:54,840
 Yeah, gone gosh, well, what would you rather have me or a massive dog?

415
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,520
 Don't make people answer that. Yeah

416
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,600
 Unfortunately the dog was busy today

417
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
 I

418
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:09,700
 Also worked with ducks, but that's another story. Oh, yeah, are they better to work with?

419
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,760
 They don't crush your balls so badly. I guess they didn't crush my balls

420
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,280
 So we got along quite nicely actually peer and if you watch the movie, it's called love birds

421
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,240
 I actually fall in love with the duck it crash lands on my roof and

422
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,400
 Yeah, we sort of we hang out. There's also a female I'm in love with but the duck does come between us and

423
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,280
 Eventually, I don't want to spoil it, but I've got to let the duck go

424
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:50,560
 That's really sad, you know you was saying about how they didn't like they didn't bring in a professional dog

425
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:58,200
 For your yeah set on your lap and eat your tiny sausage like that is one of the main problems that they have in Hollywood

426
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:04,400
 So there's a guy called Bill Berloni who runs a company called theatrical animals and they have dogs

427
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,320
 And other animals which are specifically trained to be in movies as in they know how to work on movies

428
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,240
 How to work with the lights and the cameras and stuff and they say that 80% of the calls

429
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,940
 They get is where people have decided to put on a show and just use someone's pet or

430
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,360
 Used like a trained animal rather than a properly trained animal and they've decided after about two days

431
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:31,480
 This is not going to work at all, but it's a huge union. You have to use the the acting dogs the acting animals

432
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,600
 You know there's a massive industry, and if you don't use them, then they'll be hell to pay

433
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,040
 I actually did just on stage dogs

434
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,600
 So dog and back to the 19th century dog drama was a really popular thing

435
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,560
 But especially between sort of the 1820s and 1860s in the UK

436
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,480
 Then they were usually short quite bad plays

437
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,080
 But people loved them because they just went to see the dogs perform and they were well trained dogs

438
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,720
 We're not talking any Fiji and bullshit here

439
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,960
 they were so they were trained to do one particular move which was called taking the seas and

440
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,440
 This meant basically as an actor

441
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,400
 You had to have a string of sausages concealed around your neck in a scarf and at one point in the play

442
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,960
 The dog would always the dog would always be trained to leap up to your neck and maul away at the sausages to try and get to

443
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,360
 Them and then you're taken down to the ground and it looks like the dog is tearing away at your neck

444
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:29,280
 Yeah, right very famous move. It was it was used in a very popular play at the time dog Hamlet

445
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:39,360
 The superior version of Hamlet which apparently according to the owner of the most famous dog Hamlet actor

446
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,360
 Who was called devil's hoof? That was the name of the dog

447
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:47,600
 His owner said dog Hamlet was conceived by mistake when Hamlet was being played on stage

448
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:53,080
 And this dog was in the wings and when he saw the wrestling between Claudius and Hamlet at the end

449
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,240
 The dog galloped onto stage and sort of got involved in the fighting and the audience loved it

450
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
 and they weren't well, we've got to make this a thing and

451
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,360
 So dog Hamlet became a thing and the plot of dog Hamlet was basically the same as the plot of Hamlet

452
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,240
 Except there was also always a dog on stage accompanying Hamlet the whole time

453
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:20,920
 In the final scene he got to pin Claudius down while Hamlet killed him. It sounds great

454
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,760
 I don't know why it doesn't get get played at the National Marathon

455
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,200
 One of the reasons that these dog dramas were so popular is because of the licensing act of 1737

456
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,400
 Which basically meant that whenever you wrote a play you had to give it to the law chamberlain

457
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,840
 And they had and he had to check through it and make sure that there was nothing bad in there

458
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
 And it was a real

459
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:46,960
 Ass of a hoop to get through but luckily a dog drama didn't really have any lines apart from bark bark bark

460
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,680
 Or something, you know, they were melodramas

461
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,240
 There was hardly any lines in there at all

462
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,880
 And so they were really easy for people to write and get past the law chamberlain nice

463
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,840
 Yes

464
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:04,320
 The just one last thing is I found a quite nice thing which is that animals used to in Hollywood

465
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:12,640
 Be acknowledged for their contribution to film and TV and there used to be an award ceremony that took place called the Patsy and

466
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,720
 the Patsy

467
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,600
 stood for picture animal top star of the year and

468
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,840
 It ran for a number of years and the very first one was hosted by Ronald Reagan in 1951

469
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,720
 And it's great. It's just nice to look through the list to sort of acknowledge all these incredible animals

470
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,760
 So in the first year animals that were acknowledged were Francis the talking mule

471
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,960
 Black diamond the horse lassie the dog lassie gets its first mention there

472
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:44,320
 But yeah, the Patsy and they stopped doing it and that's a shame because there are a lot of animals in movies that are still

473
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,920
 Given they're all that's interesting to me that they stopped that because they're held in such regard

474
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:57,800
 Especially in the States, you know the these acting animals. So I wonder why yeah, absolutely

475
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,200
 I wonder why

476
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
 they stopped the award

477
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,760
 Ceremony maybe because the animals don't realize they're getting awards

478
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,480
 Yeah, I'm not sure

479
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,560
 I mean the animals don't even realize they're acting

480
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,520
 Are they held in?

481
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,840
 Yeah, it is the big do some of them

482
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,160
 Do they because you look at the such the like lassie for example

483
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,800
 Or the the other famous one can't recall the name but the dog that was in

484
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,520
 Frasier, do you remember that little adi? Oh, yeah, he definitely knew what he was doing

485
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,160
 And the owners and the trainers will tell you they'll come off and they'll

486
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,560
 They'll look at you and they'll be sort of like how do I do how do I do and they'll want to do another

487
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,760
 Take

488
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,560
 Because they they know they've got to run on I've got to do a certain thing and they have to do it in a certain way

489
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,640
 And then they'll come back and they'll get a treat or whatever

490
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,360
 But they know um, they know that this camera is there and especially if they're doing it for years

491
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,080
 so, you know, even though I

492
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,440
 Took the mickey out of the the the dog because I've been working. I have had experience with it. Um, I do

493
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,640
 Uh, acknowledge the work that goes into it. Do you ever see those guys like the duck?

494
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,960
 Do you ever see the duck in like social settings anymore or no?

495
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,760
 Sadly, I have not visited the duck. Um

496
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,600
 Is that is that because the duck's too busy or you're too busy is one of your careers really take off

497
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:28,280
 Look, it's it's an actors thing. We when we leave the film, we leave each other

498
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,720
 It's what you do. It doesn't matter whether you're human or animal

499
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:38,920
 Um, and you might see each other at the awards, you know, not so much now if there's no animal awards, but uh,

500
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,960
 You know the agency christmas do

501
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,360
 You might

502
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:50,520
 Do you get do you get occasional calls from it going risa? So you've been cast in jumanji lots of lots of animal roles in that

503
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,360
 Yeah, look slip a word in I pair. I'd love to work with you

504
00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:00,600
 But as you know these days a lot of them are computer generated. Okay, so you real life animals

505
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,560
 Just of you know, you're a you're a bit of maintenance aren't you?

506
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,560
 Yeah

507
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:14,520
 Wow, hell rude

508
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:25,960
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact

509
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,920
 My fact this week is that while filming return of the jedi in the forests of california

510
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:38,760
 The actor who played chubacca had to be accompanied by crew members in brightly colored vests so that he wasn't shot by bigfoot hunters

511
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,480
 Wow, amazing. Yeah, and this is um for a long time

512
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,080
 This was a sort of a legend of the behind the scenes filming that no one had properly verified

513
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:56,920
 But peter mayhew who sadly passed away last year, uh, who played chubacca in all of the movies right up until the last

514
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,000
 Mayhew not may I isn't it

515
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,960
 Mayhew

516
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,400
 So yeah, so he played chubacca in all the movies including the force awakens

517
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,920
 He sadly passed away and actually um, he was unable to do the one after the force awakens

518
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,880
 What was that one called the last jedi? Um, I think it's called no one cares anymore. Wasn't it?

519
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,440
 Yeah, that might be it

520
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,680
 He um, but he's still consulted. He's in the credits as chubacca consultant and um

521
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,200
 He was on a reddit AMA where he was asked the question and he confirmed that this was the case

522
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,640
 They were in these forests of california, which is a big bigfoot hunting territory

523
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,800
 It is where all the most famous encounters of bigfoot happened in the californian forest

524
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,960
 Bluffs creek is where the most famous footage that we know of the paterson

525
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,400
 Gimlin if you picture bigfoot in your head, that's the footage you're thinking of that happened in a californian forest

526
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,520
 So you can see that there would be slight concern of a giant

527
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,200
 Chewbacca like character walking around that he might be hunted down. So yeah, it's uh, it's what happened also

528
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,840
 Probably grizzly bears do they have them there like they might shoot them because they think is a grizzly bear

529
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,840
 Other than something that doesn't exist

530
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,160
 Okay, so two points there

531
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,400
 no

532
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,520
 Okay, there's no grizzlies in that territory and they do exist

533
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:18,440
 Clearly, okay. In fact, I've got many facts here. How long have you got?

534
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:27,400
 To prove to you guys that they there's an estimated number between two and six thousand of these creatures

535
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,520
 That's one bit of evidence. Yeah in north america

536
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,680
 Okay, they have extreme elusiveness. They have fear of humans. They nocturnally feed

537
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,960
 And they have nomadism. Okay, that is

538
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,280
 Basically they in their groups they migrate they move on the move all the time

539
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,720
 More than 10,000 people in the u.s. Have described encounters with bigfoot over the last 50 years

540
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,600
 And a third of all bigfoot sightings are recorded in the state of oregon risa

541
00:45:54,600 --> 00:46:00,040
 I do see that you're reading this but um, what word did you get these facts from? I was just wondering these are out of my

542
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,760
 007

543
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,960
 Leon kirk bet got me for my birthday. Okay

544
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,120
 So your sources yourself

545
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,920
 I've written their hand written by me. These are facts written by me

546
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:23,400
 Last year 2019 scientists unearthed new evidence of the original bigfoot. Uh, what do you think that is?

547
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,640
 Oh, the giant

548
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,760
 hominid thing is it like chance or something 10 foot tall ape

549
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,120
 Gigantopithecus

550
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,520
 Which they believe is related to the modern day

551
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,440
 orangutan

552
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:42,760
 Um, it's interesting. That's you know, obviously, uh, there are more people who disbelieve in bigfoot than there are people who believe in it

553
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,520
 But the people who do believe that he she might exist

554
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:52,360
 Uh, quite it's quite interesting people like david attenborough has always said he thinks that the yeti for example

555
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:58,760
 Could be a real thing. He's he's said multiple interviews if you look at his career with all that montipython stuff

556
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,240
 Can you really believe that guy?

557
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,360
 He was tarnished a long time ago. You're right. Yeah

558
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:09,560
 The only second tarnish that he has said he's been trying to dust under the couch for a long time

559
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,960
 It's his bigfoot belief

560
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,400
 And here I can't believe i'm saying it but bigfoot is real

561
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,880
 Um on tuebacca

562
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,600
 Okay, there is a star wars comic from 2004 an official star wars comic

563
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:32,760
 Called into the great unknown that says that millennium falcon crashed landed into the earth in the in the pacific northwest

564
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,320
 Before the area was colonized by people and that tuebacca survives

565
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,640
 He kind of is immortal or something and he became the mythical bigfoot

566
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,720
 So maybe tuebacca is bigfoot

567
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,280
 I love this theory. Um, it's also a comic I believe but

568
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:56,680
 Because it makes total sense and you know now he would have to have mated

569
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,720
 But then a population can grow and also it counts

570
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,720
 for the

571
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,720
 spaceship situation

572
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,360
 ancient astronauts for example, so therefore

573
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,400
 Um, extraterrestrials have landed here, which you know, we all know is true as well

574
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,440
 So it does tie in with the bigfoot and ufo

575
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:23,640
 Factor which which I find fascinating and that's why star wars is such a popular documentary

576
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,280
 Exactly. Well everything's based on fact and that is that is a derby quote

577
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:37,240
 It's in the book. It's in the govlo 7 book. It's in here. I wrote it. It's on page four everything

578
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,720
 Have you guys uh recent dan ever been to willow creek or you're familiar with willow creek

579
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,280
 Which I think is sort of the home of bigfoot, isn't it in california?

580
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,120
 It's one of them. Uh familiar with it. Yes. Have not been. No

581
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:56,680
 Because it's kind of amazing how well they do like the the willow creek museum apparently rakes in $500 a day

582
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:02,280
 Which for a microscopic museum in a microscopic place in the middle of nowhere is a lot of money

583
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,720
 A lot of people seem to go to this place the entry fee is $500

584
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,720
 [Laughter]

585
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,440
 Right

586
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,440
 It's amazing and it's you every day, isn't it?

587
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:18,680
 There's another museum. There's a sasquatch museum in georgia in cherry log georgia

588
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:25,320
 And they it's called expedition bigfoot and one of their main things they have is a buttocks imprint of the sasquatch

589
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:32,840
 So apparently the sasquatch I know about that one. Oh, do you? Okay. Well, I don't I mean it's a it's a plaster cast, isn't it?

590
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,320
 Yeah, so it it they left an apple out and the sasquatch came in the middle of the night and it

591
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,200
 uh because they're nocturnal and

592
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:49,400
 It went to grab the apple but it didn't go right up to it because it so it sort of actually lent down and on its

593
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,440
 On its buttocks on the on the on the unfortunately

594
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,400
 I think it was muddy ground and reached over and got it and

595
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,720
 Took off and left an imprint. Yeah, and they've got that whole cast and they did the cast

596
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,520
 Yeah, it's a famous one and according to jeff muldrim professor of anthropology at the university of idaho

597
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:11,720
 It has obviously prominent buttocks that are well muscled and the hair streams downwards and inwards towards the natal cleft

598
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:18,440
 If anyone wants to know what a bigfoot butt looks like. Yeah, and I've got a tattoo of a natal cleft

599
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:25,080
 On my right shoulder blade, so delighted. This isn't a visual medium

600
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,560
 Underneath that it says everything's based on fact

601
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:36,440
 So this this podcast is obviously broken now

602
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:45,320
 The very famous footage that I was mentioning before that we all know the paterson kimlin footage

603
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:52,680
 Yeah, those guys those guys are very interesting. So bob kimlin is the surviving one of the two. Um, he's in his 80s

604
00:50:53,320 --> 00:51:00,760
 And he and you've met himries, which is so interesting because he wasn't a bigfoot hunter. He was uh, he was basically

605
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,920
 A um daredevil to an extent. He used to ride

606
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,320
 Yeah, he was a stuntman and he used to write carts through the canyons

607
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,400
 He was courted by evil keneval to be part of his daredeviline team

608
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:19,240
 And that was going to be his whole career and then he was filming this thing with paterson where they were actually

609
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,480
 Filming a movie about someone else's account about these eight men in california

610
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:31,400
 When they suddenly found bigfoot and took this footage and for 35 odd years afterwards kimlin's life was effectively ruined because no one believed them

611
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:37,560
 What they were saying his wife used to get teased at her workplace and constantly people would be revving up to their house

612
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:42,120
 Saying let's go bigfoot, you know drunk people and then I think it was in the early 2000s

613
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,600
 He decided to show up to a conference where suddenly he was met as if he were a god

614
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,120
 And it was only then that his life turned around and it's interesting that just in those 35 years

615
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:57,880
 He didn't break him down the sort of the what it did to his life that he sort of admitted it to a being a hoax

616
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,400
 He's always stuck by his guns. Yeah. Oh, that's nice. He found his people

617
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,880
 Yeah, exactly because when when they got the footage

618
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,240
 Paterson was a bit of a showman and took it around everywhere

619
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,720
 But gimlin didn't really want to have anything to do with that

620
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:17,400
 He just wanted to look after his horses and stuff. And so paterson hired someone to pretend he was bob kimlin

621
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,400
 No, really and they massively fell out. I mean, this is what I read

622
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:27,560
 I don't Reese might know this but like yeah, they massively fell out and it was only towards the end of paterson's life that they kind of made up

623
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:32,840
 Um, in fact when paterson went around with this cousin, I think who's called the atley

624
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,160
 They were making so much money that they did the classic thing of at the end of each night

625
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,440
 They would go back to the hotel room and have money fights where they threw money at each other because they were making so much

626
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:47,720
 The flip side to that is while paterson is having these money parties throwing them around the room

627
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:54,120
 Gimlin sold the rights to the footage to a fellow bigfoot researcher for ten american dollars. Wow

628
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:59,320
 That's yeah, that's all he made for me. You've got to get that in tiny denominations to make a good money

629
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:07,320
 I was reading about what scientists thought of this film. There's a guy called john napier

630
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,920
 Who's like a big bigfoot?

631
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:14,600
 Scientist and I think kind of a kind of fair on both sides as far as I was reading it anyway

632
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:20,200
 And he thought that he was quite struck by the way that the bigfoot walks in a really exaggerated way

633
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,400
 And he says why ruin a good hoax by ordering an actor to walk in such an artificial way

634
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,560
 Sorry, how how many times more silly is the bigfoot walk?

635
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:35,800
 Yeah, there's an there was an anthropologist called daniel schmitt who said on this

636
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,920
 He said either this is a person trying to walk funny or bigfoot walks in a manner that is more or less

637
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,460
 identical to a person walking funny

638
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:47,240
 And let's not forget it has breasts

639
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,720
 Let's not forget that

640
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:53,160
 Yeah, because yeah, why would you put a put?

641
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,120
 Breasts on a on a fake bigfoot suit. You know give you that extra

642
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:04,120
 Moment of difficulty to to get that accurate in terms of its movement and you know go to those troubles

643
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,080
 There's there's you know, I'm not here to to scientifically

644
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,480
 Prove and argue this case, but you know, there's if you do want to dive into it listeners

645
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,280
 Please cross over live now

646
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,720
 my podcast the cryptid factor which

647
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:22,440
 You'll absolutely enjoy. It's also it's visual. It's not just audio

648
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,720
 Although we're not we haven't got the visuals up yet, but uh, it's like this is less facts

649
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,720
 I can't believe our podcast has been one long advert for the cryptid factor

650
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,400
 We're not putting this out. We need listeners

651
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,480
 Can I ask and I can't I can't even believe I'm going down this road. What am I doing?

652
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,840
 I hate myself

653
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,360
 But if that presumably there are male big feet as well

654
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,360
 Because if it's just female, how are they breeding or do the males also have breasts?

655
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,200
 How is that working?

656
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:55,160
 Yeah, it's this male and this female and this youth and people have seen all three

657
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,560
 Okay, so it's not just females that people know it just so happens in this footage

658
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:03,960
 Bigfoot in this footage is actually called patty. Just a little nugget there

659
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,400
 Patty the big foot is the name that's given to her

660
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,080
 The big foot research organization

661
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,640
 Go out and they do expeditions every year

662
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,960
 Maybe four times a year and you can sign up if you go on the bfro website

663
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,600
 you can be part of an expedition to

664
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:28,680
 Try and find these things and quite often almost every time they will at least hear the howls in the forest and

665
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,200
 You know, it's it's it's well worth your time

666
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,760
 But I mean that's a matter of opinion

667
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:40,600
 Look you can either do that or go and watch dogs on stage. It's up to you

668
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:46,760
 Can I just I know it seems totally unrelated, but can I say something about the yesi which I found really amazing

669
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,960
 It's very related. Yeah. Well, you know, I don't know if the big foot

670
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:55,720
 Fans hate yetis or whatever. But so the yesi is obviously this of nepali's equivalent of bigfoot

671
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:01,480
 So it's yesi an abominable snowman are himalayas bigfoot sasquatch. They're north america and

672
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,120
 A yesi finger

673
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:12,200
 Was once smuggled out of napal by my personal favorite actor jimmy stewart. That's right. It's it's an insane story

674
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,720
 Where did he smuggle it? What put where did he put it? Why did he put this finger?

675
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,280
 No

676
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:34,920
 Now see that would have worked so much better if you guys had video because

677
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,760
 Can I just say I put a finger right up? We used to have our own tv show and every time you say this would work

678
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,320
 Well in video. It's a dugger to our hearts

679
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:49,640
 Oh, I'm so sorry. And also if there are any bbz commissioners listening, they're going. Thank god. We definitely did the right thing

680
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:55,000
 Yeah, you're here next week. Okay. You've you guys you've got the visual show, but you're gonna have to have restabi

681
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,160
 That's

682
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:02,440
 That's gonna be about bigfoot. No, we got decommissioned by attenborough. Interestingly. Yeah, he came back

683
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,760
 Just for one off decommission

684
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,560
 I can't believe that guy. I know so many cock-ups in that career

685
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:15,320
 Anna, can I ask what happened with um, did you say jimmy stewart? What happened with his um with his yeti finger?

686
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,040
 Where is it now and the finger? Well, thank you for asking james

687
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:25,640
 So this basically started when there was a yeti hand apparently that was in a nepali's monastery in the 1950s and

688
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,920
 Basically, there was a guy who had a great name at this huge oil magnate called tom slick

689
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:35,640
 Very cool name for someone who's made wealthy from oil and he organized this

690
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,120
 expedition of scientists to go and basically get the yeti hand

691
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,760
 And so this guy was sent out to get it. He was called peter burn. He was an explorer

692
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:52,760
 And a british scientist had given him a human finger to swap with the yeti finger with one of the yeti fingers on this hand

693
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,840
 So he got into this monastery

694
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,440
 It's a bit up in the air whether he got permission from the monks or whether he just stole it

695
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,440
 But essentially he hacked off the yeti finger replaced it with this human finger

696
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,400
 Wow stole we're falling on the side of stolen

697
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:12,120
 But then it happened that he was mates with james stewart and james stewart's wife gloria who happened to be in the area

698
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,400
 And so he said i'm so sorry guys, but you might heard you're going to the uk

699
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,040
 Would you mind taking this yeti finger back with you?

700
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:23,240
 And they did and they they smuggled it out in gloria jimmy stewart's wife's

701
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,000
 lingerie case, which i actually didn't even know that was a thing

702
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:33,480
 But apparently no one searches lingerie cases. In fact, they asked at customs at the other end in britain

703
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,560
 You know, did what did you open the lingerie case and the customs official said no, of course not

704
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,960
 We'd never open a lady's lingerie case

705
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:45,240
 So I should say that they have done analysis on this finger, which was kept in the hunt area museum

706
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:49,400
 They've done some analysis recently and it is in fact just a human finger turns out

707
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,880
 A call he swapped it back. He swapped it back

708
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:56,920
 There's always a response, isn't there? That's the good thing about this kind of thing

709
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,560
 Because yes, because now

710
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,280
 Jimmy stewart or

711
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,040
 Tom slick has the actual yeti hand and of course if you've got that that finger

712
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:13,080
 You're not going to divulge that information. That's up in your in your glass cabinet up on the third floor near the landing

713
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,480
 By your big foot books

714
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:22,920
 I love her respectful james and ana are big to you reese if I said this i'd get fucking murdered

715
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,720
 Oh, yeah, but don't forget who edits this thing

716
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:31,800
 I'd like to get a copy of all the things that I said that don't end up in the show

717
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,360
 I'll throw them on my show. Okay. That's just that's going to be all the things. Yeah, I'm sorry

718
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,120
 There's a limit on the size of fire I could send

719
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:47,240
 Okay, that's it that is all of our facts

720
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,680

01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,000

749
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,880
 Are you talking to me? I am yeah
