00:00:06,00:00:10,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish!"
00:00:10,00:00:14,"Before we start, a little bit of news that is very important to Anna and I, and"
00:00:14,00:00:18,that is that our new book is finally out in
00:00:18,00:00:23,"paperback! Woohoo! I know that might not seem like a big deal to you,"
00:00:23,00:00:27,but honestly this is a real chance for us to get more people
00:00:27,00:00:31,reading this book. One very interesting thing to say is
00:00:31,00:00:35,that the book has had a name change. What used to be called
00:00:35,00:00:38,"""Everything to Play For"" is now called ""A Load of Old"
00:00:38,00:00:44,"Balls - The QI History of Sport"" by James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski. A lot of people"
00:00:44,00:00:46,"have said to us, ""Why did you not call it that in the first place?"""
00:00:46,00:00:50,"I'm not sure if they're being rude, I hope not, because it is a book"
00:00:50,00:00:55,full of the most interesting facts and stories about sport you can possibly
00:00:55,00:00:58,"imagine. Even if you're not into sport, probably this"
00:00:58,00:01:02,"summer you will notice that everyone's off watching the Euros, everyone's off"
00:01:02,00:01:05,watching the Olympics. Perhaps you don't really have much to say
00:01:05,00:01:08,"to those people when it comes up at a dinner party,"
00:01:08,00:01:12,we'll read our book and you will be the pinnacle of all sporting knowledge and
00:01:12,00:01:16,"all quite interesting sporting knowledge at that. As you imagine from me and Anna,"
00:01:16,00:01:22,"it's just full of silly stories, fun facts. We spent so much time doing loads of"
00:01:22,00:01:25,in-depth research in there that even if you are the kind of person who's
00:01:25,00:01:28,"watching every single sporting event this summer, there will be loads of stuff"
00:01:28,00:01:32,in there that you didn't know. So if you go to anywhere where you would
00:01:32,00:01:36,"normally buy your books, then look for a load of old balls,"
00:01:36,00:01:40,"the QI History of Sport or search for our names, James Harkin and Anna"
00:01:40,00:01:44,"Tyshinski and you will find that book. Please do buy it, it would"
00:01:44,00:01:48,"mean the world to us if you did. Of course we're going on tour, don't forget"
00:01:48,00:01:54,"that people in Scotland, Wales, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia"
00:01:54,00:01:58,do get your tickets very very soon. A lot of them are sold out. I know we've got
00:01:58,00:02:01,quite a few tickets left for the Scottish Dates in Edinburgh
00:02:01,00:02:06,and Glasgow and I think quite a few for the show in Cardiff.
00:02:06,00:02:10,So if you're in any of those cities then do get your tickets
00:02:10,00:02:14,but actually you know go to gnosisthingsthefish.com/live and you will
00:02:14,00:02:17,see all of the dates where we're playing and hopefully one of them will be
00:02:17,00:02:21,near you. Okay not much more to say apart from
00:02:21,00:02:23,on with the podcast.
00:02:42,00:02:48,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:02:48,00:02:52,coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Shriver and
00:02:52,00:02:56,"sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin and"
00:02:56,00:02:59,once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite
00:02:59,00:03:02,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order
00:03:02,00:03:06,here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is my fact.
00:03:06,00:03:10,My fact this week is that snooker games on cruise ships
00:03:10,00:03:14,are sometimes played with flat balls.
00:03:14,00:03:18,"Are we talking about the balls on the table, are they?"
00:03:18,00:03:23,The men playing. Yeah this is this is obvious when you think about it.
00:03:23,00:03:26,Oh it's so obvious. It's so obvious when you think about it. I don't really know
00:03:26,00:03:29,how you could place a nooker on a cruise ship with a ball-shaped ball
00:03:29,00:03:31,actually on a rough cruise ship. We'll get to that in a
00:03:31,00:03:35,sec because you can and there's a pretty awesome way that you do that but
00:03:35,00:03:39,this I got from a book that's written by an Australian comedian called Hung Lee.
00:03:39,00:03:42,It's called The Crappiest Refugee. He tells the story of
00:03:42,00:03:46,from immigrant boat to cruise ship comedian. Anyway he wrote this book and
00:03:46,00:03:50,inside the book he mentions that he's seeing a bunch of guys playing on a
00:03:50,00:03:54,pool table or a snooker table and they are hitting with puck-like objects
00:03:54,00:03:57,because obviously in the rough seas the balls are going to be rolling around
00:03:57,00:04:01,and so there will be cruise ships out there that have these tables on them.
00:04:01,00:04:05,"And the idea I think is like you know air hockey, it's those kind of like"
00:04:05,00:04:08,"puck things, isn't it? Exactly. Now to your point Anna,"
00:04:08,00:04:12,"a modern day cruise ship does have pool tables or snooker tables,"
00:04:12,00:04:15,"billiards, but they use gyroscopic technology."
00:04:15,00:04:19,What? So it's amazing. No. It's honestly I've watched videos of it online.
00:04:19,00:04:23,It's so cool because basically while the rest of the ship is moving
00:04:23,00:04:26,the pool table isn't. That's insane. That's the top of the pool table.
00:04:26,00:04:30,That's a high-end cruise ship. It is incredible.
00:04:30,00:04:34,I've read stories of people finding it so fascinating that like staring to fire
00:04:34,00:04:37,sometimes people will just go and sit and watch it as it doesn't sway.
00:04:37,00:04:40,There's even stories of crew members that when they get particularly sick
00:04:40,00:04:45,they'll go and sleep on the pool table because the seasickness is getting to
00:04:45,00:04:47,them. It's not moving so you can have a restful night.
00:04:47,00:04:51,"Which begs the question, why isn't every bed on a boat gyroscopic?"
00:04:51,00:04:53,Probably price. Cost. Yeah.
00:04:53,00:04:56,How good is the correction mechanism? Like if you have a Titanic situation
00:04:56,00:04:59,how long can you continue with your game of snooker?
00:04:59,00:05:02,So it goes vertical. I see that.
00:05:02,00:05:05,So I met someone who was a dancer on cruise ships for a while.
00:05:05,00:05:07,This sounds like a good anecdote.
00:05:07,00:05:11,She did the musicals because they often have a theatre on board and
00:05:11,00:05:15,sometimes a show and she said that the most difficult one she'd ever done
00:05:15,00:05:18,was Starlight Express where you're on roller skates.
00:05:18,00:05:22,She said in rough weather you would set off across the stage and you didn't
00:05:22,00:05:25,know how soon you were going to arrive because it might be that you caught
00:05:25,00:05:28,the ship moved with you and suddenly you're there for half a second
00:05:28,00:05:32,or you're going against it and you just roll backwards.
00:05:32,00:05:36,So yeah snooker. It's a good sport. Mostly not played at sea.
00:05:36,00:05:40,Largely it's a land-based game isn't it? A land lovers game.
00:05:40,00:05:43,I did watch a tiktok yesterday just coincidentally of people playing on the
00:05:43,00:05:45,beach that looked really cool. Snooker.
00:05:45,00:05:48,It was pool actually but they kind of dug holes
00:05:48,00:05:52,for the pockets and then we just hit the bowls. Oh so they played on actual sand?
00:05:52,00:05:55,Yeah yeah. There's no facts to this but it did look pretty cool.
00:05:55,00:05:59,I'm amazed that snooker in any form has made it to tiktok because snooker is
00:05:59,00:06:02,famously quite a long game to watch. Tiktok is not a long format.
00:06:02,00:06:08,"Andy honestly if you could see my tiktok it's just snooker, golf, cricket."
00:06:08,00:06:12,It's the dullest tiktok because he just suggests things that you like doesn't
00:06:12,00:06:15,it and it just works out what you like. I reckon if you were on tiktok which I
00:06:15,00:06:19,bet you're not but you would just get moss video after moss video.
00:06:19,00:06:22,Yeah that sounds very economic. It's amazing how it works.
00:06:22,00:06:25,But it is very slow isn't it? It's all rather it takes a long time.
00:06:25,00:06:29,You play lots of frames in the course of a match and it's interesting
00:06:29,00:06:33,because for anyone who doesn't follow snooker only one person is playing at a time.
00:06:33,00:06:36,That's weird. Will you play a frame right?
00:06:36,00:06:40,Well no. You play until you mess up and then the other guy gets to have a go.
00:06:40,00:06:44,But whoever your opponent is they have to stay in their chair.
00:06:44,00:06:47,They just stay in their chair watching you and you could be playing for hours if
00:06:47,00:06:50,you don't make a mistake. It's just psychological torture.
00:06:50,00:06:53,Are there any other games which are like that where I know tennis you're only
00:06:53,00:06:58,playing when your opponent is not playing. But usually it's quite soon before you're playing again
00:06:58,00:07:02,isn't it? I don't know actually but that is one of the main things about snooker is the
00:07:02,00:07:06,psychological angle of it. Although Ronnie O'Sullivan said he likes it
00:07:06,00:07:09,obviously because he's always going to be um Ronnie O'Sullivan.
00:07:09,00:07:12,Who's Ronnie O'Sullivan? I think he's a famous snooker player.
00:07:12,00:07:16,I would say Ronnie O'Sullivan and Don Bradman are the only two people.
00:07:16,00:07:18,I don't know what James thinks about this but who have excelled everyone else so
00:07:18,00:07:23,much in their sport that it's like whoa. So Ronnie O'Sullivan is the best snooker player ever.
00:07:23,00:07:27,And he hates the fact that it's so slow for instance because he's this
00:07:27,00:07:33,mercurial crazy character with an amazing history and he likes snooker to be super fast.
00:07:33,00:07:35,So I think he's got pretty much all the records for fastest break.
00:07:35,00:07:39,But yeah he's amazing and he's got such an interesting history.
00:07:39,00:07:44,His dad went to prison for murder when I think Ronnie was about 16.
00:07:44,00:07:48,Yeah he was a millionaire though so even though his dad went to prison for murder
00:07:48,00:07:54,he was from a very affluent background because his dad ran a lingerie shop or something like that.
00:07:54,00:07:58,I believe he may have called them lingerie shops in the newspaper ads when I think they were sex
00:07:58,00:08:05,shops. I mean potatoes and potatoes. You say potato I say vibrator.
00:08:05,00:08:11,Yeah so I think some of the other snooker players who came from
00:08:11,00:08:15,less affluent backgrounds kind of point to that and say you know we're working class but Ronnie
00:08:15,00:08:19,actually was quite rich when he was growing up. Interesting because he was heavily embedded
00:08:19,00:08:24,"probably in that gang culture a bit. It was one of the Cray Brothers, the third Cray Brothers"
00:08:24,00:08:27,driver who he murdered in a nightclub I think. Oh sorry the third Cray Brother.
00:08:27,00:08:30,Yeah I didn't know there was a third Cray but you hear about the Cray Twins.
00:08:30,00:08:32,I know he was very much the... It's like the third Chuckle Brother.
00:08:32,00:08:37,Yeah he and the third Cray Brother must have given each other a ride look sometimes across
00:08:37,00:08:41,the Eastern clubs. They both have that picture of Bramwell Bronte in their house.
00:08:41,00:08:50,Imagine a joke that has to craze the Chuckle Brothers and Bramwell Bronte in it.
00:08:50,00:08:53,We've got the Jonas Brothers as well. They've got the extra brother who's called Bonus Jonas
00:08:53,00:08:57,who is the one that just isn't in the band and does his own thing all the time.
00:08:57,00:09:05,Bonus Jonas. Snooker's got fairly sort of poshish sort of foundations doesn't it because it was
00:09:05,00:09:10,"invented by supposedly, this is the big story, by Neville Chamberlain, not the Prime Minister,"
00:09:10,00:09:17,but apparently a cousin. The reports are a bit dodgy but apparently he was in India in the 1800s
00:09:17,00:09:22,and he basically incorporated two existing games. There was one called Blackpool and there was
00:09:22,00:09:27,another which was called Pyramid and so one was played entirely with red balls and that was in
00:09:27,00:09:31,a pyramid shape so he goes 'I will love the pyramid shape' and then the other one had all the other
00:09:31,00:09:36,"colour balls in it and he brought that over, smashed them into one big game with the pyramid"
00:09:36,00:09:40,and then just kept yelling 'Snooker' at people as they were playing and by the end of the game
00:09:40,00:09:43,he'd called everyone 'Snooker' and so it stuck. Why did you call someone what did it mean? Did it
00:09:43,00:09:49,"mean dickhead? I think it was a sort of term for an idiot, someone who was incompetent at whatever"
00:09:49,00:09:54,"task they were doing, a rookie. I see. It is weird though because he said he invented it in 1875."
00:09:54,00:10:00,He only said that in 1938 which is a substantial amount of time later that's what.
00:10:00,00:10:06,63 years later. 63 years later and he was an army officer already when he invented this
00:10:06,00:10:11,so he must be knocking on but the claim was accepted and I think it's sort of widely accepted
00:10:11,00:10:16,"that that's where it comes from but also the other weird thing about Snooker, that name thing you"
00:10:16,00:10:20,"were saying Dan, is so if you snooker someone is it that I need to hit a red next but I'm behind the"
00:10:20,00:10:27,yellow or whatever? Precisely. So that is unusual as well because it's a move in the game where you've
00:10:27,00:10:31,"messed things up for someone else. Yeah. Which is, is that in Croquet like that?"
00:10:31,00:10:36,"It's a bit like that, you croquet and croquet someone. I think there is a connection between"
00:10:36,00:10:42,Croquet and Snooker really. I think Snooker kind of grew out of Croquet like games. Yeah. And that's
00:10:42,00:10:47,why the that's why the table's green because it was like originally played on grass. Right.
00:10:47,00:10:53,"The bays. The bays, yeah. Which has, has to have, do you know the difference between the bays"
00:10:53,00:10:59,in Snooker and pool? I got a bit too into table makeup. Is it the nap? Yeah. I'm just going to
00:10:59,00:11:05,"almost disqualify you from answering this question, James. I thought disclosure, I am very much into"
00:11:05,00:11:09,snooze. Yeah. You're not allowed to answer any more quiz questions in this section. What's the
00:11:09,00:11:16,nap? So the nap is the way that the kind of hairs on the substance that the table is made of bend.
00:11:16,00:11:20,So basically in Snooker you have to have a nap and that means that it's a little bit like if you
00:11:20,00:11:24,"imagine a velvet surface. In fact, if you look at those cushions over there. I'm having a nap"
00:11:24,00:11:31,"listening to this. Andy, this is fascinating stuff. Sorry, sorry. Go, go, go. Okay. You look"
00:11:31,00:11:34,at those cushions over there. They're velvety. You stroke them one way and they look smooth. You
00:11:34,00:11:38,"stroke them the other way and they look rough. Oh, okay. Yeah. And that's like a snooker table."
00:11:38,00:11:41,It has to have that effect and it really affects how the ball travels because as you can imagine
00:11:41,00:11:45,"if the little hairs, fibres are standing up a certain way and depending on the angle at which"
00:11:45,00:11:49,"is hitting them, you really have to work with the nap. So if you aim for a shot in the middle"
00:11:49,00:11:54,"pocket, you have to aim slightly outside the pocket because the nap will make it naturally"
00:11:54,00:11:57,bend towards the pocket. That's so interesting. So part of the gameplay is literally getting
00:11:57,00:12:01,"your face close to the table and seeing how the nap is looking. No, it's always the same."
00:12:01,00:12:06,"Yeah, it's always the same. Well, I actually read in a really furious blog that a man who"
00:12:06,00:12:10,"has heard of people who install their own tables putting the nap on back to front,"
00:12:10,00:12:13,which is obviously an absolute disaster. Doesn't it just go the other way then? Or do you mean
00:12:13,00:12:18,"upside down? No, I think he means it goes the other way. So it will go slow and it should go"
00:12:18,00:12:21,fast. But you would be used to it. Like you would be very much used to it being one way.
00:12:21,00:12:27,"Yeah, I've got a question. Are you allowed to comb the table before the get before your pot?"
00:12:27,00:12:32,"So before every frame, before every frame? Yeah, probably someone will come on and give the table"
00:12:32,00:12:37,"a quick comb. And also you are allowed to kind of flatten it. If you see a bit come up a little bit,"
00:12:37,00:12:42,"you are allowed to flatten it. Mid game. Yeah, mid shot, like not mid shot, but just before your"
00:12:42,00:12:46,"shot you're allowed to. Like a bit of the rugs rocked up. Yeah, you're just smoothing it out."
00:12:46,00:12:53,"Mid shot would be like curling, wouldn't it? Yeah. That would be a game. So actually,"
00:12:53,00:12:56,Snooker isn't played on a Snooker table. He's played on a Billiards table.
00:12:56,00:13:01,What? Because Billiards was invented before it and then Snooker was played on the Billiards
00:13:01,00:13:04,table and we still call it a Billiards table rather than a Snooker table officially.
00:13:04,00:13:08,So what gets played on a Snooker table? There's no such thing. There's no such thing as a
00:13:08,00:13:12,"Snooker table. Well, it's just another word for a Billiards table, I guess. Right. That's great."
00:13:12,00:13:16,And what's Billiards? So Billiards is a game where you have three balls only on the table
00:13:16,00:13:20,and the rules say you get a point by either potting one of the balls
00:13:20,00:13:24,"or by hitting one ball onto the other. Right. And then if you get a point, you get another go."
00:13:24,00:13:28,And you get another go and another go and another go until you stop getting points and then your
00:13:28,00:13:33,"opponent comes on the table. Okay. So a bit like Snooker, your opponent sat there for quite a long"
00:13:33,00:13:40,"time just watching you play. Yeah. But in 1907, a new technique was discovered where, you know,"
00:13:40,00:13:45,the pockets in Snooker where the ball goes into. Yeah. What this guy called Walter Lovejoy
00:13:45,00:13:51,managed to do was to get two balls stuck in the pocket. And so he could just tap these two balls
00:13:51,00:13:54,"every time and they would always hit the cushion or hit each other. Oh, wow. And he could do that"
00:13:54,00:14:01,again and again and again and again. And there was a game a bit later between Tom Chapman and Tom
00:14:01,00:14:10,"Reese where Tom Reese managed to score 499,135 points by using this technique over 85 hours of 49"
00:14:10,00:14:17,"minutes. Wow. Oh, what a tedious person. Is it illegal now as a technique or? It's illegal as"
00:14:17,00:14:23,a technique. And also like this record was never in the record books because all of the fans went
00:14:23,00:14:29,"home, the referee went home and even his opponent went home. Wow. That's so good. I worry about"
00:14:29,00:14:33,this guy's home life. It sounds like you didn't have much to go back to. I think it's great.
00:14:33,00:14:37,I didn't know the pocket Billiards was real. I thought it was a vulgar euphemism all my life and
00:14:37,00:14:42,actually it's a proper game. And what is it? It's just a smaller version of Billiards. Oh.
00:14:42,00:14:46,Or it's slang for messing around with yourself. I would stop playing pocket Billiards is what
00:14:46,00:14:51,"you'd say to someone. Yeah. If they were masturbating in public. Yeah, right. Okay."
00:14:51,00:14:56,Just don't get them mixed up. That's how I say it. I thought I was getting away with it all this
00:14:56,00:15:06,"time. I think I'm playing Billiards. Oh, dear."
00:15:06,00:15:18,Okay. It is time for fact number two and that is Anna. My fact this week is that one of the major
00:15:18,00:15:25,battles in the Cold War was to see who was better at squashing metal. Was it to get rid of the iron
00:15:25,00:15:32,"curtain? Brilliant. Oh, my God. Lovely. This is the heavy press program, which sounds kind of like"
00:15:32,00:15:37,"a raunchy sexual program, but it wasn't. You get turned on by very different things to me, Anna."
00:15:37,00:15:44,"No, I'm with Anna. It's coming around to my place for heavy press. I don't know. No,"
00:15:44,00:15:46,I'm just going to say I'll do some pocket Billiards.
00:15:46,00:15:54,The heavy press program was launched by the US in response to the fact that the USSR in the
00:15:54,00:16:01,"1950s, it believed, had got very good at squashing metal. And the good thing about squashing metal"
00:16:01,00:16:06,is that it was a much better way of making airplanes. So it meant that you could put a huge
00:16:06,00:16:12,ingot into a machine and squash it into the shape you wanted for a big bit of wing or something.
00:16:12,00:16:16,"And that would mean that it would be a lighter aircraft, that if you just nailed together lots"
00:16:16,00:16:19,"and lots of little bits, which is how you were making planes. I've seen images of this thing and"
00:16:19,00:16:24,"it's so impressive. It's a ginormous structure, the one in America that we're going to get onto,"
00:16:24,00:16:28,"which is a very famous one called the 50. You say it's very famous, but I think it's only known"
00:16:28,00:16:32,because there's this one guy who's just written a series of amazing articles about it. It's one in
00:16:32,00:16:37,"the Atlantic and other in the New York Times, who's just really into it. And that was in Cleveland,"
00:16:37,00:16:42,Ohio. It still exists today. So I think that they made 10 machines in the US and they made four
00:16:42,00:16:47,"pressing machines, whether you squash metal and six extrusion machines, where you squeeze it like"
00:16:47,00:16:53,"toothpaste. Wow. And I think eight of them are still going today. It's nuts. At the moment,"
00:16:53,00:16:57,"every single US military aircraft contains bits made by this 50 machine. By this one machine,"
00:16:57,00:17:02,"yeah. I mean, these are built in the 50s. They're still going today. The engineers of the 50 think"
00:17:02,00:17:08,it's going to be going in total for about 110 years. Can I add squires called the 50? I think it
00:17:08,00:17:13,"was because it would exert 50,000 tons of compressive force, which is the equivalent of being able"
00:17:13,00:17:20,"to lift up 500 blue whales. Wow. And it's massive. It's 87 meters high, so it looks huge. It's so"
00:17:20,00:17:26,"cool. Honestly, this really awoke something in me, this machine. This really brought my inner"
00:17:26,00:17:32,Clarkson to the fore. It's just really the most amazing machine in the world. It's just so cool.
00:17:32,00:17:36,It is. I think it's the size and the majesty of them. And there are lots of them. So there are
00:17:36,00:17:40,"those in the US. And then, well, as I said, in the Cold War, the reason it became a fight was"
00:17:40,00:17:44,because Germany was actually the best at making them. So Germany had all this technology in the
00:17:44,00:17:49,Second World War for pressing metal that no one else had. And as part of the agreement after the
00:17:49,00:17:56,"Second World War, we divided things up. And the USSR got their biggest heavy press. So they got the"
00:17:56,00:18:02,"30,000 pressing machine, 30,000 tonne pressing machine, whereas I think America only got about"
00:18:02,00:18:06,"10,000 tonne one. And I ended up reading all of these CIA documents, spying on how Russia was"
00:18:06,00:18:10,"using them and saying, what are they doing with this thing? They're incredibly boring, aside from"
00:18:10,00:18:15,"the word secret at the top. But yeah, they had to transport it back in four specially made train"
00:18:15,00:18:20,"carriages from Germany to the USSR. But yeah, America were like, oh no, they've got this now."
00:18:20,00:18:25,We'll have to make a big one. But it's all and it's partly it all partly relates back to the
00:18:25,00:18:30,"First World War, right? So in the First World War, again, lots of post-war reparations, Treaty"
00:18:30,00:18:34,of Versailles took a lot of things away from Germany. And there was a shortage of various
00:18:34,00:18:38,key materials for the German economy and for the armaments and all this. So they developed the
00:18:38,00:18:42,"technique of press forging, which is where you press down on the diet just because it's more"
00:18:42,00:18:47,efficient. And the one thing they'd been allowed to keep or one of the things they were allowed
00:18:47,00:18:52,"to keep was their magnesium, right? The Allied power said we're not interested in your magnesium,"
00:18:52,00:18:56,so you can have that. But the problem is that the previous method of forging things is basically
00:18:56,00:19:01,"big hammer, smashes down, smashes up. Does it not explode if you hit magnesium?"
00:19:01,00:19:06,"If you put it, I think you put water on it, isn't it? But it does crack. It doesn't forge well"
00:19:06,00:19:12,under the current forging conditions. And that's why Germany invented the technique of press forging
00:19:12,00:19:16,because they were working with the materials they had and also they had to be as efficient as possible.
00:19:16,00:19:22,"So once again, shot yourselves in the foot with Versailles, didn't you, allies? But then actually,"
00:19:22,00:19:27,"in playing the long game, you got the technology back. So sort of a nice score draw for the Treaty"
00:19:27,00:19:32,"of Versailles. I think that's right, yes. I think the Treaty of Versailles is a foe of the podcast"
00:19:32,00:19:39,"because we give it a right kick in this show, don't we? True. The highest pressure ever achieved"
00:19:39,00:19:45,"is 770 gigapascals, which is more than twice the pressure in the inner core of the earth."
00:19:45,00:19:50,"Okay. Yeah. What did we do it for? Well, it's just scientists in it."
00:19:50,00:19:56,"They wanted to see what happens if you squash osmium really, really, really a lot."
00:19:56,00:20:01,And who's he? Richard Osmium. He's the Roman Richard Osmium.
00:20:01,00:20:06,"It's the chemical element osmium and they really, really squashed it with all this pressure"
00:20:06,00:20:11,"and they found out that it does not change its crystal structure. Wow. Well, sometimes you're"
00:20:11,00:20:16,going to go through that experiment to find out. It's as important to find out nothing as to find
00:20:16,00:20:22,"out something. I wonder if it's especially tough osmium or is it especially dense? Okay, that's"
00:20:22,00:20:28,"cool. Surely. Otherwise, it seems silly if it's just. We'll start off by squashing a flump and see."
00:20:30,00:20:38,"The biggest press now, I don't think get much press. It's in Vienna and it's made by an Italian"
00:20:38,00:20:46,company who would have thought. Not me. I don't see any reason why the Italians would be good at
00:20:46,00:20:50,"pressing. I suppose most industrial things like that are Russia and China, sometimes America,"
00:20:50,00:20:54,and they do have the other big ones. But an Italian company have made it in Vienna and it's
00:20:54,00:21:01,called Tyson. Is it to make lasagna sheets? It is. They can make a meatball that is as dense as the sun.
00:21:01,00:21:10,"And yeah, that exerts 100,000 tons of force, which is the equivalent of being able to lift up"
00:21:10,00:21:16,100 Eiffel towers. Wow. Which is impressive. That is amazing. It is amazing. Is it used for the
00:21:16,00:21:21,"same just making like sheets of metal for airplanes and stuff? Yeah, they do lots of stuff with like"
00:21:21,00:21:27,oil and gas industry and wind turbines and nuclear and things you would imagine need loads of metal.
00:21:27,00:21:32,"I was reading into humans crushing metal because that is, yeah, it's a thing. And it turns out"
00:21:32,00:21:37,there's a lot of Guinness World Records for people who have done that in the past. So one of the
00:21:37,00:21:44,"records I found was the most cans crushed with shoulder blades in one minute. Okay, so back"
00:21:44,00:21:49,"shoulder blades. Yeah, so you're sort of moving them together to create the crush. What do you"
00:21:49,00:21:56,"reckon in one minute? Well, okay, question. Yeah, is someone putting the cans in your shoulders after"
00:21:56,00:22:02,you have to place them there yourself because that feels tough. So the records held by Fabrizio
00:22:02,00:22:07,"Malito and another one for the Italians. Exactly. Yeah, crushing metal. It's just their forte."
00:22:07,00:22:12,"And it was his brother, Frank, who would replenish the can in between the shoulder blades to be"
00:22:12,00:22:19,crushed. 84. You're not far off. 68. 68. That's 10 more than someone managed to do it with their
00:22:19,00:22:24,"head in one minute. So 58 achieved with their head. That's interesting, because if you ever"
00:22:24,00:22:30,"crush a can these days, it's really easy. It's very, and that used to be seen as like a pop-eye"
00:22:30,00:22:35,or a manly roar kind of thing. It turns out that that did used to be that because cans were 40%
00:22:35,00:22:39,stronger back in the day in terms of the material and the strength and the thickness. This really
00:22:39,00:22:45,"shows how old I am. But I remember when aluminium cans came in. And that they were much, much easier"
00:22:45,00:22:49,to crush. It used to be that you could buy cans of pop and some of them would be aluminium and some
00:22:49,00:22:53,of them wouldn't be. Right. And the aluminium ones were way easier to crush. Were the previous ones
00:22:53,00:22:58,"steel? I suppose they must have been. I'm not really sure, but I just remember Blue Peter had a thing"
00:22:58,00:23:03,where everyone had to crush cans and send them for recycling in their 80s. Nice. And so we were
00:23:03,00:23:08,"all into can-crushing back then. Before Tamagotchi, so that was what it was, wasn't it?"
00:23:09,00:23:15,"Can I read an introductory sentence to you? Yeah, sure. Is it from your new novel? It's"
00:23:15,00:23:19,"from a piece about another kind of forging, which is a thing called drop forging. And it's in"
00:23:19,00:23:25,"kadahi. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm pronouncing it wrong, Milwaukee. It begins like this, tucked away"
00:23:25,00:23:32,in a kadahi warehouse. Something big has been pounding away since 1959. But this is a huge
00:23:32,00:23:38,great hammer. And this is the kind of thing where you just have a giant hammer to smash down on your
00:23:38,00:23:44,"metal and get it into the shape you want. Right. And this one, it weighs one million pounds. And"
00:23:44,00:23:50,it goes five floors above ground and also five floors below ground. So it's called a counterblow
00:23:50,00:23:57,"hammer, which is meaning that you are whacking above sides. Oh, cool. Yeah, on the below at the"
00:23:57,00:24:03,same time. Like a crocodile. It's so cool. It's just like flames and fire inside it. And it's just
00:24:03,00:24:08,"smashing away at these objects. Yeah, yeah. Basically, that hammer, that gigantic hammer has"
00:24:08,00:24:13,been in operation so long that you've got multiple generations of the same family who've been operating
00:24:13,00:24:18,"that hammer. It's been going since 1959. So there was a guy interviewed for this article saying,"
00:24:18,00:24:22,"""Yeah, my grandfather worked on this hammer."" I know. What would happen if you put just a person"
00:24:22,00:24:27,"in there? Oh, they'd be in trouble. They'd be in such trouble. They'd get just squished. But I'd"
00:24:27,00:24:32,"love to see what that like doesn't look like. Oh, no. It's not like when you frame Roger Rabbit."
00:24:32,00:24:38,"You would not love to see that, I can say. You've become a perfect two-dimensional human."
00:24:38,00:24:43,"It's a shame that's not on the list of options for like, you know, you've got classic burial,"
00:24:43,00:24:50,"cremation, obliterated pine, bash. The flattening. Can I tell you one thing about a cool destruction"
00:24:50,00:24:55,"engine from the 19th century? But this is great. This is, there was a great new scientist piece"
00:24:55,00:24:59,"about it, and it was called the Victorian Monster Destruction Engine. Not its official name."
00:24:59,00:25:08,"But it was made by an engineer called David Cacoldi, who's Scottish. And he was the chief engineer"
00:25:08,00:25:16,"behind this machine, which existed to smash metal, to tear it, to twist it, to crunch it,"
00:25:16,00:25:24,"to bop it, you know, to do all of this. And it was because before his work, you could not test"
00:25:24,00:25:29,"the components of a bridge, say. So, you know, you just have to trust that the bridge you were"
00:25:29,00:25:32,"building was strong enough. Yeah, you've got some rivets, you need to know whether they're"
00:25:32,00:25:36,going to hold if you put a load of pressure on it. How do you do that? Exactly that. And he built
00:25:36,00:25:41,"this gigantic machine. It was 116 tons, which at the time was huge. And its entire job was to"
00:25:41,00:25:45,tear things apart and it could measure the tonnage at which or the force that needed to be applied
00:25:45,00:25:50,"before things broke. And this changed engineering because, you know, there was the Tay Bridge disaster"
00:25:50,00:25:56,in Scotland. And they went down to the riverbed after this awful disaster had happened. Lots of
00:25:56,00:26:00,people died and it was a really tragic event. A really bad bit of poetry was written about it
00:26:00,00:26:06,famously by McGonagall. That's right. The Tay Bridge disaster disaster. And they went down and
00:26:06,00:26:11,they got some of the lugs that had attached the bridge rods to the supporting columns. And it was
00:26:11,00:26:15,found that they broke at 20 tons of pressure rather than the 60 that they should have done.
00:26:15,00:26:20,"So that, you know, ruined the career of the engineer who had said, no, these are fine and"
00:26:20,00:26:25,these are strong enough to support the bridge. So I feel like they should have used buttresses
00:26:25,00:26:30,as many a wise man confesses. It's a line from the poem. Is that genuinely a line from the poem?
00:26:30,00:26:32,That's good memory. All the poems you could have memorised.
00:26:32,00:26:38,"But yeah, he made loads of bridges as well, didn't he? And they were shipped all over the"
00:26:38,00:26:43,world because he was the first person ever to test these things. So the Sydney Harbour Bridge
00:26:43,00:26:49,"was all tested, but in his one machine, at the various bridges in London, Hammersmith Bridge."
00:26:49,00:26:52,"The family thing, like Generations, the Festival of Britain in the 1950s,"
00:26:52,00:26:58,some of their structures were tested by his grandson. And I love this. It was certainly in
00:26:58,00:27:05,"2014 there in a museum, I think it's in Southwark. And there used to be on the top floor a museum of"
00:27:05,00:27:10,"fractures, which was a collection of broken pieces of metal. But tragically during the Second World"
00:27:10,00:27:16,"War, a bomb fell on it. And all the pieces came back together. It was like, what am I supposed to"
00:27:16,00:27:30,"do with these? Find a pristine spitfire. Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:27:30,00:27:36,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 18th century America, you could tell a merchant from a lawyer"
00:27:36,00:27:44,just by looking at their handwriting. So the lawyer would put little hearts over the eyes.
00:27:44,00:27:51,"This is insane. The merchant was dollar sign. Yeah, it's crazy, isn't it? I just didn't know this."
00:27:51,00:27:57,"It was in an article in The Atlantic, I read it, an article by Rachel Gutman Way. And she wrote that"
00:27:57,00:28:03,there were different font types for different jobs. The handwriting of the merchants apparently
00:28:03,00:28:07,was supposed to reflect the efficiency and speed with which they worked. And lawyers would have
00:28:07,00:28:12,"different scripts, aristocrats would have different scripts. And what would happen is,"
00:28:12,00:28:17,"it was, you would be in your guild or whatever, or you would be taught to do this job. And when"
00:28:17,00:28:22,"you were being taught it, they would teach you particular ways of writing. So as the years went"
00:28:22,00:28:27,"on, it would kind of get more and more enforced, this style of writing. Because doctors are the only"
00:28:27,00:28:31,"people today who have reputedly got a particular kind of handwriting, which is terrible. Yeah."
00:28:31,00:28:36,"I don't think that's a font, is it? Barscript. I feel like journalists. I've seen journalists"
00:28:36,00:28:41,"doing fast writing. Short-hand. Yeah, short-hand, which feels very them. And that's a sort of"
00:28:41,00:28:45,"separate language to notate. But this is, you're talking about the English language written. Yeah,"
00:28:45,00:28:48,"so you would write the same words, but you'd be able to read them and you'd be able to say,"
00:28:48,00:28:52,"this person is a merchant, this person is a... Could you masquerade? If I was a merchant,"
00:28:52,00:28:57,"I'm wanting to pretend to be a lawyer. I suppose you could, but it's a bit like forging signatures."
00:28:58,00:29:03,"Is I guess it's difficult, right? Because your signature, you do naturally without thinking,"
00:29:03,00:29:08,"whereas to forge it, it takes time and sometimes it's not very easy to do it exactly."
00:29:08,00:29:11,And you probably need other proofs that you're a lawyer. It probably wasn't that people would
00:29:11,00:29:15,"hire a lawyer by saying, can you just write your name on a bit of paper? Looks like a lawyer's"
00:29:15,00:29:20,handwriting to me. I'm in a Mrs Doubtfire scenario in my head. I'm the aristocrat and the nanny in
00:29:20,00:29:26,"this, what I'm trying to do. Right. Well, one thing that might work there is that men and women had"
00:29:26,00:29:31,different handwriting as well. That's so interesting. So men had more masculine handwriting
00:29:31,00:29:36,"they were taught, or muscular handwriting. What does that even mean? Well, muscular handwriting,"
00:29:36,00:29:40,"according to someone called Carla Peterson, who is a professor of English at the University of"
00:29:40,00:29:47,"Maryland, they used more pressure on the pen. Just holes in the paper. 50,000 tons of force"
00:29:47,00:29:54,"on every letter. And women had more like an italic, cursive handwriting. What I thought was so"
00:29:54,00:29:59,interesting about this fact is that I hadn't really considered until now the fact that we were all
00:29:59,00:30:04,taught a font. So basically the handwriting equivalent of font is script. And we were all
00:30:04,00:30:10,"taught a script. And of course we were. And when you see writing from the olden days, like if I"
00:30:10,00:30:14,"look at collections of letters written by, like my grandparents had old letters written by their"
00:30:14,00:30:19,"grandparents from the 19th century, the handwriting is so different. And that's because official"
00:30:19,00:30:25,"styles changed. And so there was this thing called Spensarian scripts in the 1900s, which"
00:30:25,00:30:32,President Garfield called the pride of our country. America's done so much stuff. That's
00:30:32,00:30:36,"the biggest one. Is that the biggie? That's the biggest Spensarian. The guy who came up with this,"
00:30:36,00:30:42,"Platt Rogers Spencer, said he was inspired by pebbles on a beach and is sloping. It's got to"
00:30:42,00:30:49,"be at an exact angle of 52 degrees, sloping forwards and slightly rounded. Okay. And it"
00:30:49,00:30:53,"was that like basically Americans would write that like that. Yes. Because I know like, for"
00:30:53,00:30:59,"instance, my wife writes in a Russian font, which is different than an English font for sure."
00:30:59,00:31:02,"Yes. Yeah, yeah. There's lots of chat about the different ways that different European"
00:31:02,00:31:08,countries still write. So Platt Rogers Spencer spent so much time trying to get it to be the
00:31:08,00:31:11,standard writing style they were teaching in schools and so on. To the point where it feels
00:31:11,00:31:16,"very missionary when he died, his sons then took textbooks of it and they sort of went out and"
00:31:16,00:31:21,campaigned for it to be changed. Have you tried this font style? Even go to schools and hand them
00:31:21,00:31:26,"and this sort of people start reading the books. No, don't read the words. Just look at the letters."
00:31:26,00:31:32,"Yeah, exactly. So weird. Yeah. And then it did get taken over by a thing called Zana Bloso method,"
00:31:32,00:31:36,and then that eventually got taken over by another. So we've got generational changes within how we
00:31:36,00:31:41,"write. You can tell when texts come from right because you can, there's a thing called paleography."
00:31:41,00:31:45,Is that it? It's old writing and it's the study of old writing. Your course is in it because if
00:31:45,00:31:50,"you look at a text from hundreds of years ago, even if it's in English, it's going to be really"
00:31:50,00:31:55,"hard to decipher. It's hard to recognize time travel, as I suppose, is that they have different"
00:31:55,00:32:00,"handwriting. Yes, it'd be so obvious if someone suddenly started writing in that gothic script"
00:32:00,00:32:04,"that as you say, you can barely read it. It looks so different, doesn't it? So hard to distinguish."
00:32:04,00:32:09,"I was thinking people from the future might write, like for instance, in block capitals or something."
00:32:10,00:32:17,"Hello. Oh, wow. Busted. So Spenserian just very quickly, before we wrap up on that,"
00:32:17,00:32:23,"that did go out and these other fonts took over, but it did embed itself in society,"
00:32:23,00:32:27,and we see it virtually every day. So it was a win for Plat and Rogers.
00:32:27,00:32:30,"It's understandable. Oh, yeah, it should be. Think of..."
00:32:30,00:32:34,"Ingredients lists on packets of food. Oh, they're always in handwriting, aren't they?"
00:32:35,00:32:41,"Okay, okay, okay. I'm just warming up. Something that's in handwriting. Yeah."
00:32:41,00:32:46,"Okay, there was something on a banknote, like the code promise to pay the bearer."
00:32:46,00:32:52,"No, it's a logo. It's a logo in handwriting. It is a great call."
00:32:52,00:32:56,It is a food and drink product and it is not anything that you've said. It's a drink.
00:32:56,00:33:00,Coke. Coke. Coke-a-cola. Coke-a-cola.
00:33:00,00:33:04,That lovely... You're right. That rounded cursive. That rounded cursive. I forgot what the question was.
00:33:04,00:33:10,"So it was basically phased out Spenserian, but he managed to have an impact saying,"
00:33:10,00:33:16,and Ford Cars is also the way that Ford has written is based on Spenserian.
00:33:16,00:33:19,That is great. What a legacy. That's a great legacy.
00:33:19,00:33:23,"That's kind of time travel, but the normal way around, you know, like a survivor."
00:33:23,00:33:27,"It's like those animals that you find, which, oh, we thought you went extinct 130 million years ago,"
00:33:27,00:33:30,but here you are swimming around. Like a sealant camp of handwriting.
00:33:30,00:33:31,"Yeah, it's a Coca-Cola camp."
00:33:31,00:33:38,"Could you set me up for that, Joe? No."
00:33:38,00:33:42,I felt like it. I felt like I walked straight into a fur trap there.
00:33:42,00:33:46,We should probably say that handwriting evolves for practical reasons.
00:33:46,00:33:49,"So it was all about these people saying, this is a quicker way to write,"
00:33:49,00:33:52,and this is an easier way to write. This is an easier way to teach.
00:33:52,00:33:56,"Or the reason that Gothic, which was invented in the 12th century-ish,"
00:33:56,00:34:00,"that was quite squashed up, and it was because there was parchment shortages,"
00:34:00,00:34:03,and so you could fit much more on the page.
00:34:03,00:34:07,"So it's all practicalities, which feels relevant when it's enforced today,"
00:34:07,00:34:11,"because people say, isn't it sad that no one learns proper cursive anymore,"
00:34:11,00:34:14,"and there are a number of American states that enforce it legally,"
00:34:14,00:34:18,and there isn't really evidence that there's particularly a purpose.
00:34:18,00:34:19,"Cursive has just joined up handwriting, right?"
00:34:19,00:34:23,"Yes. I can tell you a lot about someone, their handwriting."
00:34:24,00:34:26,"Well, no, it can't really. But they can tell you how drunk they are."
00:34:26,00:34:30,"Well, that's good. Of all these kind of graphology things,"
00:34:30,00:34:34,"which is you're supposed to be able to tell people's personality or whatever,"
00:34:34,00:34:36,"from their handwriting, most of it does seem to be mediopie,"
00:34:36,00:34:41,"but definitely for sure, the height of ascending letters,"
00:34:41,00:34:45,"height of descending letters, spacing between words, tremors,"
00:34:45,00:34:51,"bit of sick on the page, the height of the upper and lower case letters,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,all changes depending on how much alcohol you've had.
00:34:53,00:34:55,That's good. That's very good.
00:34:55,00:34:57,That's got to be one of the most pointless studies ever done
00:34:57,00:35:00,writing declines with alcoholism.
00:35:00,00:35:02,Did you find the B.I.G.?
00:35:02,00:35:04,Notorious.
00:35:04,00:35:06,Notorious British Institute of Graphologists.
00:35:06,00:35:11,They're real.
00:35:11,00:35:12,They're pretty hardcore on there.
00:35:12,00:35:14,They are. That's really funny.
00:35:14,00:35:18,"And their claim, and I think I'm not, I don't think it's backed up by solid evidence,"
00:35:18,00:35:22,"is that it's better than therapy, because actually with therapy,"
00:35:22,00:35:24,you can only know what the client has told you.
00:35:24,00:35:24,Okay.
00:35:24,00:35:27,"Whereas with graphology, you just look at the writing and you say,"
00:35:27,00:35:29,"""Well, that's disgusting. I can't believe you had that dream."""
00:35:29,00:35:30,"Or whatever, you know."
00:35:30,00:35:32,"You're not a merchant, you're a lawyer."
00:35:32,00:35:39,We did a debunk of graphology on QI once and got very angry emails.
00:35:39,00:35:41,And letters didn't we?
00:35:41,00:35:41,And written.
00:35:41,00:35:46,"Yeah, we got one letter from a graphologist saying that"
00:35:47,00:35:51,"some of the evidence is, if you get a pen and put it in your mouth"
00:35:51,00:35:53,"and try and write something on a piece of paper,"
00:35:53,00:35:57,you'll use the same movements as if you were to do it with your hand.
00:35:57,00:36:01,Like so Andy would write it with his same sort of spidery hand writing
00:36:01,00:36:03,with his mouth as he would with his hand.
00:36:03,00:36:06,And that's evidence that it's coming directly from your brain
00:36:06,00:36:09,"as opposed to being something in your hands or whatever, hasn't it?"
00:36:09,00:36:13,Inherent in yourself the shape of your letters.
00:36:13,00:36:16,Is that claim true in either sense?
00:36:16,00:36:18,"Like, is it true that there's any correlation to your mouth and hand"
00:36:18,00:36:20,or that you could draw that conclusion?
00:36:20,00:36:23,"All I'm giving is both sides of the story, like I'm on the BBC."
00:36:23,00:36:24,"Good on you, mate."
00:36:24,00:36:26,"But no, that's what they claim."
00:36:26,00:36:29,"But of course, you know, I think these days we think that it's nonsense."
00:36:29,00:36:31,"Unless you're listening to this podcast on BBC Sounds,"
00:36:31,00:36:32,"in which case, the jury's out."
00:36:32,00:36:38,I do wonder if we were able to bring back certain people from history
00:36:38,00:36:40,"and just say, ""Oh, I love your book,"" called that."
00:36:40,00:36:42,"And they go, ""That's not what that's called."""
00:36:42,00:36:44,And it's because they're bad handwriting.
00:36:44,00:36:47,And there's a few cases where people claim this is a thing.
00:36:47,00:36:50,"So apparently, Beethoven's piece for Elise."
00:36:50,00:36:53,"Apparently, that's not the title."
00:36:53,00:36:54,"What? It's called ""Furry Leaves."""
00:36:54,00:36:56,"Apparently, it's for Therese."
00:36:56,00:36:57,No.
00:36:57,00:36:59,"Yeah, it's Therese or Therese."
00:36:59,00:37:00,It's either that.
00:37:00,00:37:00,No way.
00:37:00,00:37:03,"Yeah, but his handwriting is so dodgy that it just, it's,"
00:37:03,00:37:05,"well, we'll just go with Elise."
00:37:05,00:37:07,Are all the notes different as well?
00:37:07,00:37:11,That's so funny.
00:37:11,00:37:13,"Well, if you're worried about bad handwriting,"
00:37:13,00:37:15,"which I always was in exams,"
00:37:15,00:37:17,"because I have quite a legible small handwriting,"
00:37:17,00:37:19,and I always thought they're never going to read this gold.
00:37:19,00:37:21,"I happened to be on the OCR,"
00:37:21,00:37:23,which is one of the famous exam boards.
00:37:23,00:37:26,"OCR exam board page, FAQ's page,"
00:37:26,00:37:29,and they clarified examiners are experienced at reading
00:37:29,00:37:31,a wide range of handwriting.
00:37:31,00:37:32,"And if one examiner can't read it,"
00:37:32,00:37:35,"it gets passed to another one, and so on."
00:37:35,00:37:35,Wow.
00:37:35,00:37:37,"So I think if your handwriting's bad,"
00:37:37,00:37:40,"it just goes, gets passed to 20 different examiners."
00:37:40,00:37:40,That's so funny.
00:37:40,00:37:41,I knew where it would end up.
00:37:41,00:37:42,Where?
00:37:42,00:37:45,"At the very end, there is a lady on the Isle of Man"
00:37:45,00:37:48,"who runs a firm called Transcription Services,"
00:37:48,00:37:49,and almost no one does what she does.
00:37:49,00:37:53,She is just phenomenal at reading handwriting.
00:37:53,00:37:53,Really?
00:37:53,00:37:54,Specifically old writing.
00:37:54,00:37:57,"Like the work by William Wiseworth,"
00:37:57,00:37:58,"the Brontes, John Dunn,"
00:37:58,00:38:01,"it's all passed to her in the Isle of Man,"
00:38:01,00:38:03,and she's just amazing at it.
00:38:03,00:38:05,And that is paleography.
00:38:05,00:38:08,"Yeah, one person who was really difficult to decipher"
00:38:08,00:38:09,was Catherine Mansfield.
00:38:09,00:38:13,I was reading about the New Zealand short story person.
00:38:13,00:38:17,Her handwriting was so bad that when she died
00:38:17,00:38:20,"and left 53 handwritten notebooks,"
00:38:20,00:38:22,it took decades to decipher them.
00:38:22,00:38:23,Wow.
00:38:23,00:38:24,And the person who was doing it
00:38:24,00:38:28,once spent an entire week trying to decipher a single word.
00:38:28,00:38:34,So the way you write can kind of show where you're from.
00:38:34,00:38:35,I thought this was really interesting.
00:38:35,00:38:37,"So the way you write a T, for instance,"
00:38:37,00:38:38,which bit do you write first?
00:38:38,00:38:39,The width.
00:38:39,00:38:40,I don't even know.
00:38:40,00:38:41,I go the top.
00:38:41,00:38:43,"I don't do the cross, basically."
00:38:43,00:38:44,You don't cross your T's?
00:38:44,00:38:44,"No, I do that."
00:38:44,00:38:45,"Oh, right."
00:38:45,00:38:45,"OK, yeah."
00:38:45,00:38:48,"You don't cross your T's, imagine that."
00:38:48,00:38:51,I'll see you in the burrow.
00:38:51,00:38:53,See you later.
00:38:53,00:38:57,"So presumably, oh, Dan actually,"
00:38:57,00:38:58,what do you write first?
00:38:58,00:38:58,Well.
00:38:58,00:39:00,"You write all in capital, so it's kind of relevant."
00:39:00,00:39:03,Who writes the cross bit first?
00:39:03,00:39:03,Well.
00:39:03,00:39:05,"What's the cross bit, do you mean?"
00:39:05,00:39:07,"The cross your T's, the bit that goes across."
00:39:07,00:39:08,I do.
00:39:08,00:39:08,I do.
00:39:08,00:39:09,You write the cross first?
00:39:09,00:39:12,"OK, here, if I was writing that in lower case, I go."
00:39:12,00:39:16,"Guys, do you know what's so fascinating about this?"
00:39:16,00:39:17,Right.
00:39:17,00:39:17,Do it again.
00:39:17,00:39:19,"What does Dan, what can Dan also write"
00:39:19,00:39:20,that none of the rest of us can?
00:39:20,00:39:23,Brilliant books about weird beliefs.
00:39:23,00:39:25,"All right, I don't think you can write this."
00:39:25,00:39:27,What can he speak and where was he brought up?
00:39:27,00:39:27,Oh.
00:39:27,00:39:30,Mandarin.
00:39:30,00:39:30,Australian slang.
00:39:30,00:39:31,Mandarin.
00:39:31,00:39:33,"Australian slang, yes."
00:39:33,00:39:37,"It's Mandarin writers, writing lots of little short dashes."
00:39:37,00:39:40,"And so it makes sense for them to write, when they learn English,"
00:39:40,00:39:42,they tend to write the cross of the T first.
00:39:42,00:39:44,Because it's lots of little figures.
00:39:44,00:39:44,How interesting.
00:39:44,00:39:45,"Whereas we would always write,"
00:39:45,00:39:47,and there's lots of little stuff like that.
00:39:47,00:39:49,"In Koreans, they write nine backwards."
00:39:49,00:39:50,"Do you write your lines backwards, Dan?"
00:39:50,00:39:52,"No, I, well, I don't know."
00:39:52,00:39:53,You might tell me now that I do.
00:39:53,00:39:54,I write it like that.
00:39:54,00:39:56,"No, that's like every other night tonight."
00:39:56,00:39:57,That's normal.
00:39:57,00:39:59,"I wonder if I've got a cultural mesh going on,"
00:39:59,00:40:01,"because I will start that like that,"
00:40:01,00:40:03,but then I'll do that to end it.
00:40:03,00:40:03,Wow.
00:40:03,00:40:03,Yeah.
00:40:03,00:40:05,Gosh.
00:40:05,00:40:07,"Interesting, because I've never seen you write"
00:40:07,00:40:08,in lower case before.
00:40:08,00:40:09,"Yeah, I didn't know you could."
00:40:09,00:40:11,I am Casemore.
00:40:11,00:40:16,Wow.
00:40:16,00:40:17,I'm so sorry.
00:40:17,00:40:21,"What do you think, the school I went to taught?"
00:40:21,00:40:22,"Well, let's not go there."
00:40:22,00:40:32,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:40:32,00:40:33,and that is Andy.
00:40:33,00:40:37,My fact is that the sun is surrounded by a layer of moss.
00:40:37,00:40:39,Hey.
00:40:39,00:40:40,Is it?
00:40:40,00:40:41,Space moss.
00:40:41,00:40:43,"I mean, it obviously isn't happening."
00:40:43,00:40:49,"So this is a thing which industry experts, sun experts."
00:40:49,00:40:49,Industry?
00:40:49,00:40:51,Astronomers.
00:40:51,00:40:53,Big science brains.
00:40:53,00:40:54,They call moss.
00:40:54,00:40:55,I love this.
00:40:55,00:40:57,So this is in the sun's corona.
00:40:57,00:40:58,"We're outside the sun itself,"
00:40:58,00:41:02,"and there are areas where the sun's magnetic field bursts out,"
00:41:02,00:41:05,"and gas flow, the gas that makes up the sun,"
00:41:05,00:41:06,"flows around these huge loops,"
00:41:06,00:41:09,and then spears back down into the thing.
00:41:09,00:41:11,"It's all really, it's awesome."
00:41:11,00:41:14,"Anyway, and the moss is these sort of lacy patterns"
00:41:14,00:41:17,"around the corona and around those corona loops,"
00:41:17,00:41:19,"around the feet of them, if you like."
00:41:19,00:41:20,"It's a term that NASA uses,"
00:41:20,00:41:22,and lots of other astronomers use it.
00:41:22,00:41:26,"Of all the sexy words you can use for lace-like structures,"
00:41:26,00:41:27,"to use moss, I feel like."
00:41:27,00:41:30,"Yeah, what would you have gone for?"
00:41:30,00:41:30,"Well, lace."
00:41:30,00:41:31,Lingerie.
00:41:31,00:41:32,Lace.
00:41:32,00:41:33,Negligent.
00:41:33,00:41:35,"That's quite a cool, yeah."
00:41:35,00:41:36,Yeah.
00:41:36,00:41:39,I do think of it when I was reading about it.
00:41:39,00:41:40,"Yeah, you've described it pretty well there."
00:41:40,00:41:42,"It looks like a rainbow,"
00:41:42,00:41:45,"if you look at these coronal loops,"
00:41:45,00:41:47,"and the moss is sort of at the bottom of them,"
00:41:47,00:41:50,so it's like the gold at the bottom of a rainbow.
00:41:50,00:41:50,Very nice.
00:41:50,00:41:51,Lovely.
00:41:51,00:41:54,What's really weird is I read that this is the case.
00:41:54,00:41:56,"There may be other reasons for it,"
00:41:56,00:41:58,"but the reason those loops come out, at all,"
00:41:58,00:42:01,is largely to do with the rotation of the sun.
00:42:01,00:42:02,Right.
00:42:02,00:42:03,"Yeah, so you've got basically,"
00:42:03,00:42:06,"it takes 25 days at the equator to rotate,"
00:42:06,00:42:09,"but at the poles, it takes 33 days."
00:42:09,00:42:12,"So you have this bit overtaking the outside,"
00:42:12,00:42:15,"and it sort of snaps, and it creates these big loops."
00:42:15,00:42:17,"It's sort of running past itself in a,"
00:42:17,00:42:19,"it's the weird rotation,"
00:42:19,00:42:20,the double rotation of the planet.
00:42:20,00:42:22,"Yeah, because it's all gas,"
00:42:22,00:42:26,"so it kind of feels natural, right,"
00:42:26,00:42:27,that it would rotate at different levels.
00:42:27,00:42:29,"But yeah, that chaos that's generated."
00:42:29,00:42:30,Yeah.
00:42:30,00:42:32,"But it seems like we still don't know a lot about the sun,"
00:42:32,00:42:33,"which is quite exciting,"
00:42:33,00:42:34,"and they're still discovering stuff about it, aren't they?"
00:42:34,00:42:38,"I mean, this is all linked to that eternal mystery,"
00:42:38,00:42:41,"that why is the sun's atmosphere,"
00:42:41,00:42:44,"the bit just above the surface of the sun, so hot?"
00:42:44,00:42:46,So I think we might have mentioned before.
00:42:46,00:42:48,So hotter than the surface or even the core?
00:42:48,00:42:49,"It's the hottest there, is that what you're saying?"
00:42:49,00:42:51,"It's hotter than the surface, definitely."
00:42:51,00:42:52,I'm not sure if it's hotter than the very core.
00:42:52,00:42:54,"Yeah, it's so much hotter."
00:42:54,00:42:57,"So the surface of the sun is about 6,000 degrees Celsius."
00:42:57,00:42:58,"I think we can all agree, very hot."
00:42:58,00:42:59,Yeah.
00:42:59,00:42:59,Well.
00:42:59,00:43:05,"But the corona, the atmosphere, is 1 million and 6,000 degrees Celsius."
00:43:05,00:43:07,It's a million degrees hotter.
00:43:07,00:43:09,"And do you know that even NASA says that there are flares,"
00:43:09,00:43:13,which they think might be between 10 and 40 million degrees Celsius?
00:43:13,00:43:15,"Wow, 40 million degrees."
00:43:15,00:43:17,"So the sun's rotating, producing magnetic field, right?"
00:43:17,00:43:17,Yeah.
00:43:17,00:43:21,"And then these lines of magnetic force, they get tangled,"
00:43:21,00:43:23,and they build up pressure and they snap.
00:43:23,00:43:24,"And most of the energy goes outwards,"
00:43:24,00:43:28,"but some of it goes back inwards, into the sun."
00:43:28,00:43:31,"And the particles in the sun's lower atmosphere,"
00:43:31,00:43:35,they build up this pressure wave and it penetrates deep into the sun.
00:43:35,00:43:37,And it becomes a sunquake.
00:43:37,00:43:40,Just everything starts sounding like a cool title for a metal album.
00:43:40,00:43:42,Sunquake.
00:43:42,00:43:42,Sunquake.
00:43:42,00:43:45,I've been going around singing Sunquake.
00:43:45,00:43:47,"There's a group called the Solar Wind Sherpas,"
00:43:47,00:43:49,who also sound pretty cool and metal.
00:43:49,00:43:50,So they're a band.
00:43:50,00:43:51,"No, they're a group of scientists."
00:43:51,00:43:56,"But just anything sun related, like coronal moss, or whatever."
00:43:56,00:43:58,"That one doesn't quite work, I gotta say."
00:43:58,00:43:58,Okay.
00:43:58,00:43:59,"It's not metal, I don't think that one."
00:43:59,00:44:01,No matter how much you put that voice on.
00:44:01,00:44:02,"Okay, okay, okay."
00:44:02,00:44:04,"Quite similarly, you get solar rain,"
00:44:04,00:44:07,which is actually lumps of plasma
00:44:07,00:44:09,that fall down from these coronal rainbow loops.
00:44:09,00:44:12,"And when they splash into the chromosphere,"
00:44:12,00:44:14,"the bit in between the atmosphere and the surface,"
00:44:14,00:44:17,they make a big splash and they send up loads more plasma.
00:44:17,00:44:19,We are chromosphere.
00:44:19,00:44:21,"This is our album, Solar Rain."
00:44:21,00:44:21,What about that?
00:44:21,00:44:22,"Yeah, it's good."
00:44:22,00:44:24,We are the Solar Hedge Row.
00:44:24,00:44:25,What about that?
00:44:25,00:44:29,"It's a bit rural, bit rustic, but nice."
00:44:29,00:44:30,"Yeah, maybe like the muscles."
00:44:30,00:44:31,"I mean, it's not that interesting."
00:44:31,00:44:35,It's just like filaments of mossy-like stuff from the sun
00:44:35,00:44:39,"that create loops that go in like a line, like a hedge row might."
00:44:39,00:44:41,But it is an official term apparently.
00:44:41,00:44:42,That's cool.
00:44:42,00:44:44,Do you know who is the first person to take a photo
00:44:44,00:44:46,of these filaments on the sun?
00:44:46,00:44:48,"Oh, it's almost."
00:44:48,00:44:49,Is someone we've heard of?
00:44:49,00:44:49,"Oh, no."
00:44:49,00:44:53,That narrows it down.
00:44:53,00:44:54,That narrows it down.
00:44:54,00:44:57,You might have come across her name.
00:44:57,00:44:59,"Annie Monda, she was called."
00:44:59,00:45:03,And she was married to Edward Walter Monda.
00:45:03,00:45:06,And she was probably the last of what was called the lady computers.
00:45:06,00:45:11,"So towards the end of the 19th century,"
00:45:11,00:45:16,this is obviously there were computers like for the space race and stuff like that.
00:45:16,00:45:18,But these were women who would do the calculations
00:45:18,00:45:21,when astronomers would come up with loads of data.
00:45:21,00:45:22,They would give them to the women
00:45:22,00:45:25,and the women would work them out and work out what was going on.
00:45:25,00:45:26,"Amazing, right."
00:45:26,00:45:28,"And also the Monda minimum is named after her,"
00:45:28,00:45:29,"which you might have heard,"
00:45:29,00:45:32,which was a time in the 17th century when all sunspots disappeared.
00:45:32,00:45:35,Was that when it got very cold?
00:45:35,00:45:36,"Yeah, the little ice age."
00:45:36,00:45:37,Exactly.
00:45:37,00:45:38,Was that the Monda minimum?
00:45:38,00:45:39,But it's named after her.
00:45:39,00:45:41,"And her husband as well, yeah."
00:45:41,00:45:42,"Yeah, that's awesome."
00:45:42,00:45:45,But so she's coming through data to find all this stuff.
00:45:45,00:45:46,So amateur photographer on the side.
00:45:46,00:45:49,"She was also a photographer on the side, yeah, yeah."
00:45:49,00:45:52,And she and her husband did photographs of the sun.
00:45:52,00:45:54,"And we're doing it all the time, basically."
00:45:54,00:45:55,"Whenever there was a clear day,"
00:45:55,00:45:57,they would go out and photograph the sun.
00:45:57,00:45:58,How do you photograph the sun with that?
00:45:58,00:46:02,"You need a special filter to stop hurting your eyes, obviously."
00:46:02,00:46:04,There are lots of different ways of doing it.
00:46:04,00:46:06,"And like, for instance, you can do it with a pinhole camera."
00:46:06,00:46:10,I think you could largely just point it in the direction
00:46:10,00:46:12,"and press snap, can't you?"
00:46:12,00:46:15,"I think if you do that and you send the photos to Boots,"
00:46:15,00:46:17,you're going to get a sticker on them.
00:46:17,00:46:21,"In Britain, you can photograph the sun pretty easily."
00:46:21,00:46:25,"The sort of vague, white dot on screen by Cloud."
00:46:25,00:46:27,That reminds me of the warnings
00:46:27,00:46:29,when there are eclipses about what they can do to your eyes.
00:46:29,00:46:32,"I've been sort of mad to very extents over the years,"
00:46:32,00:46:35,but I was reading about the eclipse in Melbourne in 1976.
00:46:35,00:46:36,I think it was.
00:46:36,00:46:39,When there was this doctor who sort of spread panic
00:46:39,00:46:41,around the city saying there could be an epidemic
00:46:41,00:46:45,of thousands of kids being completely blind.
00:46:45,00:46:46,Because all you need to do is look at that
00:46:46,00:46:48,for a couple of seconds and you can go blind.
00:46:48,00:46:52,"Now, it's not, it is exaggerated, the scare mongering,"
00:46:52,00:46:55,but it scared Melbourne into watching it from inside.
00:46:55,00:46:57,So 2 million of the 2.5 million people there
00:46:57,00:46:58,watched it on their tellies.
00:46:58,00:47:01,"It is a problem, I think, with the eclipse,"
00:47:01,00:47:03,which is it is bad for you.
00:47:03,00:47:05,"And you can't say it's not bad for you,"
00:47:05,00:47:08,but pretty much all the time everyone says
00:47:08,00:47:09,it's worse for you than it actually is.
00:47:09,00:47:11,I think that's the problem.
00:47:11,00:47:14,"So when Trump famously looked at the sun,"
00:47:14,00:47:15,that wouldn't have done.
00:47:15,00:47:16,It depends how long you do it for.
00:47:16,00:47:19,I think you can tell if it's doing damage.
00:47:19,00:47:21,Bloody left-wing media spinning these stories to make him--
00:47:21,00:47:22,We're not saying.
00:47:22,00:47:24,We're not saying you should go and look at the sun.
00:47:24,00:47:26,That's the problem is you can't say that.
00:47:26,00:47:28,You can't say go out and look at the sun.
00:47:28,00:47:28,Brilliant idea.
00:47:28,00:47:30,I would say give Trump a break.
00:47:30,00:47:31,That's what I'm saying.
00:47:31,00:47:34,"But yeah, it's like you've looked at the sun"
00:47:34,00:47:37,"every now and then by accident for a second or so, right?"
00:47:37,00:47:38,"And you're like, oh, that hurt my eyes,"
00:47:38,00:47:40,but you didn't go blind at any stage.
00:47:40,00:47:41,"No, because it's the eclipse."
00:47:41,00:47:42,Isn't there a risk that people are going to try
00:47:42,00:47:46,"and look for longer than the tiny, tiny glimpse"
00:47:46,00:47:47,that might not do you any harm?
00:47:47,00:47:49,But it feels so much common sense
00:47:49,00:47:50,"that the only people who do get in trouble,"
00:47:50,00:47:53,"and I think this was true in Britain when we had it in 1999,"
00:47:53,00:47:55,are people who had lots of drugs.
00:47:55,00:47:57,So there was a girl who'd taken lots of speed
00:47:57,00:47:59,"who stared at the eclipse for half an hour,"
00:47:59,00:48:01,and she did have some permanent eye damage.
00:48:01,00:48:03,"Isaac Newton, that was a story that he stared at the sun"
00:48:03,00:48:05,in that sense impartially blinded.
00:48:05,00:48:06,That was deliberately for an experiment
00:48:06,00:48:08,to see what would happen if he stared at the sun.
00:48:08,00:48:10,"So you can be very, very clever and also very, very stupid."
00:48:10,00:48:12,So I think it's just good to wear on the side of court
00:48:12,00:48:13,and say never look anywhere.
00:48:13,00:48:14,I think that's fair.
00:48:14,00:48:18,But I think one bit of good news is if you do go blind
00:48:18,00:48:19,"for staring at the sun for too long,"
00:48:19,00:48:21,is that there's a new invention
00:48:21,00:48:23,that allows blind people to enjoy eclipses.
00:48:23,00:48:25,Really?
00:48:25,00:48:27,"Yeah, it's called light sound,"
00:48:27,00:48:30,and it sort of measures and translates the sky's brightness
00:48:30,00:48:31,and turns it into music.
00:48:31,00:48:34,"And so you can like put your headphones in,"
00:48:34,00:48:36,and apparently it gives a really good impression
00:48:36,00:48:37,of the change of the sun
00:48:37,00:48:39,and the change of the brightness that's happening.
00:48:39,00:48:40,That was so cool.
00:48:40,00:48:41,That was so cool.
00:48:41,00:48:42,Yeah.
00:48:42,00:48:42,That's amazing.
00:48:42,00:48:43,That's awesome.
00:48:44,00:48:47,Milosevic scared his people underground.
00:48:47,00:48:48,Slobodan.
00:48:48,00:48:51,Or Aston Villa striker Savo Milosevic.
00:48:51,00:48:53,"I think it was Slobodan though,"
00:48:53,00:48:55,"of course I haven't written it down,"
00:48:55,00:48:57,but whichever one was ruling Serbia in the 90s.
00:48:57,00:49:02,"Yeah, he said that it would make you urinate really frequently"
00:49:02,00:49:03,and get heart palpitations.
00:49:03,00:49:06,"And everyone literally went inside,"
00:49:06,00:49:07,pulled all their curtains down.
00:49:07,00:49:08,"They were calling help lines saying,"
00:49:08,00:49:09,is it safe to watch it on telly?
00:49:09,00:49:10,Wow.
00:49:10,00:49:13,That like no one went outside public transport all stopped.
00:49:13,00:49:15,So the whole of the rest of Europe flooded outside
00:49:15,00:49:16,"to watch the eclipse,"
00:49:16,00:49:19,and all of Serbia retreated underground and indoors.
00:49:19,00:49:21,Did he have motives that we know now?
00:49:21,00:49:24,"Well, was that a weird, the urination thing?"
00:49:24,00:49:25,"Well, what was where did that come from?"
00:49:25,00:49:27,"No, I agree, because no, I don't know."
00:49:27,00:49:28,I don't know why.
00:49:28,00:49:30,"There was actually a paper saying what were his motivations,"
00:49:30,00:49:32,and I couldn't download the full thing.
00:49:32,00:49:33,So we'll never know.
00:49:33,00:49:38,"No one, apart from people who could afford 24.99,"
00:49:38,00:49:39,will ever know.
00:49:41,00:49:43,But I can tell you that animal rights activists
00:49:43,00:49:46,sent sunglasses to the chimps in the zoo.
00:49:46,00:49:47,"So scared, were they?"
00:49:47,00:49:48,Gosh.
00:49:48,00:49:49,Golly.
00:49:49,00:49:51,I think one of the coolest things I read
00:49:51,00:49:54,"as part of this research is that you got the sun,"
00:49:54,00:49:55,"we're just staring at it,"
00:49:55,00:49:56,we're trying to work out what's going on with it.
00:49:56,00:49:58,We got nothing to compare it to.
00:49:58,00:50:02,But we got nothing to compare it to.
00:50:02,00:50:03,And that's not true anymore.
00:50:03,00:50:04,"And it's not been true for a while,"
00:50:04,00:50:07,"because the Kepler Space Telescope,"
00:50:07,00:50:08,"back when it was operating,"
00:50:08,00:50:11,"monitored 150,000 stars in the Milky Way,"
00:50:11,00:50:17,and they found 369 suns that are incredibly similar to ours.
00:50:17,00:50:20,"And so now we can look at other case studies,"
00:50:20,00:50:22,"as it were, and go,"
00:50:22,00:50:23,"""Oh, this is interesting."
00:50:23,00:50:25,"That sun is very active at the moment."""
00:50:25,00:50:27,"And it wasn't 10, 11 years ago."
00:50:27,00:50:29,That must mean that it's running in phases.
00:50:29,00:50:31,So we can learn via these suns
00:50:31,00:50:35,that are billions of miles away about our own sun.
00:50:35,00:50:36,"Yeah, because there are a lot of scientists"
00:50:36,00:50:38,that look at our sun as a curiosity
00:50:38,00:50:39,"compared to other suns,"
00:50:39,00:50:42,in that they say it's spectacularly boring
00:50:42,00:50:44,in comparison to all the other suns
00:50:44,00:50:45,that we're seeing in the universe.
00:50:45,00:50:47,And they partially wonder if that's why we're here at all.
00:50:47,00:50:49,"Yeah, that must be right."
00:50:49,00:50:51,Because if it starts spitting out stuff at us
00:50:51,00:50:53,"every two or three years, we're going to die."
00:50:53,00:50:56,"Exactly. So our sun is just not that active,"
00:50:56,00:50:58,and that's been incredible for us.
00:50:58,00:51:00,"It has. And I think actually with the election coming up,"
00:51:00,00:51:04,"sometimes you want a boring center of your universe,"
00:51:04,00:51:06,don't you? Because it can be relied upon.
00:51:06,00:51:08,To not destroy you.
00:51:08,00:51:11,That is a political broadcast for Kier Starman.
00:51:11,00:51:14,Don't know what you're talking about.
00:51:14,00:51:16,We actually had someone write in who was a space weather forecaster.
00:51:16,00:51:17,"Oh, I know."
00:51:17,00:51:18,To the fish inbox.
00:51:18,00:51:18,Really?
00:51:18,00:51:19,This is cool.
00:51:19,00:51:20,He's called Gavin Medley.
00:51:20,00:51:22,What? Dark with no weather again.
00:51:22,00:51:26,"He works at the LASP,"
00:51:26,00:51:29,which is the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics
00:51:29,00:51:30,at the University of Colorado.
00:51:30,00:51:32,"And he was writing about the, you know,"
00:51:32,00:51:35,"if the sun emits a giant electromagnetic storm,"
00:51:35,00:51:37,we won't get warning before it hits us.
00:51:37,00:51:39,But there are space weather instruments
00:51:39,00:51:43,"that sit on spacecraft at Lagrange points,"
00:51:43,00:51:46,and they just sit there in gravitational equilibrium.
00:51:46,00:51:47,And one of their goals is to collect data
00:51:47,00:51:50,"to predict and warn about solar storms and flares,"
00:51:50,00:51:52,which can take down our electrical structure.
00:51:52,00:51:54,And that's how we knew like a few weeks ago
00:51:54,00:51:55,when they had that big solar storm
00:51:55,00:51:57,"that people in London couldn't see,"
00:51:57,00:51:58,but everyone else in the country could see.
00:51:58,00:51:59,Yeah. The aurora.
00:51:59,00:52:02,The aurora. We know about that because of those things.
00:52:02,00:52:03,Yeah.
00:52:03,00:52:04,"By the way, we're in the most exciting year for the sun"
00:52:04,00:52:06,"in 11 years, loads of sunspots."
00:52:06,00:52:06,Oh.
00:52:06,00:52:09,'Cause the sun switches poles every 11 years.
00:52:09,00:52:09,Yeah.
00:52:09,00:52:12,"So the most boring year was 2019,"
00:52:12,00:52:14,"and that was like hardly any sunspots,"
00:52:14,00:52:16,because the poles were just like perfectly aligned
00:52:16,00:52:18,"north and south, and now we're in the most feisty year,"
00:52:18,00:52:20,which I think might be why they've discovered this thing
00:52:20,00:52:21,"that your main fact was about,"
00:52:21,00:52:23,"is because it feels like as a scientist,"
00:52:23,00:52:25,"it's the most thrilling time to look at the sun,"
00:52:25,00:52:27,'cause so much mad shit's going on there.
00:52:27,00:52:31,"So if one of these big coronal mass ejections hits us,"
00:52:31,00:52:33,"we're kind of buggered a little bit, right?"
00:52:33,00:52:35,"All of our electronics are going to fry,"
00:52:35,00:52:38,"and until they fix it, it's going to be pretty tough."
00:52:38,00:52:41,"And we knew that this big one was coming a few weeks ago,"
00:52:41,00:52:44,"and I was in Wales in the middle of nowhere,"
00:52:44,00:52:46,and so I got a load of cash out of the cash machine
00:52:46,00:52:49,"just in case, all of the cash machines got back genuinely."
00:52:49,00:52:50,Just subtle prepper.
00:52:50,00:52:51,I love it.
00:52:51,00:52:53,Your cash is no good in the aftertimes.
00:52:53,00:52:55,But it'll get me home.
00:52:55,00:52:57,Like all I had to do was get home.
00:52:57,00:52:58,"I have an electric car, right?"
00:52:58,00:53:01,"So if I'm stuck in Wales with an electric car,"
00:53:01,00:53:02,"and all the electrics are fried,"
00:53:02,00:53:04,I am kind of buggered.
00:53:04,00:53:06,"I'm not necessarily buggered if you have to stay in Wales, James."
00:53:06,00:53:06,Come on.
00:53:06,00:53:07,Good people of Wales.
00:53:07,00:53:08,Great place to be stranded for a while.
00:53:08,00:53:09,"No, it's a great place to be,"
00:53:09,00:53:12,but it's not ideal for the rest of my family if I'm in Wales.
00:53:12,00:53:14,James's electric tin opener is in London.
00:53:14,00:53:16,That's what he's getting back to.
00:53:16,00:53:19,"Oh, he brings that with him."
00:53:19,00:53:20,"I keep that in a lead-lined case,"
00:53:20,00:53:22,a case of a coronal mass ejection.
00:53:22,00:53:27,"But there's a theory, right?"
00:53:27,00:53:30,So we could fire out a big loop of wire into space.
00:53:31,00:53:34,So the entire earth is covered by one wire.
00:53:34,00:53:34,Okay.
00:53:34,00:53:38,"And then when the coronal mass ejection comes in,"
00:53:38,00:53:40,"which is basically charged particles,"
00:53:40,00:53:42,"then the wire can kind of ground it,"
00:53:42,00:53:44,and it won't fry all of our electricity.
00:53:44,00:53:45,That's interesting.
00:53:45,00:53:46,It's a really good idea.
00:53:46,00:53:48,"No one's really taken the idea seriously,"
00:53:48,00:53:53,but they reckon that the loop would cost about $100 billion to make.
00:53:53,00:53:56,"But if we did get hit by one of those coronal mass ejections,"
00:53:56,00:53:58,"which will happen sometime,"
00:53:58,00:54:00,the cost will be way more than that.
00:54:00,00:54:01,Yeah.
00:54:01,00:54:02,"Wait, wait, it'll be in the trillions."
00:54:02,00:54:05,It will fuck up our economy for years.
00:54:05,00:54:06,"Actually, $100 billion."
00:54:06,00:54:08,"Sounds a lot, but actually, you know,"
00:54:08,00:54:10,"a lot of things, when you read about it in the paper,"
00:54:10,00:54:12,it's like $600 billion.
00:54:12,00:54:13,"Oh, okay, yeah."
00:54:13,00:54:15,We clubbed together.
00:54:15,00:54:15,Yeah.
00:54:15,00:54:16,We didn't deal with that.
00:54:16,00:54:17,"Well, how much did you get out of the cash point the other day?"
00:54:17,00:54:24,There's a big queue behind James.
00:54:24,00:54:25,His limit's 200 a time.
00:54:25,00:54:28,It's only $20 million a time there.
00:54:28,00:54:28,Let me take out.
00:54:28,00:54:35,[Music]
