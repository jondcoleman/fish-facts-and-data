00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.240
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish!

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.800
 Before we start, a little bit of news that is very important to Anna and I, and

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.960
 that is that our new book is finally out in

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.440
 paperback! Woohoo! I know that might not seem like a big deal to you,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.760
 but honestly this is a real chance for us to get more people

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.120
 reading this book. One very interesting thing to say is

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.040
 that the book has had a name change. What used to be called

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.400
 "Everything to Play For" is now called "A Load of Old

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.160
 Balls - The QI History of Sport" by James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski. A lot of people

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.800
 have said to us, "Why did you not call it that in the first place?"

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.000
 I'm not sure if they're being rude, I hope not, because it is a book

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.120
 full of the most interesting facts and stories about sport you can possibly

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.960
 imagine. Even if you're not into sport, probably this

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.720
 summer you will notice that everyone's off watching the Euros, everyone's off

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.760
 watching the Olympics. Perhaps you don't really have much to say

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240
 to those people when it comes up at a dinner party,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.480
 we'll read our book and you will be the pinnacle of all sporting knowledge and

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.560
 all quite interesting sporting knowledge at that. As you imagine from me and Anna,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.320
 it's just full of silly stories, fun facts. We spent so much time doing loads of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.360
 in-depth research in there that even if you are the kind of person who's

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.800
 watching every single sporting event this summer, there will be loads of stuff

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.880
 in there that you didn't know. So if you go to anywhere where you would

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.800
 normally buy your books, then look for a load of old balls,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.400
 the QI History of Sport or search for our names, James Harkin and Anna

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.480
 Tyshinski and you will find that book. Please do buy it, it would

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.480
 mean the world to us if you did. Of course we're going on tour, don't forget

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.400
 that people in Scotland, Wales, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.480
 do get your tickets very very soon. A lot of them are sold out. I know we've got

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.680
 quite a few tickets left for the Scottish Dates in Edinburgh

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.880
 and Glasgow and I think quite a few for the show in Cardiff.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.080
 So if you're in any of those cities then do get your tickets

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.000
 but actually you know go to gnosisthingsthefish.com/live and you will

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.280
 see all of the dates where we're playing and hopefully one of them will be

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.040
 near you. Okay not much more to say apart from

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.840
 on with the podcast.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.160
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Shriver and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.240
 sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin and

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.280
 once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.480
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.720
 here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is my fact.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.000
 My fact this week is that snooker games on cruise ships

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.880
 are sometimes played with flat balls.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.720
 Are we talking about the balls on the table, are they?

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.680
 The men playing. Yeah this is this is obvious when you think about it.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.320
 Oh it's so obvious. It's so obvious when you think about it. I don't really know

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.280
 how you could place a nooker on a cruise ship with a ball-shaped ball

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.680
 actually on a rough cruise ship. We'll get to that in a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.440
 sec because you can and there's a pretty awesome way that you do that but

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.280
 this I got from a book that's written by an Australian comedian called Hung Lee.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.720
 It's called The Crappiest Refugee. He tells the story of

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.560
 from immigrant boat to cruise ship comedian. Anyway he wrote this book and

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.960
 inside the book he mentions that he's seeing a bunch of guys playing on a

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.720
 pool table or a snooker table and they are hitting with puck-like objects

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.680
 because obviously in the rough seas the balls are going to be rolling around

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.280
 and so there will be cruise ships out there that have these tables on them.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.520
 And the idea I think is like you know air hockey, it's those kind of like

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.720
 puck things, isn't it? Exactly. Now to your point Anna,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.080
 a modern day cruise ship does have pool tables or snooker tables,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.600
 billiards, but they use gyroscopic technology.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.440
 What? So it's amazing. No. It's honestly I've watched videos of it online.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.200
 It's so cool because basically while the rest of the ship is moving

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.160
 the pool table isn't. That's insane. That's the top of the pool table.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.000
 That's a high-end cruise ship. It is incredible.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 I've read stories of people finding it so fascinating that like staring to fire

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.760
 sometimes people will just go and sit and watch it as it doesn't sway.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.960
 There's even stories of crew members that when they get particularly sick

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.120
 they'll go and sleep on the pool table because the seasickness is getting to

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.200
 them. It's not moving so you can have a restful night.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.520
 Which begs the question, why isn't every bed on a boat gyroscopic?

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.600
 Probably price. Cost. Yeah.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.640
 How good is the correction mechanism? Like if you have a Titanic situation

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.520
 how long can you continue with your game of snooker?

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.320
 So it goes vertical. I see that.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.760
 So I met someone who was a dancer on cruise ships for a while.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.680
 This sounds like a good anecdote.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.840
 She did the musicals because they often have a theatre on board and

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.280
 sometimes a show and she said that the most difficult one she'd ever done

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.800
 was Starlight Express where you're on roller skates.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.480
 She said in rough weather you would set off across the stage and you didn't

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.520
 know how soon you were going to arrive because it might be that you caught

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.640
 the ship moved with you and suddenly you're there for half a second

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.560
 or you're going against it and you just roll backwards.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.720
 So yeah snooker. It's a good sport. Mostly not played at sea.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.000
 Largely it's a land-based game isn't it? A land lovers game.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.600
 I did watch a tiktok yesterday just coincidentally of people playing on the

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.520
 beach that looked really cool. Snooker.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.320
 It was pool actually but they kind of dug holes

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.720
 for the pockets and then we just hit the bowls. Oh so they played on actual sand?

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.760
 Yeah yeah. There's no facts to this but it did look pretty cool.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.760
 I'm amazed that snooker in any form has made it to tiktok because snooker is

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.960
 famously quite a long game to watch. Tiktok is not a long format.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.720
 Andy honestly if you could see my tiktok it's just snooker, golf, cricket.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.560
 It's the dullest tiktok because he just suggests things that you like doesn't

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.840
 it and it just works out what you like. I reckon if you were on tiktok which I

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.040
 bet you're not but you would just get moss video after moss video.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.240
 Yeah that sounds very economic. It's amazing how it works.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.360
 But it is very slow isn't it? It's all rather it takes a long time.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.360
 You play lots of frames in the course of a match and it's interesting

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.040
 because for anyone who doesn't follow snooker only one person is playing at a time.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.000
 That's weird. Will you play a frame right?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.560
 Well no. You play until you mess up and then the other guy gets to have a go.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.320
 But whoever your opponent is they have to stay in their chair.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.840
 They just stay in their chair watching you and you could be playing for hours if

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.560
 you don't make a mistake. It's just psychological torture.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.440
 Are there any other games which are like that where I know tennis you're only

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.400
 playing when your opponent is not playing. But usually it's quite soon before you're playing again

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.720
 isn't it? I don't know actually but that is one of the main things about snooker is the

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.640
 psychological angle of it. Although Ronnie O'Sullivan said he likes it

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.840
 obviously because he's always going to be um Ronnie O'Sullivan.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.000
 Who's Ronnie O'Sullivan? I think he's a famous snooker player.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 I would say Ronnie O'Sullivan and Don Bradman are the only two people.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.720
 I don't know what James thinks about this but who have excelled everyone else so

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.280
 much in their sport that it's like whoa. So Ronnie O'Sullivan is the best snooker player ever.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.600
 And he hates the fact that it's so slow for instance because he's this

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.200
 mercurial crazy character with an amazing history and he likes snooker to be super fast.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.680
 So I think he's got pretty much all the records for fastest break.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.920
 But yeah he's amazing and he's got such an interesting history.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.080
 His dad went to prison for murder when I think Ronnie was about 16.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.960
 Yeah he was a millionaire though so even though his dad went to prison for murder

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.560
 he was from a very affluent background because his dad ran a lingerie shop or something like that.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.800
 I believe he may have called them lingerie shops in the newspaper ads when I think they were sex

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:05.360
 shops. I mean potatoes and potatoes. You say potato I say vibrator.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.440
 Yeah so I think some of the other snooker players who came from

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.840
 less affluent backgrounds kind of point to that and say you know we're working class but Ronnie

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.920
 actually was quite rich when he was growing up. Interesting because he was heavily embedded

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.000
 probably in that gang culture a bit. It was one of the Cray Brothers, the third Cray Brothers

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.440
 driver who he murdered in a nightclub I think. Oh sorry the third Cray Brother.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.080
 Yeah I didn't know there was a third Cray but you hear about the Cray Twins.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.880
 I know he was very much the... It's like the third Chuckle Brother.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.680
 Yeah he and the third Cray Brother must have given each other a ride look sometimes across

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.360
 the Eastern clubs. They both have that picture of Bramwell Bronte in their house.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:50.240
 Imagine a joke that has to craze the Chuckle Brothers and Bramwell Bronte in it.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.920
 We've got the Jonas Brothers as well. They've got the extra brother who's called Bonus Jonas

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.280
 who is the one that just isn't in the band and does his own thing all the time.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:05.360
 Bonus Jonas. Snooker's got fairly sort of poshish sort of foundations doesn't it because it was

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.800
 invented by supposedly, this is the big story, by Neville Chamberlain, not the Prime Minister,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.280
 but apparently a cousin. The reports are a bit dodgy but apparently he was in India in the 1800s

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.960
 and he basically incorporated two existing games. There was one called Blackpool and there was

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.760
 another which was called Pyramid and so one was played entirely with red balls and that was in

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.600
 a pyramid shape so he goes 'I will love the pyramid shape' and then the other one had all the other

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:36.240
 colour balls in it and he brought that over, smashed them into one big game with the pyramid

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.080
 and then just kept yelling 'Snooker' at people as they were playing and by the end of the game

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.840
 he'd called everyone 'Snooker' and so it stuck. Why did you call someone what did it mean? Did it

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.200
 mean dickhead? I think it was a sort of term for an idiot, someone who was incompetent at whatever

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.880
 task they were doing, a rookie. I see. It is weird though because he said he invented it in 1875.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.480
 He only said that in 1938 which is a substantial amount of time later that's what.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.080
 63 years later. 63 years later and he was an army officer already when he invented this

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.280
 so he must be knocking on but the claim was accepted and I think it's sort of widely accepted

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.240
 that that's where it comes from but also the other weird thing about Snooker, that name thing you

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.960
 were saying Dan, is so if you snooker someone is it that I need to hit a red next but I'm behind the

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:27.840
 yellow or whatever? Precisely. So that is unusual as well because it's a move in the game where you've

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.840
 messed things up for someone else. Yeah. Which is, is that in Croquet like that?

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.160
 It's a bit like that, you croquet and croquet someone. I think there is a connection between

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.160
 Croquet and Snooker really. I think Snooker kind of grew out of Croquet like games. Yeah. And that's

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.280
 why the that's why the table's green because it was like originally played on grass. Right.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:53.200
 The bays. The bays, yeah. Which has, has to have, do you know the difference between the bays

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:59.760
 in Snooker and pool? I got a bit too into table makeup. Is it the nap? Yeah. I'm just going to

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:05.040
 almost disqualify you from answering this question, James. I thought disclosure, I am very much into

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.440
 snooze. Yeah. You're not allowed to answer any more quiz questions in this section. What's the

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:16.080
 nap? So the nap is the way that the kind of hairs on the substance that the table is made of bend.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.640
 So basically in Snooker you have to have a nap and that means that it's a little bit like if you

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.640
 imagine a velvet surface. In fact, if you look at those cushions over there. I'm having a nap

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:31.360
 listening to this. Andy, this is fascinating stuff. Sorry, sorry. Go, go, go. Okay. You look

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.880
 at those cushions over there. They're velvety. You stroke them one way and they look smooth. You

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.160
 stroke them the other way and they look rough. Oh, okay. Yeah. And that's like a snooker table.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.440
 It has to have that effect and it really affects how the ball travels because as you can imagine

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.360
 if the little hairs, fibres are standing up a certain way and depending on the angle at which

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.760
 is hitting them, you really have to work with the nap. So if you aim for a shot in the middle

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.160
 pocket, you have to aim slightly outside the pocket because the nap will make it naturally

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.920
 bend towards the pocket. That's so interesting. So part of the gameplay is literally getting

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.440
 your face close to the table and seeing how the nap is looking. No, it's always the same.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.640
 Yeah, it's always the same. Well, I actually read in a really furious blog that a man who

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.560
 has heard of people who install their own tables putting the nap on back to front,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.840
 which is obviously an absolute disaster. Doesn't it just go the other way then? Or do you mean

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.240
 upside down? No, I think he means it goes the other way. So it will go slow and it should go

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.840
 fast. But you would be used to it. Like you would be very much used to it being one way.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.280
 Yeah, I've got a question. Are you allowed to comb the table before the get before your pot?

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.560
 So before every frame, before every frame? Yeah, probably someone will come on and give the table

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.920
 a quick comb. And also you are allowed to kind of flatten it. If you see a bit come up a little bit,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.160
 you are allowed to flatten it. Mid game. Yeah, mid shot, like not mid shot, but just before your

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.240
 shot you're allowed to. Like a bit of the rugs rocked up. Yeah, you're just smoothing it out.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:53.120
 Mid shot would be like curling, wouldn't it? Yeah. That would be a game. So actually,

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.000
 Snooker isn't played on a Snooker table. He's played on a Billiards table.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.200
 What? Because Billiards was invented before it and then Snooker was played on the Billiards

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.720
 table and we still call it a Billiards table rather than a Snooker table officially.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.000
 So what gets played on a Snooker table? There's no such thing. There's no such thing as a

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.160
 Snooker table. Well, it's just another word for a Billiards table, I guess. Right. That's great.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.800
 And what's Billiards? So Billiards is a game where you have three balls only on the table

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.160
 and the rules say you get a point by either potting one of the balls

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.720
 or by hitting one ball onto the other. Right. And then if you get a point, you get another go.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.400
 And you get another go and another go and another go until you stop getting points and then your

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.120
 opponent comes on the table. Okay. So a bit like Snooker, your opponent sat there for quite a long

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:40.000
 time just watching you play. Yeah. But in 1907, a new technique was discovered where, you know,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.120
 the pockets in Snooker where the ball goes into. Yeah. What this guy called Walter Lovejoy

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:51.120
 managed to do was to get two balls stuck in the pocket. And so he could just tap these two balls

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.960
 every time and they would always hit the cushion or hit each other. Oh, wow. And he could do that

00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:01.040
 again and again and again and again. And there was a game a bit later between Tom Chapman and Tom

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:10.560
 Reese where Tom Reese managed to score 499,135 points by using this technique over 85 hours of 49

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:17.600
 minutes. Wow. Oh, what a tedious person. Is it illegal now as a technique or? It's illegal as

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.280
 a technique. And also like this record was never in the record books because all of the fans went

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:29.280
 home, the referee went home and even his opponent went home. Wow. That's so good. I worry about

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.520
 this guy's home life. It sounds like you didn't have much to go back to. I think it's great.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.840
 I didn't know the pocket Billiards was real. I thought it was a vulgar euphemism all my life and

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.240
 actually it's a proper game. And what is it? It's just a smaller version of Billiards. Oh.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.480
 Or it's slang for messing around with yourself. I would stop playing pocket Billiards is what

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.680
 you'd say to someone. Yeah. If they were masturbating in public. Yeah, right. Okay.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.960
 Just don't get them mixed up. That's how I say it. I thought I was getting away with it all this

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:06.560
 time. I think I'm playing Billiards. Oh, dear.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:18.320
 Okay. It is time for fact number two and that is Anna. My fact this week is that one of the major

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:25.520
 battles in the Cold War was to see who was better at squashing metal. Was it to get rid of the iron

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:32.800
 curtain? Brilliant. Oh, my God. Lovely. This is the heavy press program, which sounds kind of like

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.920
 a raunchy sexual program, but it wasn't. You get turned on by very different things to me, Anna.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:44.880
 No, I'm with Anna. It's coming around to my place for heavy press. I don't know. No,

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.880
 I'm just going to say I'll do some pocket Billiards.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:54.960
 The heavy press program was launched by the US in response to the fact that the USSR in the

00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:01.040
 1950s, it believed, had got very good at squashing metal. And the good thing about squashing metal

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.560
 is that it was a much better way of making airplanes. So it meant that you could put a huge

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.080
 ingot into a machine and squash it into the shape you wanted for a big bit of wing or something.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.240
 And that would mean that it would be a lighter aircraft, that if you just nailed together lots

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.760
 and lots of little bits, which is how you were making planes. I've seen images of this thing and

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.240
 it's so impressive. It's a ginormous structure, the one in America that we're going to get onto,

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.480
 which is a very famous one called the 50. You say it's very famous, but I think it's only known

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.880
 because there's this one guy who's just written a series of amazing articles about it. It's one in

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.280
 the Atlantic and other in the New York Times, who's just really into it. And that was in Cleveland,

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.720
 Ohio. It still exists today. So I think that they made 10 machines in the US and they made four

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.840
 pressing machines, whether you squash metal and six extrusion machines, where you squeeze it like

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.040
 toothpaste. Wow. And I think eight of them are still going today. It's nuts. At the moment,

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.760
 every single US military aircraft contains bits made by this 50 machine. By this one machine,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.160
 yeah. I mean, these are built in the 50s. They're still going today. The engineers of the 50 think

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:08.080
 it's going to be going in total for about 110 years. Can I add squires called the 50? I think it

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.280
 was because it would exert 50,000 tons of compressive force, which is the equivalent of being able

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:20.800
 to lift up 500 blue whales. Wow. And it's massive. It's 87 meters high, so it looks huge. It's so

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.880
 cool. Honestly, this really awoke something in me, this machine. This really brought my inner

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:32.400
 Clarkson to the fore. It's just really the most amazing machine in the world. It's just so cool.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.320
 It is. I think it's the size and the majesty of them. And there are lots of them. So there are

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.240
 those in the US. And then, well, as I said, in the Cold War, the reason it became a fight was

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.480
 because Germany was actually the best at making them. So Germany had all this technology in the

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.680
 Second World War for pressing metal that no one else had. And as part of the agreement after the

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:56.640
 Second World War, we divided things up. And the USSR got their biggest heavy press. So they got the

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.080
 30,000 pressing machine, 30,000 tonne pressing machine, whereas I think America only got about

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.560
 10,000 tonne one. And I ended up reading all of these CIA documents, spying on how Russia was

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.800
 using them and saying, what are they doing with this thing? They're incredibly boring, aside from

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.840
 the word secret at the top. But yeah, they had to transport it back in four specially made train

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.720
 carriages from Germany to the USSR. But yeah, America were like, oh no, they've got this now.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.120
 We'll have to make a big one. But it's all and it's partly it all partly relates back to the

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:30.560
 First World War, right? So in the First World War, again, lots of post-war reparations, Treaty

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.400
 of Versailles took a lot of things away from Germany. And there was a shortage of various

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.480
 key materials for the German economy and for the armaments and all this. So they developed the

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.400
 technique of press forging, which is where you press down on the diet just because it's more

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.520
 efficient. And the one thing they'd been allowed to keep or one of the things they were allowed

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.720
 to keep was their magnesium, right? The Allied power said we're not interested in your magnesium,

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.720
 so you can have that. But the problem is that the previous method of forging things is basically

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.200
 big hammer, smashes down, smashes up. Does it not explode if you hit magnesium?

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.800
 If you put it, I think you put water on it, isn't it? But it does crack. It doesn't forge well

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:12.880
 under the current forging conditions. And that's why Germany invented the technique of press forging

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.720
 because they were working with the materials they had and also they had to be as efficient as possible.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:22.000
 So once again, shot yourselves in the foot with Versailles, didn't you, allies? But then actually,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.200
 in playing the long game, you got the technology back. So sort of a nice score draw for the Treaty

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:32.800
 of Versailles. I think that's right, yes. I think the Treaty of Versailles is a foe of the podcast

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:39.520
 because we give it a right kick in this show, don't we? True. The highest pressure ever achieved

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.840
 is 770 gigapascals, which is more than twice the pressure in the inner core of the earth.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.160
 Okay. Yeah. What did we do it for? Well, it's just scientists in it.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:56.240
 They wanted to see what happens if you squash osmium really, really, really a lot.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.280
 And who's he? Richard Osmium. He's the Roman Richard Osmium.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.880
 It's the chemical element osmium and they really, really squashed it with all this pressure

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.840
 and they found out that it does not change its crystal structure. Wow. Well, sometimes you're

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.960
 going to go through that experiment to find out. It's as important to find out nothing as to find

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:22.400
 out something. I wonder if it's especially tough osmium or is it especially dense? Okay, that's

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:28.880
 cool. Surely. Otherwise, it seems silly if it's just. We'll start off by squashing a flump and see.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:38.080
 The biggest press now, I don't think get much press. It's in Vienna and it's made by an Italian

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:46.160
 company who would have thought. Not me. I don't see any reason why the Italians would be good at

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.480
 pressing. I suppose most industrial things like that are Russia and China, sometimes America,

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.560
 and they do have the other big ones. But an Italian company have made it in Vienna and it's

00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:01.200
 called Tyson. Is it to make lasagna sheets? It is. They can make a meatball that is as dense as the sun.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:10.400
 And yeah, that exerts 100,000 tons of force, which is the equivalent of being able to lift up

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.640
 100 Eiffel towers. Wow. Which is impressive. That is amazing. It is amazing. Is it used for the

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.360
 same just making like sheets of metal for airplanes and stuff? Yeah, they do lots of stuff with like

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:27.440
 oil and gas industry and wind turbines and nuclear and things you would imagine need loads of metal.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.640
 I was reading into humans crushing metal because that is, yeah, it's a thing. And it turns out

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.200
 there's a lot of Guinness World Records for people who have done that in the past. So one of the

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:44.960
 records I found was the most cans crushed with shoulder blades in one minute. Okay, so back

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.600
 shoulder blades. Yeah, so you're sort of moving them together to create the crush. What do you

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:56.560
 reckon in one minute? Well, okay, question. Yeah, is someone putting the cans in your shoulders after

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:02.080
 you have to place them there yourself because that feels tough. So the records held by Fabrizio

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:07.760
 Malito and another one for the Italians. Exactly. Yeah, crushing metal. It's just their forte.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.240
 And it was his brother, Frank, who would replenish the can in between the shoulder blades to be

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:19.440
 crushed. 84. You're not far off. 68. 68. That's 10 more than someone managed to do it with their

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.800
 head in one minute. So 58 achieved with their head. That's interesting, because if you ever

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.000
 crush a can these days, it's really easy. It's very, and that used to be seen as like a pop-eye

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.600
 or a manly roar kind of thing. It turns out that that did used to be that because cans were 40%

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.600
 stronger back in the day in terms of the material and the strength and the thickness. This really

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:45.120
 shows how old I am. But I remember when aluminium cans came in. And that they were much, much easier

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.440
 to crush. It used to be that you could buy cans of pop and some of them would be aluminium and some

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.200
 of them wouldn't be. Right. And the aluminium ones were way easier to crush. Were the previous ones

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.400
 steel? I suppose they must have been. I'm not really sure, but I just remember Blue Peter had a thing

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.680
 where everyone had to crush cans and send them for recycling in their 80s. Nice. And so we were

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.880
 all into can-crushing back then. Before Tamagotchi, so that was what it was, wasn't it?

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.120
 Can I read an introductory sentence to you? Yeah, sure. Is it from your new novel? It's

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.840
 from a piece about another kind of forging, which is a thing called drop forging. And it's in

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:25.840
 kadahi. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm pronouncing it wrong, Milwaukee. It begins like this, tucked away

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:32.800
 in a kadahi warehouse. Something big has been pounding away since 1959. But this is a huge

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.800
 great hammer. And this is the kind of thing where you just have a giant hammer to smash down on your

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:44.240
 metal and get it into the shape you want. Right. And this one, it weighs one million pounds. And

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:50.960
 it goes five floors above ground and also five floors below ground. So it's called a counterblow

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:57.040
 hammer, which is meaning that you are whacking above sides. Oh, cool. Yeah, on the below at the

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:03.600
 same time. Like a crocodile. It's so cool. It's just like flames and fire inside it. And it's just

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.880
 smashing away at these objects. Yeah, yeah. Basically, that hammer, that gigantic hammer has

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.120
 been in operation so long that you've got multiple generations of the same family who've been operating

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.240
 that hammer. It's been going since 1959. So there was a guy interviewed for this article saying,

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.560
 "Yeah, my grandfather worked on this hammer." I know. What would happen if you put just a person

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.440
 in there? Oh, they'd be in trouble. They'd be in such trouble. They'd get just squished. But I'd

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.880
 love to see what that like doesn't look like. Oh, no. It's not like when you frame Roger Rabbit.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.240
 You would not love to see that, I can say. You've become a perfect two-dimensional human.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.040
 It's a shame that's not on the list of options for like, you know, you've got classic burial,

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:50.080
 cremation, obliterated pine, bash. The flattening. Can I tell you one thing about a cool destruction

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:55.440
 engine from the 19th century? But this is great. This is, there was a great new scientist piece

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.520
 about it, and it was called the Victorian Monster Destruction Engine. Not its official name.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:08.800
 But it was made by an engineer called David Cacoldi, who's Scottish. And he was the chief engineer

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:16.320
 behind this machine, which existed to smash metal, to tear it, to twist it, to crunch it,

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:24.720
 to bop it, you know, to do all of this. And it was because before his work, you could not test

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.040
 the components of a bridge, say. So, you know, you just have to trust that the bridge you were

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.240
 building was strong enough. Yeah, you've got some rivets, you need to know whether they're

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.560
 going to hold if you put a load of pressure on it. How do you do that? Exactly that. And he built

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.520
 this gigantic machine. It was 116 tons, which at the time was huge. And its entire job was to

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.920
 tear things apart and it could measure the tonnage at which or the force that needed to be applied

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.880
 before things broke. And this changed engineering because, you know, there was the Tay Bridge disaster

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:56.480
 in Scotland. And they went down to the riverbed after this awful disaster had happened. Lots of

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.480
 people died and it was a really tragic event. A really bad bit of poetry was written about it

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:06.880
 famously by McGonagall. That's right. The Tay Bridge disaster disaster. And they went down and

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.600
 they got some of the lugs that had attached the bridge rods to the supporting columns. And it was

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.920
 found that they broke at 20 tons of pressure rather than the 60 that they should have done.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.640
 So that, you know, ruined the career of the engineer who had said, no, these are fine and

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.440
 these are strong enough to support the bridge. So I feel like they should have used buttresses

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.400
 as many a wise man confesses. It's a line from the poem. Is that genuinely a line from the poem?

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.560
 That's good memory. All the poems you could have memorised.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:38.720
 But yeah, he made loads of bridges as well, didn't he? And they were shipped all over the

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.120
 world because he was the first person ever to test these things. So the Sydney Harbour Bridge

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:49.200
 was all tested, but in his one machine, at the various bridges in London, Hammersmith Bridge.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.880
 The family thing, like Generations, the Festival of Britain in the 1950s,

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:58.800
 some of their structures were tested by his grandson. And I love this. It was certainly in

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:05.280
 2014 there in a museum, I think it's in Southwark. And there used to be on the top floor a museum of

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.480
 fractures, which was a collection of broken pieces of metal. But tragically during the Second World

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:16.960
 War, a bomb fell on it. And all the pieces came back together. It was like, what am I supposed to

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:30.960
 do with these? Find a pristine spitfire. Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:36.880
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 18th century America, you could tell a merchant from a lawyer

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:44.000
 just by looking at their handwriting. So the lawyer would put little hearts over the eyes.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.680
 This is insane. The merchant was dollar sign. Yeah, it's crazy, isn't it? I just didn't know this.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:57.600
 It was in an article in The Atlantic, I read it, an article by Rachel Gutman Way. And she wrote that

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:03.120
 there were different font types for different jobs. The handwriting of the merchants apparently

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.840
 was supposed to reflect the efficiency and speed with which they worked. And lawyers would have

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.000
 different scripts, aristocrats would have different scripts. And what would happen is,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.920
 it was, you would be in your guild or whatever, or you would be taught to do this job. And when

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.000
 you were being taught it, they would teach you particular ways of writing. So as the years went

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.280
 on, it would kind of get more and more enforced, this style of writing. Because doctors are the only

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.920
 people today who have reputedly got a particular kind of handwriting, which is terrible. Yeah.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.720
 I don't think that's a font, is it? Barscript. I feel like journalists. I've seen journalists

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.600
 doing fast writing. Short-hand. Yeah, short-hand, which feels very them. And that's a sort of

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.520
 separate language to notate. But this is, you're talking about the English language written. Yeah,

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.960
 so you would write the same words, but you'd be able to read them and you'd be able to say,

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.880
 this person is a merchant, this person is a... Could you masquerade? If I was a merchant,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.520
 I'm wanting to pretend to be a lawyer. I suppose you could, but it's a bit like forging signatures.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:03.040
 Is I guess it's difficult, right? Because your signature, you do naturally without thinking,

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:08.160
 whereas to forge it, it takes time and sometimes it's not very easy to do it exactly.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.600
 And you probably need other proofs that you're a lawyer. It probably wasn't that people would

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.760
 hire a lawyer by saying, can you just write your name on a bit of paper? Looks like a lawyer's

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:20.560
 handwriting to me. I'm in a Mrs Doubtfire scenario in my head. I'm the aristocrat and the nanny in

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:26.240
 this, what I'm trying to do. Right. Well, one thing that might work there is that men and women had

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.680
 different handwriting as well. That's so interesting. So men had more masculine handwriting

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.960
 they were taught, or muscular handwriting. What does that even mean? Well, muscular handwriting,

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.800
 according to someone called Carla Peterson, who is a professor of English at the University of

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:47.280
 Maryland, they used more pressure on the pen. Just holes in the paper. 50,000 tons of force

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:54.480
 on every letter. And women had more like an italic, cursive handwriting. What I thought was so

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:59.520
 interesting about this fact is that I hadn't really considered until now the fact that we were all

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.400
 taught a font. So basically the handwriting equivalent of font is script. And we were all

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:10.000
 taught a script. And of course we were. And when you see writing from the olden days, like if I

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.560
 look at collections of letters written by, like my grandparents had old letters written by their

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:19.600
 grandparents from the 19th century, the handwriting is so different. And that's because official

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:25.920
 styles changed. And so there was this thing called Spensarian scripts in the 1900s, which

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:32.720
 President Garfield called the pride of our country. America's done so much stuff. That's

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.640
 the biggest one. Is that the biggie? That's the biggest Spensarian. The guy who came up with this,

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:42.640
 Platt Rogers Spencer, said he was inspired by pebbles on a beach and is sloping. It's got to

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:49.360
 be at an exact angle of 52 degrees, sloping forwards and slightly rounded. Okay. And it

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.760
 was that like basically Americans would write that like that. Yes. Because I know like, for

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:59.040
 instance, my wife writes in a Russian font, which is different than an English font for sure.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.480
 Yes. Yeah, yeah. There's lots of chat about the different ways that different European

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:08.080
 countries still write. So Platt Rogers Spencer spent so much time trying to get it to be the

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.600
 standard writing style they were teaching in schools and so on. To the point where it feels

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.560
 very missionary when he died, his sons then took textbooks of it and they sort of went out and

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.840
 campaigned for it to be changed. Have you tried this font style? Even go to schools and hand them

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.640
 and this sort of people start reading the books. No, don't read the words. Just look at the letters.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:32.000
 Yeah, exactly. So weird. Yeah. And then it did get taken over by a thing called Zana Bloso method,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.800
 and then that eventually got taken over by another. So we've got generational changes within how we

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.360
 write. You can tell when texts come from right because you can, there's a thing called paleography.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:45.200
 Is that it? It's old writing and it's the study of old writing. Your course is in it because if

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:50.800
 you look at a text from hundreds of years ago, even if it's in English, it's going to be really

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.040
 hard to decipher. It's hard to recognize time travel, as I suppose, is that they have different

00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:00.080
 handwriting. Yes, it'd be so obvious if someone suddenly started writing in that gothic script

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.640
 that as you say, you can barely read it. It looks so different, doesn't it? So hard to distinguish.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.440
 I was thinking people from the future might write, like for instance, in block capitals or something.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:17.600
 Hello. Oh, wow. Busted. So Spenserian just very quickly, before we wrap up on that,

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.200
 that did go out and these other fonts took over, but it did embed itself in society,

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.760
 and we see it virtually every day. So it was a win for Plat and Rogers.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.320
 It's understandable. Oh, yeah, it should be. Think of...

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:34.400
 Ingredients lists on packets of food. Oh, they're always in handwriting, aren't they?

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:41.040
 Okay, okay, okay. I'm just warming up. Something that's in handwriting. Yeah.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:46.240
 Okay, there was something on a banknote, like the code promise to pay the bearer.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:52.320
 No, it's a logo. It's a logo in handwriting. It is a great call.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.720
 It is a food and drink product and it is not anything that you've said. It's a drink.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.080
 Coke. Coke. Coke-a-cola. Coke-a-cola.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.480
 That lovely... You're right. That rounded cursive. That rounded cursive. I forgot what the question was.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:10.800
 So it was basically phased out Spenserian, but he managed to have an impact saying,

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:16.000
 and Ford Cars is also the way that Ford has written is based on Spenserian.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.200
 That is great. What a legacy. That's a great legacy.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.520
 That's kind of time travel, but the normal way around, you know, like a survivor.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.280
 It's like those animals that you find, which, oh, we thought you went extinct 130 million years ago,

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.560
 but here you are swimming around. Like a sealant camp of handwriting.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.760
 Yeah, it's a Coca-Cola camp.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:38.400
 Could you set me up for that, Joe? No.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.640
 I felt like it. I felt like I walked straight into a fur trap there.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.080
 We should probably say that handwriting evolves for practical reasons.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.440
 So it was all about these people saying, this is a quicker way to write,

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.240
 and this is an easier way to write. This is an easier way to teach.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.560
 Or the reason that Gothic, which was invented in the 12th century-ish,

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.640
 that was quite squashed up, and it was because there was parchment shortages,

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.600
 and so you could fit much more on the page.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.440
 So it's all practicalities, which feels relevant when it's enforced today,

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.680
 because people say, isn't it sad that no one learns proper cursive anymore,

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.720
 and there are a number of American states that enforce it legally,

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.000
 and there isn't really evidence that there's particularly a purpose.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.520
 Cursive has just joined up handwriting, right?

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.200
 Yes. I can tell you a lot about someone, their handwriting.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.880
 Well, no, it can't really. But they can tell you how drunk they are.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.880
 Well, that's good. Of all these kind of graphology things,

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.000
 which is you're supposed to be able to tell people's personality or whatever,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.960
 from their handwriting, most of it does seem to be mediopie,

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.200
 but definitely for sure, the height of ascending letters,

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.040
 height of descending letters, spacing between words, tremors,

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:51.280
 bit of sick on the page, the height of the upper and lower case letters,

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.840
 all changes depending on how much alcohol you've had.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.360
 That's good. That's very good.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.680
 That's got to be one of the most pointless studies ever done

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.880
 writing declines with alcoholism.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.080
 Did you find the B.I.G.?

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.240
 Notorious.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.640
 Notorious British Institute of Graphologists.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:11.600
 They're real.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.800
 They're pretty hardcore on there.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.080
 They are. That's really funny.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.800
 And their claim, and I think I'm not, I don't think it's backed up by solid evidence,

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.080
 is that it's better than therapy, because actually with therapy,

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.320
 you can only know what the client has told you.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:24.800
 Okay.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.520
 Whereas with graphology, you just look at the writing and you say,

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.680
 "Well, that's disgusting. I can't believe you had that dream."

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.640
 Or whatever, you know.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.400
 You're not a merchant, you're a lawyer.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:39.040
 We did a debunk of graphology on QI once and got very angry emails.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.040
 And letters didn't we?

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.680
 And written.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.800
 Yeah, we got one letter from a graphologist saying that

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.520
 some of the evidence is, if you get a pen and put it in your mouth

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.360
 and try and write something on a piece of paper,

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.920
 you'll use the same movements as if you were to do it with your hand.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.280
 Like so Andy would write it with his same sort of spidery hand writing

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.200
 with his mouth as he would with his hand.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.320
 And that's evidence that it's coming directly from your brain

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.760
 as opposed to being something in your hands or whatever, hasn't it?

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.440
 Inherent in yourself the shape of your letters.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.480
 Is that claim true in either sense?

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.560
 Like, is it true that there's any correlation to your mouth and hand

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.080
 or that you could draw that conclusion?

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.360
 All I'm giving is both sides of the story, like I'm on the BBC.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.880
 Good on you, mate.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.080
 But no, that's what they claim.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.520
 But of course, you know, I think these days we think that it's nonsense.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.440
 Unless you're listening to this podcast on BBC Sounds,

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.640
 in which case, the jury's out.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:38.640
 I do wonder if we were able to bring back certain people from history

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.800
 and just say, "Oh, I love your book," called that.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.640
 And they go, "That's not what that's called."

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.560
 And it's because they're bad handwriting.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.120
 And there's a few cases where people claim this is a thing.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.000
 So apparently, Beethoven's piece for Elise.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.120
 Apparently, that's not the title.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.640
 What? It's called "Furry Leaves."

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.880
 Apparently, it's for Therese.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.600
 No.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.120
 Yeah, it's Therese or Therese.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.080
 It's either that.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:00.480
 No way.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.920
 Yeah, but his handwriting is so dodgy that it just, it's,

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.040
 well, we'll just go with Elise.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.600
 Are all the notes different as well?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.840
 That's so funny.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.360
 Well, if you're worried about bad handwriting,

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.040
 which I always was in exams,

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.520
 because I have quite a legible small handwriting,

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.840
 and I always thought they're never going to read this gold.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.920
 I happened to be on the OCR,

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.680
 which is one of the famous exam boards.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.400
 OCR exam board page, FAQ's page,

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.600
 and they clarified examiners are experienced at reading

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.360
 a wide range of handwriting.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.800
 And if one examiner can't read it,

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.280
 it gets passed to another one, and so on.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:35.680
 Wow.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.200
 So I think if your handwriting's bad,

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.080
 it just goes, gets passed to 20 different examiners.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:40.640
 That's so funny.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.840
 I knew where it would end up.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.240
 Where?

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:45.200
 At the very end, there is a lady on the Isle of Man

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.000
 who runs a firm called Transcription Services,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.680
 and almost no one does what she does.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:53.200
 She is just phenomenal at reading handwriting.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:53.600
 Really?

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.800
 Specifically old writing.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.280
 Like the work by William Wiseworth,

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.400
 the Brontes, John Dunn,

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.520
 it's all passed to her in the Isle of Man,

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.520
 and she's just amazing at it.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.520
 And that is paleography.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.160
 Yeah, one person who was really difficult to decipher

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.520
 was Catherine Mansfield.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.360
 I was reading about the New Zealand short story person.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.520
 Her handwriting was so bad that when she died

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.080
 and left 53 handwritten notebooks,

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.560
 it took decades to decipher them.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.200
 Wow.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.960
 And the person who was doing it

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.320
 once spent an entire week trying to decipher a single word.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:34.240
 So the way you write can kind of show where you're from.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.280
 I thought this was really interesting.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.120
 So the way you write a T, for instance,

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.320
 which bit do you write first?

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.920
 The width.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.480
 I don't even know.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.200
 I go the top.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.040
 I don't do the cross, basically.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.320
 You don't cross your T's?

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:44.800
 No, I do that.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.120
 Oh, right.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.520
 OK, yeah.

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.240
 You don't cross your T's, imagine that.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.280
 I'll see you in the burrow.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.920
 See you later.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.120
 So presumably, oh, Dan actually,

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.320
 what do you write first?

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:58.720
 Well.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.720
 You write all in capital, so it's kind of relevant.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.120
 Who writes the cross bit first?

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:03.680
 Well.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.360
 What's the cross bit, do you mean?

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.840
 The cross your T's, the bit that goes across.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.320
 I do.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:08.800
 I do.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.520
 You write the cross first?

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.800
 OK, here, if I was writing that in lower case, I go.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.160
 Guys, do you know what's so fascinating about this?

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.040
 Right.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:17.520
 Do it again.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.520
 What does Dan, what can Dan also write

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.720
 that none of the rest of us can?

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.120
 Brilliant books about weird beliefs.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.840
 All right, I don't think you can write this.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:27.680
 What can he speak and where was he brought up?

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:27.920
 Oh.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.240
 Mandarin.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:30.960
 Australian slang.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.520
 Mandarin.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.120
 Australian slang, yes.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.360
 It's Mandarin writers, writing lots of little short dashes.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.400
 And so it makes sense for them to write, when they learn English,

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.160
 they tend to write the cross of the T first.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.160
 Because it's lots of little figures.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:44.800
 How interesting.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.440
 Whereas we would always write,

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.200
 and there's lots of little stuff like that.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.520
 In Koreans, they write nine backwards.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.880
 Do you write your lines backwards, Dan?

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.320
 No, I, well, I don't know.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.760
 You might tell me now that I do.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.560
 I write it like that.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.720
 No, that's like every other night tonight.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.200
 That's normal.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.280
 I wonder if I've got a cultural mesh going on,

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.600
 because I will start that like that,

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.120
 but then I'll do that to end it.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:03.600
 Wow.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:03.920
 Yeah.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.680
 Gosh.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.280
 Interesting, because I've never seen you write

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.480
 in lower case before.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.520
 Yeah, I didn't know you could.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.680
 I am Casemore.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:16.640
 Wow.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.440
 I'm so sorry.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.200
 What do you think, the school I went to taught?

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.400
 Well, let's not go there.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:32.320
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.760
 and that is Andy.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.120
 My fact is that the sun is surrounded by a layer of moss.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.360
 Hey.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.960
 Is it?

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.600
 Space moss.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.920
 I mean, it obviously isn't happening.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:49.120
 So this is a thing which industry experts, sun experts.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:49.680
 Industry?

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.600
 Astronomers.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.440
 Big science brains.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.720
 They call moss.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.200
 I love this.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.360
 So this is in the sun's corona.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.960
 We're outside the sun itself,

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.080
 and there are areas where the sun's magnetic field bursts out,

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.040
 and gas flow, the gas that makes up the sun,

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.720
 flows around these huge loops,

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.760
 and then spears back down into the thing.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.280
 It's all really, it's awesome.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.800
 Anyway, and the moss is these sort of lacy patterns

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.680
 around the corona and around those corona loops,

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.440
 around the feet of them, if you like.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.640
 It's a term that NASA uses,

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.080
 and lots of other astronomers use it.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:26.000
 Of all the sexy words you can use for lace-like structures,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.520
 to use moss, I feel like.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.080
 Yeah, what would you have gone for?

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:30.640
 Well, lace.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.600
 Lingerie.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.160
 Lace.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.040
 Negligent.

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.760
 That's quite a cool, yeah.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.320
 Yeah.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.120
 I do think of it when I was reading about it.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.640
 Yeah, you've described it pretty well there.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.160
 It looks like a rainbow,

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.520
 if you look at these coronal loops,

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.280
 and the moss is sort of at the bottom of them,

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.080
 so it's like the gold at the bottom of a rainbow.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:50.720
 Very nice.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.440
 Lovely.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.560
 What's really weird is I read that this is the case.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.000
 There may be other reasons for it,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.720
 but the reason those loops come out, at all,

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.680
 is largely to do with the rotation of the sun.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.400
 Right.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.840
 Yeah, so you've got basically,

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.560
 it takes 25 days at the equator to rotate,

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.120
 but at the poles, it takes 33 days.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.560
 So you have this bit overtaking the outside,

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.040
 and it sort of snaps, and it creates these big loops.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.600
 It's sort of running past itself in a,

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.040
 it's the weird rotation,

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.560
 the double rotation of the planet.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.080
 Yeah, because it's all gas,

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.000
 so it kind of feels natural, right,

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.760
 that it would rotate at different levels.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.680
 But yeah, that chaos that's generated.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.240
 Yeah.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.080
 But it seems like we still don't know a lot about the sun,

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.120
 which is quite exciting,

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.880
 and they're still discovering stuff about it, aren't they?

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.720
 I mean, this is all linked to that eternal mystery,

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.760
 that why is the sun's atmosphere,

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.560
 the bit just above the surface of the sun, so hot?

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.080
 So I think we might have mentioned before.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.000
 So hotter than the surface or even the core?

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.600
 It's the hottest there, is that what you're saying?

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.040
 It's hotter than the surface, definitely.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.480
 I'm not sure if it's hotter than the very core.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.640
 Yeah, it's so much hotter.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.280
 So the surface of the sun is about 6,000 degrees Celsius.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.880
 I think we can all agree, very hot.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.360
 Yeah.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:42:59.920
 Well.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:05.760
 But the corona, the atmosphere, is 1 million and 6,000 degrees Celsius.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.280
 It's a million degrees hotter.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.600
 And do you know that even NASA says that there are flares,

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.280
 which they think might be between 10 and 40 million degrees Celsius?

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.120
 Wow, 40 million degrees.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.120
 So the sun's rotating, producing magnetic field, right?

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:17.600
 Yeah.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:21.040
 And then these lines of magnetic force, they get tangled,

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.040
 and they build up pressure and they snap.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.320
 And most of the energy goes outwards,

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.080
 but some of it goes back inwards, into the sun.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.680
 And the particles in the sun's lower atmosphere,

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.280
 they build up this pressure wave and it penetrates deep into the sun.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.040
 And it becomes a sunquake.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.880
 Just everything starts sounding like a cool title for a metal album.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.320
 Sunquake.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:42.800
 Sunquake.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.360
 I've been going around singing Sunquake.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.600
 There's a group called the Solar Wind Sherpas,

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.280
 who also sound pretty cool and metal.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.560
 So they're a band.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.840
 No, they're a group of scientists.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:56.560
 But just anything sun related, like coronal moss, or whatever.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.240
 That one doesn't quite work, I gotta say.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:58.720
 Okay.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.920
 It's not metal, I don't think that one.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.840
 No matter how much you put that voice on.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.880
 Okay, okay, okay.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.800
 Quite similarly, you get solar rain,

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.200
 which is actually lumps of plasma

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.360
 that fall down from these coronal rainbow loops.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.000
 And when they splash into the chromosphere,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.480
 the bit in between the atmosphere and the surface,

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.840
 they make a big splash and they send up loads more plasma.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.280
 We are chromosphere.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.200
 This is our album, Solar Rain.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:21.920
 What about that?

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:22.240
 Yeah, it's good.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.160
 We are the Solar Hedge Row.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.440
 What about that?

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:29.040
 It's a bit rural, bit rustic, but nice.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.480
 Yeah, maybe like the muscles.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.840
 I mean, it's not that interesting.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.600
 It's just like filaments of mossy-like stuff from the sun

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.520
 that create loops that go in like a line, like a hedge row might.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.680
 But it is an official term apparently.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.160
 That's cool.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.240
 Do you know who is the first person to take a photo

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.080
 of these filaments on the sun?

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.320
 Oh, it's almost.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.440
 Is someone we've heard of?

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:49.840
 Oh, no.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.840
 That narrows it down.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.720
 That narrows it down.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.920
 You might have come across her name.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.440
 Annie Monda, she was called.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:03.360
 And she was married to Edward Walter Monda.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.720
 And she was probably the last of what was called the lady computers.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:11.200
 So towards the end of the 19th century,

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:16.080
 this is obviously there were computers like for the space race and stuff like that.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.960
 But these were women who would do the calculations

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.760
 when astronomers would come up with loads of data.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.880
 They would give them to the women

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.280
 and the women would work them out and work out what was going on.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.240
 Amazing, right.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.960
 And also the Monda minimum is named after her,

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.920
 which you might have heard,

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.880
 which was a time in the 17th century when all sunspots disappeared.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.440
 Was that when it got very cold?

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.960
 Yeah, the little ice age.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:37.600
 Exactly.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.800
 Was that the Monda minimum?

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.680
 But it's named after her.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.120
 And her husband as well, yeah.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.880
 Yeah, that's awesome.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.680
 But so she's coming through data to find all this stuff.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.960
 So amateur photographer on the side.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.600
 She was also a photographer on the side, yeah, yeah.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.800
 And she and her husband did photographs of the sun.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.560
 And we're doing it all the time, basically.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.760
 Whenever there was a clear day,

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.600
 they would go out and photograph the sun.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.880
 How do you photograph the sun with that?

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.240
 You need a special filter to stop hurting your eyes, obviously.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.000
 There are lots of different ways of doing it.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.800
 And like, for instance, you can do it with a pinhole camera.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.880
 I think you could largely just point it in the direction

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.640
 and press snap, can't you?

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.840
 I think if you do that and you send the photos to Boots,

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.200
 you're going to get a sticker on them.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.840
 In Britain, you can photograph the sun pretty easily.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.520
 The sort of vague, white dot on screen by Cloud.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.200
 That reminds me of the warnings

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.440
 when there are eclipses about what they can do to your eyes.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.160
 I've been sort of mad to very extents over the years,

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.440
 but I was reading about the eclipse in Melbourne in 1976.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.240
 I think it was.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.520
 When there was this doctor who sort of spread panic

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.920
 around the city saying there could be an epidemic

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.120
 of thousands of kids being completely blind.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.560
 Because all you need to do is look at that

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.480
 for a couple of seconds and you can go blind.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.400
 Now, it's not, it is exaggerated, the scare mongering,

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.280
 but it scared Melbourne into watching it from inside.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.760
 So 2 million of the 2.5 million people there

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.880
 watched it on their tellies.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.120
 It is a problem, I think, with the eclipse,

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.360
 which is it is bad for you.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.680
 And you can't say it's not bad for you,

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.080
 but pretty much all the time everyone says

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.840
 it's worse for you than it actually is.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.440
 I think that's the problem.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.240
 So when Trump famously looked at the sun,

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.520
 that wouldn't have done.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.640
 It depends how long you do it for.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.120
 I think you can tell if it's doing damage.

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.920
 Bloody left-wing media spinning these stories to make him--

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:22.720
 We're not saying.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.480
 We're not saying you should go and look at the sun.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.400
 That's the problem is you can't say that.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.080
 You can't say go out and look at the sun.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.880
 Brilliant idea.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.320
 I would say give Trump a break.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.200
 That's what I'm saying.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.640
 But yeah, it's like you've looked at the sun

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.120
 every now and then by accident for a second or so, right?

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.400
 And you're like, oh, that hurt my eyes,

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.080
 but you didn't go blind at any stage.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.520
 No, because it's the eclipse.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.960
 Isn't there a risk that people are going to try

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.320
 and look for longer than the tiny, tiny glimpse

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.120
 that might not do you any harm?

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.040
 But it feels so much common sense

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.640
 that the only people who do get in trouble,

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.840
 and I think this was true in Britain when we had it in 1999,

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.680
 are people who had lots of drugs.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.120
 So there was a girl who'd taken lots of speed

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.120
 who stared at the eclipse for half an hour,

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.200
 and she did have some permanent eye damage.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.520
 Isaac Newton, that was a story that he stared at the sun

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.120
 in that sense impartially blinded.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.800
 That was deliberately for an experiment

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.320
 to see what would happen if he stared at the sun.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.720
 So you can be very, very clever and also very, very stupid.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:12.880
 So I think it's just good to wear on the side of court

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.760
 and say never look anywhere.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.880
 I think that's fair.

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.080
 But I think one bit of good news is if you do go blind

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.600
 for staring at the sun for too long,

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.280
 is that there's a new invention

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.920
 that allows blind people to enjoy eclipses.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.360
 Really?

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.120
 Yeah, it's called light sound,

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.240
 and it sort of measures and translates the sky's brightness

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.440
 and turns it into music.

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.560
 And so you can like put your headphones in,

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.720
 and apparently it gives a really good impression

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.920
 of the change of the sun

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.840
 and the change of the brightness that's happening.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.880
 That was so cool.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:41.600
 That was so cool.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.000
 Yeah.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:42.880
 That's amazing.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:43.520
 That's awesome.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.680
 Milosevic scared his people underground.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.640
 Slobodan.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.680
 Or Aston Villa striker Savo Milosevic.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.840
 I think it was Slobodan though,

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.200
 of course I haven't written it down,

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.760
 but whichever one was ruling Serbia in the 90s.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:02.080
 Yeah, he said that it would make you urinate really frequently

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.360
 and get heart palpitations.

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.240
 And everyone literally went inside,

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.360
 pulled all their curtains down.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.480
 They were calling help lines saying,

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.920
 is it safe to watch it on telly?

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:10.560
 Wow.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.200
 That like no one went outside public transport all stopped.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.040
 So the whole of the rest of Europe flooded outside

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.160
 to watch the eclipse,

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.440
 and all of Serbia retreated underground and indoors.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.280
 Did he have motives that we know now?

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.480
 Well, was that a weird, the urination thing?

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.440
 Well, what was where did that come from?

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.120
 No, I agree, because no, I don't know.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.080
 I don't know why.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.400
 There was actually a paper saying what were his motivations,

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.560
 and I couldn't download the full thing.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.600
 So we'll never know.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:38.480
 No one, apart from people who could afford 24.99,

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.280
 will ever know.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.760
 But I can tell you that animal rights activists

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.080
 sent sunglasses to the chimps in the zoo.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.280
 So scared, were they?

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.000
 Gosh.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.600
 Golly.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.440
 I think one of the coolest things I read

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.400
 as part of this research is that you got the sun,

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.280
 we're just staring at it,

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.800
 we're trying to work out what's going on with it.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.000
 We got nothing to compare it to.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 But we got nothing to compare it to.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.200
 And that's not true anymore.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.560
 And it's not been true for a while,

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.040
 because the Kepler Space Telescope,

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.480
 back when it was operating,

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.520
 monitored 150,000 stars in the Milky Way,

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:17.360
 and they found 369 suns that are incredibly similar to ours.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.640
 And so now we can look at other case studies,

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.080
 as it were, and go,

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.440
 "Oh, this is interesting.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.280
 That sun is very active at the moment."

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.280
 And it wasn't 10, 11 years ago.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.120
 That must mean that it's running in phases.

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.280
 So we can learn via these suns

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.040
 that are billions of miles away about our own sun.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.640
 Yeah, because there are a lot of scientists

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.800
 that look at our sun as a curiosity

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.840
 compared to other suns,

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.480
 in that they say it's spectacularly boring

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.240
 in comparison to all the other suns

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.760
 that we're seeing in the universe.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.920
 And they partially wonder if that's why we're here at all.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.040
 Yeah, that must be right.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.360
 Because if it starts spitting out stuff at us

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.840
 every two or three years, we're going to die.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.480
 Exactly. So our sun is just not that active,

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.080
 and that's been incredible for us.

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.720
 It has. And I think actually with the election coming up,

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:04.400
 sometimes you want a boring center of your universe,

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.160
 don't you? Because it can be relied upon.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.400
 To not destroy you.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.120
 That is a political broadcast for Kier Starman.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:14.000
 Don't know what you're talking about.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.880
 We actually had someone write in who was a space weather forecaster.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:17.520
 Oh, I know.

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.480
 To the fish inbox.

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:18.880
 Really?

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.600
 This is cool.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.720
 He's called Gavin Medley.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.640
 What? Dark with no weather again.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.640
 He works at the LASP,

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.360
 which is the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics

00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.640
 at the University of Colorado.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.800
 And he was writing about the, you know,

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.440
 if the sun emits a giant electromagnetic storm,

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.680
 we won't get warning before it hits us.

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.520
 But there are space weather instruments

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:43.440
 that sit on spacecraft at Lagrange points,

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.080
 and they just sit there in gravitational equilibrium.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.680
 And one of their goals is to collect data

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.640
 to predict and warn about solar storms and flares,

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.160
 which can take down our electrical structure.

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.080
 And that's how we knew like a few weeks ago

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.680
 when they had that big solar storm

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.040
 that people in London couldn't see,

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.720
 but everyone else in the country could see.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.840
 Yeah. The aurora.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.400
 The aurora. We know about that because of those things.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.040
 Yeah.

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.720
 By the way, we're in the most exciting year for the sun

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.560
 in 11 years, loads of sunspots.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:06.880
 Oh.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.040
 'Cause the sun switches poles every 11 years.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:09.280
 Yeah.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:12.160
 So the most boring year was 2019,

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.000
 and that was like hardly any sunspots,

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 because the poles were just like perfectly aligned

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.480
 north and south, and now we're in the most feisty year,

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.400
 which I think might be why they've discovered this thing

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.520
 that your main fact was about,

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.600
 is because it feels like as a scientist,

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.280
 it's the most thrilling time to look at the sun,

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.120
 'cause so much mad shit's going on there.

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:31.680
 So if one of these big coronal mass ejections hits us,

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.440
 we're kind of buggered a little bit, right?

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.360
 All of our electronics are going to fry,

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.640
 and until they fix it, it's going to be pretty tough.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.680
 And we knew that this big one was coming a few weeks ago,

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.240
 and I was in Wales in the middle of nowhere,

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.320
 and so I got a load of cash out of the cash machine

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.440
 just in case, all of the cash machines got back genuinely.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.560
 Just subtle prepper.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.360
 I love it.

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.600
 Your cash is no good in the aftertimes.

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.840
 But it'll get me home.

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.200
 Like all I had to do was get home.

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.560
 I have an electric car, right?

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:01.200
 So if I'm stuck in Wales with an electric car,

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.800
 and all the electrics are fried,

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.080
 I am kind of buggered.

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.080
 I'm not necessarily buggered if you have to stay in Wales, James.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:06.560
 Come on.

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.520
 Good people of Wales.

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.160
 Great place to be stranded for a while.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.520
 No, it's a great place to be,

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.960
 but it's not ideal for the rest of my family if I'm in Wales.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.720
 James's electric tin opener is in London.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:16.240
 That's what he's getting back to.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.120
 Oh, he brings that with him.

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.800
 I keep that in a lead-lined case,

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.960
 a case of a coronal mass ejection.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.280
 But there's a theory, right?

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:30.880
 So we could fire out a big loop of wire into space.

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.400
 So the entire earth is covered by one wire.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:34.880
 Okay.

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.240
 And then when the coronal mass ejection comes in,

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.400
 which is basically charged particles,

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.320
 then the wire can kind of ground it,

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.800
 and it won't fry all of our electricity.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:45.280
 That's interesting.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.240
 It's a really good idea.

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.160
 No one's really taken the idea seriously,

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:53.280
 but they reckon that the loop would cost about $100 billion to make.

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.880
 But if we did get hit by one of those coronal mass ejections,

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.480
 which will happen sometime,

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.480
 the cost will be way more than that.

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.040
 Yeah.

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.800
 Wait, wait, it'll be in the trillions.

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.440
 It will fuck up our economy for years.

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.880
 Actually, $100 billion.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.880
 Sounds a lot, but actually, you know,

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.640
 a lot of things, when you read about it in the paper,

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.400
 it's like $600 billion.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.920
 Oh, okay, yeah.

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.120
 We clubbed together.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:15.360
 Yeah.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:16.080
 We didn't deal with that.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.760
 Well, how much did you get out of the cash point the other day?

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:24.400
 There's a big queue behind James.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.920
 His limit's 200 a time.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.160
 It's only $20 million a time there.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:28.960
 Let me take out.
