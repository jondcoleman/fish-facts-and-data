00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,240
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish!

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,800
 Before we start, a little bit of news that is very important to Anna and I, and

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,960
 that is that our new book is finally out in

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,440
 paperback! Woohoo! I know that might not seem like a big deal to you,

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,760
 but honestly this is a real chance for us to get more people

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,120
 reading this book. One very interesting thing to say is

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,040
 that the book has had a name change. What used to be called

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,400
 "Everything to Play For" is now called "A Load of Old

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,160
 Balls - The QI History of Sport" by James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski. A lot of people

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,800
 have said to us, "Why did you not call it that in the first place?"

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,000
 I'm not sure if they're being rude, I hope not, because it is a book

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,120
 full of the most interesting facts and stories about sport you can possibly

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,960
 imagine. Even if you're not into sport, probably this

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,720
 summer you will notice that everyone's off watching the Euros, everyone's off

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,760
 watching the Olympics. Perhaps you don't really have much to say

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,240
 to those people when it comes up at a dinner party,

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,480
 we'll read our book and you will be the pinnacle of all sporting knowledge and

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,560
 all quite interesting sporting knowledge at that. As you imagine from me and Anna,

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,320
 it's just full of silly stories, fun facts. We spent so much time doing loads of

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,360
 in-depth research in there that even if you are the kind of person who's

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,800
 watching every single sporting event this summer, there will be loads of stuff

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,880
 in there that you didn't know. So if you go to anywhere where you would

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,800
 normally buy your books, then look for a load of old balls,

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,400
 the QI History of Sport or search for our names, James Harkin and Anna

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,480
 Tyshinski and you will find that book. Please do buy it, it would

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,480
 mean the world to us if you did. Of course we're going on tour, don't forget

28
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,400
 that people in Scotland, Wales, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,480
 do get your tickets very very soon. A lot of them are sold out. I know we've got

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,680
 quite a few tickets left for the Scottish Dates in Edinburgh

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,880
 and Glasgow and I think quite a few for the show in Cardiff.

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,080
 So if you're in any of those cities then do get your tickets

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,000
 but actually you know go to gnosisthingsthefish.com/live and you will

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,280
 see all of the dates where we're playing and hopefully one of them will be

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,040
 near you. Okay not much more to say apart from

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,840
 on with the podcast.

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,160
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Shriver and

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,240
 sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin and

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,280
 once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,480
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,720
 here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is my fact.

43
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,000
 My fact this week is that snooker games on cruise ships

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,880
 are sometimes played with flat balls.

45
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,720
 Are we talking about the balls on the table, are they?

46
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,680
 The men playing. Yeah this is this is obvious when you think about it.

47
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,320
 Oh it's so obvious. It's so obvious when you think about it. I don't really know

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,280
 how you could place a nooker on a cruise ship with a ball-shaped ball

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,680
 actually on a rough cruise ship. We'll get to that in a

50
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,440
 sec because you can and there's a pretty awesome way that you do that but

51
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,280
 this I got from a book that's written by an Australian comedian called Hung Lee.

52
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,720
 It's called The Crappiest Refugee. He tells the story of

53
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
 from immigrant boat to cruise ship comedian. Anyway he wrote this book and

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,960
 inside the book he mentions that he's seeing a bunch of guys playing on a

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,720
 pool table or a snooker table and they are hitting with puck-like objects

56
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,680
 because obviously in the rough seas the balls are going to be rolling around

57
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
 and so there will be cruise ships out there that have these tables on them.

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,520
 And the idea I think is like you know air hockey, it's those kind of like

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,720
 puck things, isn't it? Exactly. Now to your point Anna,

60
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,080
 a modern day cruise ship does have pool tables or snooker tables,

61
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,600
 billiards, but they use gyroscopic technology.

62
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,440
 What? So it's amazing. No. It's honestly I've watched videos of it online.

63
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,200
 It's so cool because basically while the rest of the ship is moving

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,160
 the pool table isn't. That's insane. That's the top of the pool table.

65
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
 That's a high-end cruise ship. It is incredible.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I've read stories of people finding it so fascinating that like staring to fire

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,760
 sometimes people will just go and sit and watch it as it doesn't sway.

68
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,960
 There's even stories of crew members that when they get particularly sick

69
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,120
 they'll go and sleep on the pool table because the seasickness is getting to

70
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,200
 them. It's not moving so you can have a restful night.

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,520
 Which begs the question, why isn't every bed on a boat gyroscopic?

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
 Probably price. Cost. Yeah.

73
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,640
 How good is the correction mechanism? Like if you have a Titanic situation

74
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,520
 how long can you continue with your game of snooker?

75
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,320
 So it goes vertical. I see that.

76
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,760
 So I met someone who was a dancer on cruise ships for a while.

77
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,680
 This sounds like a good anecdote.

78
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840
 She did the musicals because they often have a theatre on board and

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,280
 sometimes a show and she said that the most difficult one she'd ever done

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,800
 was Starlight Express where you're on roller skates.

81
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,480
 She said in rough weather you would set off across the stage and you didn't

82
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,520
 know how soon you were going to arrive because it might be that you caught

83
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,640
 the ship moved with you and suddenly you're there for half a second

84
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,560
 or you're going against it and you just roll backwards.

85
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,720
 So yeah snooker. It's a good sport. Mostly not played at sea.

86
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,000
 Largely it's a land-based game isn't it? A land lovers game.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,600
 I did watch a tiktok yesterday just coincidentally of people playing on the

88
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,520
 beach that looked really cool. Snooker.

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,320
 It was pool actually but they kind of dug holes

90
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,720
 for the pockets and then we just hit the bowls. Oh so they played on actual sand?

91
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,760
 Yeah yeah. There's no facts to this but it did look pretty cool.

92
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,760
 I'm amazed that snooker in any form has made it to tiktok because snooker is

93
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,960
 famously quite a long game to watch. Tiktok is not a long format.

94
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,720
 Andy honestly if you could see my tiktok it's just snooker, golf, cricket.

95
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
 It's the dullest tiktok because he just suggests things that you like doesn't

96
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,840
 it and it just works out what you like. I reckon if you were on tiktok which I

97
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,040
 bet you're not but you would just get moss video after moss video.

98
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,240
 Yeah that sounds very economic. It's amazing how it works.

99
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,360
 But it is very slow isn't it? It's all rather it takes a long time.

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,360
 You play lots of frames in the course of a match and it's interesting

101
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,040
 because for anyone who doesn't follow snooker only one person is playing at a time.

102
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,000
 That's weird. Will you play a frame right?

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,560
 Well no. You play until you mess up and then the other guy gets to have a go.

104
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,320
 But whoever your opponent is they have to stay in their chair.

105
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,840
 They just stay in their chair watching you and you could be playing for hours if

106
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,560
 you don't make a mistake. It's just psychological torture.

107
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
 Are there any other games which are like that where I know tennis you're only

108
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,400
 playing when your opponent is not playing. But usually it's quite soon before you're playing again

109
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,720
 isn't it? I don't know actually but that is one of the main things about snooker is the

110
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,640
 psychological angle of it. Although Ronnie O'Sullivan said he likes it

111
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,840
 obviously because he's always going to be um Ronnie O'Sullivan.

112
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,000
 Who's Ronnie O'Sullivan? I think he's a famous snooker player.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 I would say Ronnie O'Sullivan and Don Bradman are the only two people.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,720
 I don't know what James thinks about this but who have excelled everyone else so

115
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,280
 much in their sport that it's like whoa. So Ronnie O'Sullivan is the best snooker player ever.

116
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,600
 And he hates the fact that it's so slow for instance because he's this

117
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,200
 mercurial crazy character with an amazing history and he likes snooker to be super fast.

118
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,680
 So I think he's got pretty much all the records for fastest break.

119
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,920
 But yeah he's amazing and he's got such an interesting history.

120
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,080
 His dad went to prison for murder when I think Ronnie was about 16.

121
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,960
 Yeah he was a millionaire though so even though his dad went to prison for murder

122
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,560
 he was from a very affluent background because his dad ran a lingerie shop or something like that.

123
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,800
 I believe he may have called them lingerie shops in the newspaper ads when I think they were sex

124
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,360
 shops. I mean potatoes and potatoes. You say potato I say vibrator.

125
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,440
 Yeah so I think some of the other snooker players who came from

126
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,840
 less affluent backgrounds kind of point to that and say you know we're working class but Ronnie

127
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,920
 actually was quite rich when he was growing up. Interesting because he was heavily embedded

128
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,000
 probably in that gang culture a bit. It was one of the Cray Brothers, the third Cray Brothers

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,440
 driver who he murdered in a nightclub I think. Oh sorry the third Cray Brother.

130
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,080
 Yeah I didn't know there was a third Cray but you hear about the Cray Twins.

131
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,880
 I know he was very much the... It's like the third Chuckle Brother.

132
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,680
 Yeah he and the third Cray Brother must have given each other a ride look sometimes across

133
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,360
 the Eastern clubs. They both have that picture of Bramwell Bronte in their house.

134
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:50,240
 Imagine a joke that has to craze the Chuckle Brothers and Bramwell Bronte in it.

135
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,920
 We've got the Jonas Brothers as well. They've got the extra brother who's called Bonus Jonas

136
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,280
 who is the one that just isn't in the band and does his own thing all the time.

137
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:05,360
 Bonus Jonas. Snooker's got fairly sort of poshish sort of foundations doesn't it because it was

138
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,800
 invented by supposedly, this is the big story, by Neville Chamberlain, not the Prime Minister,

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,280
 but apparently a cousin. The reports are a bit dodgy but apparently he was in India in the 1800s

140
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,960
 and he basically incorporated two existing games. There was one called Blackpool and there was

141
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,760
 another which was called Pyramid and so one was played entirely with red balls and that was in

142
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,600
 a pyramid shape so he goes 'I will love the pyramid shape' and then the other one had all the other

143
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,240
 colour balls in it and he brought that over, smashed them into one big game with the pyramid

144
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,080
 and then just kept yelling 'Snooker' at people as they were playing and by the end of the game

145
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,840
 he'd called everyone 'Snooker' and so it stuck. Why did you call someone what did it mean? Did it

146
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,200
 mean dickhead? I think it was a sort of term for an idiot, someone who was incompetent at whatever

147
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,880
 task they were doing, a rookie. I see. It is weird though because he said he invented it in 1875.

148
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,480
 He only said that in 1938 which is a substantial amount of time later that's what.

149
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,080
 63 years later. 63 years later and he was an army officer already when he invented this

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,280
 so he must be knocking on but the claim was accepted and I think it's sort of widely accepted

151
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,240
 that that's where it comes from but also the other weird thing about Snooker, that name thing you

152
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,960
 were saying Dan, is so if you snooker someone is it that I need to hit a red next but I'm behind the

153
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:27,840
 yellow or whatever? Precisely. So that is unusual as well because it's a move in the game where you've

154
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,840
 messed things up for someone else. Yeah. Which is, is that in Croquet like that?

155
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,160
 It's a bit like that, you croquet and croquet someone. I think there is a connection between

156
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,160
 Croquet and Snooker really. I think Snooker kind of grew out of Croquet like games. Yeah. And that's

157
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,280
 why the that's why the table's green because it was like originally played on grass. Right.

158
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:53,200
 The bays. The bays, yeah. Which has, has to have, do you know the difference between the bays

159
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,760
 in Snooker and pool? I got a bit too into table makeup. Is it the nap? Yeah. I'm just going to

160
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,040
 almost disqualify you from answering this question, James. I thought disclosure, I am very much into

161
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,440
 snooze. Yeah. You're not allowed to answer any more quiz questions in this section. What's the

162
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,080
 nap? So the nap is the way that the kind of hairs on the substance that the table is made of bend.

163
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,640
 So basically in Snooker you have to have a nap and that means that it's a little bit like if you

164
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,640
 imagine a velvet surface. In fact, if you look at those cushions over there. I'm having a nap

165
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,360
 listening to this. Andy, this is fascinating stuff. Sorry, sorry. Go, go, go. Okay. You look

166
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,880
 at those cushions over there. They're velvety. You stroke them one way and they look smooth. You

167
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,160
 stroke them the other way and they look rough. Oh, okay. Yeah. And that's like a snooker table.

168
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,440
 It has to have that effect and it really affects how the ball travels because as you can imagine

169
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,360
 if the little hairs, fibres are standing up a certain way and depending on the angle at which

170
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,760
 is hitting them, you really have to work with the nap. So if you aim for a shot in the middle

171
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,160
 pocket, you have to aim slightly outside the pocket because the nap will make it naturally

172
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,920
 bend towards the pocket. That's so interesting. So part of the gameplay is literally getting

173
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,440
 your face close to the table and seeing how the nap is looking. No, it's always the same.

174
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,640
 Yeah, it's always the same. Well, I actually read in a really furious blog that a man who

175
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,560
 has heard of people who install their own tables putting the nap on back to front,

176
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,840
 which is obviously an absolute disaster. Doesn't it just go the other way then? Or do you mean

177
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,240
 upside down? No, I think he means it goes the other way. So it will go slow and it should go

178
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,840
 fast. But you would be used to it. Like you would be very much used to it being one way.

179
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,280
 Yeah, I've got a question. Are you allowed to comb the table before the get before your pot?

180
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,560
 So before every frame, before every frame? Yeah, probably someone will come on and give the table

181
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,920
 a quick comb. And also you are allowed to kind of flatten it. If you see a bit come up a little bit,

182
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,160
 you are allowed to flatten it. Mid game. Yeah, mid shot, like not mid shot, but just before your

183
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,240
 shot you're allowed to. Like a bit of the rugs rocked up. Yeah, you're just smoothing it out.

184
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,120
 Mid shot would be like curling, wouldn't it? Yeah. That would be a game. So actually,

185
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,000
 Snooker isn't played on a Snooker table. He's played on a Billiards table.

186
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,200
 What? Because Billiards was invented before it and then Snooker was played on the Billiards

187
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,720
 table and we still call it a Billiards table rather than a Snooker table officially.

188
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,000
 So what gets played on a Snooker table? There's no such thing. There's no such thing as a

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,160
 Snooker table. Well, it's just another word for a Billiards table, I guess. Right. That's great.

190
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,800
 And what's Billiards? So Billiards is a game where you have three balls only on the table

191
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,160
 and the rules say you get a point by either potting one of the balls

192
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,720
 or by hitting one ball onto the other. Right. And then if you get a point, you get another go.

193
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,400
 And you get another go and another go and another go until you stop getting points and then your

194
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,120
 opponent comes on the table. Okay. So a bit like Snooker, your opponent sat there for quite a long

195
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:40,000
 time just watching you play. Yeah. But in 1907, a new technique was discovered where, you know,

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,120
 the pockets in Snooker where the ball goes into. Yeah. What this guy called Walter Lovejoy

197
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,120
 managed to do was to get two balls stuck in the pocket. And so he could just tap these two balls

198
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,960
 every time and they would always hit the cushion or hit each other. Oh, wow. And he could do that

199
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,040
 again and again and again and again. And there was a game a bit later between Tom Chapman and Tom

200
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:10,560
 Reese where Tom Reese managed to score 499,135 points by using this technique over 85 hours of 49

201
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,600
 minutes. Wow. Oh, what a tedious person. Is it illegal now as a technique or? It's illegal as

202
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,280
 a technique. And also like this record was never in the record books because all of the fans went

203
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,280
 home, the referee went home and even his opponent went home. Wow. That's so good. I worry about

204
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,520
 this guy's home life. It sounds like you didn't have much to go back to. I think it's great.

205
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,840
 I didn't know the pocket Billiards was real. I thought it was a vulgar euphemism all my life and

206
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,240
 actually it's a proper game. And what is it? It's just a smaller version of Billiards. Oh.

207
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,480
 Or it's slang for messing around with yourself. I would stop playing pocket Billiards is what

208
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,680
 you'd say to someone. Yeah. If they were masturbating in public. Yeah, right. Okay.

209
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,960
 Just don't get them mixed up. That's how I say it. I thought I was getting away with it all this

210
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:06,560
 time. I think I'm playing Billiards. Oh, dear.

211
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:18,320
 Okay. It is time for fact number two and that is Anna. My fact this week is that one of the major

212
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,520
 battles in the Cold War was to see who was better at squashing metal. Was it to get rid of the iron

213
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:32,800
 curtain? Brilliant. Oh, my God. Lovely. This is the heavy press program, which sounds kind of like

214
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,920
 a raunchy sexual program, but it wasn't. You get turned on by very different things to me, Anna.

215
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,880
 No, I'm with Anna. It's coming around to my place for heavy press. I don't know. No,

216
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
 I'm just going to say I'll do some pocket Billiards.

217
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,960
 The heavy press program was launched by the US in response to the fact that the USSR in the

218
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,040
 1950s, it believed, had got very good at squashing metal. And the good thing about squashing metal

219
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,560
 is that it was a much better way of making airplanes. So it meant that you could put a huge

220
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,080
 ingot into a machine and squash it into the shape you wanted for a big bit of wing or something.

221
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,240
 And that would mean that it would be a lighter aircraft, that if you just nailed together lots

222
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,760
 and lots of little bits, which is how you were making planes. I've seen images of this thing and

223
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,240
 it's so impressive. It's a ginormous structure, the one in America that we're going to get onto,

224
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,480
 which is a very famous one called the 50. You say it's very famous, but I think it's only known

225
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,880
 because there's this one guy who's just written a series of amazing articles about it. It's one in

226
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,280
 the Atlantic and other in the New York Times, who's just really into it. And that was in Cleveland,

227
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,720
 Ohio. It still exists today. So I think that they made 10 machines in the US and they made four

228
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,840
 pressing machines, whether you squash metal and six extrusion machines, where you squeeze it like

229
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,040
 toothpaste. Wow. And I think eight of them are still going today. It's nuts. At the moment,

230
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,760
 every single US military aircraft contains bits made by this 50 machine. By this one machine,

231
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,160
 yeah. I mean, these are built in the 50s. They're still going today. The engineers of the 50 think

232
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,080
 it's going to be going in total for about 110 years. Can I add squires called the 50? I think it

233
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:13,280
 was because it would exert 50,000 tons of compressive force, which is the equivalent of being able

234
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:20,800
 to lift up 500 blue whales. Wow. And it's massive. It's 87 meters high, so it looks huge. It's so

235
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,880
 cool. Honestly, this really awoke something in me, this machine. This really brought my inner

236
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,400
 Clarkson to the fore. It's just really the most amazing machine in the world. It's just so cool.

237
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,320
 It is. I think it's the size and the majesty of them. And there are lots of them. So there are

238
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,240
 those in the US. And then, well, as I said, in the Cold War, the reason it became a fight was

239
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,480
 because Germany was actually the best at making them. So Germany had all this technology in the

240
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,680
 Second World War for pressing metal that no one else had. And as part of the agreement after the

241
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:56,640
 Second World War, we divided things up. And the USSR got their biggest heavy press. So they got the

242
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,080
 30,000 pressing machine, 30,000 tonne pressing machine, whereas I think America only got about

243
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,560
 10,000 tonne one. And I ended up reading all of these CIA documents, spying on how Russia was

244
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,800
 using them and saying, what are they doing with this thing? They're incredibly boring, aside from

245
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,840
 the word secret at the top. But yeah, they had to transport it back in four specially made train

246
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,720
 carriages from Germany to the USSR. But yeah, America were like, oh no, they've got this now.

247
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,120
 We'll have to make a big one. But it's all and it's partly it all partly relates back to the

248
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,560
 First World War, right? So in the First World War, again, lots of post-war reparations, Treaty

249
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,400
 of Versailles took a lot of things away from Germany. And there was a shortage of various

250
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,480
 key materials for the German economy and for the armaments and all this. So they developed the

251
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,400
 technique of press forging, which is where you press down on the diet just because it's more

252
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,520
 efficient. And the one thing they'd been allowed to keep or one of the things they were allowed

253
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,720
 to keep was their magnesium, right? The Allied power said we're not interested in your magnesium,

254
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 so you can have that. But the problem is that the previous method of forging things is basically

255
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,200
 big hammer, smashes down, smashes up. Does it not explode if you hit magnesium?

256
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,800
 If you put it, I think you put water on it, isn't it? But it does crack. It doesn't forge well

257
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,880
 under the current forging conditions. And that's why Germany invented the technique of press forging

258
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,720
 because they were working with the materials they had and also they had to be as efficient as possible.

259
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,000
 So once again, shot yourselves in the foot with Versailles, didn't you, allies? But then actually,

260
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,200
 in playing the long game, you got the technology back. So sort of a nice score draw for the Treaty

261
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,800
 of Versailles. I think that's right, yes. I think the Treaty of Versailles is a foe of the podcast

262
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:39,520
 because we give it a right kick in this show, don't we? True. The highest pressure ever achieved

263
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,840
 is 770 gigapascals, which is more than twice the pressure in the inner core of the earth.

264
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,160
 Okay. Yeah. What did we do it for? Well, it's just scientists in it.

265
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,240
 They wanted to see what happens if you squash osmium really, really, really a lot.

266
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,280
 And who's he? Richard Osmium. He's the Roman Richard Osmium.

267
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,880
 It's the chemical element osmium and they really, really squashed it with all this pressure

268
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,840
 and they found out that it does not change its crystal structure. Wow. Well, sometimes you're

269
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,960
 going to go through that experiment to find out. It's as important to find out nothing as to find

270
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,400
 out something. I wonder if it's especially tough osmium or is it especially dense? Okay, that's

271
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,880
 cool. Surely. Otherwise, it seems silly if it's just. We'll start off by squashing a flump and see.

272
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:38,080
 The biggest press now, I don't think get much press. It's in Vienna and it's made by an Italian

273
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:46,160
 company who would have thought. Not me. I don't see any reason why the Italians would be good at

274
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,480
 pressing. I suppose most industrial things like that are Russia and China, sometimes America,

275
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,560
 and they do have the other big ones. But an Italian company have made it in Vienna and it's

276
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:01,200
 called Tyson. Is it to make lasagna sheets? It is. They can make a meatball that is as dense as the sun.

277
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:10,400
 And yeah, that exerts 100,000 tons of force, which is the equivalent of being able to lift up

278
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,640
 100 Eiffel towers. Wow. Which is impressive. That is amazing. It is amazing. Is it used for the

279
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,360
 same just making like sheets of metal for airplanes and stuff? Yeah, they do lots of stuff with like

280
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,440
 oil and gas industry and wind turbines and nuclear and things you would imagine need loads of metal.

281
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,640
 I was reading into humans crushing metal because that is, yeah, it's a thing. And it turns out

282
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,200
 there's a lot of Guinness World Records for people who have done that in the past. So one of the

283
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,960
 records I found was the most cans crushed with shoulder blades in one minute. Okay, so back

284
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,600
 shoulder blades. Yeah, so you're sort of moving them together to create the crush. What do you

285
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,560
 reckon in one minute? Well, okay, question. Yeah, is someone putting the cans in your shoulders after

286
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,080
 you have to place them there yourself because that feels tough. So the records held by Fabrizio

287
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,760
 Malito and another one for the Italians. Exactly. Yeah, crushing metal. It's just their forte.

288
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,240
 And it was his brother, Frank, who would replenish the can in between the shoulder blades to be

289
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,440
 crushed. 84. You're not far off. 68. 68. That's 10 more than someone managed to do it with their

290
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,800
 head in one minute. So 58 achieved with their head. That's interesting, because if you ever

291
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,000
 crush a can these days, it's really easy. It's very, and that used to be seen as like a pop-eye

292
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,600
 or a manly roar kind of thing. It turns out that that did used to be that because cans were 40%

293
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,600
 stronger back in the day in terms of the material and the strength and the thickness. This really

294
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,120
 shows how old I am. But I remember when aluminium cans came in. And that they were much, much easier

295
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,440
 to crush. It used to be that you could buy cans of pop and some of them would be aluminium and some

296
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,200
 of them wouldn't be. Right. And the aluminium ones were way easier to crush. Were the previous ones

297
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,400
 steel? I suppose they must have been. I'm not really sure, but I just remember Blue Peter had a thing

298
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,680
 where everyone had to crush cans and send them for recycling in their 80s. Nice. And so we were

299
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,880
 all into can-crushing back then. Before Tamagotchi, so that was what it was, wasn't it?

300
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,120
 Can I read an introductory sentence to you? Yeah, sure. Is it from your new novel? It's

301
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,840
 from a piece about another kind of forging, which is a thing called drop forging. And it's in

302
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,840
 kadahi. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm pronouncing it wrong, Milwaukee. It begins like this, tucked away

303
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,800
 in a kadahi warehouse. Something big has been pounding away since 1959. But this is a huge

304
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,800
 great hammer. And this is the kind of thing where you just have a giant hammer to smash down on your

305
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,240
 metal and get it into the shape you want. Right. And this one, it weighs one million pounds. And

306
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,960
 it goes five floors above ground and also five floors below ground. So it's called a counterblow

307
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,040
 hammer, which is meaning that you are whacking above sides. Oh, cool. Yeah, on the below at the

308
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:03,600
 same time. Like a crocodile. It's so cool. It's just like flames and fire inside it. And it's just

309
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,880
 smashing away at these objects. Yeah, yeah. Basically, that hammer, that gigantic hammer has

310
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,120
 been in operation so long that you've got multiple generations of the same family who've been operating

311
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,240
 that hammer. It's been going since 1959. So there was a guy interviewed for this article saying,

312
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,560
 "Yeah, my grandfather worked on this hammer." I know. What would happen if you put just a person

313
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,440
 in there? Oh, they'd be in trouble. They'd be in such trouble. They'd get just squished. But I'd

314
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,880
 love to see what that like doesn't look like. Oh, no. It's not like when you frame Roger Rabbit.

315
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,240
 You would not love to see that, I can say. You've become a perfect two-dimensional human.

316
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,040
 It's a shame that's not on the list of options for like, you know, you've got classic burial,

317
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:50,080
 cremation, obliterated pine, bash. The flattening. Can I tell you one thing about a cool destruction

318
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,440
 engine from the 19th century? But this is great. This is, there was a great new scientist piece

319
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,520
 about it, and it was called the Victorian Monster Destruction Engine. Not its official name.

320
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:08,800
 But it was made by an engineer called David Cacoldi, who's Scottish. And he was the chief engineer

321
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:16,320
 behind this machine, which existed to smash metal, to tear it, to twist it, to crunch it,

322
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:24,720
 to bop it, you know, to do all of this. And it was because before his work, you could not test

323
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,040
 the components of a bridge, say. So, you know, you just have to trust that the bridge you were

324
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,240
 building was strong enough. Yeah, you've got some rivets, you need to know whether they're

325
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,560
 going to hold if you put a load of pressure on it. How do you do that? Exactly that. And he built

326
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,520
 this gigantic machine. It was 116 tons, which at the time was huge. And its entire job was to

327
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,920
 tear things apart and it could measure the tonnage at which or the force that needed to be applied

328
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,880
 before things broke. And this changed engineering because, you know, there was the Tay Bridge disaster

329
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,480
 in Scotland. And they went down to the riverbed after this awful disaster had happened. Lots of

330
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,480
 people died and it was a really tragic event. A really bad bit of poetry was written about it

331
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,880
 famously by McGonagall. That's right. The Tay Bridge disaster disaster. And they went down and

332
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,600
 they got some of the lugs that had attached the bridge rods to the supporting columns. And it was

333
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,920
 found that they broke at 20 tons of pressure rather than the 60 that they should have done.

334
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,640
 So that, you know, ruined the career of the engineer who had said, no, these are fine and

335
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,440
 these are strong enough to support the bridge. So I feel like they should have used buttresses

336
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,400
 as many a wise man confesses. It's a line from the poem. Is that genuinely a line from the poem?

337
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,560
 That's good memory. All the poems you could have memorised.

338
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:38,720
 But yeah, he made loads of bridges as well, didn't he? And they were shipped all over the

339
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,120
 world because he was the first person ever to test these things. So the Sydney Harbour Bridge

340
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,200
 was all tested, but in his one machine, at the various bridges in London, Hammersmith Bridge.

341
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,880
 The family thing, like Generations, the Festival of Britain in the 1950s,

342
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,800
 some of their structures were tested by his grandson. And I love this. It was certainly in

343
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,280
 2014 there in a museum, I think it's in Southwark. And there used to be on the top floor a museum of

344
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,480
 fractures, which was a collection of broken pieces of metal. But tragically during the Second World

345
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,960
 War, a bomb fell on it. And all the pieces came back together. It was like, what am I supposed to

346
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:30,960
 do with these? Find a pristine spitfire. Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

347
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,880
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 18th century America, you could tell a merchant from a lawyer

348
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:44,000
 just by looking at their handwriting. So the lawyer would put little hearts over the eyes.

349
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,680
 This is insane. The merchant was dollar sign. Yeah, it's crazy, isn't it? I just didn't know this.

350
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,600
 It was in an article in The Atlantic, I read it, an article by Rachel Gutman Way. And she wrote that

351
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,120
 there were different font types for different jobs. The handwriting of the merchants apparently

352
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,840
 was supposed to reflect the efficiency and speed with which they worked. And lawyers would have

353
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,000
 different scripts, aristocrats would have different scripts. And what would happen is,

354
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,920
 it was, you would be in your guild or whatever, or you would be taught to do this job. And when

355
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,000
 you were being taught it, they would teach you particular ways of writing. So as the years went

356
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,280
 on, it would kind of get more and more enforced, this style of writing. Because doctors are the only

357
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,920
 people today who have reputedly got a particular kind of handwriting, which is terrible. Yeah.

358
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,720
 I don't think that's a font, is it? Barscript. I feel like journalists. I've seen journalists

359
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,600
 doing fast writing. Short-hand. Yeah, short-hand, which feels very them. And that's a sort of

360
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,520
 separate language to notate. But this is, you're talking about the English language written. Yeah,

361
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,960
 so you would write the same words, but you'd be able to read them and you'd be able to say,

362
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,880
 this person is a merchant, this person is a... Could you masquerade? If I was a merchant,

363
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,520
 I'm wanting to pretend to be a lawyer. I suppose you could, but it's a bit like forging signatures.

364
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,040
 Is I guess it's difficult, right? Because your signature, you do naturally without thinking,

365
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,160
 whereas to forge it, it takes time and sometimes it's not very easy to do it exactly.

366
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,600
 And you probably need other proofs that you're a lawyer. It probably wasn't that people would

367
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,760
 hire a lawyer by saying, can you just write your name on a bit of paper? Looks like a lawyer's

368
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,560
 handwriting to me. I'm in a Mrs Doubtfire scenario in my head. I'm the aristocrat and the nanny in

369
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,240
 this, what I'm trying to do. Right. Well, one thing that might work there is that men and women had

370
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,680
 different handwriting as well. That's so interesting. So men had more masculine handwriting

371
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,960
 they were taught, or muscular handwriting. What does that even mean? Well, muscular handwriting,

372
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,800
 according to someone called Carla Peterson, who is a professor of English at the University of

373
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:47,280
 Maryland, they used more pressure on the pen. Just holes in the paper. 50,000 tons of force

374
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:54,480
 on every letter. And women had more like an italic, cursive handwriting. What I thought was so

375
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,520
 interesting about this fact is that I hadn't really considered until now the fact that we were all

376
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,400
 taught a font. So basically the handwriting equivalent of font is script. And we were all

377
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:10,000
 taught a script. And of course we were. And when you see writing from the olden days, like if I

378
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,560
 look at collections of letters written by, like my grandparents had old letters written by their

379
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,600
 grandparents from the 19th century, the handwriting is so different. And that's because official

380
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,920
 styles changed. And so there was this thing called Spensarian scripts in the 1900s, which

381
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:32,720
 President Garfield called the pride of our country. America's done so much stuff. That's

382
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,640
 the biggest one. Is that the biggie? That's the biggest Spensarian. The guy who came up with this,

383
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,640
 Platt Rogers Spencer, said he was inspired by pebbles on a beach and is sloping. It's got to

384
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:49,360
 be at an exact angle of 52 degrees, sloping forwards and slightly rounded. Okay. And it

385
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,760
 was that like basically Americans would write that like that. Yes. Because I know like, for

386
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,040
 instance, my wife writes in a Russian font, which is different than an English font for sure.

387
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,480
 Yes. Yeah, yeah. There's lots of chat about the different ways that different European

388
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,080
 countries still write. So Platt Rogers Spencer spent so much time trying to get it to be the

389
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,600
 standard writing style they were teaching in schools and so on. To the point where it feels

390
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,560
 very missionary when he died, his sons then took textbooks of it and they sort of went out and

391
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,840
 campaigned for it to be changed. Have you tried this font style? Even go to schools and hand them

392
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,640
 and this sort of people start reading the books. No, don't read the words. Just look at the letters.

393
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,000
 Yeah, exactly. So weird. Yeah. And then it did get taken over by a thing called Zana Bloso method,

394
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,800
 and then that eventually got taken over by another. So we've got generational changes within how we

395
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,360
 write. You can tell when texts come from right because you can, there's a thing called paleography.

396
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,200
 Is that it? It's old writing and it's the study of old writing. Your course is in it because if

397
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,800
 you look at a text from hundreds of years ago, even if it's in English, it's going to be really

398
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,040
 hard to decipher. It's hard to recognize time travel, as I suppose, is that they have different

399
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,080
 handwriting. Yes, it'd be so obvious if someone suddenly started writing in that gothic script

400
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,640
 that as you say, you can barely read it. It looks so different, doesn't it? So hard to distinguish.

401
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,440
 I was thinking people from the future might write, like for instance, in block capitals or something.

402
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:17,600
 Hello. Oh, wow. Busted. So Spenserian just very quickly, before we wrap up on that,

403
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,200
 that did go out and these other fonts took over, but it did embed itself in society,

404
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,760
 and we see it virtually every day. So it was a win for Plat and Rogers.

405
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,320
 It's understandable. Oh, yeah, it should be. Think of...

406
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,400
 Ingredients lists on packets of food. Oh, they're always in handwriting, aren't they?

407
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:41,040
 Okay, okay, okay. I'm just warming up. Something that's in handwriting. Yeah.

408
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,240
 Okay, there was something on a banknote, like the code promise to pay the bearer.

409
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,320
 No, it's a logo. It's a logo in handwriting. It is a great call.

410
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,720
 It is a food and drink product and it is not anything that you've said. It's a drink.

411
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,080
 Coke. Coke. Coke-a-cola. Coke-a-cola.

412
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,480
 That lovely... You're right. That rounded cursive. That rounded cursive. I forgot what the question was.

413
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,800
 So it was basically phased out Spenserian, but he managed to have an impact saying,

414
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,000
 and Ford Cars is also the way that Ford has written is based on Spenserian.

415
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
 That is great. What a legacy. That's a great legacy.

416
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,520
 That's kind of time travel, but the normal way around, you know, like a survivor.

417
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,280
 It's like those animals that you find, which, oh, we thought you went extinct 130 million years ago,

418
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,560
 but here you are swimming around. Like a sealant camp of handwriting.

419
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,760
 Yeah, it's a Coca-Cola camp.

420
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,400
 Could you set me up for that, Joe? No.

421
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,640
 I felt like it. I felt like I walked straight into a fur trap there.

422
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,080
 We should probably say that handwriting evolves for practical reasons.

423
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,440
 So it was all about these people saying, this is a quicker way to write,

424
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,240
 and this is an easier way to write. This is an easier way to teach.

425
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,560
 Or the reason that Gothic, which was invented in the 12th century-ish,

426
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,640
 that was quite squashed up, and it was because there was parchment shortages,

427
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,600
 and so you could fit much more on the page.

428
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,440
 So it's all practicalities, which feels relevant when it's enforced today,

429
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,680
 because people say, isn't it sad that no one learns proper cursive anymore,

430
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,720
 and there are a number of American states that enforce it legally,

431
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,000
 and there isn't really evidence that there's particularly a purpose.

432
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,520
 Cursive has just joined up handwriting, right?

433
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,200
 Yes. I can tell you a lot about someone, their handwriting.

434
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,880
 Well, no, it can't really. But they can tell you how drunk they are.

435
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,880
 Well, that's good. Of all these kind of graphology things,

436
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,000
 which is you're supposed to be able to tell people's personality or whatever,

437
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,960
 from their handwriting, most of it does seem to be mediopie,

438
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,200
 but definitely for sure, the height of ascending letters,

439
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,040
 height of descending letters, spacing between words, tremors,

440
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,280
 bit of sick on the page, the height of the upper and lower case letters,

441
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,840
 all changes depending on how much alcohol you've had.

442
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,360
 That's good. That's very good.

443
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,680
 That's got to be one of the most pointless studies ever done

444
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,880
 writing declines with alcoholism.

445
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,080
 Did you find the B.I.G.?

446
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,240
 Notorious.

447
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,640
 Notorious British Institute of Graphologists.

448
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,600
 They're real.

449
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,800
 They're pretty hardcore on there.

450
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,080
 They are. That's really funny.

451
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,800
 And their claim, and I think I'm not, I don't think it's backed up by solid evidence,

452
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,080
 is that it's better than therapy, because actually with therapy,

453
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,320
 you can only know what the client has told you.

454
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,800
 Okay.

455
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,520
 Whereas with graphology, you just look at the writing and you say,

456
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,680
 "Well, that's disgusting. I can't believe you had that dream."

457
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,640
 Or whatever, you know.

458
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,400
 You're not a merchant, you're a lawyer.

459
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,040
 We did a debunk of graphology on QI once and got very angry emails.

460
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
 And letters didn't we?

461
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,680
 And written.

462
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,800
 Yeah, we got one letter from a graphologist saying that

463
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,520
 some of the evidence is, if you get a pen and put it in your mouth

464
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,360
 and try and write something on a piece of paper,

465
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,920
 you'll use the same movements as if you were to do it with your hand.

466
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,280
 Like so Andy would write it with his same sort of spidery hand writing

467
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,200
 with his mouth as he would with his hand.

468
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,320
 And that's evidence that it's coming directly from your brain

469
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,760
 as opposed to being something in your hands or whatever, hasn't it?

470
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,440
 Inherent in yourself the shape of your letters.

471
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,480
 Is that claim true in either sense?

472
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,560
 Like, is it true that there's any correlation to your mouth and hand

473
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,080
 or that you could draw that conclusion?

474
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,360
 All I'm giving is both sides of the story, like I'm on the BBC.

475
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,880
 Good on you, mate.

476
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,080
 But no, that's what they claim.

477
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,520
 But of course, you know, I think these days we think that it's nonsense.

478
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,440
 Unless you're listening to this podcast on BBC Sounds,

479
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,640
 in which case, the jury's out.

480
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,640
 I do wonder if we were able to bring back certain people from history

481
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,800
 and just say, "Oh, I love your book," called that.

482
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,640
 And they go, "That's not what that's called."

483
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,560
 And it's because they're bad handwriting.

484
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,120
 And there's a few cases where people claim this is a thing.

485
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,000
 So apparently, Beethoven's piece for Elise.

486
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,120
 Apparently, that's not the title.

487
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,640
 What? It's called "Furry Leaves."

488
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,880
 Apparently, it's for Therese.

489
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,600
 No.

490
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,120
 Yeah, it's Therese or Therese.

491
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,080
 It's either that.

492
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,480
 No way.

493
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,920
 Yeah, but his handwriting is so dodgy that it just, it's,

494
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,040
 well, we'll just go with Elise.

495
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,600
 Are all the notes different as well?

496
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,840
 That's so funny.

497
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,360
 Well, if you're worried about bad handwriting,

498
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,040
 which I always was in exams,

499
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,520
 because I have quite a legible small handwriting,

500
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,840
 and I always thought they're never going to read this gold.

501
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,920
 I happened to be on the OCR,

502
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,680
 which is one of the famous exam boards.

503
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,400
 OCR exam board page, FAQ's page,

504
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,600
 and they clarified examiners are experienced at reading

505
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,360
 a wide range of handwriting.

506
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,800
 And if one examiner can't read it,

507
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,280
 it gets passed to another one, and so on.

508
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,680
 Wow.

509
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,200
 So I think if your handwriting's bad,

510
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,080
 it just goes, gets passed to 20 different examiners.

511
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,640
 That's so funny.

512
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,840
 I knew where it would end up.

513
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,240
 Where?

514
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,200
 At the very end, there is a lady on the Isle of Man

515
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,000
 who runs a firm called Transcription Services,

516
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,680
 and almost no one does what she does.

517
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,200
 She is just phenomenal at reading handwriting.

518
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,600
 Really?

519
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,800
 Specifically old writing.

520
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,280
 Like the work by William Wiseworth,

521
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,400
 the Brontes, John Dunn,

522
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,520
 it's all passed to her in the Isle of Man,

523
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
 and she's just amazing at it.

524
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
 And that is paleography.

525
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,160
 Yeah, one person who was really difficult to decipher

526
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,520
 was Catherine Mansfield.

527
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,360
 I was reading about the New Zealand short story person.

528
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,520
 Her handwriting was so bad that when she died

529
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,080
 and left 53 handwritten notebooks,

530
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,560
 it took decades to decipher them.

531
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,200
 Wow.

532
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,960
 And the person who was doing it

533
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,320
 once spent an entire week trying to decipher a single word.

534
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,240
 So the way you write can kind of show where you're from.

535
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,280
 I thought this was really interesting.

536
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,120
 So the way you write a T, for instance,

537
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,320
 which bit do you write first?

538
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,920
 The width.

539
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,480
 I don't even know.

540
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,200
 I go the top.

541
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
 I don't do the cross, basically.

542
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,320
 You don't cross your T's?

543
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,800
 No, I do that.

544
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,120
 Oh, right.

545
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,520
 OK, yeah.

546
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,240
 You don't cross your T's, imagine that.

547
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,280
 I'll see you in the burrow.

548
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,920
 See you later.

549
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,120
 So presumably, oh, Dan actually,

550
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,320
 what do you write first?

551
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,720
 Well.

552
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,720
 You write all in capital, so it's kind of relevant.

553
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,120
 Who writes the cross bit first?

554
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,680
 Well.

555
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,360
 What's the cross bit, do you mean?

556
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,840
 The cross your T's, the bit that goes across.

557
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,320
 I do.

558
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:08,800
 I do.

559
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,520
 You write the cross first?

560
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,800
 OK, here, if I was writing that in lower case, I go.

561
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,160
 Guys, do you know what's so fascinating about this?

562
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,040
 Right.

563
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,520
 Do it again.

564
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
 What does Dan, what can Dan also write

565
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,720
 that none of the rest of us can?

566
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,120
 Brilliant books about weird beliefs.

567
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,840
 All right, I don't think you can write this.

568
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,680
 What can he speak and where was he brought up?

569
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:27,920
 Oh.

570
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,240
 Mandarin.

571
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:30,960
 Australian slang.

572
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,520
 Mandarin.

573
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,120
 Australian slang, yes.

574
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,360
 It's Mandarin writers, writing lots of little short dashes.

575
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,400
 And so it makes sense for them to write, when they learn English,

576
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,160
 they tend to write the cross of the T first.

577
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
 Because it's lots of little figures.

578
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,800
 How interesting.

579
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,440
 Whereas we would always write,

580
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,200
 and there's lots of little stuff like that.

581
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,520
 In Koreans, they write nine backwards.

582
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,880
 Do you write your lines backwards, Dan?

583
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,320
 No, I, well, I don't know.

584
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,760
 You might tell me now that I do.

585
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,560
 I write it like that.

586
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,720
 No, that's like every other night tonight.

587
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,200
 That's normal.

588
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,280
 I wonder if I've got a cultural mesh going on,

589
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,600
 because I will start that like that,

590
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,120
 but then I'll do that to end it.

591
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,600
 Wow.

592
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:03,920
 Yeah.

593
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,680
 Gosh.

594
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,280
 Interesting, because I've never seen you write

595
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,480
 in lower case before.

596
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,520
 Yeah, I didn't know you could.

597
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,680
 I am Casemore.

598
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,640
 Wow.

599
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,440
 I'm so sorry.

600
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,200
 What do you think, the school I went to taught?

601
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,400
 Well, let's not go there.

602
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:32,320
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

603
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,760
 and that is Andy.

604
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,120
 My fact is that the sun is surrounded by a layer of moss.

605
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,360
 Hey.

606
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,960
 Is it?

607
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,600
 Space moss.

608
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,920
 I mean, it obviously isn't happening.

609
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,120
 So this is a thing which industry experts, sun experts.

610
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,680
 Industry?

611
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,600
 Astronomers.

612
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,440
 Big science brains.

613
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,720
 They call moss.

614
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,200
 I love this.

615
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,360
 So this is in the sun's corona.

616
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,960
 We're outside the sun itself,

617
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,080
 and there are areas where the sun's magnetic field bursts out,

618
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,040
 and gas flow, the gas that makes up the sun,

619
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,720
 flows around these huge loops,

620
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,760
 and then spears back down into the thing.

621
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,280
 It's all really, it's awesome.

622
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,800
 Anyway, and the moss is these sort of lacy patterns

623
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,680
 around the corona and around those corona loops,

624
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,440
 around the feet of them, if you like.

625
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,640
 It's a term that NASA uses,

626
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,080
 and lots of other astronomers use it.

627
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,000
 Of all the sexy words you can use for lace-like structures,

628
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,520
 to use moss, I feel like.

629
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,080
 Yeah, what would you have gone for?

630
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,640
 Well, lace.

631
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,600
 Lingerie.

632
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,160
 Lace.

633
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,040
 Negligent.

634
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,760
 That's quite a cool, yeah.

635
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,320
 Yeah.

636
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,120
 I do think of it when I was reading about it.

637
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,640
 Yeah, you've described it pretty well there.

638
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,160
 It looks like a rainbow,

639
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,520
 if you look at these coronal loops,

640
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,280
 and the moss is sort of at the bottom of them,

641
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,080
 so it's like the gold at the bottom of a rainbow.

642
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,720
 Very nice.

643
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,440
 Lovely.

644
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,560
 What's really weird is I read that this is the case.

645
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,000
 There may be other reasons for it,

646
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,720
 but the reason those loops come out, at all,

647
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,680
 is largely to do with the rotation of the sun.

648
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,400
 Right.

649
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,840
 Yeah, so you've got basically,

650
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,560
 it takes 25 days at the equator to rotate,

651
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,120
 but at the poles, it takes 33 days.

652
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,560
 So you have this bit overtaking the outside,

653
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,040
 and it sort of snaps, and it creates these big loops.

654
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,600
 It's sort of running past itself in a,

655
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,040
 it's the weird rotation,

656
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,560
 the double rotation of the planet.

657
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,080
 Yeah, because it's all gas,

658
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,000
 so it kind of feels natural, right,

659
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,760
 that it would rotate at different levels.

660
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,680
 But yeah, that chaos that's generated.

661
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,240
 Yeah.

662
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,080
 But it seems like we still don't know a lot about the sun,

663
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,120
 which is quite exciting,

664
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,880
 and they're still discovering stuff about it, aren't they?

665
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,720
 I mean, this is all linked to that eternal mystery,

666
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,760
 that why is the sun's atmosphere,

667
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,560
 the bit just above the surface of the sun, so hot?

668
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,080
 So I think we might have mentioned before.

669
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,000
 So hotter than the surface or even the core?

670
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,600
 It's the hottest there, is that what you're saying?

671
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,040
 It's hotter than the surface, definitely.

672
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,480
 I'm not sure if it's hotter than the very core.

673
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,640
 Yeah, it's so much hotter.

674
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,280
 So the surface of the sun is about 6,000 degrees Celsius.

675
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,880
 I think we can all agree, very hot.

676
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,360
 Yeah.

677
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,920
 Well.

678
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,760
 But the corona, the atmosphere, is 1 million and 6,000 degrees Celsius.

679
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,280
 It's a million degrees hotter.

680
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,600
 And do you know that even NASA says that there are flares,

681
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,280
 which they think might be between 10 and 40 million degrees Celsius?

682
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,120
 Wow, 40 million degrees.

683
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,120
 So the sun's rotating, producing magnetic field, right?

684
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,600
 Yeah.

685
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,040
 And then these lines of magnetic force, they get tangled,

686
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
 and they build up pressure and they snap.

687
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,320
 And most of the energy goes outwards,

688
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,080
 but some of it goes back inwards, into the sun.

689
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,680
 And the particles in the sun's lower atmosphere,

690
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,280
 they build up this pressure wave and it penetrates deep into the sun.

691
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,040
 And it becomes a sunquake.

692
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,880
 Just everything starts sounding like a cool title for a metal album.

693
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,320
 Sunquake.

694
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:42,800
 Sunquake.

695
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,360
 I've been going around singing Sunquake.

696
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,600
 There's a group called the Solar Wind Sherpas,

697
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,280
 who also sound pretty cool and metal.

698
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,560
 So they're a band.

699
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,840
 No, they're a group of scientists.

700
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,560
 But just anything sun related, like coronal moss, or whatever.

701
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,240
 That one doesn't quite work, I gotta say.

702
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:58,720
 Okay.

703
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,920
 It's not metal, I don't think that one.

704
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,840
 No matter how much you put that voice on.

705
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,880
 Okay, okay, okay.

706
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,800
 Quite similarly, you get solar rain,

707
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,200
 which is actually lumps of plasma

708
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,360
 that fall down from these coronal rainbow loops.

709
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,000
 And when they splash into the chromosphere,

710
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,480
 the bit in between the atmosphere and the surface,

711
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,840
 they make a big splash and they send up loads more plasma.

712
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,280
 We are chromosphere.

713
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,200
 This is our album, Solar Rain.

714
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:21,920
 What about that?

715
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,240
 Yeah, it's good.

716
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,160
 We are the Solar Hedge Row.

717
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,440
 What about that?

718
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,040
 It's a bit rural, bit rustic, but nice.

719
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,480
 Yeah, maybe like the muscles.

720
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,840
 I mean, it's not that interesting.

721
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,600
 It's just like filaments of mossy-like stuff from the sun

722
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,520
 that create loops that go in like a line, like a hedge row might.

723
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,680
 But it is an official term apparently.

724
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,160
 That's cool.

725
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,240
 Do you know who is the first person to take a photo

726
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,080
 of these filaments on the sun?

727
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,320
 Oh, it's almost.

728
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,440
 Is someone we've heard of?

729
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:49,840
 Oh, no.

730
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,840
 That narrows it down.

731
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,720
 That narrows it down.

732
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,920
 You might have come across her name.

733
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,440
 Annie Monda, she was called.

734
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,360
 And she was married to Edward Walter Monda.

735
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,720
 And she was probably the last of what was called the lady computers.

736
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,200
 So towards the end of the 19th century,

737
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,080
 this is obviously there were computers like for the space race and stuff like that.

738
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,960
 But these were women who would do the calculations

739
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,760
 when astronomers would come up with loads of data.

740
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,880
 They would give them to the women

741
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,280
 and the women would work them out and work out what was going on.

742
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,240
 Amazing, right.

743
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,960
 And also the Monda minimum is named after her,

744
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,920
 which you might have heard,

745
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,880
 which was a time in the 17th century when all sunspots disappeared.

746
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,440
 Was that when it got very cold?

747
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,960
 Yeah, the little ice age.

748
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,600
 Exactly.

749
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,800
 Was that the Monda minimum?

750
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,680
 But it's named after her.

751
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,120
 And her husband as well, yeah.

752
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,880
 Yeah, that's awesome.

753
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,680
 But so she's coming through data to find all this stuff.

754
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,960
 So amateur photographer on the side.

755
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,600
 She was also a photographer on the side, yeah, yeah.

756
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,800
 And she and her husband did photographs of the sun.

757
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,560
 And we're doing it all the time, basically.

758
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,760
 Whenever there was a clear day,

759
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,600
 they would go out and photograph the sun.

760
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,880
 How do you photograph the sun with that?

761
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,240
 You need a special filter to stop hurting your eyes, obviously.

762
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,000
 There are lots of different ways of doing it.

763
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,800
 And like, for instance, you can do it with a pinhole camera.

764
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,880
 I think you could largely just point it in the direction

765
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,640
 and press snap, can't you?

766
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,840
 I think if you do that and you send the photos to Boots,

767
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,200
 you're going to get a sticker on them.

768
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,840
 In Britain, you can photograph the sun pretty easily.

769
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,520
 The sort of vague, white dot on screen by Cloud.

770
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,200
 That reminds me of the warnings

771
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,440
 when there are eclipses about what they can do to your eyes.

772
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,160
 I've been sort of mad to very extents over the years,

773
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,440
 but I was reading about the eclipse in Melbourne in 1976.

774
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,240
 I think it was.

775
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,520
 When there was this doctor who sort of spread panic

776
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,920
 around the city saying there could be an epidemic

777
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,120
 of thousands of kids being completely blind.

778
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,560
 Because all you need to do is look at that

779
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,480
 for a couple of seconds and you can go blind.

780
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,400
 Now, it's not, it is exaggerated, the scare mongering,

781
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,280
 but it scared Melbourne into watching it from inside.

782
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,760
 So 2 million of the 2.5 million people there

783
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,880
 watched it on their tellies.

784
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,120
 It is a problem, I think, with the eclipse,

785
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,360
 which is it is bad for you.

786
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,680
 And you can't say it's not bad for you,

787
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,080
 but pretty much all the time everyone says

788
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,840
 it's worse for you than it actually is.

789
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,440
 I think that's the problem.

790
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,240
 So when Trump famously looked at the sun,

791
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,520
 that wouldn't have done.

792
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,640
 It depends how long you do it for.

793
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,120
 I think you can tell if it's doing damage.

794
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,920
 Bloody left-wing media spinning these stories to make him--

795
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,720
 We're not saying.

796
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,480
 We're not saying you should go and look at the sun.

797
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,400
 That's the problem is you can't say that.

798
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,080
 You can't say go out and look at the sun.

799
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,880
 Brilliant idea.

800
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,320
 I would say give Trump a break.

801
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,200
 That's what I'm saying.

802
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,640
 But yeah, it's like you've looked at the sun

803
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,120
 every now and then by accident for a second or so, right?

804
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,400
 And you're like, oh, that hurt my eyes,

805
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,080
 but you didn't go blind at any stage.

806
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,520
 No, because it's the eclipse.

807
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,960
 Isn't there a risk that people are going to try

808
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,320
 and look for longer than the tiny, tiny glimpse

809
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,120
 that might not do you any harm?

810
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,040
 But it feels so much common sense

811
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,640
 that the only people who do get in trouble,

812
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,840
 and I think this was true in Britain when we had it in 1999,

813
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,680
 are people who had lots of drugs.

814
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,120
 So there was a girl who'd taken lots of speed

815
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,120
 who stared at the eclipse for half an hour,

816
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,200
 and she did have some permanent eye damage.

817
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,520
 Isaac Newton, that was a story that he stared at the sun

818
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,120
 in that sense impartially blinded.

819
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,800
 That was deliberately for an experiment

820
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,320
 to see what would happen if he stared at the sun.

821
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,720
 So you can be very, very clever and also very, very stupid.

822
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,880
 So I think it's just good to wear on the side of court

823
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,760
 and say never look anywhere.

824
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,880
 I think that's fair.

825
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,080
 But I think one bit of good news is if you do go blind

826
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,600
 for staring at the sun for too long,

827
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,280
 is that there's a new invention

828
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,920
 that allows blind people to enjoy eclipses.

829
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,360
 Really?

830
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,120
 Yeah, it's called light sound,

831
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,240
 and it sort of measures and translates the sky's brightness

832
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,440
 and turns it into music.

833
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,560
 And so you can like put your headphones in,

834
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,720
 and apparently it gives a really good impression

835
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,920
 of the change of the sun

836
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,840
 and the change of the brightness that's happening.

837
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,880
 That was so cool.

838
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,600
 That was so cool.

839
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,000
 Yeah.

840
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,880
 That's amazing.

841
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,520
 That's awesome.

842
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,680
 Milosevic scared his people underground.

843
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,640
 Slobodan.

844
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,680
 Or Aston Villa striker Savo Milosevic.

845
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,840
 I think it was Slobodan though,

846
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,200
 of course I haven't written it down,

847
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,760
 but whichever one was ruling Serbia in the 90s.

848
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,080
 Yeah, he said that it would make you urinate really frequently

849
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,360
 and get heart palpitations.

850
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,240
 And everyone literally went inside,

851
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,360
 pulled all their curtains down.

852
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,480
 They were calling help lines saying,

853
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,920
 is it safe to watch it on telly?

854
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,560
 Wow.

855
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,200
 That like no one went outside public transport all stopped.

856
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,040
 So the whole of the rest of Europe flooded outside

857
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,160
 to watch the eclipse,

858
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,440
 and all of Serbia retreated underground and indoors.

859
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,280
 Did he have motives that we know now?

860
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,480
 Well, was that a weird, the urination thing?

861
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,440
 Well, what was where did that come from?

862
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,120
 No, I agree, because no, I don't know.

863
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,080
 I don't know why.

864
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,400
 There was actually a paper saying what were his motivations,

865
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,560
 and I couldn't download the full thing.

866
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,600
 So we'll never know.

867
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,480
 No one, apart from people who could afford 24.99,

868
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,280
 will ever know.

869
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,760
 But I can tell you that animal rights activists

870
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,080
 sent sunglasses to the chimps in the zoo.

871
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,280
 So scared, were they?

872
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,000
 Gosh.

873
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,600
 Golly.

874
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,440
 I think one of the coolest things I read

875
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,400
 as part of this research is that you got the sun,

876
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,280
 we're just staring at it,

877
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,800
 we're trying to work out what's going on with it.

878
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,000
 We got nothing to compare it to.

879
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 But we got nothing to compare it to.

880
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,200
 And that's not true anymore.

881
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,560
 And it's not been true for a while,

882
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,040
 because the Kepler Space Telescope,

883
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,480
 back when it was operating,

884
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,520
 monitored 150,000 stars in the Milky Way,

885
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:17,360
 and they found 369 suns that are incredibly similar to ours.

886
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,640
 And so now we can look at other case studies,

887
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,080
 as it were, and go,

888
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,440
 "Oh, this is interesting.

889
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,280
 That sun is very active at the moment."

890
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,280
 And it wasn't 10, 11 years ago.

891
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,120
 That must mean that it's running in phases.

892
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,280
 So we can learn via these suns

893
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,040
 that are billions of miles away about our own sun.

894
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,640
 Yeah, because there are a lot of scientists

895
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,800
 that look at our sun as a curiosity

896
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,840
 compared to other suns,

897
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,480
 in that they say it's spectacularly boring

898
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,240
 in comparison to all the other suns

899
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,760
 that we're seeing in the universe.

900
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,920
 And they partially wonder if that's why we're here at all.

901
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,040
 Yeah, that must be right.

902
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,360
 Because if it starts spitting out stuff at us

903
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,840
 every two or three years, we're going to die.

904
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,480
 Exactly. So our sun is just not that active,

905
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,080
 and that's been incredible for us.

906
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,720
 It has. And I think actually with the election coming up,

907
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,400
 sometimes you want a boring center of your universe,

908
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,160
 don't you? Because it can be relied upon.

909
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,400
 To not destroy you.

910
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,120
 That is a political broadcast for Kier Starman.

911
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,000
 Don't know what you're talking about.

912
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,880
 We actually had someone write in who was a space weather forecaster.

913
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,520
 Oh, I know.

914
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,480
 To the fish inbox.

915
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:18,880
 Really?

916
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,600
 This is cool.

917
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,720
 He's called Gavin Medley.

918
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,640
 What? Dark with no weather again.

919
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,640
 He works at the LASP,

920
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,360
 which is the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics

921
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,640
 at the University of Colorado.

922
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,800
 And he was writing about the, you know,

923
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,440
 if the sun emits a giant electromagnetic storm,

924
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,680
 we won't get warning before it hits us.

925
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,520
 But there are space weather instruments

926
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,440
 that sit on spacecraft at Lagrange points,

927
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,080
 and they just sit there in gravitational equilibrium.

928
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,680
 And one of their goals is to collect data

929
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,640
 to predict and warn about solar storms and flares,

930
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,160
 which can take down our electrical structure.

931
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,080
 And that's how we knew like a few weeks ago

932
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,680
 when they had that big solar storm

933
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,040
 that people in London couldn't see,

934
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,720
 but everyone else in the country could see.

935
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,840
 Yeah. The aurora.

936
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,400
 The aurora. We know about that because of those things.

937
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,040
 Yeah.

938
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,720
 By the way, we're in the most exciting year for the sun

939
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,560
 in 11 years, loads of sunspots.

940
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:06,880
 Oh.

941
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,040
 'Cause the sun switches poles every 11 years.

942
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:09,280
 Yeah.

943
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,160
 So the most boring year was 2019,

944
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,000
 and that was like hardly any sunspots,

945
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 because the poles were just like perfectly aligned

946
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,480
 north and south, and now we're in the most feisty year,

947
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,400
 which I think might be why they've discovered this thing

948
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,520
 that your main fact was about,

949
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,600
 is because it feels like as a scientist,

950
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,280
 it's the most thrilling time to look at the sun,

951
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,120
 'cause so much mad shit's going on there.

952
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,680
 So if one of these big coronal mass ejections hits us,

953
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,440
 we're kind of buggered a little bit, right?

954
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,360
 All of our electronics are going to fry,

955
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,640
 and until they fix it, it's going to be pretty tough.

956
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,680
 And we knew that this big one was coming a few weeks ago,

957
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,240
 and I was in Wales in the middle of nowhere,

958
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,320
 and so I got a load of cash out of the cash machine

959
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,440
 just in case, all of the cash machines got back genuinely.

960
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,560
 Just subtle prepper.

961
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,360
 I love it.

962
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,600
 Your cash is no good in the aftertimes.

963
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,840
 But it'll get me home.

964
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,200
 Like all I had to do was get home.

965
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,560
 I have an electric car, right?

966
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,200
 So if I'm stuck in Wales with an electric car,

967
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,800
 and all the electrics are fried,

968
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,080
 I am kind of buggered.

969
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,080
 I'm not necessarily buggered if you have to stay in Wales, James.

970
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,560
 Come on.

971
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,520
 Good people of Wales.

972
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,160
 Great place to be stranded for a while.

973
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,520
 No, it's a great place to be,

974
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,960
 but it's not ideal for the rest of my family if I'm in Wales.

975
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,720
 James's electric tin opener is in London.

976
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,240
 That's what he's getting back to.

977
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,120
 Oh, he brings that with him.

978
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,800
 I keep that in a lead-lined case,

979
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,960
 a case of a coronal mass ejection.

980
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,280
 But there's a theory, right?

981
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,880
 So we could fire out a big loop of wire into space.

982
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,400
 So the entire earth is covered by one wire.

983
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:34,880
 Okay.

984
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,240
 And then when the coronal mass ejection comes in,

985
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,400
 which is basically charged particles,

986
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,320
 then the wire can kind of ground it,

987
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,800
 and it won't fry all of our electricity.

988
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,280
 That's interesting.

989
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,240
 It's a really good idea.

990
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,160
 No one's really taken the idea seriously,

991
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,280
 but they reckon that the loop would cost about $100 billion to make.

992
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,880
 But if we did get hit by one of those coronal mass ejections,

993
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,480
 which will happen sometime,

994
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,480
 the cost will be way more than that.

995
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,040
 Yeah.

996
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,800
 Wait, wait, it'll be in the trillions.

997
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,440
 It will fuck up our economy for years.

998
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,880
 Actually, $100 billion.

999
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,880
 Sounds a lot, but actually, you know,

1000
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,640
 a lot of things, when you read about it in the paper,

1001
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,400
 it's like $600 billion.

1002
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,920
 Oh, okay, yeah.

1003
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,120
 We clubbed together.

1004
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,360
 Yeah.

1005
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,080
 We didn't deal with that.

1006
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,760
 Well, how much did you get out of the cash point the other day?

1007
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:24,400
 There's a big queue behind James.

1008
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,920
 His limit's 200 a time.

1009
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,160
 It's only $20 million a time there.

1010
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:28,960
 Let me take out.
