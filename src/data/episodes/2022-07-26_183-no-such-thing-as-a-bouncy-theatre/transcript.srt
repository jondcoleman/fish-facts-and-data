00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,700
 It's a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

2
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,460
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

3
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,820
 and Alex Bell, and once again we have gathered around the microphones of our four favorite facts

4
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,140
 from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,060
 Starting with you, Alex.

6
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:47,140
 My fact this week is that 1% of the entire planet's wood supply is turned into IKEA furniture.

7
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,140
 Bullshit.

8
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,140
 That is true.

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,540
 But they've only got 400 or so shops globally that we haven't been to one.

10
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,540
 Yeah, but they're pretty big.

11
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,780
 Think about how many books there are, right, in the world, and how many trees are needed

12
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,780
 for that.

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,640
 So if you think of an Amazon warehouse globally, all the warehouses, surely more wood

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
 goes there.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,020
 I think the amount of volume that passes through those shops is huge.

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,660
 So one of the reasons that their furniture is so cheap is the way they've packaged it.

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,220
 So if you open up an IKEA bookcase package, it's incredibly tightly packed together.

18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,580
 There's very little polystyrene in it, and that's like part of the reason it's so cheap

19
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,580
 apparently.

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,740
 Also, you have to transport it from one place to another, but you're not transporting

21
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,620
 any air, which is heavy, when you put a lot of it in there, they're wooden lorries.

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:36,300
 So one thing that you can't really flat pack is sofas and armchairs, because they just

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,500
 come as one big object, don't they?

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,900
 And so one way they tried to fix that was by making it inflatable sofas, and by making

25
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,860
 these inflatable sofas they would reduce the use of raw materials by 85% and transport

26
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,860
 volume by 90%.

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,860
 Wow.

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,500
 And the idea was you would buy this inflatable sofa, you'd blow it up at home, and then you'd

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,060
 put some cloth over it, and you wouldn't know that it was air.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,060
 So basically?

31
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,780
 But aren't they effectively manufacturing furniture for bouncy castles?

32
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,460
 Yeah, but bouncy castles are quite comfortable, if you've ever sat on one, you've never watched

33
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,940
 a whole film on a bouncy castle though, which I do want to do that sometimes.

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,940
 Who was it who did?

35
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
 Who was it?

36
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,940
 We'll see, would you?

37
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,940
 Yeah, we'll see, would you?

38
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,540
 Our friend comedian, we'll see, did bouncy castle hamlet and bouncy castle mudbeth.

39
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,300
 But in that case, he was acting on the bouncy castle rather than people watching on the bouncy

40
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
 castle.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
 Yeah, it's true.

42
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,500
 I would go to a bouncy theatre, but that's because a lot of theatre's have very uncomfortable

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
 seats.

44
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
 Yeah.

45
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 Hang on.

46
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 So did this work?

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 So did this work?

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:46,420
 Well, it did work up to a point in that you could sit on them.

49
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,900
 The problem was they picked up a lot of static electricity, and so they turned into massive

50
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,740
 dust collectors, so you would be full of dust.

51
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,780
 And also, they didn't really weigh anything.

52
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,780
 So it flew too late.

53
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,940
 Yeah, that's basically it.

54
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,940
 They would kind of float away from where you left them.

55
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,900
 So the one good thing about a sulphur is it's always in the same place.

56
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,900
 Yeah.

57
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,140
 I think that's the one good thing about a sulphur.

58
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,140
 It's one of the good things.

59
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,140
 Oh, sure.

60
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,140
 One of them.

61
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,140
 Yeah.

62
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,140
 So this is like a hover so far.

63
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,140
 It was a bit like that.

64
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,420
 The stars, they would all start to gather in one corner of the star.

65
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,980
 And one of their works at IKEA said they were like a gathering of swollen hippos.

66
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
 Oh, wow.

67
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,060
 But can you imagine coming into work and then all of the selfies have moved to one fire?

68
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,060
 It's terrifying.

69
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,460
 You would be paranoid that they're conspiring against you.

70
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,500
 You've got the mid-meeting like toy story.

71
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,020
 So that's the thing about IKEA is that the store's famously, you can only go around

72
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,020
 the one way.

73
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,020
 There's a few shortcuts.

74
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,020
 Yeah.

75
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,020
 I've heard this.

76
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,020
 So like often they're like the door section and they're all fake doors and one of them's a

77
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,020
 real door.

78
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,860
 And you have two IKEA workers.

79
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,100
 One of them is always the last to tell the truth to me.

80
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,100
 But the Guardian did a thing about the architecture of an IKEA shop.

81
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,060
 They interviewed a few architectural professors and they found that 60% of IKEA purchases are

82
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,060
 impulse.

83
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,220
 The reason they get so many impulse purchases is that you have to put an item in your trolley

84
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,860
 when you see it because otherwise you probably won't see it again because you're going

85
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,860
 around the whole shop.

86
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,860
 Yeah.

87
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,860
 So you can just sling it anything.

88
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,140
 I'll put it there for the moment.

89
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,140
 Yeah.

90
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,580
 I always go around twice once making a mental image of everything I want to buy.

91
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,580
 Do you really?

92
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,900
 Everyone in the IKEA control room is like, who is this freak who is watching my monocles?

93
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,820
 That's like those mind palaces, isn't it?

94
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,820
 You have a mind IKEA shop.

95
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,060
 There's full of hundreds of hundreds of items.

96
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,420
 Do you know about Janja Wintersall?

97
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,420
 No.

98
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:45,740
 Okay, she has a mind palace and she was given a week to memorize all 328 pages and 4818 items

99
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,700
 of the 2018 IKEA catalog and she managed to do it.

100
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700
 Wow.

101
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,700
 You're kidding, really?

102
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,700
 Well, as in people have tested her and she's got everything right.

103
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
 Yeah.

104
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,700
 That's amazing.

105
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
 Yeah, she got that.

106
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,700
 Twice as many IKEA catalogs are printed every year as Bibles.

107
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
 Oh, there.

108
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
 Yeah.

109
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,700
 And 75% of the IKEA catalog is CGI.

110
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
 It's not real.

111
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
 What?

112
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,700
 I know.

113
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
 No.

114
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
 What does that mean?

115
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
 I have no other pictures.

116
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,700
 The finish was really if you buy.

117
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
 You know, just like in a full three or so.

118
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,780
 I mean, like the pictures aren't actual pictures of the product.

119
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,780
 The item.

120
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,780
 They're the CGI rendering.

121
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,620
 They're actually Andy Circus pretending to be so far.

122
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,940
 Just speaking of the catalog and memory of all the items, all the items obviously have

123
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,940
 very odd names.

124
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,940
 Yes.

125
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,940
 So you'd have to be memorizing these very odd names as well.

126
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,940
 Like Billy Bookcase.

127
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,940
 Exactly.

128
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,780
 It was revealed this year, why they're called, what they're called, all the items at IKEA.

129
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,620
 And it's to do with the founder and the fact that Camprad is his own name.

130
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,420
 He is the K in IKEA.

131
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,420
 Okay.

132
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,420
 Camp member is first name, but it begins with I.

133
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,420
 Yeah.

134
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,420
 And the initial is his first name, his second name.

135
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,260
 And then I believe it's his, the town he lived in, the lake that he lived next to.

136
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,260
 The farm where he grew up.

137
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,260
 And then his hometown.

138
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,260
 There we go.

139
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
 Yeah.

140
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,260
 So he had dyslexia.

141
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,260
 Right.

142
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,780
 He found it impossible to just memorize regular codes and regular names.

143
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,700
 So they came up with this system whereby everything in IKEA was given something that he could

144
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,180
 relate to so that he could, he could memorize the category of name that it has.

145
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,900
 So for example, if it's a bed textile, it will be named after a flower or a plant.

146
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,700
 So he'll know, okay, it's going to be a flower plant.

147
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,100
 That's easy to remember.

148
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,100
 Beds, wardrobes and hall furniture are Norwegian name places.

149
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,340
 Old cases are either Scandinavian boy names or professions.

150
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,820
 And so every little product has its own category of, of theme.

151
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,340
 But all of his children are named after things that you can get in a house.

152
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,340
 What?

153
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,060
 So he's got a child called bed and another one called, yes.

154
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,100
 There's another one percent fact here because Billy Bookcases, there are about 60 million

155
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,860
 in the world, which is nearly one for every 100 people.

156
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,180
 Does anyone here have a Billy Bookcase?

157
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,180
 Yeah, I do.

158
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,180
 How many three?

159
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
 You've got three.

160
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
 Yeah.

161
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,180
 I've got three as well, I think.

162
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,660
 I, I used to have somebody don't any mark.

163
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,660
 I've got one.

164
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,980
 So that's seven between us.

165
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,660
 So we are, we have more than average.

166
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,820
 That's more than one percent.

167
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,820
 Yeah.

168
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,820
 That's more than one percent.

169
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,300
 What we would actually need is, um, not point, not four of them.

170
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
 Yeah.

171
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
 Yeah.

172
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
 Matt Banta there.

173
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,140
 And they also use one percent of the world's cotton every year, according to them.

174
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,140
 Do they?

175
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,140
 Yeah.

176
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,140
 Can Prade use to be a Nazi?

177
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,140
 I know.

178
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,140
 It was such a shame.

179
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,900
 He seemed like such a quirky, fun character and then it got to that bit of the story.

180
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
 It's the elephant in the room.

181
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
 Yeah.

182
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,100
 And the elephant is wearing a swastika round band.

183
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,100
 I'm afraid.

184
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,100
 Yeah.

185
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,100
 He's a player.

186
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,100
 He has a apologise for it.

187
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
 Very previously.

188
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
 He was a teenager.

189
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,100
 He was 17 in 1943.

190
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,420
 So, uh, he wasn't involved in the early stages.

191
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
 We can say that.

192
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,580
 Do you remember the actor, Haley Gelozman?

193
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,580
 Yes.

194
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
 Yeah.

195
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,580
 He was in the Sixth Sense.

196
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,580
 Exactly.

197
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,580
 The kid in the Sixth Sense.

198
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,580
 Oh, yeah.

199
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,580
 Yeah.

200
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,580
 Uh, he was discovered in an Ikea.

201
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,580
 What did he say?

202
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,580
 His parents had lasted three years earlier.

203
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,580
 Yeah.

204
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,580
 Haley Gelozman.

205
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,780
 Um, he was in, uh, in Burbank in America, they have an Ikea.

206
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,140
 He was inside it and there were just people sitting there taking photos, casting kids basically

207
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,300
 and they just, it was just a desk and said, come over, have your photo taken and we'll

208
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,180
 put you up for casting.

209
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,820
 And so he was with his parents walking through Ikea, saw that sat down.

210
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,820
 They took photos of him and he immediately got cast for a Pizza Hut commercial for their

211
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,820
 new Bigfoot pizza.

212
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,620
 So the head of it now, we find our way down found this time.

213
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,980
 It's an anti-tangental Ikea information with a keyword Bigfoot right to the end.

214
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,460
 So we have a Google Alert set up for Bigfoot.

215
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,620
 So while he was on TV, Robert Zamekis or Tom Hanks must have seen it because they then

216
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,180
 called him in or the casting director certainly for the movie Forest Gump.

217
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,860
 So he, before he was in six cents, he plays Forest Gump's son at the end of the movie.

218
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,860
 It does, he.

219
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,260
 And then he went on to six cents and so on, but discovered in an Ikea.

220
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,980
 What was the main feature of the Bigfoot Pizza?

221
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
 Why was it called a Bigfoot Pizza?

222
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,660
 I reckon it must have been big.

223
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,980
 Was it shaped like a foot?

224
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
 It tasted like feet.

225
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
 [laughter]

226
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
 It tasted like a foot.

227
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,460
 Or you ordered it, open it and nothing was there.

228
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,940
 Just a blurry photo of a pizza.

229
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:22,420
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

230
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,660
 Okay, my fact this week is that the Nazca people would employ someone to walk around with

231
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,300
 a dead fox on their head.

232
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,300
 Cool.

233
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,740
 So the Nazca people, these are the people of Peru from my holiday.

234
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,740
 From your holiday.

235
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,420
 I've just come back from Peru.

236
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
 Yep.

237
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,580
 I want to talk about Peru because I think it's amazing.

238
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,460
 I found it quite hard finding out about this fact James and I presume that's because you've

239
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,420
 got the fact from a tour guide or from some intrinsic esoteric bit of location.

240
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,980
 James was the guy that they employed to walk around.

241
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,580
 I got this from an exhibition at the National Art Museum of Lima and it was someone who

242
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,540
 listens to this podcast called Patricia who took me and my wife round and one of the

243
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,620
 things I had in this museum was a dead fox and apparently what happened was if you were

244
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,700
 growing crops and you wanted to scare the birds away, they didn't have scarecrows.

245
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,900
 They were to have a person with a fox on their head.

246
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,780
 So the birds flying around would see the fox and think that's a fox and I'm not going to

247
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,140
 go down and eat the crops.

248
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,460
 It's just like a human scarecrop.

249
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,180
 That's great but why wouldn't all farmers just then not wear a dead fox on their head every

250
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,180
 day?

251
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,180
 Because they're heavy.

252
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,180
 Are they?

253
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,180
 A whole fox.

254
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,180
 Yeah.

255
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,180
 A whole fox is different.

256
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,180
 It's pretty much like, the one that they had in the museum was like a spread out.

257
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,180
 Carpet kind of thing.

258
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
 Kind of a carpet thing.

259
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,380
 You can get fox shawls, you know, like scarves that are posh old women wear in the 19s.

260
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,380
 Yeah, but a bird's not going to get tricked by that.

261
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,380
 No, it's true.

262
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,380
 But you'd look amazing.

263
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,700
 I think I'm not sure it was actually a fox because I'm not sure it was a fox.

264
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,020
 It's not going to find it online.

265
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,220
 Were you even in Peru?

266
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,740
 I have a feeling it might have been a Zorro, which is a...

267
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
 The mask of Zorro.

268
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
 The mask of Zorro.

269
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,260
 Zorro is a Peruvian desert fox, a faux fox.

270
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,340
 But the Nazca's are famous.

271
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
 They're pre-Columbian.

272
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,780
 So before the Europeans went over to Peru and they're most famous because they lived in

273
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,220
 the desert and they made these massive lines in the middle of the desert, which you can

274
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:23,020
 go and visit and you fly off them and you can see all these different shapes of things.

275
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,060
 Are they amazing to see?

276
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,660
 They were quite amazing to see here, basically because I always wanted to.

277
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,660
 Yeah.

278
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,500
 And so I was impressed by them.

279
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,780
 Were they larger than you would have expected?

280
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,420
 They were smaller to me because I was a long way away and they're a plane.

281
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,580
 But some are bigger than others and you have lots of shapes of animals and stuff and there

282
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,900
 are some massive ones which are just a triangle, so they're a bit shit.

283
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,740
 But then there are smaller ones, which are like a monkey or something or a killer whale

284
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,340
 and they're really cool.

285
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,740
 That's very cool.

286
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,300
 So they didn't know what they looked like.

287
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,300
 Is this the latest theory?

288
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,020
 I've read a better theory.

289
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,660
 I think it's an incredible coincidence, they all look like animals if they didn't know.

290
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,180
 I mean, that would explain the triangles.

291
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,180
 I think they would know.

292
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,740
 They didn't have power flights, so the question is how do they know?

293
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,420
 There are hills around, so they'd be able to stand on their hills and see them.

294
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,460
 Have you heard of hot air balloon theory?

295
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,460
 Oh god.

296
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,500
 Sorry.

297
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
 This is a man.

298
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,660
 Why do I get the feeling this is going to be full of hot air?

299
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,220
 This is a man who is called Jim Woodman from the 1970s.

300
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,620
 One percent of him is owned by IKEA.

301
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:40,900
 In the 1970s he put forward this theory that in fact the Nazca people did see these line

302
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,420
 formations and they did it from the air by hot air balloons which he believes they were

303
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,180
 able to build.

304
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,220
 So what he said is that he noticed that they had an amazing textile industry that had

305
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,900
 high grade weaving and clothes.

306
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
 That's true.

307
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
 Yep.

308
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,100
 And he also said that they knew what smoke did.

309
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,460
 They knew that hot air rise and so on.

310
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,700
 They knew the basic things and all they needed to do was put two things together.

311
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,140
 We've not found any hot air balloons.

312
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,900
 Because he says, he floated away, Jim.

313
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
 Exactly.

314
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,540
 He floated away to the 19th century.

315
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,420
 What he says is that they used it for burial rituals.

316
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,020
 So what they were doing were they were putting the dead Nazca people inside the hot air balloons

317
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,340
 and they would fly off into the Pacific Ocean.

318
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,860
 So but if you happen to accidentally be in one of the funeral baskets of a hot air balloon

319
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,820
 then you could see from above.

320
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,060
 There's a few holes obviously in his theory.

321
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,100
 One is that he actually tested it out using the basic stuff that they had and it could only

322
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,700
 make sort of awkward liftoffs for a few minutes at a time.

323
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,140
 I read that they built one.

324
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,820
 They got to about 400 feet up.

325
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,420
 Oh, well maybe they kept going.

326
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,780
 Maybe this is an old article.

327
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,460
 Why are you encouraging him?

328
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,540
 Because I think this actually holds a lot of water this theory.

329
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,540
 So do you?

330
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,540
 Yes.

331
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,020
 So they were professional ballooners to build this trial balloon in 1975.

332
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,340
 Admittedly they were doing it to a design from the 18th century still, but they used only

333
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,500
 things that the Nazca people would have had available to them.

334
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,380
 So only local cloths using the same sort of materials and crops.

335
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:24,820
 Even the fires that they got the hot air from were made using wood that was available locally

336
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,820
 and it did work.

337
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,140
 I mean obviously it would have been for a treat or a special occasion.

338
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
 Right.

339
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,860
 Here's the problem with the Pacific Ocean burial theory is that the prevailing wids are

340
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,340
 going in a different direction.

341
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,340
 That's true.

342
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,060
 So if the balloon did go up it would crash into the Andy's mountains on the east of it.

343
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,860
 But there are a lot of hills around there, a mountain, so you can see it from high up

344
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
 I think.

345
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,380
 So if you go to the north floor to the theory of them not seeing it, you can actually see it

346
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,380
 from mountains.

347
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
 It's a way easier.

348
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,780
 Is it not something about all being along the same line of longitude or last year?

349
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,060
 They're all basically in a straight line around the world.

350
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
 Correct.

351
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:05,660
 Well, the people who I spoke to reckon that they are, do you remember in the Viking times

352
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,780
 they would have like labyrinths and you would walk around them and it would be a kind

353
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,740
 of penance, or it would be a kind of a religious walk or something like that?

354
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,740
 And they think a lot of them because of that because if you look at them, they're

355
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
 like labyrinths.

356
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,820
 There's one way in and one way out and you can walk along them as they, you know, if you

357
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,700
 think of a monkey which is a line drawing, you can walk into the tail, go all the way around

358
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,980
 it and then come out from the legs.

359
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,660
 Like an edge of sketch of things.

360
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,660
 Exactly like that.

361
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
 Yeah.

362
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,860
 But I think the truth is nobody knows because when the Spanish came they got rid of all

363
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,220
 of the history and also they didn't write anything down the Nusca people and actually

364
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,340
 none of the pre-Columbians wrote anything down.

365
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,860
 They didn't have any writing.

366
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,500
 The Alex and I went to a talk where we found out how they were made.

367
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
 Oh, really?

368
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,300
 So we went to see this guy, a historian called Eric Von Daniken, and I was like, what are

369
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
 you trying to mean to this?

370
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:04,620
 You came along and Eric Von Daniken, who was a very big part of a TV series called Ancient

371
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,580
 Aliens, but obviously writer of the book chariots of the gods, which was the global sensational,

372
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,020
 bestselling, greatest book ever published.

373
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,100
 It was a piece of bullshit.

374
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,500
 Great nonfiction.

375
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,500
 Yeah, obviously that's a massive theory that they had helped from aliens, but obviously when

376
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,260
 you look at it, it looks more like it's Horde of Balloons.

377
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,700
 I don't like this tactic of you giving one ridiculous theory and then giving one even

378
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,500
 more ridiculous theory and expecting us to buy the second one.

379
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
 That's like the prices.

380
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
 What is that?

381
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 Yeah.

382
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,420
 There's a pricing theory in shops where they say, you can have this one, just as cheap and

383
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,420
 cost 50 quid.

384
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
 So much costs 600 quid.

385
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,500
 Or you can have the 10,000 pounds one, so you get the 600 quid one.

386
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,100
 Or it's like a chainsaw thing in the triangle.

387
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,620
 Now it's kind of a bit shit because it's a monkey one right next to it and it's like it's

388
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,620
 still pretty high effort.

389
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,620
 Yeah, that's good line.

390
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,620
 That's true.

391
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:59,740
 Actually, while we were in Peru, we went to a place called the Sistine Chapel of America,

392
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:07,220
 Pedro de Andecualeías, or something like that, and it's very nice church, but the talk

393
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,140
 I was a bit boring, so we kind of just ducked out and next to it there was a little museum

394
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:18,100
 of like Nazca people, and they had a whole load of stuff about aliens and it was a proper

395
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
 museum.

396
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,220
 And they had these elongated skulls that they find sometimes and stuff like that.

397
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,220
 And they literally in this museum had no bit of saying, no, it's not aliens.

398
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,300
 And they're just like, nobody knows.

399
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,780
 You're kidding, that's so cool.

400
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,700
 As I was there, I was like, "Dan would love this museum."

401
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
 That's amazing.

402
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,100
 I think it was the previous people in the same area who made the elongated skulls, I can't

403
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,700
 remember the name because of the peep, but I've got it in my notes somewhere.

404
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,700
 Do you know how the Nazca died out?

405
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,700
 Oh, glue away.

406
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,700
 Overfolded by something quite irritatingly dull.

407
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,700
 Is it El Nino or like some kind of weather phenomenon?

408
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
 Yeah, it is.

409
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,420
 Alex, I don't think it's irritatingly dull, but sorry, if it is, what I remember was like

410
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,660
 not alien, like not like, there weren't like white-to-white meteors, it was just like...

411
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,380
 Well, it is to do with crops, so let's see how far we get, shall we?

412
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,860
 So basically, they used to live on these trees called fire angos, which are very, very

413
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,860
 cool, very hardwood, very good for building things.

414
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,540
 And the roots go 150 feet down because it's so dry there.

415
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,540
 So they used to live on those.

416
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,660
 And then they started chopping them all down, kind of like Easter Island, so that they

417
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,980
 could grow crops, right?

418
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,460
 And then they grew loads and loads of crops, and then at about 500 AD, there was a massive

419
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,220
 flood, which completely destroyed their civilization, swept across the plain, destroyed all their

420
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,500
 homes, and within 200 years they'd been conquered and died out.

421
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,580
 But the way we know this is so cool, a team from Cambridge University went there, and they

422
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,580
 measured the amount of pollen in the soil at different depths.

423
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,940
 So they can say, "Oh, well, up to 400 AD, there's loads of horango pollen, then there's

424
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,260
 a bit of cotton pollen, and then suddenly there's this big boom in loads of other crops, like

425
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,580
 squash and mazes and things."

426
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,420
 And that's how they knew that they'd chop down all the trees in the area, and they were just

427
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,820
 having huge fields of crops instead.

428
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
 Right.

429
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,820
 That's what they do.

430
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
 Wow.

431
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
 So they do crop circles then as well.

432
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
 No.

433
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
 For the aliens.

434
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,820
 Oh my God.

435
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:16,780
 There is one theory, by the way, which is, it is to do with aliens, but it's a more like

436
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,940
 one of these unreasonable ideas.

437
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,060
 It's a more scientific approach, which is that rather than the aliens built the line,

438
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:29,340
 like us setting up setty or things in order to look to the universe for signals of life,

439
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,100
 it was basically big SOS, not SOS, but you know what I mean, it was attempt to communicate.

440
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,620
 There were attempts of saying there was life down here and drawing animals so that anyone

441
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,140
 looking down onto Earth might see that things were man-made.

442
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,340
 Again, it's a theory I've not spoken to.

443
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:53,300
 And his later James Fizer and I'm playing some now-special.

444
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,740
 OK, there's time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

445
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,940
 My fact is that instead of going outside, the painter Gainesborough painted outdoor scenes

446
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,140
 by making a little model with moss and broccoli.

447
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,500
 So broccoli were his trees.

448
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
 Exactly.

449
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
 And he used coal for boulders.

450
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
 He used coal.

451
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,020
 And he used cables for stones.

452
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,020
 Exactly.

453
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,020
 So he was a famous landscape painter.

454
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,020
 British, right.

455
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,020
 British.

456
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,740
 It was born in 1727, just to give you an idea, died in 1788.

457
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,260
 And yeah, he would make inspiration, these weird little models, and then he used broccoli

458
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,260
 for trees.

459
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,700
 It's all because it's basically a piece of art for another piece of art.

460
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,700
 Yeah, it is.

461
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
 Yeah.

462
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,580
 He wasn't painting directly from them, but it was to give him ideas of what he wanted

463
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,580
 to move.

464
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,580
 What goes where and what.

465
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,500
 Yeah, because it's much easier to move a piece of broccoli than it is to move a tree.

466
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,060
 And it's all about the shape of the painting.

467
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:49,020
 He was really precise about the exact shape of his hilt and where the cow would go and everything.

468
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,660
 Did he have little cows?

469
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
 Yep.

470
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,660
 Great.

471
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,660
 What were they made of?

472
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,660
 Like cockroaches.

473
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,660
 That's right.

474
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,140
 That's why if you look closely at the Gainesborough painting, all the cows have little antenna

475
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,580
 and hard shell-like bodies.

476
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,260
 One of the reasons that he's not as famous, I didn't know his name, I have to admit.

477
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,900
 And he gets often compared to, is it Constable who lived very much near him?

478
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,180
 And I think partly the reason is he was held back slightly by his little broccoli model

479
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,180
 village.

480
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,460
 Oh my god, stuck in it.

481
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,860
 Because with Constable, there's a great thing of geographically, you can visit all of

482
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,060
 the lands that he was painting, and that's a huge thing to go there and wander through

483
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,340
 the fields and look at the trees that were, you know, in his paintings.

484
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,340
 But yeah.

485
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:39,420
 I'm sorry, I've eaten it.

486
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,700
 It is tragic though, because he loved landscapes, but the thing that sold and made you money

487
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,980
 at the time was portraits, obviously, for wealthy people commissioning pictures.

488
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,780
 But he just wanted to do the landscapes that's all he was really interested in.

489
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,780
 So it's really sad.

490
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,860
 They only became popular as things you could buy just in their own right after his death.

491
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,420
 His brothers were quite interesting.

492
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:03,220
 His brother Humphrey was a mechanic, and he invented a method of condensing steam in

493
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:09,700
 sort of separate containers that then James Watts used when he was developing his engine.

494
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,340
 How can you find that interesting and stuff about pollen in that has irritatingly dull.

495
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,460
 No, he said irrigating.

496
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:24,700
 And his other brother was called John, but everyone called him scheming jack, because he used

497
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,460
 to come up with the ideas of curiosity.

498
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,060
 Yeah, he invented copper wings that he tried to fly with, and he had a sulphur.

499
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:37,500
 Yeah, and he had a self-rocking crib and a cuckoo that cuckoo's all year long, a cuckoo

500
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
 clock.

501
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
 It's useful.

502
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
 Yeah, a cuckoo clock.

503
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,060
 Yeah, that cuckoo'd all year long.

504
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,140
 Well, most cuckoo clocks that are made in Germany or wherever, they don't only do it

505
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,140
 once.

506
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
 Do it during spring.

507
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,140
 No, but they do, like, once an hour, right?

508
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,620
 I think his was just cuckooing all the time.

509
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,260
 They sound like quite a group of, you know, the brothers are all making things, aren't

510
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,260
 they?

511
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,260
 Yeah, that's what I mean.

512
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,260
 I mean, it's a very interesting spread.

513
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,020
 You often get them with this, this would let historical families, they often have really

514
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,020
 interesting...

515
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,500
 Is it 'cause they're all rich and they don't have to do proper jobs?

516
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 Probably.

517
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,180
 I think he wasn't very rich to start off.

518
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,700
 He became very wealthy, and he got really annoyed later in life, because he got annoyed

519
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,980
 with customers saying, "Can you paint my child dressed up as Henry VIII, please?"

520
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,980
 But I wanted you to get my child exactly right, and he said, "You're not going to get

521
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,820
 a good likeness of your child if he's dressed as Henry VIII in this painting."

522
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,780
 I read that he painted with paint brushes that were six feet long.

523
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,780
 I read that.

524
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,900
 I'm not sure whether it's completely true.

525
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,740
 I suppose I knew what he did, but he put the canvas he was painting on right next to

526
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,140
 the person sitting for the painting, and then he'd paint from a bit further back.

527
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,900
 I think unbelievable amount of size skill, if you can do that, I paint a vague likeness of

528
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,900
 someone's child.

529
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,740
 Have you heard about his huge rivalry?

530
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,100
 Oh, with Joshua Reynolds.

531
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,700
 With Joshua Reynolds, who was another very famous artist of the time?

532
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,460
 And they just really got on each other's nerves.

533
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:07,260
 And so once Joshua Reynolds insisted that blue wasn't really a good colour, I think he was

534
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,540
 saying that it should most be used in small amounts, unless you're painting the sky, obviously.

535
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,700
 But anyway, one of Gainesville's most famous paintings is called The Blue Boy, as a young

536
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,740
 man who is in a completely blue suit.

537
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,540
 So there is a theory that says that this was painted as a reposter Reynolds saying, "You

538
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,220
 can use blue in paintings."

539
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,620
 Oh, the other argument is he painted the blue by, and then Reynolds said, "Actually blue,

540
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,900
 and you should really only paint girls."

541
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
 Exactly.

542
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,580
 And there is a painting that recently found which was by Gainesboro, and then someone slagged

543
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,220
 it off to the man who's had a commission, and the man who's had a commission, hired Reynolds

544
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,100
 to repaint everything except a thing.

545
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:53,460
 But now the painting is 80% different, so underneath 80% of it is an original Gainesboro.

546
00:24:53,460 --> 00:25:00,500
 And then the top 80% is Reynolds, which is such a deep criticism.

547
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:08,300
 Just a few other odd ways that artists paint these days, different methods.

548
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
 This is really interesting.

549
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:16,940
 In Ukraine, there is a series of scuba divers that now go down and do underwater paintings.

550
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,940
 Under watercolors.

551
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,140
 Yes, underwater colour paintings, yeah.

552
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,740
 And so they go underwater for up to 40 minutes of a time.

553
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,380
 They bring with them canvases that are obviously water resistant, and they use water resistant

554
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,380
 paints.

555
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:37,660
 But now all these landscapes of underneath the ocean, of seaweed and so on, painted from

556
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,660
 the bottom of the ocean.

557
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,660
 Really cool like that.

558
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:47,660
 That's tough if you can't use blue as well, isn't it?

559
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:54,060
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

560
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,260
 My fact this week is that the US Navy submarines are starting to control their periscopes with

561
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,260
 Xbox controllers.

562
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
 It's amazing.

563
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,260
 Yeah.

564
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
 Starting too.

565
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,540
 So they've started trialing the use of it, the trials went very well, and now they're implementing

566
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
 it properly.

567
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
 You're able to.

568
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:16,940
 So the idea behind this, I used to have in my head the way that periscopes work, and

569
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,980
 I think I got this from Batman movies from the '60s, you used to have some person looking

570
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,380
 through almost like the Peep Show contraption.

571
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,700
 These binoculars that would be sent up to the surface, and you would move it around like

572
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,700
 that.

573
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,260
 These days they have a joystick, and the joystick people have been finding very hard

574
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:37,060
 to use, and they started testing it out then by using Xbox controllers, thinking let's

575
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:42,180
 see how this goes down well, and everyone has taken to it surprisingly well, to the point

576
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,220
 of accuracy that it just makes more sense to do it, both for the accuracy, and then

577
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,620
 secondly for the cost, because these controllers cost nothing, but these joysticks that they're

578
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,380
 paying for each time, costs tens of thousands of dollars.

579
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,860
 To get joysticks these days, isn't it?

580
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
 It's hard to get joysticks.

581
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,860
 Yeah.

582
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,060
 Can you use any of these Wii controllers if you prefer?

583
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,620
 It's dangerous using a Wii controller though, because if you wave your arm, it might fire

584
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,220
 a torpedo by the same way.

585
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,500
 But that's what happened when Wii first came out, isn't it, everyone smashed everything

586
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
 in their houses?

587
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 Yeah.

588
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
 That was a big thing.

589
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
 Well said at the time.

590
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
 And you don't want to smash a window in a submarine?

591
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
 No.

592
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:23,780
 Yeah, I believe that the captains and so on who've been talking about the fact that this is

593
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,780
 going to go into place is saying, you know, if one breaks and you happen to be near land,

594
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,980
 you can just go to a local shop by a new Xbox controller.

595
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,980
 Of course, the thing about being a submarine is, there's no guarantee you've been there.

596
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,940
 That's the problem.

597
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,860
 Well, maybe they should buy a few to bring with them.

598
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,180
 So I was looking to Periscopes.

599
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
 Oh yeah.

600
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:50,060
 I didn't know that Periscopes were not invented for the submarine, they were invented or popularized

601
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,260
 if you'd like by the First World War in the trenches.

602
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,020
 And the other thing that was invented was the Periscope Rifle where you attach the firing

603
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:02,380
 mechanism and the rifle to a Periscope so you can fire from the safety of your own trench

604
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,500
 completely inside your trench.

605
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,460
 Now the disadvantage was that they were much less accurate than actually looking through

606
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,580
 the size of proper rifle, obviously, because they're a bit sharp, but they were used to

607
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,100
 great deal in the campaign at Gallipoli.

608
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:23,700
 And in Gallipoli, accuracy mattered a lot less because some trenches were five yards

609
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
 away from each other.

610
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
 No.

611
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,700
 Oh my God.

612
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,940
 So during World War I, the Allies tried to train Seagulls to defecate on the Periscopes

613
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:38,140
 of viewboats so they wouldn't be able to see where they were going.

614
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,140
 How did it go?

615
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,300
 It didn't go so well.

616
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,580
 The main problem was twofold.

617
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,100
 They couldn't tell the difference between friendly subs and enemy subs.

618
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,220
 And also they didn't tend to go out to see very much Seagulls, they tend to live on cliffs

619
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,500
 where there are so many submarines.

620
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,700
 Around the home basically.

621
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:03,500
 So the other thing they did was they would send two swimmers to a submarine.

622
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,100
 One would have a black bag and the other one would have a hammer.

623
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,740
 And the first one would try and put the black bag over the Periscope so they couldn't

624
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,020
 see where they were going.

625
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,140
 And if he failed the other one would smash the glass with a hammer.

626
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,340
 It feels like the second guy is the most important one.

627
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,340
 Yeah.

628
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,340
 Because he can do the most damage.

629
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,340
 Yeah.

630
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,340
 No.

631
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,340
 No, the second guy feels like an afterthought of a plan.

632
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,540
 And what if that doesn't work, sir?

633
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,740
 Smash it with a hammer.

634
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:33,260
 You'd think that one swimmer could cope with a big black bag and a hammer.

635
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,260
 Yes.

636
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,100
 I mean, how big were hammers back in the first World War?

637
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,580
 They were small but black bags were massive.

638
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,420
 Do you know there are some golf courses which have Periscopes?

639
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,420
 James, do you like golf?

640
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,420
 I do.

641
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,540
 I know that if you go and watch golf tournaments or this happened in the past, I don't know if

642
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
 it still happens.

643
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,380
 I haven't been to one for ages, but you would be able to buy little Periscopes because everyone

644
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,060
 stands around the green because they want to watch what's happening.

645
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,060
 Yeah.

646
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,060
 There's only so much space.

647
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,060
 There's lots of people.

648
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,100
 So you can see over the top of people's heads.

649
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,100
 That is great.

650
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
 James, this is not universal.

651
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
 You haven't missed it at every course.

652
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,940
 But there are golf courses which have Periscopes.

653
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,820
 I found one from the '20s and then I found one, modern one, modern one, where the first

654
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,220
 hole is quite hard to see to the green.

655
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,860
 So you need to see if the previous golfing party have moved on to the green before you drive

656
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,700
 a golf ball at them towards the green.

657
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,180
 So they have a 30 foot high Periscope which is from an old Navy submarine.

658
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,060
 They took it off in the '60s and they installed it at the golf course so you can just check

659
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,820
 out the line at the land ahead of you whether it's safe to play.

660
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,660
 There are a lot of courses that you have blind shots that you can't see the shot but the way

661
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,540
 they deal with it is with a little bell and after you've played your shot you ring the bell

662
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,620
 so it's safe for the other guys to play behind you.

663
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,620
 But you may not.

664
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,620
 No.

665
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,500
 If there's no one there, you've come after they've left.

666
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,780
 No one's there to ring the bell.

667
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,780
 Yeah.

668
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,780
 What you need is a constantly ringing cookie clock.

669
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,780
 You can say 'go'.

670
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,460
 But you can slightly pause people.

671
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,460
 That's a problem.

672
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
 It's constantly ringing.

673
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,460
 Yeah.

674
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,460
 But then you get there and you hold the beak of the cookies.

675
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,460
 But yeah.

676
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,180
 A while trying to swing.

677
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:11,460
 I think this is how crazy golf was invented.

678
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,860
