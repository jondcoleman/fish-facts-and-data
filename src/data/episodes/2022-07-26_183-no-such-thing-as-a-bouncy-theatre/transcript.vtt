00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.700
 It's a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.460
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.820
 and Alex Bell, and once again we have gathered around the microphones of our four favorite facts

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.140
 from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.060
 Starting with you, Alex.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.140
 My fact this week is that 1% of the entire planet's wood supply is turned into IKEA furniture.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.140
 Bullshit.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 That is true.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.540
 But they've only got 400 or so shops globally that we haven't been to one.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.540
 Yeah, but they're pretty big.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.780
 Think about how many books there are, right, in the world, and how many trees are needed

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.780
 for that.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.640
 So if you think of an Amazon warehouse globally, all the warehouses, surely more wood

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.640
 goes there.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.020
 I think the amount of volume that passes through those shops is huge.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.660
 So one of the reasons that their furniture is so cheap is the way they've packaged it.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.220
 So if you open up an IKEA bookcase package, it's incredibly tightly packed together.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.580
 There's very little polystyrene in it, and that's like part of the reason it's so cheap

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 apparently.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.740
 Also, you have to transport it from one place to another, but you're not transporting

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.620
 any air, which is heavy, when you put a lot of it in there, they're wooden lorries.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.300
 So one thing that you can't really flat pack is sofas and armchairs, because they just

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.500
 come as one big object, don't they?

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.900
 And so one way they tried to fix that was by making it inflatable sofas, and by making

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.860
 these inflatable sofas they would reduce the use of raw materials by 85% and transport

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.860
 volume by 90%.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 Wow.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.500
 And the idea was you would buy this inflatable sofa, you'd blow it up at home, and then you'd

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.060
 put some cloth over it, and you wouldn't know that it was air.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.060
 So basically?

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.780
 But aren't they effectively manufacturing furniture for bouncy castles?

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.460
 Yeah, but bouncy castles are quite comfortable, if you've ever sat on one, you've never watched

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.940
 a whole film on a bouncy castle though, which I do want to do that sometimes.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.940
 Who was it who did?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.940
 Who was it?

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.940
 We'll see, would you?

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.940
 Yeah, we'll see, would you?

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.540
 Our friend comedian, we'll see, did bouncy castle hamlet and bouncy castle mudbeth.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.300
 But in that case, he was acting on the bouncy castle rather than people watching on the bouncy

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.300
 castle.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.300
 Yeah, it's true.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.500
 I would go to a bouncy theatre, but that's because a lot of theatre's have very uncomfortable

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.500
 seats.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.500
 Yeah.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.500
 Hang on.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.500
 So did this work?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500
 So did this work?

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:46.420
 Well, it did work up to a point in that you could sit on them.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.900
 The problem was they picked up a lot of static electricity, and so they turned into massive

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.740
 dust collectors, so you would be full of dust.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.780
 And also, they didn't really weigh anything.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.780
 So it flew too late.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.940
 Yeah, that's basically it.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.940
 They would kind of float away from where you left them.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.900
 So the one good thing about a sulphur is it's always in the same place.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.900
 Yeah.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.140
 I think that's the one good thing about a sulphur.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.140
 It's one of the good things.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.140
 Oh, sure.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.140
 One of them.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.140
 Yeah.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.140
 So this is like a hover so far.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.140
 It was a bit like that.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.420
 The stars, they would all start to gather in one corner of the star.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.980
 And one of their works at IKEA said they were like a gathering of swollen hippos.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.980
 Oh, wow.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.060
 But can you imagine coming into work and then all of the selfies have moved to one fire?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.060
 It's terrifying.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.460
 You would be paranoid that they're conspiring against you.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.500
 You've got the mid-meeting like toy story.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.020
 So that's the thing about IKEA is that the store's famously, you can only go around

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.020
 the one way.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.020
 There's a few shortcuts.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.020
 Yeah.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.020
 I've heard this.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.020
 So like often they're like the door section and they're all fake doors and one of them's a

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.020
 real door.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.860
 And you have two IKEA workers.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.100
 One of them is always the last to tell the truth to me.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.100
 But the Guardian did a thing about the architecture of an IKEA shop.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.060
 They interviewed a few architectural professors and they found that 60% of IKEA purchases are

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.060
 impulse.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.220
 The reason they get so many impulse purchases is that you have to put an item in your trolley

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.860
 when you see it because otherwise you probably won't see it again because you're going

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.860
 around the whole shop.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.860
 Yeah.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.860
 So you can just sling it anything.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.140
 I'll put it there for the moment.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.140
 Yeah.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.580
 I always go around twice once making a mental image of everything I want to buy.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.580
 Do you really?

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.900
 Everyone in the IKEA control room is like, who is this freak who is watching my monocles?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.820
 That's like those mind palaces, isn't it?

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.820
 You have a mind IKEA shop.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.060
 There's full of hundreds of hundreds of items.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.420
 Do you know about Janja Wintersall?

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.420
 No.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:45.740
 Okay, she has a mind palace and she was given a week to memorize all 328 pages and 4818 items

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.700
 of the 2018 IKEA catalog and she managed to do it.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.700
 Wow.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.700
 You're kidding, really?

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.700
 Well, as in people have tested her and she's got everything right.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.700
 Yeah.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.700
 That's amazing.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.700
 Yeah, she got that.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.700
 Twice as many IKEA catalogs are printed every year as Bibles.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.700
 Oh, there.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.700
 Yeah.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.700
 And 75% of the IKEA catalog is CGI.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.700
 It's not real.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.700
 What?

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.700
 I know.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.700
 No.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.700
 What does that mean?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.700
 I have no other pictures.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.700
 The finish was really if you buy.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.700
 You know, just like in a full three or so.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.780
 I mean, like the pictures aren't actual pictures of the product.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.780
 The item.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.780
 They're the CGI rendering.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.620
 They're actually Andy Circus pretending to be so far.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.940
 Just speaking of the catalog and memory of all the items, all the items obviously have

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.940
 very odd names.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.940
 Yes.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.940
 So you'd have to be memorizing these very odd names as well.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.940
 Like Billy Bookcase.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.940
 Exactly.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.780
 It was revealed this year, why they're called, what they're called, all the items at IKEA.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.620
 And it's to do with the founder and the fact that Camprad is his own name.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.420
 He is the K in IKEA.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.420
 Okay.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.420
 Camp member is first name, but it begins with I.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.420
 Yeah.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.420
 And the initial is his first name, his second name.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.260
 And then I believe it's his, the town he lived in, the lake that he lived next to.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.260
 The farm where he grew up.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.260
 And then his hometown.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.260
 There we go.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.260
 Yeah.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.260
 So he had dyslexia.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.260
 Right.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.780
 He found it impossible to just memorize regular codes and regular names.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.700
 So they came up with this system whereby everything in IKEA was given something that he could

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.180
 relate to so that he could, he could memorize the category of name that it has.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.900
 So for example, if it's a bed textile, it will be named after a flower or a plant.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.700
 So he'll know, okay, it's going to be a flower plant.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.100
 That's easy to remember.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.100
 Beds, wardrobes and hall furniture are Norwegian name places.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.340
 Old cases are either Scandinavian boy names or professions.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.820
 And so every little product has its own category of, of theme.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.340
 But all of his children are named after things that you can get in a house.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.340
 What?

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.060
 So he's got a child called bed and another one called, yes.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.100
 There's another one percent fact here because Billy Bookcases, there are about 60 million

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.860
 in the world, which is nearly one for every 100 people.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.180
 Does anyone here have a Billy Bookcase?

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.180
 Yeah, I do.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.180
 How many three?

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.180
 You've got three.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.180
 Yeah.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.180
 I've got three as well, I think.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.660
 I, I used to have somebody don't any mark.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.660
 I've got one.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.980
 So that's seven between us.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.660
 So we are, we have more than average.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.820
 That's more than one percent.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.820
 Yeah.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.820
 That's more than one percent.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.300
 What we would actually need is, um, not point, not four of them.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.300
 Yeah.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.300
 Yeah.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.300
 Matt Banta there.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:26.140
 And they also use one percent of the world's cotton every year, according to them.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.140
 Do they?

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.140
 Yeah.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.140
 Can Prade use to be a Nazi?

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.140
 I know.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.140
 It was such a shame.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.900
 He seemed like such a quirky, fun character and then it got to that bit of the story.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.900
 It's the elephant in the room.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.900
 Yeah.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.100
 And the elephant is wearing a swastika round band.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.100
 I'm afraid.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.100
 Yeah.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.100
 He's a player.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.100
 He has a apologise for it.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100
 Very previously.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.100
 He was a teenager.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.100
 He was 17 in 1943.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.420
 So, uh, he wasn't involved in the early stages.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.420
 We can say that.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.580
 Do you remember the actor, Haley Gelozman?

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.580
 Yes.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.580
 Yeah.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.580
 He was in the Sixth Sense.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.580
 Exactly.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.580
 The kid in the Sixth Sense.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.580
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.580
 Yeah.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.580
 Uh, he was discovered in an Ikea.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.580
 What did he say?

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.580
 His parents had lasted three years earlier.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.580
 Yeah.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.580
 Haley Gelozman.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.780
 Um, he was in, uh, in Burbank in America, they have an Ikea.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:13.140
 He was inside it and there were just people sitting there taking photos, casting kids basically

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.300
 and they just, it was just a desk and said, come over, have your photo taken and we'll

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.180
 put you up for casting.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.820
 And so he was with his parents walking through Ikea, saw that sat down.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.820
 They took photos of him and he immediately got cast for a Pizza Hut commercial for their

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.820
 new Bigfoot pizza.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.620
 So the head of it now, we find our way down found this time.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.980
 It's an anti-tangental Ikea information with a keyword Bigfoot right to the end.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.460
 So we have a Google Alert set up for Bigfoot.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.620
 So while he was on TV, Robert Zamekis or Tom Hanks must have seen it because they then

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.180
 called him in or the casting director certainly for the movie Forest Gump.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.860
 So he, before he was in six cents, he plays Forest Gump's son at the end of the movie.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.860
 It does, he.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.260
 And then he went on to six cents and so on, but discovered in an Ikea.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.980
 What was the main feature of the Bigfoot Pizza?

00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:59.980
 Why was it called a Bigfoot Pizza?

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.660
 I reckon it must have been big.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.980
 Was it shaped like a foot?

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.980
 It tasted like feet.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:04.980
 [laughter]

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.980
 It tasted like a foot.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.460
 Or you ordered it, open it and nothing was there.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.940
 Just a blurry photo of a pizza.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:22.420
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:27.660
 Okay, my fact this week is that the Nazca people would employ someone to walk around with

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.300
 a dead fox on their head.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.300
 Cool.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.740
 So the Nazca people, these are the people of Peru from my holiday.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.740
 From your holiday.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.420
 I've just come back from Peru.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.420
 Yep.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.580
 I want to talk about Peru because I think it's amazing.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.460
 I found it quite hard finding out about this fact James and I presume that's because you've

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.420
 got the fact from a tour guide or from some intrinsic esoteric bit of location.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.980
 James was the guy that they employed to walk around.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.580
 I got this from an exhibition at the National Art Museum of Lima and it was someone who

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:01.540
 listens to this podcast called Patricia who took me and my wife round and one of the

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.620
 things I had in this museum was a dead fox and apparently what happened was if you were

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.700
 growing crops and you wanted to scare the birds away, they didn't have scarecrows.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.900
 They were to have a person with a fox on their head.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.780
 So the birds flying around would see the fox and think that's a fox and I'm not going to

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.140
 go down and eat the crops.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.460
 It's just like a human scarecrop.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.180
 That's great but why wouldn't all farmers just then not wear a dead fox on their head every

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.180
 day?

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.180
 Because they're heavy.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.180
 Are they?

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.180
 A whole fox.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.180
 Yeah.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.180
 A whole fox is different.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.180
 It's pretty much like, the one that they had in the museum was like a spread out.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.180
 Carpet kind of thing.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.180
 Kind of a carpet thing.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:41.380
 You can get fox shawls, you know, like scarves that are posh old women wear in the 19s.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.380
 Yeah, but a bird's not going to get tricked by that.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.380
 No, it's true.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.380
 But you'd look amazing.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.700
 I think I'm not sure it was actually a fox because I'm not sure it was a fox.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.020
 It's not going to find it online.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.220
 Were you even in Peru?

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.740
 I have a feeling it might have been a Zorro, which is a...

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.740
 The mask of Zorro.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.740
 The mask of Zorro.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:07.260
 Zorro is a Peruvian desert fox, a faux fox.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.340
 But the Nazca's are famous.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.340
 They're pre-Columbian.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.780
 So before the Europeans went over to Peru and they're most famous because they lived in

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.220
 the desert and they made these massive lines in the middle of the desert, which you can

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:23.020
 go and visit and you fly off them and you can see all these different shapes of things.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.060
 Are they amazing to see?

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.660
 They were quite amazing to see here, basically because I always wanted to.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.660
 Yeah.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.500
 And so I was impressed by them.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.780
 Were they larger than you would have expected?

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:39.420
 They were smaller to me because I was a long way away and they're a plane.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.580
 But some are bigger than others and you have lots of shapes of animals and stuff and there

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.900
 are some massive ones which are just a triangle, so they're a bit shit.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.740
 But then there are smaller ones, which are like a monkey or something or a killer whale

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.340
 and they're really cool.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.740
 That's very cool.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.300
 So they didn't know what they looked like.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.300
 Is this the latest theory?

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.020
 I've read a better theory.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:04.660
 I think it's an incredible coincidence, they all look like animals if they didn't know.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.180
 I mean, that would explain the triangles.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.180
 I think they would know.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.740
 They didn't have power flights, so the question is how do they know?

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.420
 There are hills around, so they'd be able to stand on their hills and see them.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.460
 Have you heard of hot air balloon theory?

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.460
 Oh god.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.500
 Sorry.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.500
 This is a man.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.660
 Why do I get the feeling this is going to be full of hot air?

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:30.220
 This is a man who is called Jim Woodman from the 1970s.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.620
 One percent of him is owned by IKEA.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:40.900
 In the 1970s he put forward this theory that in fact the Nazca people did see these line

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.420
 formations and they did it from the air by hot air balloons which he believes they were

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.180
 able to build.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:54.220
 So what he said is that he noticed that they had an amazing textile industry that had

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.900
 high grade weaving and clothes.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.900
 That's true.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.900
 Yep.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.100
 And he also said that they knew what smoke did.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.460
 They knew that hot air rise and so on.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.700
 They knew the basic things and all they needed to do was put two things together.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.140
 We've not found any hot air balloons.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.900
 Because he says, he floated away, Jim.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.900
 Exactly.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.540
 He floated away to the 19th century.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.420
 What he says is that they used it for burial rituals.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:25.020
 So what they were doing were they were putting the dead Nazca people inside the hot air balloons

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.340
 and they would fly off into the Pacific Ocean.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:34.860
 So but if you happen to accidentally be in one of the funeral baskets of a hot air balloon

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.820
 then you could see from above.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.060
 There's a few holes obviously in his theory.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.100
 One is that he actually tested it out using the basic stuff that they had and it could only

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.700
 make sort of awkward liftoffs for a few minutes at a time.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.140
 I read that they built one.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.820
 They got to about 400 feet up.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.420
 Oh, well maybe they kept going.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.780
 Maybe this is an old article.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.460
 Why are you encouraging him?

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.540
 Because I think this actually holds a lot of water this theory.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.540
 So do you?

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.540
 Yes.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.020
 So they were professional ballooners to build this trial balloon in 1975.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:11.340
 Admittedly they were doing it to a design from the 18th century still, but they used only

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.500
 things that the Nazca people would have had available to them.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.380
 So only local cloths using the same sort of materials and crops.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:24.820
 Even the fires that they got the hot air from were made using wood that was available locally

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.820
 and it did work.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.140
 I mean obviously it would have been for a treat or a special occasion.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.140
 Right.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.860
 Here's the problem with the Pacific Ocean burial theory is that the prevailing wids are

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.340
 going in a different direction.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.340
 That's true.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.060
 So if the balloon did go up it would crash into the Andy's mountains on the east of it.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.860
 But there are a lot of hills around there, a mountain, so you can see it from high up

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.860
 I think.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.380
 So if you go to the north floor to the theory of them not seeing it, you can actually see it

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.380
 from mountains.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.380
 It's a way easier.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.780
 Is it not something about all being along the same line of longitude or last year?

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.060
 They're all basically in a straight line around the world.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.060
 Correct.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:05.660
 Well, the people who I spoke to reckon that they are, do you remember in the Viking times

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.780
 they would have like labyrinths and you would walk around them and it would be a kind

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.740
 of penance, or it would be a kind of a religious walk or something like that?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.740
 And they think a lot of them because of that because if you look at them, they're

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.740
 like labyrinths.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.820
 There's one way in and one way out and you can walk along them as they, you know, if you

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.700
 think of a monkey which is a line drawing, you can walk into the tail, go all the way around

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.980
 it and then come out from the legs.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.660
 Like an edge of sketch of things.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.660
 Exactly like that.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.660
 Yeah.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.860
 But I think the truth is nobody knows because when the Spanish came they got rid of all

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:41.220
 of the history and also they didn't write anything down the Nusca people and actually

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.340
 none of the pre-Columbians wrote anything down.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.860
 They didn't have any writing.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:49.500
 The Alex and I went to a talk where we found out how they were made.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.500
 Oh, really?

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:56.300
 So we went to see this guy, a historian called Eric Von Daniken, and I was like, what are

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.300
 you trying to mean to this?

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:04.620
 You came along and Eric Von Daniken, who was a very big part of a TV series called Ancient

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:10.580
 Aliens, but obviously writer of the book chariots of the gods, which was the global sensational,

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.020
 bestselling, greatest book ever published.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.100
 It was a piece of bullshit.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.500
 Great nonfiction.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:23.500
 Yeah, obviously that's a massive theory that they had helped from aliens, but obviously when

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.260
 you look at it, it looks more like it's Horde of Balloons.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:31.700
 I don't like this tactic of you giving one ridiculous theory and then giving one even

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.500
 more ridiculous theory and expecting us to buy the second one.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.500
 That's like the prices.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.500
 What is that?

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.500
 Yeah.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.420
 There's a pricing theory in shops where they say, you can have this one, just as cheap and

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.420
 cost 50 quid.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.420
 So much costs 600 quid.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.500
 Or you can have the 10,000 pounds one, so you get the 600 quid one.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.100
 Or it's like a chainsaw thing in the triangle.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.620
 Now it's kind of a bit shit because it's a monkey one right next to it and it's like it's

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.620
 still pretty high effort.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.620
 Yeah, that's good line.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.620
 That's true.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:59.740
 Actually, while we were in Peru, we went to a place called the Sistine Chapel of America,

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:07.220
 Pedro de Andecualeías, or something like that, and it's very nice church, but the talk

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.140
 I was a bit boring, so we kind of just ducked out and next to it there was a little museum

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:18.100
 of like Nazca people, and they had a whole load of stuff about aliens and it was a proper

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.100
 museum.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:24.220
 And they had these elongated skulls that they find sometimes and stuff like that.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.220
 And they literally in this museum had no bit of saying, no, it's not aliens.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.300
 And they're just like, nobody knows.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.780
 You're kidding, that's so cool.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.700
 As I was there, I was like, "Dan would love this museum."

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.700
 That's amazing.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.100
 I think it was the previous people in the same area who made the elongated skulls, I can't

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.700
 remember the name because of the peep, but I've got it in my notes somewhere.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.700
 Do you know how the Nazca died out?

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.700
 Oh, glue away.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.700
 Overfolded by something quite irritatingly dull.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.700
 Is it El Nino or like some kind of weather phenomenon?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.700
 Yeah, it is.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.420
 Alex, I don't think it's irritatingly dull, but sorry, if it is, what I remember was like

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.660
 not alien, like not like, there weren't like white-to-white meteors, it was just like...

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.380
 Well, it is to do with crops, so let's see how far we get, shall we?

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:13.860
 So basically, they used to live on these trees called fire angos, which are very, very

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.860
 cool, very hardwood, very good for building things.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.540
 And the roots go 150 feet down because it's so dry there.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.540
 So they used to live on those.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.660
 And then they started chopping them all down, kind of like Easter Island, so that they

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.980
 could grow crops, right?

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.460
 And then they grew loads and loads of crops, and then at about 500 AD, there was a massive

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.220
 flood, which completely destroyed their civilization, swept across the plain, destroyed all their

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.500
 homes, and within 200 years they'd been conquered and died out.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:43.580
 But the way we know this is so cool, a team from Cambridge University went there, and they

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.580
 measured the amount of pollen in the soil at different depths.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.940
 So they can say, "Oh, well, up to 400 AD, there's loads of horango pollen, then there's

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.260
 a bit of cotton pollen, and then suddenly there's this big boom in loads of other crops, like

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.580
 squash and mazes and things."

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.420
 And that's how they knew that they'd chop down all the trees in the area, and they were just

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.820
 having huge fields of crops instead.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.820
 Right.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.820
 That's what they do.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:04.820
 Wow.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.820
 So they do crop circles then as well.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.820
 No.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.820
 For the aliens.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.820
 Oh my God.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:16.780
 There is one theory, by the way, which is, it is to do with aliens, but it's a more like

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.940
 one of these unreasonable ideas.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:23.060
 It's a more scientific approach, which is that rather than the aliens built the line,

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:29.340
 like us setting up setty or things in order to look to the universe for signals of life,

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:34.100
 it was basically big SOS, not SOS, but you know what I mean, it was attempt to communicate.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.620
 There were attempts of saying there was life down here and drawing animals so that anyone

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.140
 looking down onto Earth might see that things were man-made.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.340
 Again, it's a theory I've not spoken to.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:53.300
 And his later James Fizer and I'm playing some now-special.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.740
 OK, there's time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.940
 My fact is that instead of going outside, the painter Gainesborough painted outdoor scenes

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:07.140
 by making a little model with moss and broccoli.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.500
 So broccoli were his trees.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.500
 Exactly.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.500
 And he used coal for boulders.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.500
 He used coal.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.020
 And he used cables for stones.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.020
 Exactly.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.020
 So he was a famous landscape painter.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.020
 British, right.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.020
 British.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.740
 It was born in 1727, just to give you an idea, died in 1788.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:28.260
 And yeah, he would make inspiration, these weird little models, and then he used broccoli

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.260
 for trees.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.700
 It's all because it's basically a piece of art for another piece of art.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.700
 Yeah, it is.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.700
 Yeah.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.580
 He wasn't painting directly from them, but it was to give him ideas of what he wanted

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.580
 to move.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.580
 What goes where and what.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.500
 Yeah, because it's much easier to move a piece of broccoli than it is to move a tree.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.060
 And it's all about the shape of the painting.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:49.020
 He was really precise about the exact shape of his hilt and where the cow would go and everything.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.660
 Did he have little cows?

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.660
 Yep.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.660
 Great.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.660
 What were they made of?

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.660
 Like cockroaches.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.660
 That's right.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.140
 That's why if you look closely at the Gainesborough painting, all the cows have little antenna

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.580
 and hard shell-like bodies.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.260
 One of the reasons that he's not as famous, I didn't know his name, I have to admit.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.900
 And he gets often compared to, is it Constable who lived very much near him?

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:17.180
 And I think partly the reason is he was held back slightly by his little broccoli model

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.180
 village.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.460
 Oh my god, stuck in it.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.860
 Because with Constable, there's a great thing of geographically, you can visit all of

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:29.060
 the lands that he was painting, and that's a huge thing to go there and wander through

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.340
 the fields and look at the trees that were, you know, in his paintings.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.340
 But yeah.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:39.420
 I'm sorry, I've eaten it.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.700
 It is tragic though, because he loved landscapes, but the thing that sold and made you money

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.980
 at the time was portraits, obviously, for wealthy people commissioning pictures.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.780
 But he just wanted to do the landscapes that's all he was really interested in.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.780
 So it's really sad.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.860
 They only became popular as things you could buy just in their own right after his death.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.420
 His brothers were quite interesting.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:03.220
 His brother Humphrey was a mechanic, and he invented a method of condensing steam in

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:09.700
 sort of separate containers that then James Watts used when he was developing his engine.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:14.340
 How can you find that interesting and stuff about pollen in that has irritatingly dull.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.460
 No, he said irrigating.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:24.700
 And his other brother was called John, but everyone called him scheming jack, because he used

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.460
 to come up with the ideas of curiosity.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:31.060
 Yeah, he invented copper wings that he tried to fly with, and he had a sulphur.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:37.500
 Yeah, and he had a self-rocking crib and a cuckoo that cuckoo's all year long, a cuckoo

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.500
 clock.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.500
 It's useful.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.500
 Yeah, a cuckoo clock.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.060
 Yeah, that cuckoo'd all year long.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:47.140
 Well, most cuckoo clocks that are made in Germany or wherever, they don't only do it

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.140
 once.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.140
 Do it during spring.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.140
 No, but they do, like, once an hour, right?

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.620
 I think his was just cuckooing all the time.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.260
 They sound like quite a group of, you know, the brothers are all making things, aren't

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.260
 they?

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.260
 Yeah, that's what I mean.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.260
 I mean, it's a very interesting spread.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.020
 You often get them with this, this would let historical families, they often have really

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.020
 interesting...

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.500
 Is it 'cause they're all rich and they don't have to do proper jobs?

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.500
 Probably.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.180
 I think he wasn't very rich to start off.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:14.700
 He became very wealthy, and he got really annoyed later in life, because he got annoyed

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:19.980
 with customers saying, "Can you paint my child dressed up as Henry VIII, please?"

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.980
 But I wanted you to get my child exactly right, and he said, "You're not going to get

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.820
 a good likeness of your child if he's dressed as Henry VIII in this painting."

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.780
 I read that he painted with paint brushes that were six feet long.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.780
 I read that.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.900
 I'm not sure whether it's completely true.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.740
 I suppose I knew what he did, but he put the canvas he was painting on right next to

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.140
 the person sitting for the painting, and then he'd paint from a bit further back.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.900
 I think unbelievable amount of size skill, if you can do that, I paint a vague likeness of

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:46.900
 someone's child.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.740
 Have you heard about his huge rivalry?

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.100
 Oh, with Joshua Reynolds.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.700
 With Joshua Reynolds, who was another very famous artist of the time?

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.460
 And they just really got on each other's nerves.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:07.260
 And so once Joshua Reynolds insisted that blue wasn't really a good colour, I think he was

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.540
 saying that it should most be used in small amounts, unless you're painting the sky, obviously.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:16.700
 But anyway, one of Gainesville's most famous paintings is called The Blue Boy, as a young

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.740
 man who is in a completely blue suit.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:23.540
 So there is a theory that says that this was painted as a reposter Reynolds saying, "You

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.220
 can use blue in paintings."

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.620
 Oh, the other argument is he painted the blue by, and then Reynolds said, "Actually blue,

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.900
 and you should really only paint girls."

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.900
 Exactly.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:38.580
 And there is a painting that recently found which was by Gainesboro, and then someone slagged

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:43.220
 it off to the man who's had a commission, and the man who's had a commission, hired Reynolds

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.100
 to repaint everything except a thing.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:53.460
 But now the painting is 80% different, so underneath 80% of it is an original Gainesboro.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:25:00.500
 And then the top 80% is Reynolds, which is such a deep criticism.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:08.300
 Just a few other odd ways that artists paint these days, different methods.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.300
 This is really interesting.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:16.940
 In Ukraine, there is a series of scuba divers that now go down and do underwater paintings.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:17.940
 Under watercolors.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.140
 Yes, underwater colour paintings, yeah.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:25.740
 And so they go underwater for up to 40 minutes of a time.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:30.380
 They bring with them canvases that are obviously water resistant, and they use water resistant

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.380
 paints.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:37.660
 But now all these landscapes of underneath the ocean, of seaweed and so on, painted from

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.660
 the bottom of the ocean.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.660
 Really cool like that.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:47.660
 That's tough if you can't use blue as well, isn't it?

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:54.060
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:59.260
 My fact this week is that the US Navy submarines are starting to control their periscopes with

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.260
 Xbox controllers.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.260
 It's amazing.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.260
 Yeah.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.260
 Starting too.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.540
 So they've started trialing the use of it, the trials went very well, and now they're implementing

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.540
 it properly.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.540
 You're able to.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:16.940
 So the idea behind this, I used to have in my head the way that periscopes work, and

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.980
 I think I got this from Batman movies from the '60s, you used to have some person looking

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.380
 through almost like the Peep Show contraption.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.700
 These binoculars that would be sent up to the surface, and you would move it around like

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.700
 that.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.260
 These days they have a joystick, and the joystick people have been finding very hard

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:37.060
 to use, and they started testing it out then by using Xbox controllers, thinking let's

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:42.180
 see how this goes down well, and everyone has taken to it surprisingly well, to the point

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.220
 of accuracy that it just makes more sense to do it, both for the accuracy, and then

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:51.620
 secondly for the cost, because these controllers cost nothing, but these joysticks that they're

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.380
 paying for each time, costs tens of thousands of dollars.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.860
 To get joysticks these days, isn't it?

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.860
 It's hard to get joysticks.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.860
 Yeah.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:00.060
 Can you use any of these Wii controllers if you prefer?

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.620
 It's dangerous using a Wii controller though, because if you wave your arm, it might fire

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.220
 a torpedo by the same way.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.500
 But that's what happened when Wii first came out, isn't it, everyone smashed everything

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.500
 in their houses?

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.500
 Yeah.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.500
 That was a big thing.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.500
 Well said at the time.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.500
 And you don't want to smash a window in a submarine?

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.500
 No.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:23.780
 Yeah, I believe that the captains and so on who've been talking about the fact that this is

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.780
 going to go into place is saying, you know, if one breaks and you happen to be near land,

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.980
 you can just go to a local shop by a new Xbox controller.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:35.980
 Of course, the thing about being a submarine is, there's no guarantee you've been there.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.940
 That's the problem.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.860
 Well, maybe they should buy a few to bring with them.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.180
 So I was looking to Periscopes.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.180
 Oh yeah.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:50.060
 I didn't know that Periscopes were not invented for the submarine, they were invented or popularized

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.260
 if you'd like by the First World War in the trenches.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:57.020
 And the other thing that was invented was the Periscope Rifle where you attach the firing

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:02.380
 mechanism and the rifle to a Periscope so you can fire from the safety of your own trench

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.500
 completely inside your trench.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.460
 Now the disadvantage was that they were much less accurate than actually looking through

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:13.580
 the size of proper rifle, obviously, because they're a bit sharp, but they were used to

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:17.100
 great deal in the campaign at Gallipoli.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:23.700
 And in Gallipoli, accuracy mattered a lot less because some trenches were five yards

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.700
 away from each other.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.700
 No.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.700
 Oh my God.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:33.940
 So during World War I, the Allies tried to train Seagulls to defecate on the Periscopes

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:38.140
 of viewboats so they wouldn't be able to see where they were going.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.140
 How did it go?

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.300
 It didn't go so well.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.580
 The main problem was twofold.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:49.100
 They couldn't tell the difference between friendly subs and enemy subs.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:54.220
 And also they didn't tend to go out to see very much Seagulls, they tend to live on cliffs

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.500
 where there are so many submarines.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:57.700
 Around the home basically.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:03.500
 So the other thing they did was they would send two swimmers to a submarine.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.100
 One would have a black bag and the other one would have a hammer.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.740
 And the first one would try and put the black bag over the Periscope so they couldn't

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.020
 see where they were going.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.140
 And if he failed the other one would smash the glass with a hammer.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.340
 It feels like the second guy is the most important one.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.340
 Yeah.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.340
 Because he can do the most damage.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.340
 Yeah.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.340
 No.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.340
 No, the second guy feels like an afterthought of a plan.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.540
 And what if that doesn't work, sir?

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.740
 Smash it with a hammer.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:33.260
 You'd think that one swimmer could cope with a big black bag and a hammer.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.260
 Yes.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.100
 I mean, how big were hammers back in the first World War?

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.580
 They were small but black bags were massive.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.420
 Do you know there are some golf courses which have Periscopes?

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.420
 James, do you like golf?

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.420
 I do.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:50.540
 I know that if you go and watch golf tournaments or this happened in the past, I don't know if

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.540
 it still happens.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:56.380
 I haven't been to one for ages, but you would be able to buy little Periscopes because everyone

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.060
 stands around the green because they want to watch what's happening.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.060
 Yeah.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.060
 There's only so much space.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.060
 There's lots of people.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.100
 So you can see over the top of people's heads.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.100
 That is great.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.100
 James, this is not universal.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.100
 You haven't missed it at every course.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.940
 But there are golf courses which have Periscopes.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.820
 I found one from the '20s and then I found one, modern one, modern one, where the first

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.220
 hole is quite hard to see to the green.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.860
 So you need to see if the previous golfing party have moved on to the green before you drive

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.700
 a golf ball at them towards the green.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:28.180
 So they have a 30 foot high Periscope which is from an old Navy submarine.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.060
 They took it off in the '60s and they installed it at the golf course so you can just check

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.820
 out the line at the land ahead of you whether it's safe to play.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:38.660
 There are a lot of courses that you have blind shots that you can't see the shot but the way

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.540
 they deal with it is with a little bell and after you've played your shot you ring the bell

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.620
 so it's safe for the other guys to play behind you.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.620
 But you may not.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.620
 No.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.500
 If there's no one there, you've come after they've left.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.780
 No one's there to ring the bell.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:52.780
 Yeah.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.780
 What you need is a constantly ringing cookie clock.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.780
 You can say 'go'.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.460
 But you can slightly pause people.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.460
 That's a problem.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.460
 It's constantly ringing.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.460
 Yeah.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.460
 But then you get there and you hold the beak of the cookies.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.460
 But yeah.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.180
 A while trying to swing.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.460
 I think this is how crazy golf was invented.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.860
 Okay, that's it.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.460
 That is all of our facts.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.740
