00:00:00,00:00:23,It's a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:28,00:00:33,"and Alex Bell, and once again we have gathered around the microphones of our four favorite facts"
00:00:33,00:00:39,"from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:41,"Starting with you, Alex."
00:00:41,00:00:47,My fact this week is that 1% of the entire planet's wood supply is turned into IKEA furniture.
00:00:47,00:00:48,Bullshit.
00:00:48,00:00:49,That is true.
00:00:49,00:00:54,But they've only got 400 or so shops globally that we haven't been to one.
00:00:54,00:00:55,"Yeah, but they're pretty big."
00:00:55,00:00:58,"Think about how many books there are, right, in the world, and how many trees are needed"
00:00:58,00:00:59,for that.
00:00:59,00:01:03,"So if you think of an Amazon warehouse globally, all the warehouses, surely more wood"
00:01:03,00:01:04,goes there.
00:01:04,00:01:07,I think the amount of volume that passes through those shops is huge.
00:01:07,00:01:10,So one of the reasons that their furniture is so cheap is the way they've packaged it.
00:01:10,00:01:15,"So if you open up an IKEA bookcase package, it's incredibly tightly packed together."
00:01:15,00:01:18,"There's very little polystyrene in it, and that's like part of the reason it's so cheap"
00:01:18,00:01:19,apparently.
00:01:19,00:01:22,"Also, you have to transport it from one place to another, but you're not transporting"
00:01:22,00:01:28,"any air, which is heavy, when you put a lot of it in there, they're wooden lorries."
00:01:28,00:01:36,"So one thing that you can't really flat pack is sofas and armchairs, because they just"
00:01:36,00:01:38,"come as one big object, don't they?"
00:01:38,00:01:43,"And so one way they tried to fix that was by making it inflatable sofas, and by making"
00:01:43,00:01:48,these inflatable sofas they would reduce the use of raw materials by 85% and transport
00:01:48,00:01:49,volume by 90%.
00:01:49,00:01:50,Wow.
00:01:50,00:01:55,"And the idea was you would buy this inflatable sofa, you'd blow it up at home, and then you'd"
00:01:55,00:02:00,"put some cloth over it, and you wouldn't know that it was air."
00:02:00,00:02:01,So basically?
00:02:01,00:02:04,But aren't they effectively manufacturing furniture for bouncy castles?
00:02:04,00:02:10,"Yeah, but bouncy castles are quite comfortable, if you've ever sat on one, you've never watched"
00:02:10,00:02:14,"a whole film on a bouncy castle though, which I do want to do that sometimes."
00:02:14,00:02:15,Who was it who did?
00:02:15,00:02:16,Who was it?
00:02:16,00:02:17,"We'll see, would you?"
00:02:17,00:02:18,"Yeah, we'll see, would you?"
00:02:18,00:02:22,"Our friend comedian, we'll see, did bouncy castle hamlet and bouncy castle mudbeth."
00:02:22,00:02:26,"But in that case, he was acting on the bouncy castle rather than people watching on the bouncy"
00:02:26,00:02:27,castle.
00:02:27,00:02:28,"Yeah, it's true."
00:02:28,00:02:30,"I would go to a bouncy theatre, but that's because a lot of theatre's have very uncomfortable"
00:02:30,00:02:31,seats.
00:02:31,00:02:32,Yeah.
00:02:32,00:02:33,Hang on.
00:02:33,00:02:34,So did this work?
00:02:34,00:02:35,So did this work?
00:02:35,00:02:46,"Well, it did work up to a point in that you could sit on them."
00:02:46,00:02:50,"The problem was they picked up a lot of static electricity, and so they turned into massive"
00:02:50,00:02:54,"dust collectors, so you would be full of dust."
00:02:54,00:02:56,"And also, they didn't really weigh anything."
00:02:56,00:02:58,So it flew too late.
00:02:58,00:02:59,"Yeah, that's basically it."
00:02:59,00:03:01,They would kind of float away from where you left them.
00:03:01,00:03:04,So the one good thing about a sulphur is it's always in the same place.
00:03:04,00:03:05,Yeah.
00:03:05,00:03:09,I think that's the one good thing about a sulphur.
00:03:09,00:03:10,It's one of the good things.
00:03:10,00:03:11,"Oh, sure."
00:03:11,00:03:12,One of them.
00:03:12,00:03:13,Yeah.
00:03:13,00:03:14,So this is like a hover so far.
00:03:14,00:03:15,It was a bit like that.
00:03:15,00:03:19,"The stars, they would all start to gather in one corner of the star."
00:03:19,00:03:23,And one of their works at IKEA said they were like a gathering of swollen hippos.
00:03:23,00:03:24,"Oh, wow."
00:03:24,00:03:29,But can you imagine coming into work and then all of the selfies have moved to one fire?
00:03:29,00:03:30,It's terrifying.
00:03:30,00:03:32,You would be paranoid that they're conspiring against you.
00:03:32,00:03:34,You've got the mid-meeting like toy story.
00:03:34,00:03:39,"So that's the thing about IKEA is that the store's famously, you can only go around"
00:03:39,00:03:40,the one way.
00:03:40,00:03:41,There's a few shortcuts.
00:03:41,00:03:42,Yeah.
00:03:42,00:03:43,I've heard this.
00:03:43,00:03:46,So like often they're like the door section and they're all fake doors and one of them's a
00:03:46,00:03:47,real door.
00:03:47,00:03:50,And you have two IKEA workers.
00:03:50,00:03:55,One of them is always the last to tell the truth to me.
00:03:55,00:03:59,But the Guardian did a thing about the architecture of an IKEA shop.
00:03:59,00:04:04,They interviewed a few architectural professors and they found that 60% of IKEA purchases are
00:04:04,00:04:05,impulse.
00:04:05,00:04:09,The reason they get so many impulse purchases is that you have to put an item in your trolley
00:04:09,00:04:12,when you see it because otherwise you probably won't see it again because you're going
00:04:12,00:04:13,around the whole shop.
00:04:13,00:04:14,Yeah.
00:04:14,00:04:15,So you can just sling it anything.
00:04:15,00:04:17,I'll put it there for the moment.
00:04:17,00:04:18,Yeah.
00:04:18,00:04:22,I always go around twice once making a mental image of everything I want to buy.
00:04:22,00:04:23,Do you really?
00:04:23,00:04:27,"Everyone in the IKEA control room is like, who is this freak who is watching my monocles?"
00:04:27,00:04:29,"That's like those mind palaces, isn't it?"
00:04:29,00:04:30,You have a mind IKEA shop.
00:04:30,00:04:34,There's full of hundreds of hundreds of items.
00:04:34,00:04:36,Do you know about Janja Wintersall?
00:04:36,00:04:37,No.
00:04:37,00:04:45,"Okay, she has a mind palace and she was given a week to memorize all 328 pages and 4818 items"
00:04:45,00:04:49,of the 2018 IKEA catalog and she managed to do it.
00:04:49,00:04:50,Wow.
00:04:50,00:04:51,"You're kidding, really?"
00:04:51,00:04:54,"Well, as in people have tested her and she's got everything right."
00:04:54,00:04:55,Yeah.
00:04:55,00:04:56,That's amazing.
00:04:56,00:04:57,"Yeah, she got that."
00:04:57,00:04:59,Twice as many IKEA catalogs are printed every year as Bibles.
00:04:59,00:05:00,"Oh, there."
00:05:00,00:05:01,Yeah.
00:05:01,00:05:04,And 75% of the IKEA catalog is CGI.
00:05:04,00:05:05,It's not real.
00:05:05,00:05:06,What?
00:05:06,00:05:07,I know.
00:05:07,00:05:08,No.
00:05:08,00:05:09,What does that mean?
00:05:09,00:05:10,I have no other pictures.
00:05:10,00:05:11,The finish was really if you buy.
00:05:11,00:05:12,"You know, just like in a full three or so."
00:05:12,00:05:15,"I mean, like the pictures aren't actual pictures of the product."
00:05:15,00:05:16,The item.
00:05:16,00:05:17,They're the CGI rendering.
00:05:17,00:05:22,They're actually Andy Circus pretending to be so far.
00:05:22,00:05:27,"Just speaking of the catalog and memory of all the items, all the items obviously have"
00:05:27,00:05:28,very odd names.
00:05:28,00:05:29,Yes.
00:05:29,00:05:31,So you'd have to be memorizing these very odd names as well.
00:05:31,00:05:32,Like Billy Bookcase.
00:05:32,00:05:33,Exactly.
00:05:33,00:05:39,"It was revealed this year, why they're called, what they're called, all the items at IKEA."
00:05:39,00:05:44,And it's to do with the founder and the fact that Camprad is his own name.
00:05:44,00:05:46,He is the K in IKEA.
00:05:46,00:05:47,Okay.
00:05:47,00:05:49,"Camp member is first name, but it begins with I."
00:05:49,00:05:50,Yeah.
00:05:50,00:05:51,"And the initial is his first name, his second name."
00:05:51,00:05:55,"And then I believe it's his, the town he lived in, the lake that he lived next to."
00:05:55,00:05:56,The farm where he grew up.
00:05:56,00:05:57,And then his hometown.
00:05:57,00:05:58,There we go.
00:05:58,00:05:59,Yeah.
00:05:59,00:06:00,So he had dyslexia.
00:06:00,00:06:01,Right.
00:06:01,00:06:06,He found it impossible to just memorize regular codes and regular names.
00:06:06,00:06:11,So they came up with this system whereby everything in IKEA was given something that he could
00:06:11,00:06:16,"relate to so that he could, he could memorize the category of name that it has."
00:06:16,00:06:21,"So for example, if it's a bed textile, it will be named after a flower or a plant."
00:06:21,00:06:23,"So he'll know, okay, it's going to be a flower plant."
00:06:23,00:06:25,That's easy to remember.
00:06:25,00:06:29,"Beds, wardrobes and hall furniture are Norwegian name places."
00:06:29,00:06:34,Old cases are either Scandinavian boy names or professions.
00:06:34,00:06:38,"And so every little product has its own category of, of theme."
00:06:38,00:06:42,But all of his children are named after things that you can get in a house.
00:06:42,00:06:43,What?
00:06:43,00:06:47,"So he's got a child called bed and another one called, yes."
00:06:47,00:06:52,"There's another one percent fact here because Billy Bookcases, there are about 60 million"
00:06:52,00:06:55,"in the world, which is nearly one for every 100 people."
00:06:55,00:07:00,Does anyone here have a Billy Bookcase?
00:07:00,00:07:01,"Yeah, I do."
00:07:01,00:07:02,How many three?
00:07:02,00:07:03,You've got three.
00:07:03,00:07:04,Yeah.
00:07:04,00:07:05,"I've got three as well, I think."
00:07:05,00:07:06,"I, I used to have somebody don't any mark."
00:07:06,00:07:07,I've got one.
00:07:07,00:07:09,So that's seven between us.
00:07:09,00:07:11,"So we are, we have more than average."
00:07:11,00:07:12,That's more than one percent.
00:07:12,00:07:13,Yeah.
00:07:13,00:07:14,That's more than one percent.
00:07:14,00:07:18,"What we would actually need is, um, not point, not four of them."
00:07:18,00:07:19,Yeah.
00:07:19,00:07:20,Yeah.
00:07:20,00:07:21,Matt Banta there.
00:07:21,00:07:26,"And they also use one percent of the world's cotton every year, according to them."
00:07:26,00:07:27,Do they?
00:07:27,00:07:28,Yeah.
00:07:28,00:07:29,Can Prade use to be a Nazi?
00:07:29,00:07:30,I know.
00:07:30,00:07:31,It was such a shame.
00:07:31,00:07:34,"He seemed like such a quirky, fun character and then it got to that bit of the story."
00:07:34,00:07:35,It's the elephant in the room.
00:07:35,00:07:36,Yeah.
00:07:36,00:07:38,And the elephant is wearing a swastika round band.
00:07:38,00:07:39,I'm afraid.
00:07:39,00:07:40,Yeah.
00:07:40,00:07:41,He's a player.
00:07:41,00:07:42,He has a apologise for it.
00:07:42,00:07:43,Very previously.
00:07:43,00:07:44,He was a teenager.
00:07:44,00:07:45,He was 17 in 1943.
00:07:45,00:07:47,"So, uh, he wasn't involved in the early stages."
00:07:47,00:07:48,We can say that.
00:07:48,00:07:50,"Do you remember the actor, Haley Gelozman?"
00:07:50,00:07:51,Yes.
00:07:51,00:07:52,Yeah.
00:07:52,00:07:53,He was in the Sixth Sense.
00:07:53,00:07:54,Exactly.
00:07:54,00:07:55,The kid in the Sixth Sense.
00:07:55,00:07:56,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:56,00:07:57,Yeah.
00:07:57,00:07:58,"Uh, he was discovered in an Ikea."
00:07:58,00:07:59,What did he say?
00:07:59,00:08:01,His parents had lasted three years earlier.
00:08:01,00:08:02,Yeah.
00:08:02,00:08:03,Haley Gelozman.
00:08:03,00:08:07,"Um, he was in, uh, in Burbank in America, they have an Ikea."
00:08:07,00:08:13,"He was inside it and there were just people sitting there taking photos, casting kids basically"
00:08:13,00:08:16,"and they just, it was just a desk and said, come over, have your photo taken and we'll"
00:08:16,00:08:18,put you up for casting.
00:08:18,00:08:21,"And so he was with his parents walking through Ikea, saw that sat down."
00:08:21,00:08:26,They took photos of him and he immediately got cast for a Pizza Hut commercial for their
00:08:26,00:08:27,new Bigfoot pizza.
00:08:27,00:08:31,"So the head of it now, we find our way down found this time."
00:08:31,00:08:36,It's an anti-tangental Ikea information with a keyword Bigfoot right to the end.
00:08:36,00:08:40,So we have a Google Alert set up for Bigfoot.
00:08:40,00:08:45,"So while he was on TV, Robert Zamekis or Tom Hanks must have seen it because they then"
00:08:45,00:08:49,called him in or the casting director certainly for the movie Forest Gump.
00:08:49,00:08:53,"So he, before he was in six cents, he plays Forest Gump's son at the end of the movie."
00:08:53,00:08:54,"It does, he."
00:08:54,00:08:57,"And then he went on to six cents and so on, but discovered in an Ikea."
00:08:57,00:08:58,What was the main feature of the Bigfoot Pizza?
00:08:58,00:08:59,Why was it called a Bigfoot Pizza?
00:08:59,00:09:01,I reckon it must have been big.
00:09:01,00:09:02,Was it shaped like a foot?
00:09:02,00:09:03,It tasted like feet.
00:09:03,00:09:04,[laughter]
00:09:04,00:09:06,It tasted like a foot.
00:09:06,00:09:10,"Or you ordered it, open it and nothing was there."
00:09:10,00:09:12,Just a blurry photo of a pizza.
00:09:12,00:09:22,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:09:22,00:09:27,"Okay, my fact this week is that the Nazca people would employ someone to walk around with"
00:09:27,00:09:29,a dead fox on their head.
00:09:29,00:09:30,Cool.
00:09:30,00:09:34,"So the Nazca people, these are the people of Peru from my holiday."
00:09:34,00:09:35,From your holiday.
00:09:35,00:09:37,I've just come back from Peru.
00:09:37,00:09:38,Yep.
00:09:38,00:09:40,I want to talk about Peru because I think it's amazing.
00:09:40,00:09:43,I found it quite hard finding out about this fact James and I presume that's because you've
00:09:43,00:09:48,got the fact from a tour guide or from some intrinsic esoteric bit of location.
00:09:48,00:09:51,James was the guy that they employed to walk around.
00:09:51,00:09:56,I got this from an exhibition at the National Art Museum of Lima and it was someone who
00:09:56,00:10:01,listens to this podcast called Patricia who took me and my wife round and one of the
00:10:01,00:10:06,things I had in this museum was a dead fox and apparently what happened was if you were
00:10:06,00:10:11,"growing crops and you wanted to scare the birds away, they didn't have scarecrows."
00:10:11,00:10:13,They were to have a person with a fox on their head.
00:10:13,00:10:17,So the birds flying around would see the fox and think that's a fox and I'm not going to
00:10:17,00:10:19,go down and eat the crops.
00:10:19,00:10:20,It's just like a human scarecrop.
00:10:20,00:10:24,That's great but why wouldn't all farmers just then not wear a dead fox on their head every
00:10:24,00:10:25,day?
00:10:25,00:10:26,Because they're heavy.
00:10:26,00:10:27,Are they?
00:10:27,00:10:28,A whole fox.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Yeah.
00:10:29,00:10:30,A whole fox is different.
00:10:30,00:10:34,"It's pretty much like, the one that they had in the museum was like a spread out."
00:10:34,00:10:35,Carpet kind of thing.
00:10:35,00:10:36,Kind of a carpet thing.
00:10:36,00:10:41,"You can get fox shawls, you know, like scarves that are posh old women wear in the 19s."
00:10:41,00:10:43,"Yeah, but a bird's not going to get tricked by that."
00:10:43,00:10:44,"No, it's true."
00:10:44,00:10:46,But you'd look amazing.
00:10:46,00:10:51,I think I'm not sure it was actually a fox because I'm not sure it was a fox.
00:10:51,00:10:54,It's not going to find it online.
00:10:54,00:10:56,Were you even in Peru?
00:10:56,00:10:59,"I have a feeling it might have been a Zorro, which is a..."
00:10:59,00:11:00,The mask of Zorro.
00:11:00,00:11:01,The mask of Zorro.
00:11:01,00:11:07,"Zorro is a Peruvian desert fox, a faux fox."
00:11:07,00:11:09,But the Nazca's are famous.
00:11:09,00:11:10,They're pre-Columbian.
00:11:10,00:11:14,So before the Europeans went over to Peru and they're most famous because they lived in
00:11:14,00:11:18,"the desert and they made these massive lines in the middle of the desert, which you can"
00:11:18,00:11:23,go and visit and you fly off them and you can see all these different shapes of things.
00:11:23,00:11:25,Are they amazing to see?
00:11:25,00:11:28,"They were quite amazing to see here, basically because I always wanted to."
00:11:28,00:11:29,Yeah.
00:11:29,00:11:31,And so I was impressed by them.
00:11:31,00:11:34,Were they larger than you would have expected?
00:11:34,00:11:39,They were smaller to me because I was a long way away and they're a plane.
00:11:39,00:11:42,But some are bigger than others and you have lots of shapes of animals and stuff and there
00:11:42,00:11:45,"are some massive ones which are just a triangle, so they're a bit shit."
00:11:45,00:11:50,"But then there are smaller ones, which are like a monkey or something or a killer whale"
00:11:50,00:11:52,and they're really cool.
00:11:52,00:11:53,That's very cool.
00:11:53,00:11:56,So they didn't know what they looked like.
00:11:56,00:11:57,Is this the latest theory?
00:11:57,00:11:59,I've read a better theory.
00:11:59,00:12:04,"I think it's an incredible coincidence, they all look like animals if they didn't know."
00:12:04,00:12:06,"I mean, that would explain the triangles."
00:12:06,00:12:07,I think they would know.
00:12:07,00:12:09,"They didn't have power flights, so the question is how do they know?"
00:12:09,00:12:13,"There are hills around, so they'd be able to stand on their hills and see them."
00:12:13,00:12:16,Have you heard of hot air balloon theory?
00:12:16,00:12:17,Oh god.
00:12:17,00:12:19,Sorry.
00:12:19,00:12:20,This is a man.
00:12:20,00:12:24,Why do I get the feeling this is going to be full of hot air?
00:12:24,00:12:30,This is a man who is called Jim Woodman from the 1970s.
00:12:30,00:12:33,One percent of him is owned by IKEA.
00:12:33,00:12:40,In the 1970s he put forward this theory that in fact the Nazca people did see these line
00:12:40,00:12:45,formations and they did it from the air by hot air balloons which he believes they were
00:12:45,00:12:48,able to build.
00:12:48,00:12:54,So what he said is that he noticed that they had an amazing textile industry that had
00:12:54,00:12:55,high grade weaving and clothes.
00:12:55,00:12:56,That's true.
00:12:56,00:12:57,Yep.
00:12:57,00:13:01,And he also said that they knew what smoke did.
00:13:01,00:13:03,They knew that hot air rise and so on.
00:13:03,00:13:06,They knew the basic things and all they needed to do was put two things together.
00:13:06,00:13:09,We've not found any hot air balloons.
00:13:09,00:13:11,"Because he says, he floated away, Jim."
00:13:11,00:13:12,Exactly.
00:13:12,00:13:16,He floated away to the 19th century.
00:13:16,00:13:19,What he says is that they used it for burial rituals.
00:13:19,00:13:25,So what they were doing were they were putting the dead Nazca people inside the hot air balloons
00:13:25,00:13:28,and they would fly off into the Pacific Ocean.
00:13:28,00:13:34,So but if you happen to accidentally be in one of the funeral baskets of a hot air balloon
00:13:34,00:13:36,then you could see from above.
00:13:36,00:13:41,There's a few holes obviously in his theory.
00:13:41,00:13:45,One is that he actually tested it out using the basic stuff that they had and it could only
00:13:45,00:13:48,make sort of awkward liftoffs for a few minutes at a time.
00:13:48,00:13:50,I read that they built one.
00:13:50,00:13:51,They got to about 400 feet up.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"Oh, well maybe they kept going."
00:13:53,00:13:54,Maybe this is an old article.
00:13:54,00:13:56,Why are you encouraging him?
00:13:56,00:13:59,Because I think this actually holds a lot of water this theory.
00:13:59,00:14:00,So do you?
00:14:00,00:14:01,Yes.
00:14:01,00:14:06,So they were professional ballooners to build this trial balloon in 1975.
00:14:06,00:14:11,"Admittedly they were doing it to a design from the 18th century still, but they used only"
00:14:11,00:14:13,things that the Nazca people would have had available to them.
00:14:13,00:14:17,So only local cloths using the same sort of materials and crops.
00:14:17,00:14:24,Even the fires that they got the hot air from were made using wood that was available locally
00:14:24,00:14:25,and it did work.
00:14:25,00:14:29,I mean obviously it would have been for a treat or a special occasion.
00:14:29,00:14:30,Right.
00:14:30,00:14:34,Here's the problem with the Pacific Ocean burial theory is that the prevailing wids are
00:14:34,00:14:36,going in a different direction.
00:14:36,00:14:37,That's true.
00:14:37,00:14:42,So if the balloon did go up it would crash into the Andy's mountains on the east of it.
00:14:42,00:14:45,"But there are a lot of hills around there, a mountain, so you can see it from high up"
00:14:45,00:14:46,I think.
00:14:46,00:14:49,"So if you go to the north floor to the theory of them not seeing it, you can actually see it"
00:14:49,00:14:50,from mountains.
00:14:50,00:14:51,It's a way easier.
00:14:51,00:14:54,Is it not something about all being along the same line of longitude or last year?
00:14:54,00:14:57,They're all basically in a straight line around the world.
00:14:57,00:14:58,Correct.
00:14:58,00:15:05,"Well, the people who I spoke to reckon that they are, do you remember in the Viking times"
00:15:05,00:15:09,they would have like labyrinths and you would walk around them and it would be a kind
00:15:09,00:15:13,"of penance, or it would be a kind of a religious walk or something like that?"
00:15:13,00:15:16,"And they think a lot of them because of that because if you look at them, they're"
00:15:16,00:15:17,like labyrinths.
00:15:17,00:15:22,"There's one way in and one way out and you can walk along them as they, you know, if you"
00:15:22,00:15:26,"think of a monkey which is a line drawing, you can walk into the tail, go all the way around"
00:15:26,00:15:27,it and then come out from the legs.
00:15:27,00:15:29,Like an edge of sketch of things.
00:15:29,00:15:30,Exactly like that.
00:15:30,00:15:31,Yeah.
00:15:31,00:15:35,But I think the truth is nobody knows because when the Spanish came they got rid of all
00:15:35,00:15:41,of the history and also they didn't write anything down the Nusca people and actually
00:15:41,00:15:43,none of the pre-Columbians wrote anything down.
00:15:43,00:15:44,They didn't have any writing.
00:15:44,00:15:49,The Alex and I went to a talk where we found out how they were made.
00:15:49,00:15:50,"Oh, really?"
00:15:50,00:15:56,"So we went to see this guy, a historian called Eric Von Daniken, and I was like, what are"
00:15:56,00:15:58,you trying to mean to this?
00:15:58,00:16:04,"You came along and Eric Von Daniken, who was a very big part of a TV series called Ancient"
00:16:04,00:16:10,"Aliens, but obviously writer of the book chariots of the gods, which was the global sensational,"
00:16:10,00:16:13,"bestselling, greatest book ever published."
00:16:13,00:16:16,It was a piece of bullshit.
00:16:16,00:16:17,Great nonfiction.
00:16:17,00:16:23,"Yeah, obviously that's a massive theory that they had helped from aliens, but obviously when"
00:16:23,00:16:26,"you look at it, it looks more like it's Horde of Balloons."
00:16:26,00:16:31,I don't like this tactic of you giving one ridiculous theory and then giving one even
00:16:31,00:16:35,more ridiculous theory and expecting us to buy the second one.
00:16:35,00:16:36,That's like the prices.
00:16:36,00:16:37,What is that?
00:16:37,00:16:38,Yeah.
00:16:38,00:16:41,"There's a pricing theory in shops where they say, you can have this one, just as cheap and"
00:16:41,00:16:42,cost 50 quid.
00:16:42,00:16:43,So much costs 600 quid.
00:16:43,00:16:46,"Or you can have the 10,000 pounds one, so you get the 600 quid one."
00:16:46,00:16:48,Or it's like a chainsaw thing in the triangle.
00:16:48,00:16:50,Now it's kind of a bit shit because it's a monkey one right next to it and it's like it's
00:16:50,00:16:51,still pretty high effort.
00:16:51,00:16:52,"Yeah, that's good line."
00:16:52,00:16:53,That's true.
00:16:53,00:16:59,"Actually, while we were in Peru, we went to a place called the Sistine Chapel of America,"
00:16:59,00:17:07,"Pedro de Andecualeías, or something like that, and it's very nice church, but the talk"
00:17:07,00:17:12,"I was a bit boring, so we kind of just ducked out and next to it there was a little museum"
00:17:12,00:17:18,"of like Nazca people, and they had a whole load of stuff about aliens and it was a proper"
00:17:18,00:17:19,museum.
00:17:19,00:17:24,And they had these elongated skulls that they find sometimes and stuff like that.
00:17:24,00:17:28,"And they literally in this museum had no bit of saying, no, it's not aliens."
00:17:28,00:17:30,"And they're just like, nobody knows."
00:17:30,00:17:32,"You're kidding, that's so cool."
00:17:32,00:17:36,"As I was there, I was like, ""Dan would love this museum."""
00:17:36,00:17:37,That's amazing.
00:17:37,00:17:42,"I think it was the previous people in the same area who made the elongated skulls, I can't"
00:17:42,00:17:45,"remember the name because of the peep, but I've got it in my notes somewhere."
00:17:45,00:17:48,Do you know how the Nazca died out?
00:17:48,00:17:49,"Oh, glue away."
00:17:49,00:17:52,Overfolded by something quite irritatingly dull.
00:17:52,00:17:55,Is it El Nino or like some kind of weather phenomenon?
00:17:55,00:17:56,"Yeah, it is."
00:17:56,00:18:01,"Alex, I don't think it's irritatingly dull, but sorry, if it is, what I remember was like"
00:18:01,00:18:04,"not alien, like not like, there weren't like white-to-white meteors, it was just like..."
00:18:04,00:18:08,"Well, it is to do with crops, so let's see how far we get, shall we?"
00:18:08,00:18:13,"So basically, they used to live on these trees called fire angos, which are very, very"
00:18:13,00:18:16,"cool, very hardwood, very good for building things."
00:18:16,00:18:20,And the roots go 150 feet down because it's so dry there.
00:18:20,00:18:21,So they used to live on those.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"And then they started chopping them all down, kind of like Easter Island, so that they"
00:18:24,00:18:25,"could grow crops, right?"
00:18:25,00:18:30,"And then they grew loads and loads of crops, and then at about 500 AD, there was a massive"
00:18:30,00:18:35,"flood, which completely destroyed their civilization, swept across the plain, destroyed all their"
00:18:35,00:18:38,"homes, and within 200 years they'd been conquered and died out."
00:18:38,00:18:43,"But the way we know this is so cool, a team from Cambridge University went there, and they"
00:18:43,00:18:47,measured the amount of pollen in the soil at different depths.
00:18:47,00:18:51,"So they can say, ""Oh, well, up to 400 AD, there's loads of horango pollen, then there's"
00:18:51,00:18:56,"a bit of cotton pollen, and then suddenly there's this big boom in loads of other crops, like"
00:18:56,00:18:57,"squash and mazes and things."""
00:18:57,00:19:00,"And that's how they knew that they'd chop down all the trees in the area, and they were just"
00:19:00,00:19:01,having huge fields of crops instead.
00:19:01,00:19:02,Right.
00:19:02,00:19:03,That's what they do.
00:19:03,00:19:04,Wow.
00:19:04,00:19:05,So they do crop circles then as well.
00:19:05,00:19:06,No.
00:19:06,00:19:07,For the aliens.
00:19:07,00:19:08,Oh my God.
00:19:08,00:19:16,"There is one theory, by the way, which is, it is to do with aliens, but it's a more like"
00:19:16,00:19:17,one of these unreasonable ideas.
00:19:17,00:19:23,"It's a more scientific approach, which is that rather than the aliens built the line,"
00:19:23,00:19:29,"like us setting up setty or things in order to look to the universe for signals of life,"
00:19:29,00:19:34,"it was basically big SOS, not SOS, but you know what I mean, it was attempt to communicate."
00:19:34,00:19:37,There were attempts of saying there was life down here and drawing animals so that anyone
00:19:37,00:19:41,looking down onto Earth might see that things were man-made.
00:19:41,00:19:43,"Again, it's a theory I've not spoken to."
00:19:43,00:19:53,And his later James Fizer and I'm playing some now-special.
00:19:53,00:19:56,"OK, there's time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:19:56,00:20:01,"My fact is that instead of going outside, the painter Gainesborough painted outdoor scenes"
00:20:01,00:20:07,by making a little model with moss and broccoli.
00:20:07,00:20:09,So broccoli were his trees.
00:20:09,00:20:10,Exactly.
00:20:10,00:20:11,And he used coal for boulders.
00:20:11,00:20:12,He used coal.
00:20:12,00:20:14,And he used cables for stones.
00:20:14,00:20:15,Exactly.
00:20:15,00:20:17,So he was a famous landscape painter.
00:20:17,00:20:18,"British, right."
00:20:18,00:20:19,British.
00:20:19,00:20:22,"It was born in 1727, just to give you an idea, died in 1788."
00:20:22,00:20:28,"And yeah, he would make inspiration, these weird little models, and then he used broccoli"
00:20:28,00:20:29,for trees.
00:20:29,00:20:31,It's all because it's basically a piece of art for another piece of art.
00:20:31,00:20:32,"Yeah, it is."
00:20:32,00:20:33,Yeah.
00:20:33,00:20:36,"He wasn't painting directly from them, but it was to give him ideas of what he wanted"
00:20:36,00:20:37,to move.
00:20:37,00:20:38,What goes where and what.
00:20:38,00:20:41,"Yeah, because it's much easier to move a piece of broccoli than it is to move a tree."
00:20:41,00:20:44,And it's all about the shape of the painting.
00:20:44,00:20:49,He was really precise about the exact shape of his hilt and where the cow would go and everything.
00:20:49,00:20:50,Did he have little cows?
00:20:50,00:20:51,Yep.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Great.
00:20:52,00:20:53,What were they made of?
00:20:53,00:20:54,Like cockroaches.
00:20:54,00:20:55,That's right.
00:20:55,00:20:59,"That's why if you look closely at the Gainesborough painting, all the cows have little antenna"
00:20:59,00:21:03,and hard shell-like bodies.
00:21:03,00:21:08,"One of the reasons that he's not as famous, I didn't know his name, I have to admit."
00:21:08,00:21:12,"And he gets often compared to, is it Constable who lived very much near him?"
00:21:12,00:21:17,And I think partly the reason is he was held back slightly by his little broccoli model
00:21:17,00:21:18,village.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"Oh my god, stuck in it."
00:21:20,00:21:24,"Because with Constable, there's a great thing of geographically, you can visit all of"
00:21:24,00:21:29,"the lands that he was painting, and that's a huge thing to go there and wander through"
00:21:29,00:21:32,"the fields and look at the trees that were, you know, in his paintings."
00:21:32,00:21:33,But yeah.
00:21:33,00:21:39,"I'm sorry, I've eaten it."
00:21:39,00:21:43,"It is tragic though, because he loved landscapes, but the thing that sold and made you money"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"at the time was portraits, obviously, for wealthy people commissioning pictures."
00:21:46,00:21:49,But he just wanted to do the landscapes that's all he was really interested in.
00:21:49,00:21:50,So it's really sad.
00:21:50,00:21:55,They only became popular as things you could buy just in their own right after his death.
00:21:55,00:21:57,His brothers were quite interesting.
00:21:57,00:22:03,"His brother Humphrey was a mechanic, and he invented a method of condensing steam in"
00:22:03,00:22:09,sort of separate containers that then James Watts used when he was developing his engine.
00:22:09,00:22:14,How can you find that interesting and stuff about pollen in that has irritatingly dull.
00:22:14,00:22:17,"No, he said irrigating."
00:22:17,00:22:24,"And his other brother was called John, but everyone called him scheming jack, because he used"
00:22:24,00:22:26,to come up with the ideas of curiosity.
00:22:26,00:22:31,"Yeah, he invented copper wings that he tried to fly with, and he had a sulphur."
00:22:31,00:22:37,"Yeah, and he had a self-rocking crib and a cuckoo that cuckoo's all year long, a cuckoo"
00:22:37,00:22:38,clock.
00:22:38,00:22:39,It's useful.
00:22:39,00:22:40,"Yeah, a cuckoo clock."
00:22:40,00:22:42,"Yeah, that cuckoo'd all year long."
00:22:42,00:22:47,"Well, most cuckoo clocks that are made in Germany or wherever, they don't only do it"
00:22:47,00:22:48,once.
00:22:48,00:22:49,Do it during spring.
00:22:49,00:22:50,"No, but they do, like, once an hour, right?"
00:22:50,00:22:53,I think his was just cuckooing all the time.
00:22:53,00:22:58,"They sound like quite a group of, you know, the brothers are all making things, aren't"
00:22:58,00:22:59,they?
00:22:59,00:23:00,"Yeah, that's what I mean."
00:23:00,00:23:01,"I mean, it's a very interesting spread."
00:23:01,00:23:04,"You often get them with this, this would let historical families, they often have really"
00:23:04,00:23:05,interesting...
00:23:05,00:23:07,Is it 'cause they're all rich and they don't have to do proper jobs?
00:23:07,00:23:08,Probably.
00:23:08,00:23:10,I think he wasn't very rich to start off.
00:23:10,00:23:14,"He became very wealthy, and he got really annoyed later in life, because he got annoyed"
00:23:14,00:23:19,"with customers saying, ""Can you paint my child dressed up as Henry VIII, please?"""
00:23:19,00:23:22,"But I wanted you to get my child exactly right, and he said, ""You're not going to get"
00:23:22,00:23:26,"a good likeness of your child if he's dressed as Henry VIII in this painting."""
00:23:26,00:23:30,I read that he painted with paint brushes that were six feet long.
00:23:30,00:23:31,I read that.
00:23:31,00:23:33,I'm not sure whether it's completely true.
00:23:33,00:23:36,"I suppose I knew what he did, but he put the canvas he was painting on right next to"
00:23:36,00:23:41,"the person sitting for the painting, and then he'd paint from a bit further back."
00:23:41,00:23:45,"I think unbelievable amount of size skill, if you can do that, I paint a vague likeness of"
00:23:45,00:23:46,someone's child.
00:23:46,00:23:49,Have you heard about his huge rivalry?
00:23:49,00:23:52,"Oh, with Joshua Reynolds."
00:23:52,00:23:56,"With Joshua Reynolds, who was another very famous artist of the time?"
00:23:56,00:23:59,And they just really got on each other's nerves.
00:23:59,00:24:07,"And so once Joshua Reynolds insisted that blue wasn't really a good colour, I think he was"
00:24:07,00:24:11,"saying that it should most be used in small amounts, unless you're painting the sky, obviously."
00:24:11,00:24:16,"But anyway, one of Gainesville's most famous paintings is called The Blue Boy, as a young"
00:24:16,00:24:18,man who is in a completely blue suit.
00:24:18,00:24:23,"So there is a theory that says that this was painted as a reposter Reynolds saying, ""You"
00:24:23,00:24:25,"can use blue in paintings."""
00:24:25,00:24:29,"Oh, the other argument is he painted the blue by, and then Reynolds said, ""Actually blue,"
00:24:29,00:24:32,"and you should really only paint girls."""
00:24:32,00:24:33,Exactly.
00:24:33,00:24:38,"And there is a painting that recently found which was by Gainesboro, and then someone slagged"
00:24:38,00:24:43,"it off to the man who's had a commission, and the man who's had a commission, hired Reynolds"
00:24:43,00:24:46,to repaint everything except a thing.
00:24:46,00:24:53,"But now the painting is 80% different, so underneath 80% of it is an original Gainesboro."
00:24:53,00:25:00,"And then the top 80% is Reynolds, which is such a deep criticism."
00:25:00,00:25:08,"Just a few other odd ways that artists paint these days, different methods."
00:25:08,00:25:09,This is really interesting.
00:25:09,00:25:16,"In Ukraine, there is a series of scuba divers that now go down and do underwater paintings."
00:25:16,00:25:17,Under watercolors.
00:25:17,00:25:21,"Yes, underwater colour paintings, yeah."
00:25:21,00:25:25,And so they go underwater for up to 40 minutes of a time.
00:25:25,00:25:30,"They bring with them canvases that are obviously water resistant, and they use water resistant"
00:25:30,00:25:31,paints.
00:25:31,00:25:37,"But now all these landscapes of underneath the ocean, of seaweed and so on, painted from"
00:25:37,00:25:38,the bottom of the ocean.
00:25:38,00:25:39,Really cool like that.
00:25:39,00:25:47,"That's tough if you can't use blue as well, isn't it?"
00:25:47,00:25:54,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:25:54,00:25:59,My fact this week is that the US Navy submarines are starting to control their periscopes with
00:25:59,00:26:00,Xbox controllers.
00:26:00,00:26:01,It's amazing.
00:26:01,00:26:02,Yeah.
00:26:02,00:26:03,Starting too.
00:26:03,00:26:07,"So they've started trialing the use of it, the trials went very well, and now they're implementing"
00:26:07,00:26:08,it properly.
00:26:08,00:26:09,You're able to.
00:26:09,00:26:16,"So the idea behind this, I used to have in my head the way that periscopes work, and"
00:26:16,00:26:20,"I think I got this from Batman movies from the '60s, you used to have some person looking"
00:26:20,00:26:24,through almost like the Peep Show contraption.
00:26:24,00:26:27,"These binoculars that would be sent up to the surface, and you would move it around like"
00:26:27,00:26:28,that.
00:26:28,00:26:32,"These days they have a joystick, and the joystick people have been finding very hard"
00:26:32,00:26:37,"to use, and they started testing it out then by using Xbox controllers, thinking let's"
00:26:37,00:26:42,"see how this goes down well, and everyone has taken to it surprisingly well, to the point"
00:26:42,00:26:46,"of accuracy that it just makes more sense to do it, both for the accuracy, and then"
00:26:46,00:26:51,"secondly for the cost, because these controllers cost nothing, but these joysticks that they're"
00:26:51,00:26:54,"paying for each time, costs tens of thousands of dollars."
00:26:54,00:26:55,"To get joysticks these days, isn't it?"
00:26:55,00:26:56,It's hard to get joysticks.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Yeah.
00:26:57,00:27:00,Can you use any of these Wii controllers if you prefer?
00:27:00,00:27:03,"It's dangerous using a Wii controller though, because if you wave your arm, it might fire"
00:27:03,00:27:06,a torpedo by the same way.
00:27:06,00:27:09,"But that's what happened when Wii first came out, isn't it, everyone smashed everything"
00:27:09,00:27:10,in their houses?
00:27:10,00:27:11,Yeah.
00:27:11,00:27:12,That was a big thing.
00:27:12,00:27:13,Well said at the time.
00:27:13,00:27:15,And you don't want to smash a window in a submarine?
00:27:15,00:27:16,No.
00:27:16,00:27:23,"Yeah, I believe that the captains and so on who've been talking about the fact that this is"
00:27:23,00:27:27,"going to go into place is saying, you know, if one breaks and you happen to be near land,"
00:27:27,00:27:30,you can just go to a local shop by a new Xbox controller.
00:27:30,00:27:35,"Of course, the thing about being a submarine is, there's no guarantee you've been there."
00:27:35,00:27:37,That's the problem.
00:27:37,00:27:40,"Well, maybe they should buy a few to bring with them."
00:27:40,00:27:43,So I was looking to Periscopes.
00:27:43,00:27:44,Oh yeah.
00:27:44,00:27:50,"I didn't know that Periscopes were not invented for the submarine, they were invented or popularized"
00:27:50,00:27:52,if you'd like by the First World War in the trenches.
00:27:52,00:27:57,And the other thing that was invented was the Periscope Rifle where you attach the firing
00:27:57,00:28:02,mechanism and the rifle to a Periscope so you can fire from the safety of your own trench
00:28:02,00:28:04,completely inside your trench.
00:28:04,00:28:08,Now the disadvantage was that they were much less accurate than actually looking through
00:28:08,00:28:13,"the size of proper rifle, obviously, because they're a bit sharp, but they were used to"
00:28:13,00:28:17,great deal in the campaign at Gallipoli.
00:28:17,00:28:23,"And in Gallipoli, accuracy mattered a lot less because some trenches were five yards"
00:28:23,00:28:24,away from each other.
00:28:24,00:28:25,No.
00:28:25,00:28:26,Oh my God.
00:28:26,00:28:33,"So during World War I, the Allies tried to train Seagulls to defecate on the Periscopes"
00:28:33,00:28:38,of viewboats so they wouldn't be able to see where they were going.
00:28:38,00:28:39,How did it go?
00:28:39,00:28:41,It didn't go so well.
00:28:41,00:28:44,The main problem was twofold.
00:28:44,00:28:49,They couldn't tell the difference between friendly subs and enemy subs.
00:28:49,00:28:54,"And also they didn't tend to go out to see very much Seagulls, they tend to live on cliffs"
00:28:54,00:28:56,where there are so many submarines.
00:28:56,00:28:57,Around the home basically.
00:28:57,00:29:03,So the other thing they did was they would send two swimmers to a submarine.
00:29:03,00:29:06,One would have a black bag and the other one would have a hammer.
00:29:06,00:29:09,And the first one would try and put the black bag over the Periscope so they couldn't
00:29:09,00:29:11,see where they were going.
00:29:11,00:29:14,And if he failed the other one would smash the glass with a hammer.
00:29:14,00:29:17,It feels like the second guy is the most important one.
00:29:17,00:29:18,Yeah.
00:29:18,00:29:19,Because he can do the most damage.
00:29:19,00:29:20,Yeah.
00:29:20,00:29:21,No.
00:29:21,00:29:22,"No, the second guy feels like an afterthought of a plan."
00:29:22,00:29:24,"And what if that doesn't work, sir?"
00:29:24,00:29:26,Smash it with a hammer.
00:29:26,00:29:33,You'd think that one swimmer could cope with a big black bag and a hammer.
00:29:33,00:29:34,Yes.
00:29:34,00:29:37,"I mean, how big were hammers back in the first World War?"
00:29:37,00:29:39,They were small but black bags were massive.
00:29:39,00:29:43,Do you know there are some golf courses which have Periscopes?
00:29:43,00:29:44,"James, do you like golf?"
00:29:44,00:29:45,I do.
00:29:45,00:29:50,"I know that if you go and watch golf tournaments or this happened in the past, I don't know if"
00:29:50,00:29:51,it still happens.
00:29:51,00:29:56,"I haven't been to one for ages, but you would be able to buy little Periscopes because everyone"
00:29:56,00:29:59,stands around the green because they want to watch what's happening.
00:29:59,00:30:00,Yeah.
00:30:00,00:30:01,There's only so much space.
00:30:01,00:30:02,There's lots of people.
00:30:02,00:30:04,So you can see over the top of people's heads.
00:30:04,00:30:05,That is great.
00:30:05,00:30:06,"James, this is not universal."
00:30:06,00:30:07,You haven't missed it at every course.
00:30:07,00:30:09,But there are golf courses which have Periscopes.
00:30:09,00:30:14,"I found one from the '20s and then I found one, modern one, modern one, where the first"
00:30:14,00:30:18,hole is quite hard to see to the green.
00:30:18,00:30:21,So you need to see if the previous golfing party have moved on to the green before you drive
00:30:21,00:30:23,a golf ball at them towards the green.
00:30:23,00:30:28,So they have a 30 foot high Periscope which is from an old Navy submarine.
00:30:28,00:30:32,They took it off in the '60s and they installed it at the golf course so you can just check
00:30:32,00:30:34,out the line at the land ahead of you whether it's safe to play.
00:30:34,00:30:38,There are a lot of courses that you have blind shots that you can't see the shot but the way
00:30:38,00:30:42,they deal with it is with a little bell and after you've played your shot you ring the bell
00:30:42,00:30:45,so it's safe for the other guys to play behind you.
00:30:45,00:30:46,But you may not.
00:30:46,00:30:47,No.
00:30:47,00:30:50,"If there's no one there, you've come after they've left."
00:30:50,00:30:51,No one's there to ring the bell.
00:30:51,00:30:52,Yeah.
00:30:52,00:30:54,What you need is a constantly ringing cookie clock.
00:30:54,00:30:55,You can say 'go'.
00:30:55,00:30:59,But you can slightly pause people.
00:30:59,00:31:00,That's a problem.
00:31:00,00:31:01,It's constantly ringing.
00:31:01,00:31:02,Yeah.
00:31:02,00:31:04,But then you get there and you hold the beak of the cookies.
00:31:04,00:31:05,But yeah.
00:31:05,00:31:07,A while trying to swing.
00:31:07,00:31:11,I think this is how crazy golf was invented.
00:31:11,00:31:15,"Okay, that's it."
00:31:15,00:31:17,That is all of our facts.
00:31:17,00:31:18,Thank you so much for listening.
