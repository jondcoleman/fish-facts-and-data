00:00:13,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the"
00:00:19,00:00:24,"QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:24,00:00:28,"Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our"
00:00:28,00:00:34,four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact
00:00:34,00:00:42,number one and that is James. Okay my fact this week is that everyone in the French town of Evian
00:00:42,00:00:50,is allowed unlimited free Evian. Are they allowed it from like do they have to go up and put their
00:00:50,00:00:54,mouth to the spring? Well I don't know how it comes out. They just come through the taps right?
00:00:54,00:01:04,"No no, Andy's closest but he is wrong. So this is the town of Evian de Ban on the banks of the"
00:01:04,00:01:12,Lake Geneva and it's in France and they have this special spring of water and this is where we get
00:01:12,00:01:19,"the Evian today but the people of the town can go to the spring, it has a special sort of spout"
00:01:20,00:01:25,and you can go and get unlimited Evian from there. You don't have to go with your mouth
00:01:25,00:01:29,on the spout when I went there. Because that ruins the spout for everyone. It ruins the entire
00:01:29,00:01:35,"company's operations actually, millions of people. Yeah absolutely so I went there recently on my"
00:01:35,00:01:40,holidays because you guys have had some guests on the last few weeks. I was going from a ski resort
00:01:40,00:01:46,"to Geneva where our flight was going from and saw that Evian was, I won't say on the way,"
00:01:46,00:01:50,we had to take quite a long diversion but I said to my wife why don't we go to this
00:01:50,00:01:55,place Evian because it's kind of an interesting place that I've heard of. Baby was sick but
00:01:55,00:02:01,it was fine. Drank some bad water or something. But we went there and I drank some of the Evian
00:02:01,00:02:06,water with my cupped hand so I allowed it to go into my cupped hand and I drank it but just as
00:02:06,00:02:11,we're leaving actually there was a guy who turned up in his car opened his boot and he must have had
00:02:11,00:02:17,about 50 glass bottles where he went to the spring and he filled up all of his bottles so he had as
00:02:17,00:02:21,much Evian as he could drink and that apparently is a common thing that the people of Evian do.
00:02:21,00:02:27,"You're so lucky, you're so lucky that you got there before him rather than just oh yeah. Mate I'm"
00:02:27,00:02:33,just trying to fill up my two cupped hands. No sorry I've only got 47 bottles to go. What I'm
00:02:33,00:02:38,"imagining is like a municipal water, not a water cooler, you know a thing like in a school gym"
00:02:38,00:02:43,where you put your mouth to it. Yeah it's not quite like that. Press the button and it squirts up a
00:02:43,00:02:48,"bit but not very much. No it's not that, it's something where it is always flowing out. Nice."
00:02:48,00:02:55,So it is kind of a mosaic of a nice sort of like flowers and stuff like that and then there's a
00:02:55,00:02:59,little bowl underneath made of stone and the water just keeps going into the bowl and then drains away
00:02:59,00:03:04,presumably to the every other factory where it goes into your bottles. No I don't know that.
00:03:04,00:03:09,"If you're a rival company could you just go and bottle your own? Brilliant idea, brilliant."
00:03:09,00:03:14,"You could but I imagine it's probably not efficient. Probably the cost is not the water,"
00:03:14,00:03:19,it's the bottling factory. If your Buxton Springs say and your entire factory is in
00:03:19,00:03:23,"Buxton in Derbyshire, probably it's not worth it to drive all the way down to Geneva."
00:03:23,00:03:27,"Free water, I mean you could just get it out of the tap if you were trying to get more like water."
00:03:27,00:03:30,"Which some bottle companies did, didn't you? Yes, Dasani I think famously did that. Dasani which"
00:03:30,00:03:35,was coke-owned and it just turned out to be tap water that they sort of run that water under the
00:03:35,00:03:40,tap. I didn't know how they'd done it but they basically like it was tap. I think that's a slightly
00:03:40,00:03:44,misleading but if it was what it still is now which is that it's tap water as is more than two
00:03:44,00:03:50,thirds of bottled water in America and lots of it here basically it's filtered tap water so they've
00:03:50,00:03:55,taken tap water filtered it but the great thing about these big soft drinks companies is they're
00:03:55,00:04:00,already filtering the water to put in their Fanta and their Coke or whatever so they've got this
00:04:00,00:04:03,big water filtration system set up all they need to do is turn the tap on a bit more
00:04:03,00:04:09,so yeah that is yeah but what did they drink then in Avian through the tap? Is it the same
00:04:09,00:04:15,source of water coming through? What a good question so no because they will have and I don't
00:04:15,00:04:20,know for sure but they must have reservoirs where the water comes from because this is just a small
00:04:20,00:04:26,spring and certainly wouldn't be enough to fill what is a an average size French town. Yeah right
00:04:26,00:04:31,okay. I heard though that they only take about 10% of the Avian water to turn into Avian from this
00:04:31,00:04:36,spring and it filters down through the rock and then it takes about 15 years and it goes into
00:04:36,00:04:41,an underground aquifer and then once the aquifer is full the water gets forced up back up to the
00:04:41,00:04:46,surface and then it emerges at that spring and that whole thing takes 15 years to do I believe.
00:04:46,00:04:50,That's what they say on the website 15 years is that number? That's what I got it from yeah.
00:04:50,00:04:55,Why would they lie about that? It's actually 19 years but it's such a round number. There is an
00:04:55,00:04:58,interesting thing on the website which talks about the history I don't know if you saw this
00:04:58,00:05:06,they said that 1789 was a very important year in Avian water history and seeing as they were in
00:05:06,00:05:12,France it feels like 1789 probably was quite an important year. I thought that. Pretty much for
00:05:12,00:05:18,everyone because actually their water sauce was discovered by a French nobleman. Right. Do you
00:05:18,00:05:23,feel like probably had other things on his mind? I was the last thing he ever did wasn't it? I have
00:05:23,00:05:28,looked for the Marquis de Lesser who I'm sure was not top of the list when the revolution came
00:05:28,00:05:33,but I searched for his I searched his name there's no other he doesn't crop up anywhere else. No he
00:05:33,00:05:38,does that I think there is some suggestion that a bit of this origin story might not be 100 true
00:05:38,00:05:45,but it is certainly it was it was on this guy's land in Avian and supposedly this nobleman had
00:05:45,00:05:50,kidney stones or something drank some of this water and his kidney stones disappeared and he
00:05:50,00:05:54,was like this is great stuff and then the guy who owned the land started to sell the water. Yeah if
00:05:54,00:05:58,it was a perfect origin story like the ones they always make up it would be he was out for a walk
00:05:58,00:06:03,on date he fell over some of the water fell into his mouth and then he fell his kidney stones carrying
00:06:03,00:06:09,up so weird. Yeah. Bottle of water the idea comes from the fact that it was good for your health
00:06:09,00:06:15,doesn't it it was a medicine for ages and that's the reason we drink it today really is because of
00:06:15,00:06:22,all these bar places or bath places like Bath or Lemmington or Buxton and in the 19th century in
00:06:22,00:06:28,Jane Austen. Bath is named after Bath is that like having a bath it would be so weird because I'm
00:06:28,00:06:34,just going to go and have a quick Lemmington. Have you given the baby his Lemmington tonight?
00:06:34,00:06:38,Although we should make clear for the email writers that we do know that Bards are not named after
00:06:38,00:06:43,the place Bath. I didn't know that and I don't mind getting an email about it. I'm pleased I'm so
00:06:43,00:06:48,one now. Are they not? That's a good way round. It's going to be the other way round isn't it?
00:06:48,00:06:56,"What? You just you work on that log in for a moment. No, no it could have been where someone had the"
00:06:56,00:07:04,first bath. It could have been. It's like a Roman walking by tripped down into the hot water. Loved it.
00:07:06,00:07:12,A loofa lunged on his head and a duck floated by and he squeezed it and I went 'wack'.
00:07:12,00:07:19,This is amazing. Anyway the way that bottling began actually was people used to go somewhere
00:07:19,00:07:23,"like Bath and they take the waters for their health like in Jane Austen. You drink the waters,"
00:07:23,00:07:28,"you bathe in the waters, you'd get rid of your whatever poolsy you had or spots or whatever."
00:07:28,00:07:33,But some people were too busy or too poor to be able to afford this constant water treatments
00:07:33,00:07:40,"and traveling to these spa towns so they subscribed instead much like you might subscribe to, I don't"
00:07:40,00:07:47,"know, Hello Fresh or... Right, we're off the clock Anna. You don't have to do this. They subscribe"
00:07:47,00:07:51,to water deliveries which will be bottled up and sent to them for their health. And those are the
00:07:51,00:07:57,original bottles. That's original bottle water. That's very cool. So it was a kind of spa destination
00:07:57,00:08:01,Evian as well and this was before they were bottling it. This is 1806. They had a thermal
00:08:01,00:08:06,spa that opened. The bottling happened in 1826. But you would think then that as a result this is
00:08:06,00:08:11,just like you'd go there it'd be this majestical like kind of mindfulness place and really nice.
00:08:11,00:08:15,But we have an account of what it was like from someone traveling through there
00:08:15,00:08:21,in the 1810s roughly and that was Percy Shelley and Mary Shelley. He said the appearance of the
00:08:21,00:08:27,"inhabitants is more wretched, diseased and poor than I ever recollect to have seen. It's not a great"
00:08:27,00:08:31,trip advisor review there. Not a good advert for the health keeping losses. It does appear in
00:08:31,00:08:35,"Frankenstein as well by the way, Evian. He goes on his honeymoon there I think. That's right,"
00:08:35,00:08:40,"yeah. Wait, Dr Frankenstein? Yeah, yeah. Really? He goes to Evian. Yeah, so it yeah,"
00:08:40,00:08:44,Mary Shelley literally puts the town into the book. Phil Collins has a house on the banks of Lake
00:08:44,00:08:51,Geneva. Get out. Does he? What? Is that surprising? I just I'm happy I know it. Okay. I just looked up
00:08:51,00:08:55,people who live near Lake Geneva. It's quite posh isn't it that area? It's got my stuff there.
00:08:55,00:08:59,"Yeah, it became posh after they found the water really. They built massive hotels there and a"
00:08:59,00:09:04,"casino. The casino is interesting because after World War II and Hitler killed himself, there were"
00:09:04,00:09:09,rumours that Hitler was still alive and there was a rumour that he was working as a croupier in
00:09:09,00:09:13,"Evian in the big casino. Oh really? Yeah, yeah. Oh wow. The people went down there trying to find"
00:09:13,00:09:18,"Hitler and they were like, oh no, it's just a guy who looks like Hitler. Wow. How long are you there"
00:09:18,00:09:25,"Phil, by the way? We just like just until the baby got started crying. So about 45 minutes. Okay,"
00:09:25,00:09:29,"so just to just to have it. Yeah, we just we needed somewhere to go for lunch. So yeah,"
00:09:29,00:09:34,"just went there. Not long enough to find Hitler. No, Hitler. No, we didn't see him. Are you guys"
00:09:34,00:09:38,"a fan of Evian? Drink it at home? Yeah, I drink Evian. Do you? Yeah, yeah. Anyone else in your"
00:09:38,00:09:43,"household drink Evian? Yeah, everyone in my house drinks Evian, yeah. Who are the members of your"
00:09:43,00:09:52,"household again? It's myself and my wife and my daughter. Yeah, yeah. Anyone else? Well, no, humans."
00:09:52,00:09:59,"Look, we've got to come out and say this. For the record, James has got a cat and sometimes"
00:09:59,00:10:04,"his cat drinks Evian. And when we say sometimes, only when she's thirsty every single day,"
00:10:04,00:10:11,"James gives his cat Evian. I have to say before we started, these guys already knew this and I do"
00:10:11,00:10:16,"think of all the things in my life, this is the only thing that really can spoil my man of the"
00:10:16,00:10:23,people. This is your meow two moment as of it. Brilliant. And I kind of want you to keep hold
00:10:23,00:10:28,"of it because isn't it because of your fault? It's Anna's fault. And just dear listener, this is"
00:10:28,00:10:34,what happened. Anna told me that cats have special taste buds on their tongues that can taste water.
00:10:34,00:10:38,"And so for us, water doesn't taste of anything. But for cats, it's really important and they can"
00:10:38,00:10:44,taste the difference. And London water is disgusting. True. And we happen to have quite a lot of
00:10:44,00:10:51,Evian in the house because I'd stop how the load for COVID. And I just started giving it to my cat
00:10:51,00:10:57,"and she liked it. And she still likes it. Since you left Bolton, James. I think the listeners"
00:10:57,00:11:02,would appreciate that we live and we die and our cats live and die by our facts. And that's fair
00:11:02,00:11:07,enough. And it's true cats can taste water. They were as we can't. But then there's this big question
00:11:07,00:11:12,"over given the water taste of nothing, how do we know we're drinking water and not some poisonous"
00:11:12,00:11:17,"substance all the time? Well, you can't. That's interesting. It doesn't taste because it's but"
00:11:17,00:11:21,there are some tasteless things like arsenic doesn't taste of anything. Does it? But you can't
00:11:21,00:11:26,"like if I if I give you a pint of arsenic, you wouldn't necessarily know it was not water. No,"
00:11:26,00:11:30,that's true. But I would just think the odds are you struggle to get hold of a pint of arsenic. You'd
00:11:30,00:11:38,"have to read. I have to really annoyed you and keep going. He's a resourceful man. No, I just sort"
00:11:38,00:11:42,of think it's probably it's probably going to be water. And I've been right every time so far. I
00:11:42,00:11:46,"don't like to brag. You only have to be wrong once. No, that's true. I'll keep spinning that. But"
00:11:46,00:11:50,"there's there is a reason you haven't been wrong, which is that you can tell that it's water. And"
00:11:50,00:11:55,"they've only just found this. And it's that it doesn't taste sour, but it registers on our sour"
00:11:55,00:11:59,"taste buds. And it's related to a fact that a guest shared actually, one of those other guests we"
00:11:59,00:12:03,"had in when we kicked James off the show, I think basically when you drink water, it washes away"
00:12:03,00:12:09,your saliva. And then our mouths in the process of replacing saliva produce protons. And Steve
00:12:09,00:12:16,"Mould when he came on, his fact was protons taste sour. Oh, yeah. So it triggers our sour taste buds."
00:12:16,00:12:21,It is mad how much bottled water we drink now. I had no idea how much people are drinking bottled
00:12:21,00:12:25,"water. And I don't get it. So obviously, in developing countries, it's really important"
00:12:25,00:12:30,"because you can't get in a lot of countries, you can't get clean tap water, tasty water in"
00:12:30,00:12:40,"London, of course, delicious water in London. Same same problem. But it's not helping you're"
00:12:40,00:12:44,fast tracking to cancellation. It's not developing countries that are consuming it all. So in
00:12:44,00:12:51,"Singapore, how many liters do you reckon per person per annum per annum? Oh, my God. I mean,"
00:12:51,00:12:56,"half liter a day, a liter a day, 300 liters, 300 liters per person per annum of tap water."
00:12:56,00:13:01,"1,129 liters per person. 3 liters of water a day. Bottled and bottled."
00:13:01,00:13:06,"3 liters of bottled water per person per day. That's insane. There's going to be some outliers,"
00:13:06,00:13:08,aren't there? There's going to be some people who don't have any of that.
00:13:08,00:13:14,Yeah. Australia is a second worst offender. Australians are drinking 504 liters of bottled
00:13:14,00:13:19,water a person a year. Get out. Isn't that insane? It's bananas. It's really hot. The water's good.
00:13:19,00:13:25,"Yeah, but the water's good. The tap water's fine. There's a lot of cats in Australia just to say."
00:13:25,00:13:29,We're by the beach. You can't drink the salt water. You need to have a good old... No one is
00:13:29,00:13:34,proposing you drink salt water. There is such a gap in your logic between the bottle of water and
00:13:34,00:13:39,"the sea. No, the logic is you're down by the sea for a lot of the day where you cannot get"
00:13:39,00:13:45,"access to tap water. Fill up a bottle and take it down. Oh, yeah. I do think that argument has"
00:13:45,00:13:48,"persuaded me not that it's right, but that's probably why it is. It's convenient, isn't it?"
00:13:48,00:13:52,People are out. They've forgotten their bottle. Exactly. Remember your bottle of Australians.
00:13:52,00:13:56,"Is everyone at the beach always in Australia? I know that's the myth that we read, but I don't"
00:13:56,00:14:00,"believe they all do live next to the beach, though, don't they? I mean, no one lives in the middle."
00:14:00,00:14:08,"Well, you'd also need bottled water. I found a thing about water pipes. This was because I was"
00:14:08,00:14:13,"looking up tap water and how it works and what the pipes are like. Anyway, this is from a website"
00:14:13,00:14:20,"called Best Life Online. Oh, yeah. And the headline is eight surprising places you're letting snakes"
00:14:20,00:14:26,into your home. I'd be surprised living in central London if they're getting it anywhere.
00:14:26,00:14:30,"Yeah. And actually, the terrible thing about this article was I wasn't especially surprised by any"
00:14:30,00:14:36,"of the places. Well, toilet. They come up through your toilet. Toilet, water pipes, window, plumbing"
00:14:36,00:14:40,"gaps. Didn't have window. Cat door. No, that's good. That's much. I would be a bit surprised"
00:14:40,00:14:46,"by that because you're expecting the cat, aren't you? Showers, cracks in the foundation,"
00:14:46,00:14:50,"basement access points. And the only one I find mildly surprising, shoes you might have left"
00:14:50,00:14:54,"outside. Yeah, that makes sense. Come home, take off your shoes outside. What would be a surprising"
00:14:54,00:15:00,"entry, though? Out of your computer tower. Like just spiraling out of the computer. I just do"
00:15:00,00:15:05,my work on my computer and my office in my house. Do you come all the way to your computer
00:15:05,00:15:10,tower? This is where I'm out of touch. I have a tower and medieval fortification that I do
00:15:10,00:15:13,"in my computer work. It's annoying because you can't get Wi-Fi in there, but you still go over"
00:15:13,00:15:17,"there. You can get a bit if you stand there, one of the arrow slits. You can get a tiny bit, but it's not much."
00:15:17,00:15:32,"Okay, it is time for fact number two. That is Anna. My fact this week is that there's a mangrove"
00:15:32,00:15:42,"forest in Indonesia that's actually a womangrove. Riddle roundabout. Yeah, it's not really a fact"
00:15:42,00:15:47,that you can tell your friends is it without me explaining it a bit further. But it's really
00:15:47,00:15:54,cool. So this is in Papua and it's a forest called Hutan Per Empuan. And it's a forest where only
00:15:54,00:15:58,women are allowed to go. The oldest women who go there say it's been happening for as long as
00:15:58,00:16:06,they can remember and their grandmothers did it. And mangroves are basically forests that are underwater
00:16:06,00:16:13,"partly. So no, no, sorry. It's a bad description. I'm backtrack. Mangroves are trees. The mangrove,"
00:16:13,00:16:17,there are about a few dozen species of mangrove tree and they're the only trees which can grow
00:16:17,00:16:22,in saltwater. They're amazing things for all sorts of reasons. You tend to get them in brackish
00:16:22,00:16:26,areas where it's like right on the coast. So it's where the saltwater hits the freshwater. All along
00:16:26,00:16:31,the shoreline. And it's basically they exist between high and low tide. So they spend a lot of
00:16:31,00:16:36,their life in water and a lot of their life out of water. And it's very swampy and gross in a
00:16:36,00:16:41,"mangrove. But these swampy, it's gross if you don't like swampy, but these women like it."
00:16:41,00:16:46,"Because they get to gossip, essentially. So these are specifically people from the"
00:16:46,00:16:52,"Engros and Tobati tribes on the Indonesian side of Papua Island. And they weighed in,"
00:16:52,00:16:56,"they collect these shellfish from the mud, they sell them at market, you have to go in naked,"
00:16:56,00:17:00,which is kind of the reason why men aren't allowed. Because then they see the ladies naked.
00:17:00,00:17:07,"And they essentially use it as a way to swap stories, do some female bonding, bitch about the"
00:17:07,00:17:12,"men, pass down a lot of ancient wisdom. It's just a really great women only thing."
00:17:12,00:17:17,"It's like gossiping, slagging off the men, occasionally a bit of ancient wisdom."
00:17:17,00:17:24,"I like those because I subscribe to one of those gossip magazines. But then on the last page,"
00:17:24,00:17:29,"there's always a little bit of ancient wisdom. But they also, they're encouraged to just yell"
00:17:29,00:17:34,out whatever their inner voices. So just random statements that no one will understand. You get
00:17:34,00:17:40,it out. You do that. That's fine. That's clever. The inner voice yell. I read that men are allowed
00:17:40,00:17:44,"in the forest, but only when there are no women there. Is that right? That is correct. So there are"
00:17:44,00:17:48,"times that men are allowed in to collect wood, but they've got to make sure that there are no ladies"
00:17:48,00:17:52,in there. Question. It feels to me like it would be quite hard to work out when there are no ladies
00:17:52,00:17:58,in a forest. Forest is big. Is there like one of those in-out stickers or labels where you just
00:17:58,00:18:02,"slide it over? No, you just got to listen to the gossiping that's going on, which is basically"
00:18:02,00:18:06,"what they say. That's so they can just talk and talk. So if you can't hear any ladies,"
00:18:06,00:18:10,they're probably not there because they use it as their time literally to just have great chat.
00:18:10,00:18:16,Is anyone gossiping or quoting Marcus Aurelius? No. And if you do enter as a man when you're not
00:18:16,00:18:20,"allowed to, you are taken to Tribal Court and you have to pay a fine in polished stones."
00:18:21,00:18:28,"Yeah. Wow. So they take their Kohl Kohl, it's called. It's like their boat. They have a sort of"
00:18:28,00:18:32,group of them that go out with a singular boat and they make a pack not to leave each other.
00:18:32,00:18:38,"And then they go clam hunting, fish hunting as well. And big problems in modern day mangrove,"
00:18:38,00:18:44,womangrove situations is the fact that people like Evian bottles are getting into their
00:18:44,00:18:49,"areas. It's full of plastic now. And so the clams have gone, wait, sorry to knock Evian."
00:18:49,00:18:55,I do. I recycle my Evian bottles that the cat drinks. I don't go all the way to
00:18:55,00:19:02,Papua New Guinea to throw them away. But there's a big problem now. It's really affecting them.
00:19:02,00:19:06,Mangroves are so great. And it's quite sad researching them because you read about all
00:19:06,00:19:11,"the threats of them predominantly from climate change and habitat loss, habitat destruction."
00:19:11,00:19:16,"If people are using a strip of coastline for things like shrimp farming, which is a big industry"
00:19:16,00:19:20,"in lots of these countries, then it just sort of tear up the mangroves basically. But they are"
00:19:20,00:19:25,"incredible. They're among the only few plants which can tolerate saltwater out of 400,000"
00:19:25,00:19:29,"species of plant in the world. 1,500 can tolerate saltwater. Mangroves are among them."
00:19:29,00:19:36,"They live for a really long time. It's so alien when I hear it, like just all the things that they"
00:19:36,00:19:40,"can do that other trees can't do. So yeah, they filter out 90% of the salt that comes in. But"
00:19:40,00:19:45,"the ones that don't do that, they've got these special leaves. I mean, the leaves are like waxy"
00:19:45,00:19:50,substances where they leak out the salt. They can also sweat out crystallized salt on their leaves.
00:19:50,00:19:55,They're so cool. But then there's other ones where they will basically send the salt to the old
00:19:55,00:20:00,leaves in the old bark. So it's not touching the new bit of the tree. That's so intelligent. I'm using
00:20:00,00:20:07,the word intelligent. I'm using the word quite wrongly. It seems like if you look around the
00:20:07,00:20:14,"world that lots of groups of women are in mangrove forests working, it seems. In Mexico, they have"
00:20:14,00:20:21,"las chelameras, who are male and women who work in a certain area of mangroves, protecting the"
00:20:21,00:20:29,"ecosystem. In Kenya, you have the mangrove mothers who work on Pate Island. Pate Island? Is that you"
00:20:29,00:20:36,"live big footprints in Pate Island, don't you? It might be Pate Island, but I prefer Pate Island,"
00:20:36,00:20:43,"don't you? And in India, in Maharashtra, you have a collective of women who kind of work in the mangroves."
00:20:43,00:20:48,"They do safaris, but they also help protect the forest. So it just seems like everywhere you look"
00:20:48,00:20:52,"around the world, wherever there's mangroves, there seems to be women working there. We need to rename"
00:20:52,00:20:59,"them. Sounds like they need a rebrand. Yeah, they mop up tsunamis. Yeah, just incredible. They absorb"
00:20:59,00:21:04,"the energy of incoming waves when they're coastal. So the wave can lose two-thirds of its energy,"
00:21:04,00:21:08,"right? Yeah, you know, and that's really, really useful. There was a study in China which found"
00:21:08,00:21:13,"they reduced floodwater level in a tropical storm by about three meters, which is very useful."
00:21:13,00:21:18,"Annoying if you're a surfer, don't surf in a mangrove. You'll see a brilliant wave coming at you,"
00:21:18,00:21:21,it would have disappeared by the time you hit it. Very few of the Beach Boys' big hits are about
00:21:21,00:21:28,mangroves. But the other nice thing they do is they store huge amounts of carbon because
00:21:28,00:21:32,they build up these big peat deposits beneath them. Some of them are up to six meters deep.
00:21:32,00:21:38,"And they did a study in 2001, so quite a while ago, but they found that the loss of mangroves"
00:21:38,00:21:45,"is 35%, which is worse than tropical forests or coral reefs. Oh, really? Don't look at that fact at all."
00:21:45,00:21:50,"The world's biggest bacterium ever was found in a mangrove forest. Oh, yeah, we've mentioned him."
00:21:50,00:21:54,"Yeah, yeah. I hope it wasn't her. Otherwise, that bacterium would have been arrested and forced"
00:21:54,00:22:04,"to hand in polished rocks. Can I say, if you eat mangrove, it contains asparagusic acid,"
00:22:04,00:22:10,which is the stuff that makes your urine smell after eating asparagus. Does it make your
00:22:10,00:22:18,"wee smell the same as asparagus? No, the same. Asparagus acid also kills parasitic nematodes,"
00:22:18,00:22:22,which is why it's evolved into these two places. So it protects the asparagus plant and the mangroves
00:22:22,00:22:29,against these nematode worms. That's good. Interesting thing about that. They need wee mangroves.
00:22:29,00:22:35,They rely on fish wee. It turned out because part of the way they survive is through consuming lots
00:22:35,00:22:40,of nitrogen. They make great use of nitrogen and that is produced by fish wee and they did
00:22:40,00:22:45,"a study of a mangrove forest in the Bahamas and they found that there were just two species of fish,"
00:22:45,00:22:49,two types of snapper that doubled the amount of nitrogen in the water and made it possible to
00:22:49,00:22:55,"survive. Wow. Hey, here's a little mini quiz. Yeah. Which of these is not a nickname for mangroves?"
00:22:55,00:23:02,"Okay. Walking trees, dead man's fingers, the kidneys of the coast."
00:23:02,00:23:07,"Well, you would think kidneys of the coast because they effectively are doing what kidneys do,"
00:23:07,00:23:12,which is filtering stuff. So I'm going to say it's definitely not that. That's not the nickname.
00:23:12,00:23:16,"It's not the nickname. No, that is the name. That is the name. Because your question is,"
00:23:16,00:23:21,"which is not the nickname. Yeah. Oh, right, you're doing the thought. Yeah. Double negative. I'm"
00:23:21,00:23:26,going to say they look like they walk because their roots are so huge and they come out of the
00:23:26,00:23:29,"ground. I've actually always found them really creepy because they look like giant spiders,"
00:23:29,00:23:33,don't they? Fields of spiders. So I think they're probably called walking trees. Is that what you
00:23:33,00:23:38,"said? Well, I think that bananas are walking trees. Yeah. Like bananas walk as in they move."
00:23:38,00:23:46,"Bananas. I saw it from in pajamas. No, banana trees. Yeah, banana trees. They move. Yeah."
00:23:46,00:23:52,As in they'll propagate another banana tree maybe a few meters away from them. And if you
00:23:52,00:23:56,"go back two years later, it looks like the trees moved. Yeah. I think this was like one of the"
00:23:56,00:24:02,"famous moments on QI where Sean Locke said the trees they walk and Stephen was like, no,"
00:24:02,00:24:06,"they don't. And then it came through. Well, we were literally on the computers going,"
00:24:06,00:24:09,"yes, they do, Stephen. Yes, they do, Stephen. Stephen, this is Andy coming to you from my"
00:24:09,00:24:17,computer tower. I can confirm. I'm going to say that I think you kind of danced around the idea
00:24:17,00:24:20,of the dead man fingers when you said spiders. It looks like dead man fingers are coming out
00:24:20,00:24:24,"with these big balls. So I say yes to that, yes to that. And I think you're tricking us. I think"
00:24:24,00:24:30,all three are. Dan's got it. They're all nicknames for that. Walking trees. You couldn't be asked
00:24:30,00:24:36,to come up with a fourth fake nickname. Dead Man's Fingers. I'll come up with another one now.
00:24:38,00:24:43,Stop staring at me. I'll spare you. Only time. You can do it later and edit it in.
00:24:43,00:24:47,"Yeah, yeah. Salty Creepy Boys. Oh, okay. Now, that's a difficult one."
00:24:47,00:24:55,"Can I quickly talk about a place where women are not allowed? Yeah, the Yorkie Factory."
00:24:55,00:25:05,"And he knows his reference for British listeners. This is Mount Athos in Greece,"
00:25:05,00:25:12,"which was known as the place of 6,000 beards. Because there were monasteries on there and"
00:25:12,00:25:17,"monks were allowed, but women were not allowed in there. And they had a law called the Avaton,"
00:25:17,00:25:23,which prohibited women from entering. And the idea is that the monastery started when the Virgin
00:25:23,00:25:29,"Mary was sailing across the coast or something, and it stopped at this place. And the voice of God"
00:25:29,00:25:33,"said, let no other woman come here because the Virgin Mary's been here and no other women are"
00:25:33,00:25:40,allowed. So we're going to put a stop to that. We didn't like her at all. So even when the British
00:25:40,00:25:46,"Royal Family went, Prince Philip was allowed on the island and the Queen, Queen Elizabeth II wasn't."
00:25:46,00:25:53,"Helena of Bulgaria, she in the 14th century had the plague, and she was brought there to try and"
00:25:53,00:26:00,help her. But she was carried so that her feet never touched the ground. I know. And there was a
00:26:00,00:26:07,"brilliant writer, a French writer called Marie Choisie. And she had written a book called"
00:26:07,00:26:12,"""Un noir chez le feel"", which was a month with the girls where she was in a brothel. And then she"
00:26:12,00:26:18,"wrote a second book called ""Un noir chez les hommes"", which was a month with the men, which was about"
00:26:18,00:26:26,going to this place. And she had a double radial mastectomy. That's commitment. I know. And wore
00:26:26,00:26:33,a false mustache. And she posed as a man and went to this place. And she spoke to all the monks and
00:26:33,00:26:38,"stuff and asked them what was going on. And she asked one monk, she said, what's this deal like?"
00:26:38,00:26:45,"Is it true that you're not even allowed female animals in this place? And the monk said, we must"
00:26:45,00:26:50,"draw the line somewhere. The day we possessed a hen, some brothers would argue that we should also"
00:26:50,00:26:57,"accept a she-cat, a you, or even a she-ass. And there is but a short step from a she-ass to a woman."
00:26:57,00:27:00,What do you mean a you? Not me? I'm not one.
00:27:00,00:27:08,"But yeah, isn't that amazing? I never heard of this, Marie Choisie."
00:27:08,00:27:13,"She swasied pretty weirdly, I would say, having both your breasts locked off."
00:27:13,00:27:16,Just to go on this journalistic expedition?
00:27:16,00:27:22,"Yeah, she was like a feminist reporter of a crazy sort of Louis Theroux of her time."
00:27:22,00:27:25,"Yeah, but you won't see Louis chopping his dick off to get into this mangrove, will you?"
00:27:25,00:27:27,"Like that is... I don't know, Louis, if you're listening."
00:27:27,00:27:31,I'm in a ladies mangrove in Luffa.
00:27:31,00:27:37,"Hi, I'm Louis. I'm from the BBC. You okay?"
00:27:44,00:27:49,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:27:49,00:27:55,"My fact is that until the early 20th century, Swiss people were routinely being injured by the last ice age."
00:27:55,00:28:03,"The film? That's right. I hated it. Just a squirrel with a nut. I don't know, I haven't seen it."
00:28:03,00:28:09,"Is that what happens? I'm just about, yeah, Theroux is not under the ice, can't find it."
00:28:09,00:28:12,Very long quest. Really? All four movies?
00:28:12,00:28:14,"Yeah, yeah. That's padding. I hasn't found it yet."
00:28:14,00:28:21,"Look, let's press on. This is a fact. It came from a list of facts. Every year, there's a"
00:28:21,00:28:25,guy called Tom Whitwell who does a list of 52 things he learned. Oh yeah.
00:28:25,00:28:27,"I've mentioned one of his facts before. Years ago, yeah."
00:28:27,00:28:29,I have to limit myself because it's such a great list of facts.
00:28:29,00:28:33,"But he mentioned this fact, which came from a brilliant London Review of Books article"
00:28:33,00:28:38,"by Jonah Goodman, and it's all about Swiss people who, until the early 20th century,"
00:28:38,00:28:46,"loads of them had goiters, right? And that is a bulge of flesh that comes out of the front of"
00:28:46,00:28:50,your neck. And they can be really big. They can really limit your life if you have one.
00:28:50,00:28:55,"They make you wheeze, they weigh on your windpipe. They're really unpleasant to have,"
00:28:55,00:28:59,"you know, and they're harmful. And everyone in Switzerland had them."
00:28:59,00:29:02,"Not everyone, but a lot of people had them. 80% of the country."
00:29:02,00:29:07,It was crazy. And it was only on the sort of Swiss alpine plateau. We're quite
00:29:07,00:29:11,no like Geneva actually for this fact as well. And there were dozens of theories doing the rounds.
00:29:11,00:29:16,"Is it the landscape, the air, the high altitude sunlight? Is it the incest? Someone said."
00:29:16,00:29:21,"Is it moral failure? Incest is probably a category of that. Anyway, like all these"
00:29:21,00:29:26,"theories are doing rounds. And basically, it turned out it was thanks to the last Ice Age,"
00:29:26,00:29:31,"because during the last Ice Age, Switzerland, very high up, was covered by an ice sheet that"
00:29:31,00:29:36,"was about a thousand meters thick, and it melted and then refroze loads and loads of times, right?"
00:29:36,00:29:40,And it just absolutely ripped off the top 250 meters of rock and soil
00:29:40,00:29:45,"from the Swiss plateau. And wherever the ice sheet was, the soil was stripped of a chemical,"
00:29:45,00:29:50,which was iodine. And the lack of iodine is what causes goiters.
00:29:50,00:29:52,"And everyone was like, thank God it wasn't the incest."
00:29:52,00:30:02,"Keep going, hon. Oh dear. And it was lack of iodine? And it just did a complete"
00:30:02,00:30:06,number on half the population of Switzerland for centuries. It was extraordinary.
00:30:06,00:30:10,I can't believe I've never heard of this. Had you guys heard of this before? No.
00:30:10,00:30:15,"It's astonishing, because this isn't like the 1700s. This is up until the 1920s,"
00:30:15,00:30:22,"that 30% of military personnel in Switzerland had giant... When we talk about fashion, as we're"
00:30:22,00:30:28,"going to do in the next fact, you do stuff to... Yeah, I know. We rarely throw forward."
00:30:30,00:30:35,"But clothing was designed largely for them to hide these giant throbbing lumps on their necks,"
00:30:35,00:30:40,"which is... Yeah, and you can see photos. Can I do something a bit more"
00:30:40,00:30:44,"classic and throw back to the last fact? Yeah, good. Yes, better. Safe ground."
00:30:44,00:30:49,"They used to have these things in the mangroves, the biggest mangrove in the world,"
00:30:49,00:30:53,"which is on the border of India and Bangladesh, I think. And they would also have these big"
00:30:53,00:30:59,"sort of collars, which covered your entire neck. But it wasn't to stop you from being able to see"
00:30:59,00:31:03,your goiter. Can you guess what it was for? Vampires? Anti-vampire device? Close. Get away.
00:31:03,00:31:11,"Yeah, very close. I think it's something more real. Werewolf. No. It's not that close. A spider."
00:31:11,00:31:17,"Oh, spider. No, it's because tigers live there. And people working in the mangroves,"
00:31:17,00:31:21,they would be caught by tigers. I don't know if a little ruff-ruff...
00:31:21,00:31:27,"They were quite solid collars, but they would stop the tigers from being able to bite you."
00:31:27,00:31:31,"Grab you by the scruff of the neck. Yeah, sorry. Anyway, we were talking about goiters."
00:31:31,00:31:37,"And I find it incredible that the ice age was this specific, just affected this one's place so"
00:31:37,00:31:42,"specifically. Everyone else was kind of okay, but it stripped away the iodine. I mean, I think maybe"
00:31:42,00:31:46,"it was moral failing, because that's just a very targeted approach. No, no, it's good to"
00:31:46,00:31:51,relitigate these things and test the theory. But it was quite hard for them to know exactly how
00:31:51,00:31:55,"many people had it because everyone was hiding it, people were embarrassed by it. So the census,"
00:31:55,00:31:59,"if they did any kind of surveying, wouldn't really truly show it. So when conscription"
00:31:59,00:32:03,"was happening for the armies, you had to have your medical and there was no way of hiding it."
00:32:03,00:32:10,"So in 1921, nearly 30% of 19 year old conscripts had a goiter on their neck."
00:32:10,00:32:14,"If you buy one of those Swiss army knives, there is a special goiter implement."
00:32:14,00:32:18,"People always say it's for taking stones out of horseshoes, but actually it's for popping the"
00:32:18,00:32:26,goiter. There was Mark Twain when he visited in 1880. I bet he had something typically kind
00:32:26,00:32:31,and understanding to say about it. Wow. Maybe your views on Twain clear? I don't like him.
00:32:31,00:32:37,"He said, I, this isn't going to end you to him actually. He wrote, ""I have seen the principal"
00:32:37,00:32:42,"features of Swiss scenery, Mont Blanc and the goiter."" Lovely. Thank you, Mark. Another"
00:32:42,00:32:47,"very human and wise observation. Sorry, I just don't like Mark Twain. Anyway, let's move on."
00:32:47,00:32:51,Wow. It's because he was incredibly rude about Jane Austen once. Oh my God.
00:32:51,00:32:56,"He was famously, no, no, he famously wrote, ""Oh, I'd like to dig her up and beat her over"
00:32:56,00:32:59,"the head with her own shin bone."" And I just think, ""Give me a break. Give me a break, Mark."""
00:32:59,00:33:03,"Yeah. Next time you write something as good as Emma, you can have a pop at big dog Jane."
00:33:03,00:33:08,"But you never did. And you never will because you're dead. Anyway, sorry."
00:33:08,00:33:13,"Okay. So it affected not just goiters. So there was this other medical condition called,"
00:33:13,00:33:17,"it was known at the time as cretinism, right? Where people had very serious"
00:33:17,00:33:21,developmental problems. They grew much shorter than normal. Their features didn't grow properly.
00:33:21,00:33:26,A lot of them were deaf and mute. And there was a Swiss goiter commission. There were schools
00:33:26,00:33:30,"across the country for deaf, mute children. As in it really wasn't like a national health"
00:33:30,00:33:35,disaster. That's why I mean that company we haven't heard of this. Exactly. The word cretin comes
00:33:35,00:33:40,from the French Alps because of this. Right. And do you know the origin of the word cretin?
00:33:40,00:33:45,I thought it was really interesting because obviously it became an extremely offensive word.
00:33:45,00:33:51,But originally it came from an alpine dialect word because it was so common in the Alps.
00:33:51,00:33:57,It came from an alpine dialect word for Christian cretin. And it was to remind people that these
00:33:57,00:34:03,"people who looked often, you know, so inhuman in a way, a lot of deformities, to remind people"
00:34:03,00:34:08,that they were still human Christian people who were equally loved by God. We should be very kind
00:34:08,00:34:12,"to them. That's amazing. It started out as a very humane term. Because Bertrand Russell,"
00:34:12,00:34:18,he thought that iodine might have been evidence that humans don't have a soul.
00:34:18,00:34:24,"Because what he saw was that when you gave this chemical to people, suddenly they became more"
00:34:24,00:34:31,human as he saw it. Perhaps it's all about chemistry and it's not about the soul and Christianity
00:34:31,00:34:36,"and whatever. Interesting. Yeah, that kind of you can see the kind of where were chemical driven"
00:34:36,00:34:40,machines when when you throw something new into us and it changes the core. And it's kind of what
00:34:40,00:34:44,"happened, right? So when the all the theories that we're talking about earlier, moral compasses"
00:34:44,00:34:50,"and all that sort of stuff, bad beer, when the original list that was on there, where do you"
00:34:50,00:34:56,"wake up in bed with the cousin or sorry, it's the bad beer that caused the incest."
00:34:56,00:35:04,"There was four main players, I believe, when it comes down to how this eventually got solved."
00:35:04,00:35:10,"One was called Otto Bayard. And they were pushing this theory that yeah, we need we need more iodine."
00:35:10,00:35:15,And he actually went to sort of little communities and he upped the iodine
00:35:15,00:35:19,in all the things that they were consuming. So he went to the cows and he made sure that
00:35:19,00:35:22,"it was in the salt that they were licking it was in the that you know, in the milk that they were"
00:35:22,00:35:27,producing. There was tiny amounts that were being put into the food of this family. And he did it
00:35:27,00:35:31,over a term of a school course in the winter and he came back and they had gotten better and suddenly
00:35:31,00:35:35,"he went Jesus, this is this is what it is. They're missing their iodine. And that's why we"
00:35:35,00:35:40,"have it now that people put iodine in salt, isn't it? Yeah, because people around the world eat"
00:35:40,00:35:44,salt. Everyone eats a bit of salt. Iodine actually works quite well with salt. So they put it in
00:35:44,00:35:51,there and that's kind of what did it. This is 88% of salt is now iodine.
00:35:51,00:35:57,"Not the UK, weirdly. Really? No, we get our iodine other ways. But I mean, there's it's in a lot of"
00:35:57,00:36:06,milk. Because cows cows are given iodine. And so it happens that way. I believe the
00:36:06,00:36:12,"vast majority is not usually isn't. Yeah, like sea salt and rock salt are not because they're made"
00:36:12,00:36:16,differently. But even table salt in the UK is not standardly iodized. The doctor who found it was
00:36:16,00:36:21,"called Heinrich Hunziker, great name. And it was because it all goes through your thyroid gland,"
00:36:21,00:36:25,"which is at the front of your neck. And if you don't get enough, it swells up because it's"
00:36:25,00:36:30,desperately trying to find more iodine from your bloodstream. So it swells and swells and swells.
00:36:30,00:36:34,"That's what causes it. And it's like all of it, the brain fog and the muscle ache and the goiters,"
00:36:34,00:36:38,all of it is due to your body just desperately hunting. But the problem that took them a long
00:36:38,00:36:42,time to work out why it was just a little bit of iodine was required is that if you give people
00:36:42,00:36:47,"too much iodine, at least to catastrophic health consequences in the other direction. So you need"
00:36:47,00:36:53,"one 15,000th of one gram of iodine a day. It's very small. And they were trying to give people a"
00:36:53,00:36:56,"gram a day of iodine and they were getting terribly ill and they were saying, ""Well, the iodine's a"
00:36:56,00:37:00,"disaster. Look at that."" So it took a long time to work out. It is one of those frustrating things."
00:37:00,00:37:03,It's a little bit like hand washing where people were saying it for over 100 years.
00:37:03,00:37:06,"People kept saying, ""Do you know what? I think iodine is the answer to this."" And everyone,"
00:37:06,00:37:11,"""No, no, no, don't. It's just going to kill you."" And one of the key people,"
00:37:11,00:37:14,another one of the key people who changed things was a guy called Hans Egenberger.
00:37:15,00:37:21,Sounds like a McDonald's offering. It was actually a very important man.
00:37:21,00:37:26,"Do you want to, well, someone said to him one day, ""Do you want salt on your Egenberger?"""
00:37:26,00:37:34,"And he realized, take this a moment. Good old Egenberger. He was a very charismatic guy. He was"
00:37:34,00:37:39,"the male. He was in charge of a specific Swiss canton and he realized that iodine, a little bit"
00:37:39,00:37:44,of iodine was the answer. And so he decided to add to his town cinema. This is in the 1920s. His
00:37:44,00:37:48,town cinemas program of light entertainment. So the cinema was showing loads of really fun
00:37:48,00:37:54,"films. He added a lecture on iodized salt in amongst the light entertainment. But for some reason,"
00:37:54,00:37:58,"because he was so charismatic and popular, everyone flooded in to watch it. And he put lots"
00:37:58,00:38:04,"of jokes in. He did this lecture, lots of tricks and jokes and fun words, like he called it whole"
00:38:04,00:38:10,"salt. I don't know, that's not fun, but it was funny at the time. Anyway, straight after everyone"
00:38:10,00:38:14,"went to see this great film of his, there was a petition, I got thousands of signatures and"
00:38:14,00:38:18,"iodized salt was introduced. Brilliant. Wow. And then Gandhi hated it, didn't he?"
00:38:18,00:38:24,"Gandhi? Did he? What, the iodization of salt? Yeah, he did lots of good stuff, of course, Gandhi."
00:38:24,00:38:32,"We have to say, for balance. I mean, the problem was that it was the British who were taxing"
00:38:32,00:38:39,local salt and then kind of replacing it with these iodized salt. And he kind of started anti-salt
00:38:39,00:38:46,"riots. Did he walk to the sea protesting about the salt thing? He did the long walk, yeah."
00:38:46,00:38:50,"To try and get proper salt from the sea? I think it was raising awareness. I mean,"
00:38:50,00:38:56,"obviously, like the tax thing was real, but the iodized thing was kind of just a side"
00:38:56,00:39:01,hustle that he thought was colonial. I see. A rare misfire from Gandhi there. I'm not trying to
00:39:01,00:39:05,"cancel Gandhi, like you're trying to cancel Mark Twain, just to say. No, no, and I'll"
00:39:05,00:39:09,"definitely keep going on the Twain thing. Goitre used to be nicknamed ""Darbyshire Neck"""
00:39:09,00:39:14,"in the UK. In the UK, right. Yeah, supposedly, because... People in Buxton got it."
00:39:14,00:39:20,"Maybe. Maybe. Well, lots of bits of Darbyshire are quite far from the sea and seafood contains..."
00:39:20,00:39:22,"All of us, in fact."
00:39:22,00:39:27,"Yeah, but some bits are closer than others."
00:39:27,00:39:32,"The exact centre of Darbyshire is a long way from the sea, yeah."
00:39:32,00:39:40,"Yeah, and the seafood contains lots of iodine, so maybe people living in the less sea adjacent"
00:39:40,00:39:43,"of Darbyshire, which obviously doesn't touch the sea, we're getting a bit less."
00:39:43,00:39:50,"Just on iodine, it's very useful in other ways. I actually remember, this is just personal,"
00:39:50,00:39:53,but I remember having to drink iodine water. Have you guys ever drunk that because it purifies
00:39:53,00:39:58,water? No. I went to Malawi when I was a teenager for like two months and yeah.
00:39:58,00:40:02,"With iodine tablets. Yeah, with the drop of iodine tab in and you taste it for the first time"
00:40:02,00:40:06,"and you go, ""I can't drink this shit for two months."" So what does it do? It purifies water."
00:40:06,00:40:09,"Just purifies the goodness. Yeah, it's very useful for that. I feel like I've had that, yeah."
00:40:09,00:40:12,Because that's why Andy's the only one with a gaiter around they're taking.
00:40:12,00:40:19,"I really thought that my polo neck was concealing that, but apparently not."
00:40:19,00:40:21,"It did save you of that tiger, in fact, too, that didn't it?"
00:40:21,00:40:28,"But something else it does, you can detect counterfeit money and if you remember your school"
00:40:28,00:40:34,"chemistry, you might be able to work out why. So real money is on cotton or linen, usually paper."
00:40:34,00:40:39,"So we shouldn't call it paper money. Counterfeit money often just made of actual paper, wood-based"
00:40:39,00:40:44,paper. And wood-based paper contains starch. And do you remember when you're detecting starch in
00:40:44,00:40:50,science? Iodine is the thing that reacts to starch and shows up if starch is in something. So if you
00:40:50,00:40:56,"rub an iodine pen on paper and it reacts to it, then it means that it's made of wood. But this"
00:40:56,00:41:02,has been used to catch people. And there was a story in 2016 where a 14-year-old girl caused the
00:41:02,00:41:08,police to descend on her school lunch and she was put in handcuffs because she paid with a two-dollar
00:41:08,00:41:14,"bill, bizarrely, that an iodine pen that the school had showed up as fake. The police came."
00:41:14,00:41:18,"The police came, she was put in handcuffs. She wasn't allowed to eat lunch that day. She went hungry."
00:41:18,00:41:21,"She said, ""I promised that my grandma gave me the money."""
00:41:22,00:41:26,Was her grandmother doing the forging? It turns out her grandmother's not a criminal either.
00:41:26,00:41:31,"This method doesn't work on money that was made before about 1955. And her grandma had given her,"
00:41:31,00:41:36,"obviously, a note they've been taking in her wallet for a very long time. So she went free in the end."
00:41:36,00:41:39,She is not still incarcerated. I imagine she was still incarcerated.
00:41:39,00:41:45,You've got to keep her in just in case. Pardon by Biden if he is later.
00:41:45,00:41:54,I've got an audience fact about ice sheets. It's from Percy Fulford. And I just love the way this
00:41:54,00:41:59,"email begins, right? Percy writes, ""Admittedly, this one sounds a bit like a James Harkin quote"
00:41:59,00:42:03,"fact, but bear with me."" I think Percy is confused James and Dan here."
00:42:03,00:42:10,"Thank you, Percy, for your email. Is he put his address on? I'm not giving you it."
00:42:12,00:42:16,"I'm sure he just means a dantribe effect. Well, no one's worried that I'm taking effects from that."
00:42:16,00:42:21,"You know, because Dan likes his crypto stuff. Okay, yeah. Anyway,"
00:42:21,00:42:26,"you're going to tell us this fact is falling on very stony ground. In the last ice age,"
00:42:26,00:42:31,"much of Canada was covered in massive, several kilometer thick glaciers, which have now melted."
00:42:31,00:42:35,"Those glaciers were immensely heavy, but now the weight has been lifted. The crust is springing"
00:42:35,00:42:40,"back up at about 12 million meters a year, like a memory foam mattress. Yeah. However, until the"
00:42:40,00:42:49,"cross 12 million meters a year, millimeters, millimeters. It's amazing that picture of"
00:42:49,00:42:59,"earth from space. Canada is hundreds of miles. I'm underwhelmed. However, until the crust fully"
00:42:59,00:43:03,"rebounds from the weight of these glaciers, Canada's landscape is missing the immense mass that caused"
00:43:03,00:43:08,"its shape. So for the time being, moving to Canada, particularly to somewhere near Hudson Bay, remains"
00:43:08,00:43:15,"an effective weight loss method. If that's true, the UK as well, I should say. Yeah. We had a nice"
00:43:15,00:43:20,sheet that went as far down as pretty much where Stonehenge is. And then it's not there anymore.
00:43:20,00:43:26,And that's why it's the UK is slightly slanted. And that's why you get big cliffs where Dover is.
00:43:26,00:43:32,"But if you go to Markham, for instance, it's a really long, sandy beach. It's just been crushed"
00:43:32,00:43:38,"down. Yeah. Right. And now it's bouncing back, right? Over millions of years it will do. Yeah."
00:43:38,00:43:43,"You can't bounce your castle on it. But I should say, this is from memory, but there's another"
00:43:43,00:43:48,"thing about ice sheets you just reminded me of, which is there's a restaurant in, that was in"
00:43:48,00:43:54,"Italy. And I think due to climate change, it was on a glacier. And the glaciers very, very slowly"
00:43:54,00:43:58,"moving, but moving more than you thought. And they now think that the restaurant might be in"
00:43:58,00:44:03,Switzerland because it was quite near the border and it's kind of slowly moved in that direction.
00:44:03,00:44:09,"That's amazing. We should say as well, I stupidly didn't write this bit down, but one of the big"
00:44:09,00:44:14,moments in this whole story of this main fact about the last Ice Age being responsible is there
00:44:14,00:44:18,"was one person who stood up in front of the academic community and said, I think it's the"
00:44:18,00:44:23,"melting ice sheets. I think that's what's done. Like it was a proper, he put it forward as the idea."
00:44:23,00:44:29,"And everyone just went, you are nuts. That's worse than the incest idea. That's like it was it."
00:44:29,00:44:30,Hans McMuffin.
00:44:30,00:44:46,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that"
00:44:46,00:44:52,"during the reign of Charles II, women's dressing tables tended to include both face and nipple"
00:44:52,00:44:58,"makeup. Wow. Okay. Yeah. So when you're making up your face, yeah, I'm no expert, but you're"
00:44:58,00:45:03,putting on foundation and you're putting on stuff on top of that. Yeah. Maybe some lipstick.
00:45:03,00:45:09,Do they call it nipstick? Nice. How are you making up the nipple basically? Is it more for
00:45:09,00:45:12,"lipstick or a foundation? I think that's a great question. Yeah, it feels like it'd be a foundation."
00:45:12,00:45:16,"Yeah, more like a foundation. I do it as eyeliner. I do it as eyeliner, paint some little eyelashes"
00:45:16,00:45:20,around it. So you're kind of winking with your nip. So it looks like a little sunshine.
00:45:20,00:45:26,"Yeah, nice. I do lipstick. Make it a big red blob. Wow. Yeah. Why did they need it? Well,"
00:45:26,00:45:31,they needed it because this came in a period where Charles II basically lowered the cleavage line.
00:45:31,00:45:38,"He was sorry. Can King Charles do that now that he's the king? Oh, yeah. That's why he picked the"
00:45:38,00:45:43,"name Charles. He's going to start where he left off. He's easing us all in gently, but he will"
00:45:43,00:45:48,"gently start lowering those lines. The environment thing is just a lure us in, isn't it? And then"
00:45:48,00:45:53,"he whips away our tops. Wow. Yeah, no, he was a sort of like, you know, he was, he came in,"
00:45:53,00:45:59,"he was very liberal. He was the Merry Monarch, was he? Yeah, Merry Monarch. Yeah, that's his name."
00:45:59,00:46:05,"He was very libidinous, saucy, pro-theater. Just after the Cromwellian times. Exactly,"
00:46:05,00:46:09,"literally anyone would have seen Merry after all the Cromwellian. Not a high bar, but he genuinely"
00:46:09,00:46:16,"did seem like a bit of a goer. Yeah, and they're just grew this trend whereby if you're wearing"
00:46:16,00:46:20,"corsets and your nipple happened to peek over, that was not a bad thing. And then suddenly"
00:46:20,00:46:24,"everyone thought, well, let's let's lower the corset a bit. Let's get the boobs out. Let's get,"
00:46:24,00:46:30,"and it was, you know, seeing an ankle was far more scandalous and titillating to a pervert,"
00:46:30,00:46:34,than seeing you didn't have to be a pervert.
00:46:34,00:46:45,"The word used to be ankylating, didn't it? Very nice. I mean, it was still very raunchy."
00:46:46,00:46:50,"We should say it wasn't like people were going around the shop, flashing a boob to get free"
00:46:50,00:46:55,"loaf of bread. It was still, you know, there were paintings we have of people exposing breasts,"
00:46:55,00:47:00,but they were generally prostitutes or actresses who were meant to be a bit... In those days.
00:47:00,00:47:07,"Indeed. I have to say a good caveat. Yeah, there's a famous Nell Gwynn picture. This is why I was"
00:47:07,00:47:14,"never allowed to host the Oscars the second time. She was amazing, by the way, just before we"
00:47:14,00:47:20,"disappear on Nell Gwynn. I've never read about Nell Gwynn before, and she, yeah, so Charles II"
00:47:20,00:47:24,basically stipulated that when you're at the theatre and men who were in all the plays playing
00:47:24,00:47:29,"women, that should no longer be the case. It should be women now playing women. There was Margaret Hughes,"
00:47:29,00:47:34,"who was the first woman to step on stage and play a woman in a play, and then Nell Gwynn,"
00:47:34,00:47:39,"who became very famous, they met. She was working in... Her and Charles met. Her and Charles met,"
00:47:39,00:47:44,"sorry, so basically she was working outside a theatre, which was the King's Theatre, and then"
00:47:44,00:47:48,"she met this guy who was called Charles Hart, who became known as Charles the First to her."
00:47:48,00:47:52,And then she... Not to be confused with the headless one.
00:47:52,00:47:56,"Yeah, clever. That was just what she nicknamed him. It's what she nicknamed him, too."
00:47:56,00:47:58,Retroactively after she got together with Charles II.
00:47:58,00:48:02,"Well, because then she had a Charles II, which was Charles Saxwell. So actually Charles II"
00:48:02,00:48:03,"was her Charles III. Oh, wow."
00:48:03,00:48:08,"This is a sort of bawdy, fast developing. They're all behind a different door,"
00:48:08,00:48:10,all on stage. Yeah.
00:48:10,00:48:13,She was... What I know about Mel Gwynn is her mother was a prostitute.
00:48:13,00:48:17,"She was an orange seller, I think. That's right."
00:48:17,00:48:23,"And then became an actor/prostitute. I always think it's very pigmalion,"
00:48:23,00:48:26,"isn't it, don't you think? Because you very much came from Newwood,"
00:48:26,00:48:27,didn't you? She was a sexy pigmalion.
00:48:27,00:48:31,She was very witty. There's all these anecdotes that have made it through the years. So like the
00:48:31,00:48:36,one time she was going in a carriage through the streets of a city and the people were furious
00:48:36,00:48:39,because they thought that she was a different mistress. They thought that she was the Duchess
00:48:39,00:48:44,"of Portsmouth. And so they were yelling at her going, ""You Catholic whore, you Catholic whore."""
00:48:44,00:48:49,"And she leaned out of the carriage and she said, ""Pray good people be civil. I am the Protestant whore."""
00:48:49,00:48:50,Not the Catholic.
00:48:50,00:48:51,That's clever.
00:48:51,00:48:52,It's really witty.
00:48:52,00:48:54,Roll around laughing at the time.
00:48:54,00:48:55,Yes.
00:48:55,00:48:58,"But anyway, so she was one of the people who got their waps out."
00:48:58,00:48:59,"Waps, waps."
00:48:59,00:49:01,And we still have paintings of it from the time.
00:49:01,00:49:07,"We do. And yeah, it was a time, it was kind of like the roaring 20s, wasn't it?"
00:49:07,00:49:10,Because it was post just for international listeners. It was just after we'd had this
00:49:10,00:49:13,like unpleasant interregnum uptight or strained.
00:49:13,00:49:16,"Following an already, following an unpleasant civil war."
00:49:16,00:49:19,"Yeah, yeah. Everyone was a bit tired of the unpleasantness. They weren't allowed to have"
00:49:19,00:49:25,fun. The Puritans were all over them. And then this period came in and everyone loosened right up
00:49:25,00:49:30,and people got really into fashion and makeup. So women hadn't worn that much makeup.
00:49:30,00:49:35,"They'd worn very thick lead paint on their faces, often as famously Queen Elizabeth did"
00:49:35,00:49:40,"and may have killed her. But other than that, didn't really wear that much until now."
00:49:40,00:49:43,And it was the century of the massive hooped skirt.
00:49:43,00:49:47,"When you see women in these giant skirts, they couldn't fit through doors."
00:49:47,00:49:52,"That was then. And I didn't realize with the hoop skirts, people took the piss out of them"
00:49:52,00:49:57,the moment they appeared. And men kind of hated them. Men just laughed at women for wearing them.
00:49:57,00:50:00,"You couldn't see the ankles, could you? If you're a pervert."
00:50:00,00:50:06,"Yeah, they're very upset about that. But yeah, women stuck to them. And actually,"
00:50:06,00:50:11,"they were, when you look at how they were made, you had much more motion in them."
00:50:11,00:50:16,"Because basically, they involved this big whale bone kind of giant umbrella sticking"
00:50:16,00:50:21,"out from your waist. But underneath, you were just fully naked and free. So it used to be that"
00:50:21,00:50:24,you'd be covered in heavy petticoats all over your legs and stuff.
00:50:24,00:50:26,You could be doing riverdance under there. No one knows.
00:50:26,00:50:32,"You could be smuggling houses under there. But they were quite sexy because if you bent over,"
00:50:32,00:50:34,"you did expose a bit of ankle. Oh, right."
00:50:34,00:50:38,"If you really bent over, you could expose everything."
00:50:38,00:50:41,Even perverts would probably think that was a bit much.
00:50:41,00:50:48,"The waistcoat was invented by Charles II. On the 14th of October, 1666, which is"
00:50:48,00:50:55,it's not amazing that we know when the idea of wearing a suit and a waistcoat on that exact date.
00:50:56,00:50:57,"Did he think of it, or did someone help him?"
00:50:57,00:51:03,"You know what? I mean, he got the credit in fairness, but there will have been other people"
00:51:03,00:51:09,who did a lot of the hard yards. But there was accusations that England was being dictated
00:51:09,00:51:14,"to by France in lots of different ways. And they were saying that basically, not only that,"
00:51:14,00:51:19,everyone in court is just copying French clothes. And Charles II was not very happy about this and
00:51:19,00:51:24,"wanted to make a statement and said, okay, we're going to invent a new thing. We're going to all"
00:51:24,00:51:29,"wear trousers, all wear jackets, all wear waistcoats, and they're going to be made by English wool."
00:51:29,00:51:33,And you're not allowed to wear your French fashion anymore. You have to wear the English
00:51:33,00:51:37,fashion. And we know about it because peeps writes about it. So it definitely did happen.
00:51:37,00:51:38,What year was that? Sorry.
00:51:38,00:51:41,"1666, just after the fire."
00:51:41,00:51:49,"When, again, you'd think a king with his head screwed on, sorry, Charles II,"
00:51:49,00:51:50,that's probably been intense.
00:51:52,00:51:55,He would have his mind on other matters like recovering from the plague of the fire than
00:51:55,00:52:00,inventing the waistcoat. Political distractions.
00:52:00,00:52:08,Peeps wrote that the king banned pinking and the waistcoats because he said that it made his
00:52:08,00:52:15,people in his court look like magpies. Pinking is where you get some cloth and you make like
00:52:15,00:52:20,"tiny holes in it to make a pattern. It's very fashionable at the time, but the king banned it."
00:52:20,00:52:22,It's probably bad for your insulation as well.
00:52:22,00:52:23,Having small holes.
00:52:23,00:52:26,"All over your clothes. It probably doesn't do you, you know."
00:52:26,00:52:30,"Well, weirdly, if you wear like a string vest, that's just holes. But actually,"
00:52:30,00:52:33,it's supposed to be very warm because it traps the air.
00:52:33,00:52:36,"I mean, if it was just holes, it would be nothing, wouldn't it?"
00:52:36,00:52:39,"That's emperor's new string vest, but it's mostly holes."
00:52:39,00:52:42,"It's definitely mostly holes. No, I get that. I've never worn a string vest."
00:52:42,00:52:43,You've amazed me.
00:52:43,00:52:44,I can't believe it.
00:52:44,00:52:50,I can only imagine you on your Christmas holidays going down to Margate Beach with a
00:52:50,00:52:51,handkerchief around your head.
00:52:51,00:52:54,I go home. I climb off into the computer tower.
00:52:54,00:52:57,I take my clothes and get my string vest on.
00:52:57,00:53:00,"Weirdly, even though women were uncovering their boobies,"
00:53:00,00:53:03,they were covering their faces at this time.
00:53:03,00:53:09,"This went in and out of fashion throughout the 1600s and 1700s, masks."
00:53:09,00:53:12,But masks that cover your whole face.
00:53:12,00:53:15,And they'd often have a little bead sewn into the way your mouth was.
00:53:15,00:53:18,So the way you held them on was by keeping this...
00:53:18,00:53:20,You bit them on.
00:53:20,00:53:25,"You bit them on, which added, apparently, an extra air of mystery because you couldn't speak."
00:53:25,00:53:26,So you were a mute.
00:53:26,00:53:27,"You should go, ""Hello."""
00:53:27,00:53:30,That was a very sexy way of speaking in those days.
00:53:30,00:53:35,"It's a little weird that they were called ""vizards."""
00:53:35,00:53:40,"Was it to stop the sunshine from like, as I would have seen that in modern day,"
00:53:40,00:53:42,"sometimes people would wear like balaclavas, would they?"
00:53:42,00:53:45,"Stops the great plague, which was probably knocking about a bit."
00:53:45,00:53:46,Many people wearing balaclava.
00:53:46,00:53:48,Are you sure you haven't been robbed a number of times?
00:53:48,00:53:51,He's just trying to avoid getting burned.
00:53:51,00:53:53,I think you see it in some countries.
00:53:53,00:53:54,They'll wear like...
00:53:54,00:53:54,I've seen that.
00:53:54,00:53:56,Like colorful balaclavas.
00:53:56,00:53:56,Yeah.
00:53:56,00:53:58,I don't think more veils than balaclava.
00:53:58,00:54:01,"I think like, you know, like Pussy Riot War, those things."
00:54:01,00:54:02,"Oh, yeah."
00:54:02,00:54:03,I think I've seen them.
00:54:03,00:54:04,I might be wrong.
00:54:04,00:54:07,"Well, it was for sun protection a lot of the time and initially,"
00:54:07,00:54:10,but then it became a fashion which was unrelated to sun protection.
00:54:10,00:54:16,"And it was to have this air of virtue or high quality, high breeding."
00:54:16,00:54:18,But would you have your boobs out at the same time?
00:54:18,00:54:19,"Oh, yeah, yeah, naked from the neck down."
00:54:19,00:54:20,But you're unrecognizable.
00:54:20,00:54:21,No.
00:54:21,00:54:23,"Well, no, but you might, you might do, you know,"
00:54:23,00:54:25,because most people are recognizable by their faces and not by their boobs.
00:54:25,00:54:26,Yeah.
00:54:26,00:54:28,And you're not going to admit to being the man who recognizes the woman
00:54:28,00:54:29,"just by her boobs, are you?"
00:54:29,00:54:29,No.
00:54:29,00:54:31,Not when you've gone to the theatre with your wife.
00:54:31,00:54:33,Sally over there.
00:54:33,00:54:35,What is that story?
00:54:35,00:54:37,I'm going to really butcher it.
00:54:37,00:54:37,"Can you tell it, Andy?"
00:54:37,00:54:38,It's really good.
00:54:38,00:54:39,It's the...
00:54:39,00:54:39,It's in Oxford.
00:54:39,00:54:41,It's a men-only area in Oxford.
00:54:41,00:54:46,"It's a bit of the river, a swimming area called Parsons Pleasure, I think,"
00:54:46,00:54:50,"where only male dons or maybe undergraduates would swim, but they would swim naked."
00:54:50,00:54:53,"And one day, there were three dons there and some ladies happened by."
00:54:53,00:54:57,They were surprised and the dons were all naked.
00:54:57,00:54:59,"And two, they're all very embarrassed."
00:54:59,00:55:02,"And quickly, you know, two of the dons grabbed their, I don't know, flannel or whatever,"
00:55:02,00:55:04,and covered their genitals.
00:55:04,00:55:07,"And the third don, very calmly, doesn't cover his genitals, he covers his face."
00:55:07,00:55:10,"And they say, ""What have you done that for all, Charles?"""
00:55:10,00:55:11,If it's the name of Charles.
00:55:11,00:55:15,"And he says, ""Well, I'm not recognizable by my genitals."""
00:55:15,00:55:19,"So, unfortunately, they all heard of being called Charles."
00:55:19,00:55:28,"Okay, that's it."
00:55:28,00:55:29,That is all of our facts.
00:55:29,00:55:31,Thank you so much for listening.
