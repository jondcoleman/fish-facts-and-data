00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.160
 QI offices in Hobern. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.800
 Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.880
 four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.160
 number one and that is James. Okay my fact this week is that everyone in the French town of Evian

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:50.080
 is allowed unlimited free Evian. Are they allowed it from like do they have to go up and put their

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.720
 mouth to the spring? Well I don't know how it comes out. They just come through the taps right?

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:04.240
 No no, Andy's closest but he is wrong. So this is the town of Evian de Ban on the banks of the

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:12.640
 Lake Geneva and it's in France and they have this special spring of water and this is where we get

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.280
 the Evian today but the people of the town can go to the spring, it has a special sort of spout

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.440
 and you can go and get unlimited Evian from there. You don't have to go with your mouth

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.760
 on the spout when I went there. Because that ruins the spout for everyone. It ruins the entire

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.120
 company's operations actually, millions of people. Yeah absolutely so I went there recently on my

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.640
 holidays because you guys have had some guests on the last few weeks. I was going from a ski resort

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.080
 to Geneva where our flight was going from and saw that Evian was, I won't say on the way,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.960
 we had to take quite a long diversion but I said to my wife why don't we go to this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.360
 place Evian because it's kind of an interesting place that I've heard of. Baby was sick but

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.680
 it was fine. Drank some bad water or something. But we went there and I drank some of the Evian

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.720
 water with my cupped hand so I allowed it to go into my cupped hand and I drank it but just as

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.680
 we're leaving actually there was a guy who turned up in his car opened his boot and he must have had

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.440
 about 50 glass bottles where he went to the spring and he filled up all of his bottles so he had as

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.600
 much Evian as he could drink and that apparently is a common thing that the people of Evian do.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.680
 You're so lucky, you're so lucky that you got there before him rather than just oh yeah. Mate I'm

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.440
 just trying to fill up my two cupped hands. No sorry I've only got 47 bottles to go. What I'm

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.720
 imagining is like a municipal water, not a water cooler, you know a thing like in a school gym

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.120
 where you put your mouth to it. Yeah it's not quite like that. Press the button and it squirts up a

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.720
 bit but not very much. No it's not that, it's something where it is always flowing out. Nice.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.520
 So it is kind of a mosaic of a nice sort of like flowers and stuff like that and then there's a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.760
 little bowl underneath made of stone and the water just keeps going into the bowl and then drains away

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.800
 presumably to the every other factory where it goes into your bottles. No I don't know that.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.840
 If you're a rival company could you just go and bottle your own? Brilliant idea, brilliant.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.880
 You could but I imagine it's probably not efficient. Probably the cost is not the water,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.280
 it's the bottling factory. If your Buxton Springs say and your entire factory is in

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.280
 Buxton in Derbyshire, probably it's not worth it to drive all the way down to Geneva.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.280
 Free water, I mean you could just get it out of the tap if you were trying to get more like water.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.880
 Which some bottle companies did, didn't you? Yes, Dasani I think famously did that. Dasani which

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.600
 was coke-owned and it just turned out to be tap water that they sort of run that water under the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.080
 tap. I didn't know how they'd done it but they basically like it was tap. I think that's a slightly

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.800
 misleading but if it was what it still is now which is that it's tap water as is more than two

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.720
 thirds of bottled water in America and lots of it here basically it's filtered tap water so they've

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.360
 taken tap water filtered it but the great thing about these big soft drinks companies is they're

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.080
 already filtering the water to put in their Fanta and their Coke or whatever so they've got this

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.760
 big water filtration system set up all they need to do is turn the tap on a bit more

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.360
 so yeah that is yeah but what did they drink then in Avian through the tap? Is it the same

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.200
 source of water coming through? What a good question so no because they will have and I don't

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.160
 know for sure but they must have reservoirs where the water comes from because this is just a small

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.320
 spring and certainly wouldn't be enough to fill what is a an average size French town. Yeah right

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.840
 okay. I heard though that they only take about 10% of the Avian water to turn into Avian from this

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.720
 spring and it filters down through the rock and then it takes about 15 years and it goes into

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.680
 an underground aquifer and then once the aquifer is full the water gets forced up back up to the

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.320
 surface and then it emerges at that spring and that whole thing takes 15 years to do I believe.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.080
 That's what they say on the website 15 years is that number? That's what I got it from yeah.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.200
 Why would they lie about that? It's actually 19 years but it's such a round number. There is an

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.640
 interesting thing on the website which talks about the history I don't know if you saw this

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:06.640
 they said that 1789 was a very important year in Avian water history and seeing as they were in

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.720
 France it feels like 1789 probably was quite an important year. I thought that. Pretty much for

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.800
 everyone because actually their water sauce was discovered by a French nobleman. Right. Do you

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.280
 feel like probably had other things on his mind? I was the last thing he ever did wasn't it? I have

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.880
 looked for the Marquis de Lesser who I'm sure was not top of the list when the revolution came

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.840
 but I searched for his I searched his name there's no other he doesn't crop up anywhere else. No he

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.800
 does that I think there is some suggestion that a bit of this origin story might not be 100 true

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.200
 but it is certainly it was it was on this guy's land in Avian and supposedly this nobleman had

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.000
 kidney stones or something drank some of this water and his kidney stones disappeared and he

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.960
 was like this is great stuff and then the guy who owned the land started to sell the water. Yeah if

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.720
 it was a perfect origin story like the ones they always make up it would be he was out for a walk

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.840
 on date he fell over some of the water fell into his mouth and then he fell his kidney stones carrying

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.120
 up so weird. Yeah. Bottle of water the idea comes from the fact that it was good for your health

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.200
 doesn't it it was a medicine for ages and that's the reason we drink it today really is because of

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.720
 all these bar places or bath places like Bath or Lemmington or Buxton and in the 19th century in

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.240
 Jane Austen. Bath is named after Bath is that like having a bath it would be so weird because I'm

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.400
 just going to go and have a quick Lemmington. Have you given the baby his Lemmington tonight?

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.640
 Although we should make clear for the email writers that we do know that Bards are not named after

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.600
 the place Bath. I didn't know that and I don't mind getting an email about it. I'm pleased I'm so

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.560
 one now. Are they not? That's a good way round. It's going to be the other way round isn't it?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:56.720
 What? You just you work on that log in for a moment. No, no it could have been where someone had the

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:04.400
 first bath. It could have been. It's like a Roman walking by tripped down into the hot water. Loved it.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.560
 A loofa lunged on his head and a duck floated by and he squeezed it and I went 'wack'.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:19.200
 This is amazing. Anyway the way that bottling began actually was people used to go somewhere

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.520
 like Bath and they take the waters for their health like in Jane Austen. You drink the waters,

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.560
 you bathe in the waters, you'd get rid of your whatever poolsy you had or spots or whatever.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.680
 But some people were too busy or too poor to be able to afford this constant water treatments

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:40.320
 and traveling to these spa towns so they subscribed instead much like you might subscribe to, I don't

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:47.600
 know, Hello Fresh or... Right, we're off the clock Anna. You don't have to do this. They subscribe

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.600
 to water deliveries which will be bottled up and sent to them for their health. And those are the

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.040
 original bottles. That's original bottle water. That's very cool. So it was a kind of spa destination

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.520
 Evian as well and this was before they were bottling it. This is 1806. They had a thermal

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.720
 spa that opened. The bottling happened in 1826. But you would think then that as a result this is

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.760
 just like you'd go there it'd be this majestical like kind of mindfulness place and really nice.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.200
 But we have an account of what it was like from someone traveling through there

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:21.680
 in the 1810s roughly and that was Percy Shelley and Mary Shelley. He said the appearance of the

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.840
 inhabitants is more wretched, diseased and poor than I ever recollect to have seen. It's not a great

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.760
 trip advisor review there. Not a good advert for the health keeping losses. It does appear in

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.760
 Frankenstein as well by the way, Evian. He goes on his honeymoon there I think. That's right,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.320
 yeah. Wait, Dr Frankenstein? Yeah, yeah. Really? He goes to Evian. Yeah, so it yeah,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.720
 Mary Shelley literally puts the town into the book. Phil Collins has a house on the banks of Lake

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:51.360
 Geneva. Get out. Does he? What? Is that surprising? I just I'm happy I know it. Okay. I just looked up

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.120
 people who live near Lake Geneva. It's quite posh isn't it that area? It's got my stuff there.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.440
 Yeah, it became posh after they found the water really. They built massive hotels there and a

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.720
 casino. The casino is interesting because after World War II and Hitler killed himself, there were

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.200
 rumours that Hitler was still alive and there was a rumour that he was working as a croupier in

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.760
 Evian in the big casino. Oh really? Yeah, yeah. Oh wow. The people went down there trying to find

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.720
 Hitler and they were like, oh no, it's just a guy who looks like Hitler. Wow. How long are you there

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:25.600
 Phil, by the way? We just like just until the baby got started crying. So about 45 minutes. Okay,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.520
 so just to just to have it. Yeah, we just we needed somewhere to go for lunch. So yeah,

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.000
 just went there. Not long enough to find Hitler. No, Hitler. No, we didn't see him. Are you guys

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.640
 a fan of Evian? Drink it at home? Yeah, I drink Evian. Do you? Yeah, yeah. Anyone else in your

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.040
 household drink Evian? Yeah, everyone in my house drinks Evian, yeah. Who are the members of your

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:52.160
 household again? It's myself and my wife and my daughter. Yeah, yeah. Anyone else? Well, no, humans.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:59.120
 Look, we've got to come out and say this. For the record, James has got a cat and sometimes

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.720
 his cat drinks Evian. And when we say sometimes, only when she's thirsty every single day,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:11.360
 James gives his cat Evian. I have to say before we started, these guys already knew this and I do

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.720
 think of all the things in my life, this is the only thing that really can spoil my man of the

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:23.200
 people. This is your meow two moment as of it. Brilliant. And I kind of want you to keep hold

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.320
 of it because isn't it because of your fault? It's Anna's fault. And just dear listener, this is

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:34.080
 what happened. Anna told me that cats have special taste buds on their tongues that can taste water.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.640
 And so for us, water doesn't taste of anything. But for cats, it's really important and they can

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.960
 taste the difference. And London water is disgusting. True. And we happen to have quite a lot of

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:51.200
 Evian in the house because I'd stop how the load for COVID. And I just started giving it to my cat

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.840
 and she liked it. And she still likes it. Since you left Bolton, James. I think the listeners

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.320
 would appreciate that we live and we die and our cats live and die by our facts. And that's fair

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.280
 enough. And it's true cats can taste water. They were as we can't. But then there's this big question

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.480
 over given the water taste of nothing, how do we know we're drinking water and not some poisonous

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.200
 substance all the time? Well, you can't. That's interesting. It doesn't taste because it's but

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.440
 there are some tasteless things like arsenic doesn't taste of anything. Does it? But you can't

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.640
 like if I if I give you a pint of arsenic, you wouldn't necessarily know it was not water. No,

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.640
 that's true. But I would just think the odds are you struggle to get hold of a pint of arsenic. You'd

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:38.800
 have to read. I have to really annoyed you and keep going. He's a resourceful man. No, I just sort

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.080
 of think it's probably it's probably going to be water. And I've been right every time so far. I

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.880
 don't like to brag. You only have to be wrong once. No, that's true. I'll keep spinning that. But

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.880
 there's there is a reason you haven't been wrong, which is that you can tell that it's water. And

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.360
 they've only just found this. And it's that it doesn't taste sour, but it registers on our sour

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.840
 taste buds. And it's related to a fact that a guest shared actually, one of those other guests we

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.520
 had in when we kicked James off the show, I think basically when you drink water, it washes away

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:09.680
 your saliva. And then our mouths in the process of replacing saliva produce protons. And Steve

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:16.160
 Mould when he came on, his fact was protons taste sour. Oh, yeah. So it triggers our sour taste buds.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.120
 It is mad how much bottled water we drink now. I had no idea how much people are drinking bottled

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.600
 water. And I don't get it. So obviously, in developing countries, it's really important

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.880
 because you can't get in a lot of countries, you can't get clean tap water, tasty water in

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:40.560
 London, of course, delicious water in London. Same same problem. But it's not helping you're

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.960
 fast tracking to cancellation. It's not developing countries that are consuming it all. So in

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:51.600
 Singapore, how many liters do you reckon per person per annum per annum? Oh, my God. I mean,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.080
 half liter a day, a liter a day, 300 liters, 300 liters per person per annum of tap water.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.920
 1,129 liters per person. 3 liters of water a day. Bottled and bottled.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.560
 3 liters of bottled water per person per day. That's insane. There's going to be some outliers,

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.960
 aren't there? There's going to be some people who don't have any of that.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:14.160
 Yeah. Australia is a second worst offender. Australians are drinking 504 liters of bottled

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.280
 water a person a year. Get out. Isn't that insane? It's bananas. It's really hot. The water's good.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.360
 Yeah, but the water's good. The tap water's fine. There's a lot of cats in Australia just to say.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.360
 We're by the beach. You can't drink the salt water. You need to have a good old... No one is

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.960
 proposing you drink salt water. There is such a gap in your logic between the bottle of water and

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.840
 the sea. No, the logic is you're down by the sea for a lot of the day where you cannot get

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:45.040
 access to tap water. Fill up a bottle and take it down. Oh, yeah. I do think that argument has

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.400
 persuaded me not that it's right, but that's probably why it is. It's convenient, isn't it?

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.240
 People are out. They've forgotten their bottle. Exactly. Remember your bottle of Australians.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.000
 Is everyone at the beach always in Australia? I know that's the myth that we read, but I don't

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 believe they all do live next to the beach, though, don't they? I mean, no one lives in the middle.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:08.720
 Well, you'd also need bottled water. I found a thing about water pipes. This was because I was

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.840
 looking up tap water and how it works and what the pipes are like. Anyway, this is from a website

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:20.240
 called Best Life Online. Oh, yeah. And the headline is eight surprising places you're letting snakes

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.800
 into your home. I'd be surprised living in central London if they're getting it anywhere.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.560
 Yeah. And actually, the terrible thing about this article was I wasn't especially surprised by any

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:36.080
 of the places. Well, toilet. They come up through your toilet. Toilet, water pipes, window, plumbing

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.720
 gaps. Didn't have window. Cat door. No, that's good. That's much. I would be a bit surprised

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.320
 by that because you're expecting the cat, aren't you? Showers, cracks in the foundation,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.160
 basement access points. And the only one I find mildly surprising, shoes you might have left

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.640
 outside. Yeah, that makes sense. Come home, take off your shoes outside. What would be a surprising

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:00.560
 entry, though? Out of your computer tower. Like just spiraling out of the computer. I just do

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.040
 my work on my computer and my office in my house. Do you come all the way to your computer

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.240
 tower? This is where I'm out of touch. I have a tower and medieval fortification that I do

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.680
 in my computer work. It's annoying because you can't get Wi-Fi in there, but you still go over

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.920
 there. You can get a bit if you stand there, one of the arrow slits. You can get a tiny bit, but it's not much.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:32.560
 Okay, it is time for fact number two. That is Anna. My fact this week is that there's a mangrove

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:42.560
 forest in Indonesia that's actually a womangrove. Riddle roundabout. Yeah, it's not really a fact

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.760
 that you can tell your friends is it without me explaining it a bit further. But it's really

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:54.560
 cool. So this is in Papua and it's a forest called Hutan Per Empuan. And it's a forest where only

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.880
 women are allowed to go. The oldest women who go there say it's been happening for as long as

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:06.080
 they can remember and their grandmothers did it. And mangroves are basically forests that are underwater

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:13.920
 partly. So no, no, sorry. It's a bad description. I'm backtrack. Mangroves are trees. The mangrove,

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.920
 there are about a few dozen species of mangrove tree and they're the only trees which can grow

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.240
 in saltwater. They're amazing things for all sorts of reasons. You tend to get them in brackish

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.960
 areas where it's like right on the coast. So it's where the saltwater hits the freshwater. All along

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.840
 the shoreline. And it's basically they exist between high and low tide. So they spend a lot of

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.400
 their life in water and a lot of their life out of water. And it's very swampy and gross in a

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.520
 mangrove. But these swampy, it's gross if you don't like swampy, but these women like it.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.720
 Because they get to gossip, essentially. So these are specifically people from the

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:52.800
 Engros and Tobati tribes on the Indonesian side of Papua Island. And they weighed in,

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.320
 they collect these shellfish from the mud, they sell them at market, you have to go in naked,

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.720
 which is kind of the reason why men aren't allowed. Because then they see the ladies naked.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:07.760
 And they essentially use it as a way to swap stories, do some female bonding, bitch about the

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.800
 men, pass down a lot of ancient wisdom. It's just a really great women only thing.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.600
 It's like gossiping, slagging off the men, occasionally a bit of ancient wisdom.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:24.480
 I like those because I subscribe to one of those gossip magazines. But then on the last page,

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.680
 there's always a little bit of ancient wisdom. But they also, they're encouraged to just yell

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.880
 out whatever their inner voices. So just random statements that no one will understand. You get

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:40.560
 it out. You do that. That's fine. That's clever. The inner voice yell. I read that men are allowed

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.560
 in the forest, but only when there are no women there. Is that right? That is correct. So there are

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.240
 times that men are allowed in to collect wood, but they've got to make sure that there are no ladies

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.880
 in there. Question. It feels to me like it would be quite hard to work out when there are no ladies

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:58.640
 in a forest. Forest is big. Is there like one of those in-out stickers or labels where you just

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.800
 slide it over? No, you just got to listen to the gossiping that's going on, which is basically

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.960
 what they say. That's so they can just talk and talk. So if you can't hear any ladies,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.880
 they're probably not there because they use it as their time literally to just have great chat.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.720
 Is anyone gossiping or quoting Marcus Aurelius? No. And if you do enter as a man when you're not

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.720
 allowed to, you are taken to Tribal Court and you have to pay a fine in polished stones.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:28.800
 Yeah. Wow. So they take their Kohl Kohl, it's called. It's like their boat. They have a sort of

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.560
 group of them that go out with a singular boat and they make a pack not to leave each other.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:38.640
 And then they go clam hunting, fish hunting as well. And big problems in modern day mangrove,

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:44.720
 womangrove situations is the fact that people like Evian bottles are getting into their

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.280
 areas. It's full of plastic now. And so the clams have gone, wait, sorry to knock Evian.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:55.600
 I do. I recycle my Evian bottles that the cat drinks. I don't go all the way to

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:02.880
 Papua New Guinea to throw them away. But there's a big problem now. It's really affecting them.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.560
 Mangroves are so great. And it's quite sad researching them because you read about all

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.520
 the threats of them predominantly from climate change and habitat loss, habitat destruction.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.400
 If people are using a strip of coastline for things like shrimp farming, which is a big industry

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.240
 in lots of these countries, then it just sort of tear up the mangroves basically. But they are

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:25.040
 incredible. They're among the only few plants which can tolerate saltwater out of 400,000

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.680
 species of plant in the world. 1,500 can tolerate saltwater. Mangroves are among them.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:36.240
 They live for a really long time. It's so alien when I hear it, like just all the things that they

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.560
 can do that other trees can't do. So yeah, they filter out 90% of the salt that comes in. But

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.040
 the ones that don't do that, they've got these special leaves. I mean, the leaves are like waxy

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:50.000
 substances where they leak out the salt. They can also sweat out crystallized salt on their leaves.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.120
 They're so cool. But then there's other ones where they will basically send the salt to the old

00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:00.320
 leaves in the old bark. So it's not touching the new bit of the tree. That's so intelligent. I'm using

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:07.360
 the word intelligent. I'm using the word quite wrongly. It seems like if you look around the

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:14.240
 world that lots of groups of women are in mangrove forests working, it seems. In Mexico, they have

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:21.440
 las chelameras, who are male and women who work in a certain area of mangroves, protecting the

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:29.600
 ecosystem. In Kenya, you have the mangrove mothers who work on Pate Island. Pate Island? Is that you

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:36.160
 live big footprints in Pate Island, don't you? It might be Pate Island, but I prefer Pate Island,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:43.840
 don't you? And in India, in Maharashtra, you have a collective of women who kind of work in the mangroves.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.400
 They do safaris, but they also help protect the forest. So it just seems like everywhere you look

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.560
 around the world, wherever there's mangroves, there seems to be women working there. We need to rename

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:59.520
 them. Sounds like they need a rebrand. Yeah, they mop up tsunamis. Yeah, just incredible. They absorb

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.320
 the energy of incoming waves when they're coastal. So the wave can lose two-thirds of its energy,

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.320
 right? Yeah, you know, and that's really, really useful. There was a study in China which found

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:13.600
 they reduced floodwater level in a tropical storm by about three meters, which is very useful.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.000
 Annoying if you're a surfer, don't surf in a mangrove. You'll see a brilliant wave coming at you,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.360
 it would have disappeared by the time you hit it. Very few of the Beach Boys' big hits are about

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:28.160
 mangroves. But the other nice thing they do is they store huge amounts of carbon because

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.240
 they build up these big peat deposits beneath them. Some of them are up to six meters deep.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:38.800
 And they did a study in 2001, so quite a while ago, but they found that the loss of mangroves

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:45.280
 is 35%, which is worse than tropical forests or coral reefs. Oh, really? Don't look at that fact at all.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.960
 The world's biggest bacterium ever was found in a mangrove forest. Oh, yeah, we've mentioned him.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.880
 Yeah, yeah. I hope it wasn't her. Otherwise, that bacterium would have been arrested and forced

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:04.720
 to hand in polished rocks. Can I say, if you eat mangrove, it contains asparagusic acid,

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:10.640
 which is the stuff that makes your urine smell after eating asparagus. Does it make your

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:18.000
 wee smell the same as asparagus? No, the same. Asparagus acid also kills parasitic nematodes,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.880
 which is why it's evolved into these two places. So it protects the asparagus plant and the mangroves

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:29.520
 against these nematode worms. That's good. Interesting thing about that. They need wee mangroves.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:35.120
 They rely on fish wee. It turned out because part of the way they survive is through consuming lots

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.320
 of nitrogen. They make great use of nitrogen and that is produced by fish wee and they did

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.360
 a study of a mangrove forest in the Bahamas and they found that there were just two species of fish,

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.840
 two types of snapper that doubled the amount of nitrogen in the water and made it possible to

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:55.760
 survive. Wow. Hey, here's a little mini quiz. Yeah. Which of these is not a nickname for mangroves?

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:02.000
 Okay. Walking trees, dead man's fingers, the kidneys of the coast.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.760
 Well, you would think kidneys of the coast because they effectively are doing what kidneys do,

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.080
 which is filtering stuff. So I'm going to say it's definitely not that. That's not the nickname.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.160
 It's not the nickname. No, that is the name. That is the name. Because your question is,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:21.520
 which is not the nickname. Yeah. Oh, right, you're doing the thought. Yeah. Double negative. I'm

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.240
 going to say they look like they walk because their roots are so huge and they come out of the

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.120
 ground. I've actually always found them really creepy because they look like giant spiders,

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.360
 don't they? Fields of spiders. So I think they're probably called walking trees. Is that what you

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.880
 said? Well, I think that bananas are walking trees. Yeah. Like bananas walk as in they move.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:46.960
 Bananas. I saw it from in pajamas. No, banana trees. Yeah, banana trees. They move. Yeah.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:52.080
 As in they'll propagate another banana tree maybe a few meters away from them. And if you

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.880
 go back two years later, it looks like the trees moved. Yeah. I think this was like one of the

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.400
 famous moments on QI where Sean Locke said the trees they walk and Stephen was like, no,

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.080
 they don't. And then it came through. Well, we were literally on the computers going,

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.600
 yes, they do, Stephen. Yes, they do, Stephen. Stephen, this is Andy coming to you from my

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:17.120
 computer tower. I can confirm. I'm going to say that I think you kind of danced around the idea

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.800
 of the dead man fingers when you said spiders. It looks like dead man fingers are coming out

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.480
 with these big balls. So I say yes to that, yes to that. And I think you're tricking us. I think

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:30.720
 all three are. Dan's got it. They're all nicknames for that. Walking trees. You couldn't be asked

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:36.080
 to come up with a fourth fake nickname. Dead Man's Fingers. I'll come up with another one now.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.200
 Stop staring at me. I'll spare you. Only time. You can do it later and edit it in.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.840
 Yeah, yeah. Salty Creepy Boys. Oh, okay. Now, that's a difficult one.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:55.440
 Can I quickly talk about a place where women are not allowed? Yeah, the Yorkie Factory.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:05.520
 And he knows his reference for British listeners. This is Mount Athos in Greece,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:12.560
 which was known as the place of 6,000 beards. Because there were monasteries on there and

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.680
 monks were allowed, but women were not allowed in there. And they had a law called the Avaton,

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:23.440
 which prohibited women from entering. And the idea is that the monastery started when the Virgin

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:29.440
 Mary was sailing across the coast or something, and it stopped at this place. And the voice of God

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.360
 said, let no other woman come here because the Virgin Mary's been here and no other women are

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:40.800
 allowed. So we're going to put a stop to that. We didn't like her at all. So even when the British

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:46.160
 Royal Family went, Prince Philip was allowed on the island and the Queen, Queen Elizabeth II wasn't.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:53.280
 Helena of Bulgaria, she in the 14th century had the plague, and she was brought there to try and

00:25:53.280 --> 00:26:00.480
 help her. But she was carried so that her feet never touched the ground. I know. And there was a

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:07.120
 brilliant writer, a French writer called Marie Choisie. And she had written a book called

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.880
 "Un noir chez le feel", which was a month with the girls where she was in a brothel. And then she

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:18.800
 wrote a second book called "Un noir chez les hommes", which was a month with the men, which was about

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:26.880
 going to this place. And she had a double radial mastectomy. That's commitment. I know. And wore

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:33.840
 a false mustache. And she posed as a man and went to this place. And she spoke to all the monks and

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.720
 stuff and asked them what was going on. And she asked one monk, she said, what's this deal like?

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:45.200
 Is it true that you're not even allowed female animals in this place? And the monk said, we must

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.240
 draw the line somewhere. The day we possessed a hen, some brothers would argue that we should also

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:57.120
 accept a she-cat, a you, or even a she-ass. And there is but a short step from a she-ass to a woman.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.000
 What do you mean a you? Not me? I'm not one.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:08.160
 But yeah, isn't that amazing? I never heard of this, Marie Choisie.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:13.200
 She swasied pretty weirdly, I would say, having both your breasts locked off.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.400
 Just to go on this journalistic expedition?

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:22.560
 Yeah, she was like a feminist reporter of a crazy sort of Louis Theroux of her time.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.760
 Yeah, but you won't see Louis chopping his dick off to get into this mangrove, will you?

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.840
 Like that is... I don't know, Louis, if you're listening.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.680
 I'm in a ladies mangrove in Luffa.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:37.920
 Hi, I'm Louis. I'm from the BBC. You okay?

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.040
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:55.760
 My fact is that until the early 20th century, Swiss people were routinely being injured by the last ice age.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:03.680
 The film? That's right. I hated it. Just a squirrel with a nut. I don't know, I haven't seen it.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:09.280
 Is that what happens? I'm just about, yeah, Theroux is not under the ice, can't find it.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.400
 Very long quest. Really? All four movies?

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.640
 Yeah, yeah. That's padding. I hasn't found it yet.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:21.760
 Look, let's press on. This is a fact. It came from a list of facts. Every year, there's a

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.280
 guy called Tom Whitwell who does a list of 52 things he learned. Oh yeah.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.440
 I've mentioned one of his facts before. Years ago, yeah.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.680
 I have to limit myself because it's such a great list of facts.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.360
 But he mentioned this fact, which came from a brilliant London Review of Books article

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.080
 by Jonah Goodman, and it's all about Swiss people who, until the early 20th century,

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:46.320
 loads of them had goiters, right? And that is a bulge of flesh that comes out of the front of

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.960
 your neck. And they can be really big. They can really limit your life if you have one.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.840
 They make you wheeze, they weigh on your windpipe. They're really unpleasant to have,

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:59.440
 you know, and they're harmful. And everyone in Switzerland had them.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.960
 Not everyone, but a lot of people had them. 80% of the country.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.680
 It was crazy. And it was only on the sort of Swiss alpine plateau. We're quite

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.840
 no like Geneva actually for this fact as well. And there were dozens of theories doing the rounds.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.400
 Is it the landscape, the air, the high altitude sunlight? Is it the incest? Someone said.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:21.760
 Is it moral failure? Incest is probably a category of that. Anyway, like all these

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.160
 theories are doing rounds. And basically, it turned out it was thanks to the last Ice Age,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:31.360
 because during the last Ice Age, Switzerland, very high up, was covered by an ice sheet that

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:36.000
 was about a thousand meters thick, and it melted and then refroze loads and loads of times, right?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.800
 And it just absolutely ripped off the top 250 meters of rock and soil

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.760
 from the Swiss plateau. And wherever the ice sheet was, the soil was stripped of a chemical,

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.240
 which was iodine. And the lack of iodine is what causes goiters.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.320
 And everyone was like, thank God it wasn't the incest.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:30:02.640
 Keep going, hon. Oh dear. And it was lack of iodine? And it just did a complete

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.960
 number on half the population of Switzerland for centuries. It was extraordinary.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.000
 I can't believe I've never heard of this. Had you guys heard of this before? No.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.920
 It's astonishing, because this isn't like the 1700s. This is up until the 1920s,

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:22.880
 that 30% of military personnel in Switzerland had giant... When we talk about fashion, as we're

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.560
 going to do in the next fact, you do stuff to... Yeah, I know. We rarely throw forward.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.920
 But clothing was designed largely for them to hide these giant throbbing lumps on their necks,

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.000
 which is... Yeah, and you can see photos. Can I do something a bit more

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.400
 classic and throw back to the last fact? Yeah, good. Yes, better. Safe ground.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.520
 They used to have these things in the mangroves, the biggest mangrove in the world,

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.840
 which is on the border of India and Bangladesh, I think. And they would also have these big

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:59.120
 sort of collars, which covered your entire neck. But it wasn't to stop you from being able to see

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.600
 your goiter. Can you guess what it was for? Vampires? Anti-vampire device? Close. Get away.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:11.040
 Yeah, very close. I think it's something more real. Werewolf. No. It's not that close. A spider.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:17.760
 Oh, spider. No, it's because tigers live there. And people working in the mangroves,

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.120
 they would be caught by tigers. I don't know if a little ruff-ruff...

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:27.520
 They were quite solid collars, but they would stop the tigers from being able to bite you.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.520
 Grab you by the scruff of the neck. Yeah, sorry. Anyway, we were talking about goiters.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:37.360
 And I find it incredible that the ice age was this specific, just affected this one's place so

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.240
 specifically. Everyone else was kind of okay, but it stripped away the iodine. I mean, I think maybe

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.960
 it was moral failing, because that's just a very targeted approach. No, no, it's good to

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.520
 relitigate these things and test the theory. But it was quite hard for them to know exactly how

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.280
 many people had it because everyone was hiding it, people were embarrassed by it. So the census,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.120
 if they did any kind of surveying, wouldn't really truly show it. So when conscription

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.440
 was happening for the armies, you had to have your medical and there was no way of hiding it.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:10.160
 So in 1921, nearly 30% of 19 year old conscripts had a goiter on their neck.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.080
 If you buy one of those Swiss army knives, there is a special goiter implement.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.880
 People always say it's for taking stones out of horseshoes, but actually it's for popping the

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:26.400
 goiter. There was Mark Twain when he visited in 1880. I bet he had something typically kind

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.760
 and understanding to say about it. Wow. Maybe your views on Twain clear? I don't like him.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:37.600
 He said, I, this isn't going to end you to him actually. He wrote, "I have seen the principal

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:42.560
 features of Swiss scenery, Mont Blanc and the goiter." Lovely. Thank you, Mark. Another

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.760
 very human and wise observation. Sorry, I just don't like Mark Twain. Anyway, let's move on.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.840
 Wow. It's because he was incredibly rude about Jane Austen once. Oh my God.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.080
 He was famously, no, no, he famously wrote, "Oh, I'd like to dig her up and beat her over

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.440
 the head with her own shin bone." And I just think, "Give me a break. Give me a break, Mark."

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.520
 Yeah. Next time you write something as good as Emma, you can have a pop at big dog Jane.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.080
 But you never did. And you never will because you're dead. Anyway, sorry.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:13.440
 Okay. So it affected not just goiters. So there was this other medical condition called,

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.440
 it was known at the time as cretinism, right? Where people had very serious

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.920
 developmental problems. They grew much shorter than normal. Their features didn't grow properly.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.080
 A lot of them were deaf and mute. And there was a Swiss goiter commission. There were schools

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:30.400
 across the country for deaf, mute children. As in it really wasn't like a national health

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:35.440
 disaster. That's why I mean that company we haven't heard of this. Exactly. The word cretin comes

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:40.720
 from the French Alps because of this. Right. And do you know the origin of the word cretin?

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.360
 I thought it was really interesting because obviously it became an extremely offensive word.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:51.520
 But originally it came from an alpine dialect word because it was so common in the Alps.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:57.440
 It came from an alpine dialect word for Christian cretin. And it was to remind people that these

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:03.280
 people who looked often, you know, so inhuman in a way, a lot of deformities, to remind people

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.240
 that they were still human Christian people who were equally loved by God. We should be very kind

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.960
 to them. That's amazing. It started out as a very humane term. Because Bertrand Russell,

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.000
 he thought that iodine might have been evidence that humans don't have a soul.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.720
 Because what he saw was that when you gave this chemical to people, suddenly they became more

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:31.280
 human as he saw it. Perhaps it's all about chemistry and it's not about the soul and Christianity

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:36.320
 and whatever. Interesting. Yeah, that kind of you can see the kind of where were chemical driven

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.640
 machines when when you throw something new into us and it changes the core. And it's kind of what

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.400
 happened, right? So when the all the theories that we're talking about earlier, moral compasses

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:50.240
 and all that sort of stuff, bad beer, when the original list that was on there, where do you

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:56.000
 wake up in bed with the cousin or sorry, it's the bad beer that caused the incest.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.800
 There was four main players, I believe, when it comes down to how this eventually got solved.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:10.080
 One was called Otto Bayard. And they were pushing this theory that yeah, we need we need more iodine.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.440
 And he actually went to sort of little communities and he upped the iodine

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.280
 in all the things that they were consuming. So he went to the cows and he made sure that

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.960
 it was in the salt that they were licking it was in the that you know, in the milk that they were

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.680
 producing. There was tiny amounts that were being put into the food of this family. And he did it

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.920
 over a term of a school course in the winter and he came back and they had gotten better and suddenly

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.760
 he went Jesus, this is this is what it is. They're missing their iodine. And that's why we

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.160
 have it now that people put iodine in salt, isn't it? Yeah, because people around the world eat

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.880
 salt. Everyone eats a bit of salt. Iodine actually works quite well with salt. So they put it in

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:51.200
 there and that's kind of what did it. This is 88% of salt is now iodine.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:57.520
 Not the UK, weirdly. Really? No, we get our iodine other ways. But I mean, there's it's in a lot of

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:06.880
 milk. Because cows cows are given iodine. And so it happens that way. I believe the

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:12.640
 vast majority is not usually isn't. Yeah, like sea salt and rock salt are not because they're made

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.960
 differently. But even table salt in the UK is not standardly iodized. The doctor who found it was

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:21.920
 called Heinrich Hunziker, great name. And it was because it all goes through your thyroid gland,

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.840
 which is at the front of your neck. And if you don't get enough, it swells up because it's

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:30.000
 desperately trying to find more iodine from your bloodstream. So it swells and swells and swells.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.160
 That's what causes it. And it's like all of it, the brain fog and the muscle ache and the goiters,

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.000
 all of it is due to your body just desperately hunting. But the problem that took them a long

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.320
 time to work out why it was just a little bit of iodine was required is that if you give people

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.120
 too much iodine, at least to catastrophic health consequences in the other direction. So you need

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:53.520
 one 15,000th of one gram of iodine a day. It's very small. And they were trying to give people a

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.880
 gram a day of iodine and they were getting terribly ill and they were saying, "Well, the iodine's a

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.800
 disaster. Look at that." So it took a long time to work out. It is one of those frustrating things.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.920
 It's a little bit like hand washing where people were saying it for over 100 years.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.720
 People kept saying, "Do you know what? I think iodine is the answer to this." And everyone,

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.120
 "No, no, no, don't. It's just going to kill you." And one of the key people,

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.800
 another one of the key people who changed things was a guy called Hans Egenberger.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:21.840
 Sounds like a McDonald's offering. It was actually a very important man.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.640
 Do you want to, well, someone said to him one day, "Do you want salt on your Egenberger?"

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:34.320
 And he realized, take this a moment. Good old Egenberger. He was a very charismatic guy. He was

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.200
 the male. He was in charge of a specific Swiss canton and he realized that iodine, a little bit

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.560
 of iodine was the answer. And so he decided to add to his town cinema. This is in the 1920s. His

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.960
 town cinemas program of light entertainment. So the cinema was showing loads of really fun

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:54.000
 films. He added a lecture on iodized salt in amongst the light entertainment. But for some reason,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.480
 because he was so charismatic and popular, everyone flooded in to watch it. And he put lots

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:04.720
 of jokes in. He did this lecture, lots of tricks and jokes and fun words, like he called it whole

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:10.160
 salt. I don't know, that's not fun, but it was funny at the time. Anyway, straight after everyone

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.560
 went to see this great film of his, there was a petition, I got thousands of signatures and

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:18.880
 iodized salt was introduced. Brilliant. Wow. And then Gandhi hated it, didn't he?

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:24.560
 Gandhi? Did he? What, the iodization of salt? Yeah, he did lots of good stuff, of course, Gandhi.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:32.080
 We have to say, for balance. I mean, the problem was that it was the British who were taxing

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:39.760
 local salt and then kind of replacing it with these iodized salt. And he kind of started anti-salt

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:46.080
 riots. Did he walk to the sea protesting about the salt thing? He did the long walk, yeah.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:50.800
 To try and get proper salt from the sea? I think it was raising awareness. I mean,

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:56.320
 obviously, like the tax thing was real, but the iodized thing was kind of just a side

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.360
 hustle that he thought was colonial. I see. A rare misfire from Gandhi there. I'm not trying to

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.040
 cancel Gandhi, like you're trying to cancel Mark Twain, just to say. No, no, and I'll

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.760
 definitely keep going on the Twain thing. Goitre used to be nicknamed "Darbyshire Neck"

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.800
 in the UK. In the UK, right. Yeah, supposedly, because... People in Buxton got it.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.960
 Maybe. Maybe. Well, lots of bits of Darbyshire are quite far from the sea and seafood contains...

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.000
 All of us, in fact.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.040
 Yeah, but some bits are closer than others.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.720
 The exact centre of Darbyshire is a long way from the sea, yeah.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:40.400
 Yeah, and the seafood contains lots of iodine, so maybe people living in the less sea adjacent

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.920
 of Darbyshire, which obviously doesn't touch the sea, we're getting a bit less.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:50.320
 Just on iodine, it's very useful in other ways. I actually remember, this is just personal,

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.600
 but I remember having to drink iodine water. Have you guys ever drunk that because it purifies

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:58.080
 water? No. I went to Malawi when I was a teenager for like two months and yeah.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.000
 With iodine tablets. Yeah, with the drop of iodine tab in and you taste it for the first time

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.560
 and you go, "I can't drink this shit for two months." So what does it do? It purifies water.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.840
 Just purifies the goodness. Yeah, it's very useful for that. I feel like I've had that, yeah.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.560
 Because that's why Andy's the only one with a gaiter around they're taking.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:19.760
 I really thought that my polo neck was concealing that, but apparently not.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.920
 It did save you of that tiger, in fact, too, that didn't it?

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:28.800
 But something else it does, you can detect counterfeit money and if you remember your school

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:34.800
 chemistry, you might be able to work out why. So real money is on cotton or linen, usually paper.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.200
 So we shouldn't call it paper money. Counterfeit money often just made of actual paper, wood-based

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:44.400
 paper. And wood-based paper contains starch. And do you remember when you're detecting starch in

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:50.000
 science? Iodine is the thing that reacts to starch and shows up if starch is in something. So if you

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.640
 rub an iodine pen on paper and it reacts to it, then it means that it's made of wood. But this

00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:02.000
 has been used to catch people. And there was a story in 2016 where a 14-year-old girl caused the

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.880
 police to descend on her school lunch and she was put in handcuffs because she paid with a two-dollar

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:14.240
 bill, bizarrely, that an iodine pen that the school had showed up as fake. The police came.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.480
 The police came, she was put in handcuffs. She wasn't allowed to eat lunch that day. She went hungry.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.920
 She said, "I promised that my grandma gave me the money."

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.960
 Was her grandmother doing the forging? It turns out her grandmother's not a criminal either.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:31.840
 This method doesn't work on money that was made before about 1955. And her grandma had given her,

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.880
 obviously, a note they've been taking in her wallet for a very long time. So she went free in the end.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.840
 She is not still incarcerated. I imagine she was still incarcerated.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.280
 You've got to keep her in just in case. Pardon by Biden if he is later.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:54.400
 I've got an audience fact about ice sheets. It's from Percy Fulford. And I just love the way this

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:59.520
 email begins, right? Percy writes, "Admittedly, this one sounds a bit like a James Harkin quote

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.600
 fact, but bear with me." I think Percy is confused James and Dan here.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:10.640
 Thank you, Percy, for your email. Is he put his address on? I'm not giving you it.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:16.800
 I'm sure he just means a dantribe effect. Well, no one's worried that I'm taking effects from that.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.440
 You know, because Dan likes his crypto stuff. Okay, yeah. Anyway,

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:26.880
 you're going to tell us this fact is falling on very stony ground. In the last ice age,

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:31.040
 much of Canada was covered in massive, several kilometer thick glaciers, which have now melted.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.040
 Those glaciers were immensely heavy, but now the weight has been lifted. The crust is springing

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:40.480
 back up at about 12 million meters a year, like a memory foam mattress. Yeah. However, until the

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:49.200
 cross 12 million meters a year, millimeters, millimeters. It's amazing that picture of

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:59.440
 earth from space. Canada is hundreds of miles. I'm underwhelmed. However, until the crust fully

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:03.920
 rebounds from the weight of these glaciers, Canada's landscape is missing the immense mass that caused

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.480
 its shape. So for the time being, moving to Canada, particularly to somewhere near Hudson Bay, remains

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:15.040
 an effective weight loss method. If that's true, the UK as well, I should say. Yeah. We had a nice

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:20.640
 sheet that went as far down as pretty much where Stonehenge is. And then it's not there anymore.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:26.960
 And that's why it's the UK is slightly slanted. And that's why you get big cliffs where Dover is.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:32.080
 But if you go to Markham, for instance, it's a really long, sandy beach. It's just been crushed

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:38.320
 down. Yeah. Right. And now it's bouncing back, right? Over millions of years it will do. Yeah.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:43.280
 You can't bounce your castle on it. But I should say, this is from memory, but there's another

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:48.720
 thing about ice sheets you just reminded me of, which is there's a restaurant in, that was in

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:54.480
 Italy. And I think due to climate change, it was on a glacier. And the glaciers very, very slowly

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.560
 moving, but moving more than you thought. And they now think that the restaurant might be in

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:03.440
 Switzerland because it was quite near the border and it's kind of slowly moved in that direction.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:09.200
 That's amazing. We should say as well, I stupidly didn't write this bit down, but one of the big

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.560
 moments in this whole story of this main fact about the last Ice Age being responsible is there

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.400
 was one person who stood up in front of the academic community and said, I think it's the

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.680
 melting ice sheets. I think that's what's done. Like it was a proper, he put it forward as the idea.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:29.520
 And everyone just went, you are nuts. That's worse than the incest idea. That's like it was it.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.400
 Hans McMuffin.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:46.560
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:52.880
 during the reign of Charles II, women's dressing tables tended to include both face and nipple

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.960
 makeup. Wow. Okay. Yeah. So when you're making up your face, yeah, I'm no expert, but you're

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:03.520
 putting on foundation and you're putting on stuff on top of that. Yeah. Maybe some lipstick.

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:09.120
 Do they call it nipstick? Nice. How are you making up the nipple basically? Is it more for

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.320
 lipstick or a foundation? I think that's a great question. Yeah, it feels like it'd be a foundation.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.240
 Yeah, more like a foundation. I do it as eyeliner. I do it as eyeliner, paint some little eyelashes

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.240
 around it. So you're kind of winking with your nip. So it looks like a little sunshine.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.400
 Yeah, nice. I do lipstick. Make it a big red blob. Wow. Yeah. Why did they need it? Well,

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.840
 they needed it because this came in a period where Charles II basically lowered the cleavage line.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:38.640
 He was sorry. Can King Charles do that now that he's the king? Oh, yeah. That's why he picked the

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:43.120
 name Charles. He's going to start where he left off. He's easing us all in gently, but he will

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:48.880
 gently start lowering those lines. The environment thing is just a lure us in, isn't it? And then

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:53.760
 he whips away our tops. Wow. Yeah, no, he was a sort of like, you know, he was, he came in,

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:59.520
 he was very liberal. He was the Merry Monarch, was he? Yeah, Merry Monarch. Yeah, that's his name.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:05.600
 He was very libidinous, saucy, pro-theater. Just after the Cromwellian times. Exactly,

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.840
 literally anyone would have seen Merry after all the Cromwellian. Not a high bar, but he genuinely

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:16.000
 did seem like a bit of a goer. Yeah, and they're just grew this trend whereby if you're wearing

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.480
 corsets and your nipple happened to peek over, that was not a bad thing. And then suddenly

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:24.160
 everyone thought, well, let's let's lower the corset a bit. Let's get the boobs out. Let's get,

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:30.080
 and it was, you know, seeing an ankle was far more scandalous and titillating to a pervert,

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.720
 than seeing you didn't have to be a pervert.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:45.600
 The word used to be ankylating, didn't it? Very nice. I mean, it was still very raunchy.

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.640
 We should say it wasn't like people were going around the shop, flashing a boob to get free

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.120
 loaf of bread. It was still, you know, there were paintings we have of people exposing breasts,

00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:00.960
 but they were generally prostitutes or actresses who were meant to be a bit... In those days.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:07.920
 Indeed. I have to say a good caveat. Yeah, there's a famous Nell Gwynn picture. This is why I was

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:14.240
 never allowed to host the Oscars the second time. She was amazing, by the way, just before we

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:20.000
 disappear on Nell Gwynn. I've never read about Nell Gwynn before, and she, yeah, so Charles II

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.960
 basically stipulated that when you're at the theatre and men who were in all the plays playing

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.840
 women, that should no longer be the case. It should be women now playing women. There was Margaret Hughes,

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.240
 who was the first woman to step on stage and play a woman in a play, and then Nell Gwynn,

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:39.120
 who became very famous, they met. She was working in... Her and Charles met. Her and Charles met,

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:44.000
 sorry, so basically she was working outside a theatre, which was the King's Theatre, and then

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.880
 she met this guy who was called Charles Hart, who became known as Charles the First to her.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.480
 And then she... Not to be confused with the headless one.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.400
 Yeah, clever. That was just what she nicknamed him. It's what she nicknamed him, too.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.160
 Retroactively after she got together with Charles II.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.000
 Well, because then she had a Charles II, which was Charles Saxwell. So actually Charles II

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.840
 was her Charles III. Oh, wow.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.640
 This is a sort of bawdy, fast developing. They're all behind a different door,

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.160
 all on stage. Yeah.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.920
 She was... What I know about Mel Gwynn is her mother was a prostitute.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.200
 She was an orange seller, I think. That's right.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:23.120
 And then became an actor/prostitute. I always think it's very pigmalion,

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.080
 isn't it, don't you think? Because you very much came from Newwood,

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.920
 didn't you? She was a sexy pigmalion.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.360
 She was very witty. There's all these anecdotes that have made it through the years. So like the

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:36.640
 one time she was going in a carriage through the streets of a city and the people were furious

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.840
 because they thought that she was a different mistress. They thought that she was the Duchess

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:44.640
 of Portsmouth. And so they were yelling at her going, "You Catholic whore, you Catholic whore."

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:49.200
 And she leaned out of the carriage and she said, "Pray good people be civil. I am the Protestant whore."

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.400
 Not the Catholic.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.040
 That's clever.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.480
 It's really witty.

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.960
 Roll around laughing at the time.

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:55.360
 Yes.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.720
 But anyway, so she was one of the people who got their waps out.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.440
 Waps, waps.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.520
 And we still have paintings of it from the time.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:07.040
 We do. And yeah, it was a time, it was kind of like the roaring 20s, wasn't it?

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.240
 Because it was post just for international listeners. It was just after we'd had this

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.760
 like unpleasant interregnum uptight or strained.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.320
 Following an already, following an unpleasant civil war.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.600
 Yeah, yeah. Everyone was a bit tired of the unpleasantness. They weren't allowed to have

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:25.200
 fun. The Puritans were all over them. And then this period came in and everyone loosened right up

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:30.320
 and people got really into fashion and makeup. So women hadn't worn that much makeup.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.280
 They'd worn very thick lead paint on their faces, often as famously Queen Elizabeth did

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:40.320
 and may have killed her. But other than that, didn't really wear that much until now.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.360
 And it was the century of the massive hooped skirt.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.440
 When you see women in these giant skirts, they couldn't fit through doors.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:52.160
 That was then. And I didn't realize with the hoop skirts, people took the piss out of them

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:57.440
 the moment they appeared. And men kind of hated them. Men just laughed at women for wearing them.

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.960
 You couldn't see the ankles, could you? If you're a pervert.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:06.560
 Yeah, they're very upset about that. But yeah, women stuck to them. And actually,

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:11.520
 they were, when you look at how they were made, you had much more motion in them.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:16.960
 Because basically, they involved this big whale bone kind of giant umbrella sticking

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:21.200
 out from your waist. But underneath, you were just fully naked and free. So it used to be that

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.160
 you'd be covered in heavy petticoats all over your legs and stuff.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.560
 You could be doing riverdance under there. No one knows.

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:32.160
 You could be smuggling houses under there. But they were quite sexy because if you bent over,

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.560
 you did expose a bit of ankle. Oh, right.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.080
 If you really bent over, you could expose everything.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.360
 Even perverts would probably think that was a bit much.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:48.960
 The waistcoat was invented by Charles II. On the 14th of October, 1666, which is

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:55.040
 it's not amazing that we know when the idea of wearing a suit and a waistcoat on that exact date.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.760
 Did he think of it, or did someone help him?

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:03.040
 You know what? I mean, he got the credit in fairness, but there will have been other people

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:09.440
 who did a lot of the hard yards. But there was accusations that England was being dictated

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.160
 to by France in lots of different ways. And they were saying that basically, not only that,

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:19.840
 everyone in court is just copying French clothes. And Charles II was not very happy about this and

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:24.160
 wanted to make a statement and said, okay, we're going to invent a new thing. We're going to all

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:29.280
 wear trousers, all wear jackets, all wear waistcoats, and they're going to be made by English wool.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:33.600
 And you're not allowed to wear your French fashion anymore. You have to wear the English

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.520
 fashion. And we know about it because peeps writes about it. So it definitely did happen.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.960
 What year was that? Sorry.

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.280
 1666, just after the fire.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:49.120
 When, again, you'd think a king with his head screwed on, sorry, Charles II,

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.000
 that's probably been intense.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.760
 He would have his mind on other matters like recovering from the plague of the fire than

00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:00.560
 inventing the waistcoat. Political distractions.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:08.160
 Peeps wrote that the king banned pinking and the waistcoats because he said that it made his

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:15.040
 people in his court look like magpies. Pinking is where you get some cloth and you make like

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:20.480
 tiny holes in it to make a pattern. It's very fashionable at the time, but the king banned it.

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.240
 It's probably bad for your insulation as well.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.920
 Having small holes.

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.400
 All over your clothes. It probably doesn't do you, you know.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.800
 Well, weirdly, if you wear like a string vest, that's just holes. But actually,

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.200
 it's supposed to be very warm because it traps the air.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.000
 I mean, if it was just holes, it would be nothing, wouldn't it?

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.200
 That's emperor's new string vest, but it's mostly holes.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.240
 It's definitely mostly holes. No, I get that. I've never worn a string vest.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.120
 You've amazed me.

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.160
 I can't believe it.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:50.320
 I can only imagine you on your Christmas holidays going down to Margate Beach with a

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.680
 handkerchief around your head.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.720
 I go home. I climb off into the computer tower.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.360
 I take my clothes and get my string vest on.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.480
 Weirdly, even though women were uncovering their boobies,

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.040
 they were covering their faces at this time.

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:09.760
 This went in and out of fashion throughout the 1600s and 1700s, masks.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.080
 But masks that cover your whole face.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.920
 And they'd often have a little bead sewn into the way your mouth was.

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.720
 So the way you held them on was by keeping this...

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.000
 You bit them on.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.440
 You bit them on, which added, apparently, an extra air of mystery because you couldn't speak.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.240
 So you were a mute.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.040
 You should go, "Hello."

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.560
 That was a very sexy way of speaking in those days.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:35.040
 It's a little weird that they were called "vizards."

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:40.240
 Was it to stop the sunshine from like, as I would have seen that in modern day,

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.320
 sometimes people would wear like balaclavas, would they?

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.440
 Stops the great plague, which was probably knocking about a bit.

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.640
 Many people wearing balaclava.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.560
 Are you sure you haven't been robbed a number of times?

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.360
 He's just trying to avoid getting burned.

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.280
 I think you see it in some countries.

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.080
 They'll wear like...

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:54.720
 I've seen that.

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.000
 Like colorful balaclavas.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:56.560
 Yeah.

00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.560
 I don't think more veils than balaclava.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.680
 I think like, you know, like Pussy Riot War, those things.

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.760
 I think I've seen them.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.560
 I might be wrong.

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.680
 Well, it was for sun protection a lot of the time and initially,

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.960
 but then it became a fashion which was unrelated to sun protection.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:16.240
 And it was to have this air of virtue or high quality, high breeding.

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.000
 But would you have your boobs out at the same time?

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.600
 Oh, yeah, yeah, naked from the neck down.

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.880
 But you're unrecognizable.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.440
 No.

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.120
 Well, no, but you might, you might do, you know,

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.680
 because most people are recognizable by their faces and not by their boobs.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.080
 Yeah.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.160
 And you're not going to admit to being the man who recognizes the woman

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.200
 just by her boobs, are you?

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:29.600
 No.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.120
 Not when you've gone to the theatre with your wife.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.200
 Sally over there.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.680
 What is that story?

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.040
 I'm going to really butcher it.

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:37.920
 Can you tell it, Andy?

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:38.720
 It's really good.

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:39.280
 It's the...

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:39.920
 It's in Oxford.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.760
 It's a men-only area in Oxford.

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.160
 It's a bit of the river, a swimming area called Parsons Pleasure, I think,

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:50.720
 where only male dons or maybe undergraduates would swim, but they would swim naked.

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.680
 And one day, there were three dons there and some ladies happened by.

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.280
 They were surprised and the dons were all naked.

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.280
 And two, they're all very embarrassed.

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.320
 And quickly, you know, two of the dons grabbed their, I don't know, flannel or whatever,

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.400
 and covered their genitals.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.840
 And the third don, very calmly, doesn't cover his genitals, he covers his face.

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.880
 And they say, "What have you done that for all, Charles?"

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:11.920
 If it's the name of Charles.

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:15.040
 And he says, "Well, I'm not recognizable by my genitals."

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.360
 So, unfortunately, they all heard of being called Charles.

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:28.720
 Okay, that's it.

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.680
 That is all of our facts.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.040

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.720
 Yeah, I grabbed that.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.960
 Oh my god.

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.920
