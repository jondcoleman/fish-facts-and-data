00:00:02,00:00:06,"Hello, you lovely club fish member on Patreon."
00:00:06,00:00:08,Here is your announcement for the big news
00:00:08,00:00:11,of changes happening to no such thing as a fish.
00:00:11,00:00:15,"Well, first of all, the main thing to say to you guys"
00:00:15,00:00:17,"is that if you want to stay exactly where you are,"
00:00:17,00:00:18,then nothing changes.
00:00:18,00:00:20,"Well, very slightly changes."
00:00:20,00:00:22,We are gonna move the bonus content to Wednesdays
00:00:22,00:00:23,instead of Tuesdays.
00:00:23,00:00:26,That's just to make our workflow a little bit easier.
00:00:26,00:00:29,But every other week you will still get your episode
00:00:29,00:00:31,"of ""Droppers Align"" and in fact, ""Droppers Align"""
00:00:31,00:00:33,will now become fortnightly.
00:00:33,00:00:35,We won't be doing any of the little bits and pieces
00:00:35,00:00:38,"instead, this is a ""Droppers Align"" zone."
00:00:38,00:00:41,"If you would like to get involved with any other tiers,"
00:00:41,00:00:43,"so that is plenty more fish,"
00:00:43,00:00:45,"which includes video ""Droppers Align"""
00:00:45,00:00:49,"and full, more or less unedited episodes of fish"
00:00:49,00:00:51,"then go to our ""Plency More Fish"" tier."
00:00:51,00:00:53,"And if you would like to be a friend of the podcast,"
00:00:53,00:00:55,then the top tier is for you.
00:00:55,00:00:57,You will become custodian of a fact.
00:00:57,00:01:00,You will be able to come to our three monthly Zoom quizzes
00:01:00,00:01:03,and you will also get into the archive
00:01:03,00:01:06,where we put basically the Museum of Fish.
00:01:06,00:01:08,So lots of other places you can go.
00:01:08,00:01:09,There's merch there as well.
00:01:09,00:01:11,So go and explore if you want to.
00:01:11,00:01:13,"But if not, then please stay here, ""Droppers Align"""
00:01:13,00:01:16,and your every episodes of fish will stay exactly
00:01:16,00:01:17,as they were.
00:01:17,00:01:19,"Okay, on with the podcast."
00:01:19,00:01:22,(upbeat music)
00:01:22,00:01:26,(upbeat music)
00:01:26,00:01:29,(speaking in foreign language)
00:01:29,00:01:31,(upbeat music)
00:01:31,00:01:37,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:37,00:01:40,"of ""No Such Thing As A Fish"" a weekly podcast."
00:01:40,00:01:42,This week coming to you live
00:01:42,00:01:44,from the London Podcast Festival.
00:01:44,00:01:48,(audience cheering)
00:01:48,00:01:50,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:50,00:01:52,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:01:52,00:01:54,"James Harkin, and Jamie Morton."
00:01:54,00:01:56,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:56,00:01:59,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:01:59,00:02:02,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:02,00:02:06,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Jamie."
00:02:06,00:02:10,"Iconic Fespian, ""Bear Bome"" had a walk on part"
00:02:10,00:02:14,"in every single production at the ""Geal Good Theater"""
00:02:14,00:02:17,in London's West End for 20 years.
00:02:17,00:02:21,"And, fittingly, had a front page obituary"
00:02:21,00:02:23,in the stage newspaper.
00:02:23,00:02:25,He was also a cat.
00:02:25,00:02:29,(audience laughing)
00:02:29,00:02:32,"I know, I mean, what a hack, I'm sorry."
00:02:32,00:02:34,"That is a Fespian cat, that is."
00:02:34,00:02:35,Yeah.
00:02:35,00:02:38,"For people listening on the podcast next week,"
00:02:38,00:02:40,"or whenever it goes out, can you describe"
00:02:40,00:02:41,the cat who was Jamie?
00:02:41,00:02:43,"We've got a tabby cat, he's male,"
00:02:43,00:02:47,"and he's lounging on stage at the ""Geal Good."""
00:02:47,00:02:49,"Looking very happy with his beautifully lit,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,"it's black and white, it's very,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,"it's also like a headshot, but it's a full body."
00:02:53,00:02:54,(audience laughing)
00:02:54,00:02:55,Yeah.
00:02:55,00:02:56,Shays long kind of look.
00:02:56,00:02:57,"That little, is that a photo of a tail?"
00:02:57,00:03:00,"He's like saying, ""Paint me like one of your French cats."""
00:03:00,00:03:01,It's giving that energy to them.
00:03:01,00:03:02,"Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the way it is."
00:03:02,00:03:05,Same opulence as well around it in terms of the architecture.
00:03:05,00:03:07,"Yeah, I mean, I love this cat."
00:03:07,00:03:08,"So, I'm not gonna lie."
00:03:08,00:03:10,I fall in love with him this week.
00:03:10,00:03:11,"I've never heard of him before, but now I love him."
00:03:11,00:03:14,"So, when you say walk on roll in all the plays,"
00:03:14,00:03:15,was that official?
00:03:15,00:03:17,Was he written into?
00:03:17,00:03:18,No.
00:03:18,00:03:19,No.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"So, he was the resident, is it like Mouser?"
00:03:22,00:03:23,Is that the name?
00:03:23,00:03:27,"Yeah, Mouser name, that they caught the mice."
00:03:27,00:03:31,"And he just would randomly walk on stage during productions,"
00:03:31,00:03:34,"which being a theatre director, I find chilling,"
00:03:34,00:03:37,"'cause you work so hard to kind of make a show good,"
00:03:37,00:03:40,then some fucking cats just like wandering in front of everyone.
00:03:40,00:03:42,And what did the actors think of it?
00:03:42,00:03:47,"Well, the actors loved this cat, almost uniformly."
00:03:47,00:03:51,"I think there wasn't a single actor who didn't love beer bone,"
00:03:51,00:03:54,"'cause he is, as I said, a total hag."
00:03:54,00:03:58,"I mean, look at him, but yeah, he was loved."
00:03:58,00:04:01,And people got very attached to him.
00:04:01,00:04:03,So much so that he had this obituary
00:04:03,00:04:05,on the front page of the stage newspaper.
00:04:05,00:04:09,"And people like Penelope Keith wrote obituries for him,"
00:04:09,00:04:10,like loads of actors kind of got involved.
00:04:10,00:04:12,"The stage, I hadn't heard of the stage,"
00:04:12,00:04:15,is that like the main main thing that you can get on it?
00:04:15,00:04:18,"The Bible, Dan, honestly."
00:04:18,00:04:18,I love that.
00:04:18,00:04:20,"No, I had actually heard of it."
00:04:20,00:04:22,"I was just being them for a second, yeah."
00:04:22,00:04:24,Then they've heard of it too.
00:04:24,00:04:26,"Oh, so it is just being staged."
00:04:26,00:04:27,"It's a great news paper, yeah."
00:04:27,00:04:28,"No, it is, it's a great news paper."
00:04:28,00:04:29,"It's behind a play wall, but it's great."
00:04:29,00:04:31,"Okay, a lot of people did love beer bone,"
00:04:31,00:04:34,but beer bone would arrive on stage at moments
00:04:34,00:04:37,"that weren't necessarily good for a scene, you know?"
00:04:37,00:04:40,"There was one play that was on, which was called"
00:04:40,00:04:44,"the House of Bernard Alba, which had a lot of sand"
00:04:44,00:04:49,"all over the stage, which beer bone was the ultimate pooing ground."
00:04:49,00:04:52,"It was, so that was not good, right?"
00:04:52,00:04:55,"Well, it was not good for who, we loved it."
00:04:55,00:04:57,It adds realism to the play.
00:04:57,00:04:58,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:58,00:04:59,That's where it's set.
00:04:59,00:05:01,"If it's set in the pitiless desert of the Sahara,"
00:05:01,00:05:04,"it actually, I would say, kills the mood a bit,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,"to have a house cat, though enough."
00:05:06,00:05:09,Some people think it's good luck for a cat to be on stage
00:05:09,00:05:12,"and in America, at least, there was a superstition"
00:05:12,00:05:15,"that if a black cat came into the theatre,"
00:05:15,00:05:16,that was really good luck.
00:05:16,00:05:18,"And if it came on the first night,"
00:05:18,00:05:20,"that was really, really good luck,"
00:05:20,00:05:21,and the whole show was going to be amazing.
00:05:21,00:05:22,Right.
00:05:22,00:05:25,And so the fifth avenue theatre in New York
00:05:25,00:05:28,"used to keep a black cat backstage,"
00:05:28,00:05:30,"and then on the first show of every run,"
00:05:30,00:05:32,"that they would throw it out there,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,"so that it was on stage, and that was good luck."
00:05:34,00:05:35,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:35,00:05:37,"And the reason you said, ""Master"" is second to go, Jamie."
00:05:37,00:05:40,"The reason that cats used to be very, very important in theatre"
00:05:40,00:05:43,"is because back in the day, food being thrown on stage"
00:05:43,00:05:47,to show your all-pleasure in a play was a massive thing.
00:05:47,00:05:49,"So at the end of every night, food was just everywhere,"
00:05:49,00:05:51,"all over the stage, which brought in the mice,"
00:05:51,00:05:53,"and mice were a huge, huge problem."
00:05:53,00:05:56,So theatres would have sometimes up to 20 cats
00:05:56,00:05:58,roaming around catching mice if they had problems.
00:05:58,00:06:02,"But a lot of those cats will lie on their CVs, you know."
00:06:02,00:06:04,"You've put on here, you also do birds."
00:06:04,00:06:05,Is that true?
00:06:05,00:06:06,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:06,00:06:10,"Yeah, because actually Bearbone was on the payroll, I read."
00:06:10,00:06:12,"He was officially listed on the Gilgood payroll,"
00:06:12,00:06:14,"which, as a former accountant, I think,"
00:06:14,00:06:16,brings up a whole host of problems.
00:06:16,00:06:19,"Like, who pays the national insurance on that?"
00:06:19,00:06:21,"Yeah, I wonder who his agent was."
00:06:21,00:06:22,"I don't know, someone bloody good."
00:06:22,00:06:23,"Yeah, 15% of a cat."
00:06:23,00:06:26,"And apparently, he would disappear from time to time,"
00:06:26,00:06:28,according to Dame Hilda Brackett.
00:06:28,00:06:31,He would dash off to see a particular friend
00:06:31,00:06:32,at the Lyric Theatre.
00:06:32,00:06:33,His girlfriend?
00:06:33,00:06:36,"Yeah, she said, ""We used to hear lots of meows."
00:06:36,00:06:37,"""This was so ho after all."""
00:06:37,00:06:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:40,00:06:40,I love it.
00:06:40,00:06:44,"Do you think all of-- most West Emphaters have cats, as you said."
00:06:44,00:06:44,Yeah.
00:06:44,00:06:45,They're all mates.
00:06:45,00:06:46,"Do they just, like, all meet up at--"
00:06:46,00:06:48,"Like, that's a cute, that's a great show, though."
00:06:48,00:06:49,That's a charity book.
00:06:49,00:06:51,You should have seen the performance of this.
00:06:51,00:06:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:53,00:06:55,"Well, lots of them are dead of cats, don't they?"
00:06:55,00:06:57,So the Noel Coward Theatre had two cats.
00:06:57,00:06:59,They imagined a difficult girl cat and boy cat.
00:06:59,00:07:02,And I think boy cat only ever distinguished himself
00:07:02,00:07:06,once when he ate Princess Margaret's bouquet.
00:07:06,00:07:07,Is that a euphemism?
00:07:07,00:07:10,"No, it's not."
00:07:10,00:07:12,"It's a bloody good one, isn't it?"
00:07:12,00:07:15,"Yeah, apparently, he also escaped offstage"
00:07:15,00:07:18,during a performance of a musical five-guys named Mo.
00:07:18,00:07:20,"And he would go under the stage,"
00:07:20,00:07:23,and he would only come out when someone tap danced over him.
00:07:23,00:07:24,Right.
00:07:24,00:07:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:07:25,00:07:28,There was a cat called Ambrose at the Theatre Royal
00:07:28,00:07:30,"Jury Lane, which I think you performed her."
00:07:30,00:07:31,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:31,00:07:32,"We have, yeah."
00:07:32,00:07:36,And this cat got into a beef with Michael Crawford.
00:07:36,00:07:38,He kept upstaging Michael Crawford.
00:07:38,00:07:41,And Michael Crawford had no sense of humor about this.
00:07:41,00:07:42,It's Michael Crawford.
00:07:42,00:07:43,"It's Michael Crawford, the original--"
00:07:43,00:07:44,Phantom.
00:07:44,00:07:44,Yes.
00:07:44,00:07:45,But was he also Frank Spencer?
00:07:45,00:07:46,"Yeah, Frank Spencer."
00:07:46,00:07:47,I'm a T. That guy.
00:07:47,00:07:49,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:49,00:07:50,A varied career.
00:07:50,00:07:50,I think we'll agree.
00:07:50,00:07:52,"I was going to say, yeah, like--"
00:07:52,00:07:53,"But then instead of Michael Crawford,"
00:07:53,00:07:54,I was like kicking off about this cat.
00:07:54,00:07:58,But every single person in the theatre took the cat's side.
00:07:58,00:07:59,What does that say?
00:07:59,00:08:00,Wow.
00:08:00,00:08:04,"Yeah, I read about one that was at the Sadler's Wells."
00:08:04,00:08:06,"It was called Sadler, the Cat."
00:08:06,00:08:09,And Sadler in 1956 just suddenly disappeared.
00:08:09,00:08:12,"But unlike the other cats who would come on unprompted,"
00:08:12,00:08:14,Sadler actually had a role in a play.
00:08:14,00:08:14,"Oh, no."
00:08:14,00:08:18,"So in the stage, magazine, they had an advert"
00:08:18,00:08:20,to audition for a new cat for the show.
00:08:20,00:08:21,And I found the advert.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"It said, owing to the dramatic disappearance"
00:08:23,00:08:26,"of Sadler, official theatre cat at the Wells,"
00:08:26,00:08:28,the important feline role in the forthcoming production
00:08:28,00:08:30,"of School of Fathers, falls vacant."
00:08:30,00:08:32,Auditions will be held.
00:08:32,00:08:34,Applicants must be fully grown and capable
00:08:34,00:08:38,of maintaining dignity and poise atop a 10-foot high wall.
00:08:38,00:08:41,Despite the distractions of a full operatic orchestra
00:08:41,00:08:43,"and audience laughter and applause,"
00:08:43,00:08:45,"the chosen artist will receive full her service,"
00:08:45,00:08:49,one sardine and two complimentary tickets per performance.
00:08:49,00:08:50,Wow.
00:08:50,00:08:52,And did you see who got the part?
00:08:52,00:08:54,It was a cat called Keats.
00:08:54,00:08:56,"And according to the Daily Telegraphy Beat-Off,"
00:08:56,00:09:01,"a tough competition from cats called Fantasia, Nimbus, Klott,"
00:09:01,00:09:04,and Mr. Woodbury Bentley.
00:09:04,00:09:05,And they had two auditions.
00:09:05,00:09:08,"In the second audition, he jumped off the wall"
00:09:08,00:09:10,that he was sitting on and then walked over to the bar
00:09:10,00:09:12,and started knocking down bottles.
00:09:12,00:09:16,And they decided this was a perfect cat for the theatre.
00:09:16,00:09:18,This is exactly what the old actors would do.
00:09:18,00:09:19,So happy.
00:09:19,00:09:20,Yeah.
00:09:20,00:09:21,So good.
00:09:21,00:09:22,How can you cast a cat in a play?
00:09:22,00:09:24,They just-- they famously don't play--
00:09:24,00:09:25,Bull.
00:09:25,00:09:27,"They play with Bulls, but you know what I mean?"
00:09:27,00:09:29,"Yeah, and they're hard to direct, I would imagine."
00:09:29,00:09:32,"Yeah, dogs, I think, do get a look in sometimes on the West End."
00:09:32,00:09:33,I was trying to find other animals
00:09:33,00:09:35,that have been in West End productions.
00:09:35,00:09:36,Yeah.
00:09:36,00:09:39,So there was a Guardian report in 2001
00:09:39,00:09:41,"that there was a production of The Taming of the True,"
00:09:41,00:09:43,which had an entire cast of chickens.
00:09:43,00:09:45,And I cannot find out whether it was like a whole flock
00:09:45,00:09:47,of chickens and a human cast or whether it
00:09:47,00:09:50,was an entire cast of chickens.
00:09:50,00:09:53,"But when they all fired, I think, they were sacked."
00:09:53,00:09:55,"Yes, apparently for being too hysterical."
00:09:55,00:09:56,"Again, I don't know what the--"
00:09:56,00:09:57,It's hysterical.
00:09:57,00:09:58,It's a kick.
00:09:58,00:10:00,I can't imagine how hysterical they
00:10:00,00:10:02,got when they were told they were fired.
00:10:02,00:10:03,That's the big on the room.
00:10:03,00:10:06,"Guys, we're going to have to let you go."
00:10:06,00:10:08,"By the way, beer bomb, the cat."
00:10:08,00:10:11,Do we know-- do you guys know why it's called beer bomb?
00:10:11,00:10:12,There was a famous actor called beer
00:10:12,00:10:13,but I don't know what they're going to do.
00:10:13,00:10:14,"Yeah, he was a theatre manager."
00:10:14,00:10:15,He was an actor as well.
00:10:15,00:10:17,His name was Sir Herbert Beerbomb Tree.
00:10:17,00:10:21,"And he founded Radar, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts."
00:10:21,00:10:22,Yeah.
00:10:22,00:10:24,And he's a pretty amazing character.
00:10:24,00:10:25,He released a few records.
00:10:25,00:10:28,He did hamlets to be or not to be on vinyl.
00:10:28,00:10:29,That's pretty cool.
00:10:29,00:10:32,I'm just really sin his own stuff.
00:10:32,00:10:35,"And also, randomly, in the play Cats,"
00:10:35,00:10:39,there is a reference which is said to Gus from Geliorum.
00:10:39,00:10:41,Is that the name of the cat in it?
00:10:41,00:10:42,The line is he's acted with Oving.
00:10:42,00:10:44,He's acted with Tree.
00:10:44,00:10:45,"Cats, I'm so glad we're on Cats."
00:10:45,00:10:47,"So thing one, when you think about it,"
00:10:47,00:10:49,cats is an antagravive cast.
00:10:49,00:10:50,OK.
00:10:50,00:10:53,And?
00:10:53,00:10:54,"Why does it make you think, doesn't it?"
00:10:54,00:10:55,Yeah.
00:10:55,00:10:56,Yeah.
00:10:56,00:10:59,It's also an antagram of acts.
00:10:59,00:11:01,"Oh, my God."
00:11:01,00:11:05,I was so pleased with myself cast.
00:11:05,00:11:08,And they got to stack but without the cage.
00:11:08,00:11:09,Nah.
00:11:09,00:11:11,"And they thought, oh, that's brilliant."
00:11:11,00:11:13,Is that it?
00:11:13,00:11:14,That was the fact.
00:11:14,00:11:15,That was the fact.
00:11:15,00:11:18,"He messaged us saying, I've got some amazing stuff on Cats"
00:11:18,00:11:20,that I need to say on stage.
00:11:20,00:11:22,I spent six hours reading about the musical cats
00:11:22,00:11:25,"because you had a cat's back, and that was it."
00:11:25,00:11:27,"Well, I just wanted to introduce yours."
00:11:27,00:11:28,"Yeah, go on, go on."
00:11:28,00:11:30,"OK, well, I have quite a good one about Cats, the musical."
00:11:30,00:11:30,Do you?
00:11:30,00:11:31,OK.
00:11:31,00:11:36,"For its broadway run, they used over 49,000 condoms."
00:11:36,00:11:38,"Oh, sorry."
00:11:38,00:11:39,Yeah.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Can we guess?
00:11:40,00:11:40,Why?
00:11:40,00:11:41,Densch.
00:11:41,00:11:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:45,00:11:45,Densch.
00:11:45,00:11:47,"Sadly, Densch ruptured her Achilles,"
00:11:47,00:11:49,so couldn't perform in Cats.
00:11:49,00:11:50,Although she was originally Cats.
00:11:50,00:11:51,She was meant to be.
00:11:51,00:11:53,She was originally Cats.
00:11:53,00:11:54,In Cats.
00:11:54,00:11:55,In Cats.
00:11:55,00:11:56,"Yeah, why do you think they used so many condoms?"
00:11:56,00:11:59,To stop things from getting wet is my first thought.
00:11:59,00:12:00,"Well, what sort of thing?"
00:12:00,00:12:02,You smuggle drugs for the cars.
00:12:02,00:12:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:04,00:12:06,"No, you were on the right lines, James."
00:12:06,00:12:08,"Yeah, to protect something."
00:12:08,00:12:08,Is it?
00:12:08,00:12:09,OK.
00:12:09,00:12:15,"Oh, is it for-- so a lot of preppers will use condoms"
00:12:15,00:12:18,"to store water because a condom, like a water balloon,"
00:12:18,00:12:20,you can hold gallons of water.
00:12:20,00:12:21,Absolutely not.
00:12:21,00:12:22,"All right, no, I'm sorry."
00:12:22,00:12:24,"If you ever go to Dan's for dinner,"
00:12:24,00:12:28,he offers still sparkling or gracing of spurnicide.
00:12:28,00:12:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:31,00:12:32,"It's all right, Andy."
00:12:32,00:12:34,"Cats have claws, don't they?"
00:12:34,00:12:34,Yes.
00:12:34,00:12:37,It's to protect the claws in transit.
00:12:37,00:12:39,"And they had $49,000."
00:12:39,00:12:40,"Well, real Cats have claws."
00:12:40,00:12:41,This is the show with people.
00:12:41,00:12:42,Yeah.
00:12:42,00:12:44,"All right, put us out of my way."
00:12:44,00:12:45,"It was-- you were right, James."
00:12:45,00:12:48,"It was to protect their microphone packs,"
00:12:48,00:12:50,"because they were sweating so much, because it's a Dan show, right?"
00:12:50,00:12:52,They're dancing so much that they would put their mic packs
00:12:52,00:12:54,"in condoms, if you'd--"
00:12:54,00:12:55,"$49,000."
00:12:55,00:12:56,Yeah.
00:12:56,00:12:58,"After each show, they were just like tip loads of condoms"
00:12:58,00:12:59,in the bin outside of this.
00:12:59,00:13:01,"Oh, it's a sweet show."
00:13:01,00:13:04,"While we're on Andrew Lloyd Webber,"
00:13:04,00:13:06,"there's another cat connection, which"
00:13:06,00:13:08,is the fact that Phantom of the Opera now
00:13:08,00:13:09,has a sequel.
00:13:09,00:13:12,"Many, many years ago, Lloyd Webber was working on that sequel."
00:13:12,00:13:15,"And he was rising it with Frederick Forsyth, the author."
00:13:15,00:13:16,"The author, Jackal?"
00:13:16,00:13:17,"Yeah, exactly."
00:13:17,00:13:18,So they were writing it.
00:13:18,00:13:19,He'd written all the music.
00:13:19,00:13:21,And he had it on his electric piano.
00:13:21,00:13:24,"And then one day, he sat down to write a new song."
00:13:24,00:13:27,"And his kitten, called Otto, stepped on the keyboard"
00:13:27,00:13:30,and erased the entire score.
00:13:30,00:13:31,And so we never got it.
00:13:31,00:13:33,"The main thing about Cat Charlie is the movie,"
00:13:33,00:13:36,the amazing movie that came out a few years ago.
00:13:36,00:13:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:36,00:13:38,"And it was really the start of the pandemic, I think."
00:13:38,00:13:40,"It was right at the start of the pandemic, wasn't it?"
00:13:40,00:13:41,It was a bad moment.
00:13:41,00:13:43,I think we're claiming it caused the pandemic.
00:13:43,00:13:43,I don't know.
00:13:43,00:13:47,"No, but it made it seem a lot longer."
00:13:47,00:13:50,You knew something bad was in the air when cats came out.
00:13:50,00:13:54,And the big thing about that is the CGI bum holes
00:13:54,00:13:55,that all the cats had.
00:13:55,00:13:56,Wow.
00:13:56,00:13:56,What's that?
00:13:56,00:14:00,"Well, is it true or not?"
00:14:00,00:14:01,Because that is urban myth.
00:14:01,00:14:01,Is it true?
00:14:01,00:14:02,It's urban myth.
00:14:02,00:14:04,So someone tweeted a guy called Jack Waz.
00:14:04,00:14:08,"I think-- I mean, that sounds like an honest man, doesn't it?"
00:14:08,00:14:09,Jack Waz.
00:14:09,00:14:09,I think it's James.
00:14:09,00:14:12,You go to such impeccable lengths to source all of your facts.
00:14:12,00:14:15,James goes deep into newspaper archives from 200 years ago.
00:14:15,00:14:20,But he will also sometimes throw in like @JackWaz as a source.
00:14:20,00:14:23,@JackWaz is the New York Times of our day.
00:14:23,00:14:26,"He said that a VFX producer, friend of a friend,"
00:14:26,00:14:30,"was hired to get rid of the bum holes, right?"
00:14:30,00:14:32,But then the Daily Beast Online magazine
00:14:32,00:14:35,"found a VFX person, and they said it was true."
00:14:35,00:14:38,And they were definitely someone who worked on the show.
00:14:38,00:14:40,And they said what had happened was actually
00:14:40,00:14:42,the way the visual effects worked
00:14:42,00:14:46,is they had a very special way of the fur being made.
00:14:46,00:14:49,And the fur would go in little holes.
00:14:49,00:14:49,Like your hair does.
00:14:49,00:14:51,You know you have walls in your hair.
00:14:51,00:14:53,And so they had them on all the cats.
00:14:53,00:14:55,And it just so happened that if you got them any of them
00:14:55,00:14:59,"from a certain angle, it looked like they had female genitalia"
00:14:59,00:15:01,or an anus.
00:15:01,00:15:04,"And they had to imply one person who, basically, it"
00:15:04,00:15:07,was their job to go through looking for the bum holes
00:15:07,00:15:08,and then get rid of them.
00:15:08,00:15:09,"Right, that's insane."
00:15:09,00:15:12,That's such a high-pressure job as well.
00:15:12,00:15:14,"You've got to catch every single one, you know?"
00:15:14,00:15:15,It's true.
00:15:15,00:15:16,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:16,00:15:17,"But Pokemon, yeah."
00:15:17,00:15:19,I love it.
00:15:19,00:15:20,"They could catch all of the bum holes,"
00:15:20,00:15:22,"but not Judith Ench is Wedding Ring, which"
00:15:22,00:15:23,is on throughout the fucking process.
00:15:23,00:15:24,"Oh, is it?"
00:15:24,00:15:26,As like an old cat.
00:15:26,00:15:29,"So you got all of the rings, but one, and yeah."
00:15:29,00:15:29,Exactly.
00:15:29,00:15:36,So it's time for fact number two.
00:15:36,00:15:38,And that is my fact.
00:15:38,00:15:42,"My fact this week is that, at one of the oldest bath houses,"
00:15:42,00:15:44,"in Japan, visitors have the option"
00:15:44,00:15:50,"of soaking in hot water, cold water, electric water,"
00:15:50,00:15:51,or condom water.
00:15:51,00:15:59,We need to call them and suggest that.
00:15:59,00:16:01,"No, the final one, there are many others,"
00:16:01,00:16:04,but the other one is radioactive water.
00:16:04,00:16:05,"Ooh, yeah."
00:16:05,00:16:07,People also drink this water.
00:16:07,00:16:09,"So it turns out, I thought this was going"
00:16:09,00:16:11,"to be unique to this one place in Japan,"
00:16:11,00:16:13,which is a radium onsen.
00:16:13,00:16:17,And onsen is a word that means bath houses in Japan
00:16:17,00:16:20,"that use hot spring water, and they take natural source water."
00:16:20,00:16:21,And they use that.
00:16:21,00:16:24,"There's something like 25,000 hot spring sources in Japan"
00:16:24,00:16:25,that they use.
00:16:25,00:16:26,They're everywhere.
00:16:26,00:16:30,"Yeah, and 3,000 onsen establishments all over Japan."
00:16:30,00:16:31,So it's a real big thing there.
00:16:31,00:16:34,"And so like the electric water that you would sit in,"
00:16:34,00:16:37,that actually sends mild electric currents through the water
00:16:37,00:16:38,as you're sitting in it.
00:16:38,00:16:41,And people describe it as like being tickled by lightning
00:16:41,00:16:43,as you're trying to relax.
00:16:43,00:16:44,So you're just how relaxing?
00:16:44,00:16:45,"Yeah, well, yeah."
00:16:45,00:16:48,"Well, they see these baths not as necessarily"
00:16:48,00:16:49,completely relaxing.
00:16:49,00:16:51,"It's all about rejuvenation, it's all about health and so on."
00:16:51,00:16:55,"And so radioactive water, radium water, is a thing."
00:16:55,00:16:57,"It's not bad for you, is it?"
00:16:57,00:17:00,"The quantities are really, really small."
00:17:00,00:17:02,The quantities are less than you would get
00:17:02,00:17:05,"if you were on a flight, for example."
00:17:05,00:17:07,But that's flight.
00:17:07,00:17:11,"You know, we get hit by radioactive flares from space"
00:17:11,00:17:12,as you're on a flight.
00:17:12,00:17:16,"So James, quick, jump in with the top."
00:17:16,00:17:18,There is radiation that comes from space.
00:17:18,00:17:21,"And if the closer you are to it, the less space."
00:17:21,00:17:21,Space.
00:17:21,00:17:22,Space.
00:17:22,00:17:24,"Not Katy Perry, but it means you."
00:17:24,00:17:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:28,00:17:30,There's less of the atmosphere to block it out
00:17:30,00:17:32,when your fervor up is the basics.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"But if you're on a plane all the time, it'll be bad for you."
00:17:34,00:17:38,"Like a air hostess or a pilot, for example."
00:17:38,00:17:39,"And it's bad for you, it's bad for you."
00:17:39,00:17:41,What are you talking about?
00:17:41,00:17:45,They said that it's safest way to travel.
00:17:45,00:17:45,No.
00:17:45,00:17:47,"But if you live in Cornwall, there's radiation there, too."
00:17:47,00:17:49,"Like, you know what I'm saying?"
00:17:49,00:17:52,But here's some kind of lead box at the end of this.
00:17:52,00:17:54,So there is radiation in Cornwall.
00:17:54,00:17:56,Cornwall has more background radiation than anywhere else.
00:17:56,00:17:58,But we all have a little bit.
00:17:58,00:18:01,And a normal person would get two to three millisieverts
00:18:01,00:18:03,of radiation in a year.
00:18:03,00:18:05,But there's a place called Ramsar in a ran
00:18:05,00:18:08,that has the highest radiation anywhere in the world.
00:18:08,00:18:10,It's because they have hot springs and radiation
00:18:10,00:18:12,underground and it comes up.
00:18:12,00:18:15,"And they get 260 millisieverts per year,"
00:18:15,00:18:19,which is more than 100 times what a normal person would get.
00:18:19,00:18:21,"But actually, the cancer incidence there"
00:18:21,00:18:23,is lower than any of their neighbors.
00:18:23,00:18:24,Right.
00:18:24,00:18:27,"And what people think is the people who live there,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,they have a higher proportion of what's called T-cells.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"Remembering COVID, they said T-cells."
00:18:31,00:18:33,"It's like, helped your immune system."
00:18:33,00:18:34,But it turns out that people there have
00:18:34,00:18:36,got higher proportion of T-cells.
00:18:36,00:18:38,"And it's the thing called Hormesis, which"
00:18:38,00:18:41,is the idea that very small low doses of something
00:18:41,00:18:45,that would otherwise be harmful can actually make you stronger.
00:18:45,00:18:47,And it is really--
00:18:47,00:18:49,"I mean, I'm not saying everyone should go out now"
00:18:49,00:18:51,and get as much radiation as possible.
00:18:51,00:18:52,But it is genuinely exciting.
00:18:52,00:18:53,You have a great time.
00:18:53,00:18:54,That's amazing.
00:18:54,00:18:55,Yeah.
00:18:55,00:18:56,That really is amazing.
00:18:56,00:18:56,It's very cool.
00:18:56,00:19:00,"So as I was saying a second ago, these are massive in Japan."
00:19:00,00:19:01,And I was trying to find more information
00:19:01,00:19:04,about this very specific one in Osaka.
00:19:04,00:19:07,And the best place I could find out about it
00:19:07,00:19:10,was a website called tatufriendlyonson.com.
00:19:10,00:19:13,"And this is so interesting, because in Japan,"
00:19:13,00:19:17,"when you go to an onsen, largely it's separated."
00:19:17,00:19:18,So men will go into one place.
00:19:18,00:19:18,One will go to another.
00:19:18,00:19:19,You have to be naked.
00:19:19,00:19:20,You've got to be completely naked.
00:19:20,00:19:24,"And the problem is in Japan, if you have tattoos,"
00:19:24,00:19:27,you're not allowed to go and show your tattoos in these places
00:19:27,00:19:28,because of the yakusa.
00:19:28,00:19:30,So a lot of foreigners arrive trying to go--
00:19:30,00:19:32,--trying to go to the ganksters.
00:19:32,00:19:33,"Yeah, the mafia, basically."
00:19:33,00:19:35,"Yeah, who are tattooed, typically."
00:19:35,00:19:36,"Yeah, exactly."
00:19:36,00:19:40,And so if you arrive and you've got like--
00:19:40,00:19:45,"Eternity, I love cherry, whatever on your face."
00:19:45,00:19:48,It's so revealing knowing what you would have gone for there.
00:19:48,00:19:50,I didn't want to talk about my actual tattoos.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"OK, I will."
00:19:51,00:19:55,"So thug life across your tummy, they won't let you in,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,because of the yakusa thing.
00:19:57,00:19:59,So this website basically lists all of the onsen's
00:19:59,00:20:02,"that you can go to, and that will allow you in."
00:20:02,00:20:06,Do you think the pork broth onsen would be one of those tattoo
00:20:06,00:20:07,friendly ones?
00:20:07,00:20:09,"I think it might be, yeah, this is amazing."
00:20:09,00:20:10,This is--
00:20:10,00:20:11,There's a place.
00:20:11,00:20:13,"Well, it's the pork broth hot tub."
00:20:13,00:20:14,It's the unison spa.
00:20:14,00:20:18,"And they have a massive ramen bath, basically."
00:20:18,00:20:20,And it's just slightly porky hot water.
00:20:20,00:20:21,It sounds amazing.
00:20:21,00:20:23,It's the noodles in there.
00:20:23,00:20:25,"Well, they dangle above you a huge sculpture"
00:20:25,00:20:27,that looks like a pair of chopsticks holding noodles.
00:20:27,00:20:29,So it looks like you're about to--
00:20:29,00:20:29,What?
00:20:29,00:20:31,It's like you're a soft boiled egg.
00:20:31,00:20:32,It's like you're a--
00:20:32,00:20:33,It's like you're--
00:20:33,00:20:34,"And if you've seen my physique, that I"
00:20:34,00:20:37,"am like a soft boiled egg, basically."
00:20:37,00:20:38,But they've got a green tea bath.
00:20:38,00:20:41,"They've got a sake bath, which is very slightly sake."
00:20:41,00:20:42,"It's not obviously not all sake,"
00:20:42,00:20:44,because that'd be hugely expensive.
00:20:44,00:20:47,"They've got a coffee bath, which does not look appetizing."
00:20:47,00:20:49,Yeah.
00:20:49,00:20:51,It looks really good.
00:20:51,00:20:54,"It's safe if you have the runs, isn't it?"
00:20:54,00:20:54,"Oh, yes."
00:20:54,00:20:55,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:55,00:20:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:57,00:20:59,"Yeah, that sounds-- I'd love to go there."
00:20:59,00:21:00,It does look cool.
00:21:00,00:21:00,Sounds awesome.
00:21:00,00:21:03,"I have been to Anonsan a few, in fact, in Japan."
00:21:03,00:21:04,Really?
00:21:04,00:21:08,"There's a thing in Japan called Hadakano sukiai,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,which means naked camaraderie.
00:21:10,00:21:12,And the idea is everyone gets naked.
00:21:12,00:21:16,You're all together in a big sort of jacuzzi with no bubbles.
00:21:16,00:21:20,"And it means you're all emotionally together, open, honest."
00:21:20,00:21:22,That's the idea behind it.
00:21:22,00:21:25,"And I must admit, I went in, ran in, had a bath, came out,"
00:21:25,00:21:27,and went back to my room as quickly as I could.
00:21:27,00:21:28,"Oh, right."
00:21:28,00:21:29,You didn't have any--
00:21:29,00:21:30,Not very communal for you then.
00:21:30,00:21:32,I don't speak Japanese.
00:21:32,00:21:35,"But there are other ways of communicating, then."
00:21:35,00:21:37,"Yeah, but they could share ads at the best of times"
00:21:37,00:21:39,is difficult.
00:21:39,00:21:40,I'm just a hawker's back to the last fact.
00:21:40,00:21:44,You know that Andrew Lloyd Webber has a 30-person hot tub.
00:21:44,00:21:44,That's disgusting.
00:21:44,00:21:46,Does he?
00:21:46,00:21:48,"So it's a 30-person hot tub, meaning everyone"
00:21:48,00:21:51,gets a slot on the outer wall.
00:21:51,00:21:52,What's the alternative?
00:21:52,00:21:53,That it could--
00:21:53,00:21:57,"Bus format, where it is like six by four."
00:21:57,00:21:58,"Like, what's the--"
00:21:58,00:21:59,"Yeah, what?"
00:21:59,00:22:01,There's an aisle down the middle.
00:22:01,00:22:04,"Tickets, please."
00:22:04,00:22:06,Chicken of fish?
00:22:06,00:22:07,Nuts?
00:22:07,00:22:07,"No, we don't have any."
00:22:07,00:22:10,"I can just concede, yours."
00:22:10,00:22:12,"No, I don't-- yeah, I don't know what--"
00:22:12,00:22:12,"yeah, I don't know."
00:22:12,00:22:15,I think it must be that everyone gets a bit of wall.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"Otherwise, you're just popping about in the middle,"
00:22:16,00:22:18,"feeling like a lemon, yeah."
00:22:18,00:22:19,"I hate that bit, yeah."
00:22:19,00:22:20,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:20,00:22:21,Popping.
00:22:21,00:22:25,"There is a spa in the southern island of Tremaccushu,"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"and it opened up, I think, in 2017."
00:22:27,00:22:29,They'd announced it with big fanfare the year before.
00:22:29,00:22:31,"They said, this is going to be--"
00:22:31,00:22:32,"Actually, it wasn't a spa."
00:22:32,00:22:35,It was a spa-themed amusement park.
00:22:35,00:22:38,And they released some images of basically a rollercoaster
00:22:38,00:22:42,that's full of bath rollercoaster.
00:22:42,00:22:43,OK.
00:22:43,00:22:45,"And in a little bath, and that's your--"
00:22:45,00:22:48,"Yeah, you know you get in the carriage, and it's a bath."
00:22:48,00:22:49,And you're in a spa.
00:22:49,00:22:50,That sounds fun.
00:22:50,00:22:52,They were not sure at the time if it could be done.
00:22:52,00:22:56,"If it was beyond the can of humanity, but they did it."
00:22:56,00:23:00,"So you're in a compartment that is a jacuzzi, basically?"
00:23:00,00:23:03,I think they didn't quite correct the full rollercoaster bath.
00:23:03,00:23:04,How do you-- yeah.
00:23:04,00:23:06,"Because that would have been very heavy, obviously."
00:23:06,00:23:07,It would spill a lot.
00:23:07,00:23:08,It would spill a lot.
00:23:08,00:23:10,It's like an opposite log flume.
00:23:10,00:23:12,The water's in.
00:23:12,00:23:15,"If you're really unlucky, you'll be dry at the end of it."
00:23:15,00:23:16,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:16,00:23:19,"All the people waiting on the side, yeah."
00:23:19,00:23:21,"Yeah, that's very interesting."
00:23:21,00:23:23,"There's another one, which I wonder if that's there as well,"
00:23:23,00:23:24,"where you have an option of arriving,"
00:23:24,00:23:27,and they bury you up to your neck and sand.
00:23:27,00:23:30,"And it's quite hot sand so that you can get whatever,"
00:23:30,00:23:32,"you know, holistic therapy."
00:23:32,00:23:36,So have you ever done any sort of odd pampering things
00:23:36,00:23:38,like this?
00:23:38,00:23:41,"That you're willing to admit, too?"
00:23:41,00:23:44,I was quite intrigued by the beer baths that you can do.
00:23:44,00:23:46,"You know, in Europe, in the Czech Republic,"
00:23:46,00:23:48,there's a lot-- they're quite popular now.
00:23:48,00:23:51,"You're just like bathing, like, hoppy water,"
00:23:51,00:23:53,a bit like your ramen.
00:23:53,00:23:56,I wonder if you'd be interested in this thing in Japan.
00:23:56,00:23:59,It's the Nightingale Fese's Facial.
00:23:59,00:24:01,"Now, it's not what it sounds like."
00:24:01,00:24:04,"It's Fese's from the Japanese Busch Wabler, which"
00:24:04,00:24:05,is not a true nightingale.
00:24:05,00:24:10,"Oh, thank god."
00:24:10,00:24:15,"In Japanese, it's brilliantly called Uguisu No Fun."
00:24:15,00:24:16,Right.
00:24:16,00:24:19,"And apparently-- anyone around you, because you stink of shit."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"Apparently, Victoria Beckham is a proponent of it."
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Oh, no."
00:24:23,00:24:24,Wow.
00:24:24,00:24:24,OK.
00:24:24,00:24:25,That's extreme pampering things.
00:24:25,00:24:28,"I read about the crying therapy rooms,"
00:24:28,00:24:29,which seems really nice.
00:24:29,00:24:32,The whole idea is to make you a sad as you could possibly be.
00:24:32,00:24:35,So you go in and you sit down and there's just sad movies
00:24:35,00:24:38,"playing on the screen, and someone sits next to you,"
00:24:38,00:24:40,"just going to ask really sad, isn't it?"
00:24:40,00:24:43,And then they hand you tissues as you're crying.
00:24:43,00:24:45,Just me.
00:24:45,00:24:46,OK.
00:24:46,00:24:47,Give that one some else.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"Oh, my god."
00:24:48,00:24:49,"Oh, that sounds nice."
00:24:49,00:24:50,So we've got-- have a good cry.
00:24:50,00:24:52,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:52,00:24:53,"Yeah, I'd buy that."
00:24:53,00:24:56,"Just going back to Onsen, so these baths,"
00:24:56,00:24:59,"would you eat an Onsen Tamago, which"
00:24:59,00:25:04,"is a traditional Japanese egg, which is cooked in a Onsen?"
00:25:04,00:25:06,You put your egg in a rope net.
00:25:06,00:25:09,"You put it in the Onsen, and the water's about 70 degrees,"
00:25:09,00:25:13,and you leave it in for 30 to 40 minutes.
00:25:13,00:25:14,And then it's done.
00:25:14,00:25:14,Question?
00:25:14,00:25:15,Yeah.
00:25:15,00:25:18,Because there are two ways of cooking eggs in water.
00:25:18,00:25:20,Shell on and shell off.
00:25:20,00:25:23,"So are we poaching this, bad boy, are we?"
00:25:23,00:25:25,"No, this is, I believe it's shell on, I think."
00:25:25,00:25:27,"Oh, that's fine."
00:25:27,00:25:29,"Shell on, wow, there you go."
00:25:29,00:25:31,The audience has spoken shell on.
00:25:31,00:25:32,"People in it, it can be in a bath."
00:25:32,00:25:35,"It's not just a water bath, like a battery."
00:25:35,00:25:36,It's an actual Onsen.
00:25:36,00:25:41,"And also, the eggs have a unique silky custard texture."
00:25:41,00:25:42,I bet they do.
00:25:42,00:25:42,Yeah.
00:25:42,00:25:43,I would eat that.
00:25:43,00:25:44,I'm sorry.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"Can I just ask the person, was it a lady in the audience?"
00:25:46,00:25:48,"She said, Shell on, have you had one of these?"
00:25:48,00:25:49,They're really good.
00:25:49,00:25:49,They're really good.
00:25:49,00:25:50,There you go.
00:25:50,00:25:52,"You can't, you know, like a poached egg."
00:25:52,00:25:54,There's that like bit of white that never gets cooked.
00:25:54,00:25:56,And it's someone's like flamed on your plate.
00:25:56,00:25:57,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:57,00:26:00,Looks like a dementor in the water as it's boiling.
00:26:00,00:26:02,I've never seen a poached egg that hasn't got it.
00:26:02,00:26:03,Why do we put order this?
00:26:03,00:26:03,It's foul.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"Oh, I love a poached egg."
00:26:05,00:26:05,You do?
00:26:05,00:26:07,"Yeah, okay."
00:26:07,00:26:09,"But they're just like, if it's in its wrapper,"
00:26:09,00:26:10,I don't mind where it's been.
00:26:10,00:26:11,It's wrapped.
00:26:11,00:26:15,"I'd have a, I'd have a, if there was a banana, a banana in at the same time,"
00:26:15,00:26:17,"pop that in the net, I don't mind."
00:26:17,00:26:18,Yeah.
00:26:18,00:26:21,"Because it's been up her, up her chicken's bum, hasn't it, right?"
00:26:21,00:26:22,"Right, let's not get fussy, you know."
00:26:22,00:26:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:25,00:26:26,"I wish I had wrapped it up, I'll be honest."
00:26:26,00:26:27,Let's go.
00:26:27,00:26:29,But I just want the other weird spot thing.
00:26:29,00:26:33,"There was that bullseam and hair treatment, right?"
00:26:33,00:26:34,Okay.
00:26:34,00:26:36,Did you hear it read about this in Chelsea?
00:26:36,00:26:36,No.
00:26:36,00:26:37,In Chelsea?
00:26:37,00:26:38,Yeah.
00:26:38,00:26:39,Okay.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"It was a hair mask, basically."
00:26:41,00:26:43,"In 2008, 2009."
00:26:43,00:26:44,Hair mask?
00:26:44,00:26:44,Yeah.
00:26:44,00:26:48,It was this place called Harry's Salon in Chelsea.
00:26:48,00:26:55,"It offered a 45-minute Aberdeen organic hair treatment, which was Aberdeen Angus,"
00:26:55,00:26:57,like good quality.
00:26:57,00:26:59,Bull comes.
00:26:59,00:27:00,Stuff.
00:27:00,00:27:05,"Which women would like, I don't know, I guess, would pay like a lot of money to have,"
00:27:05,00:27:09,"like, lathered over their hair, and would just like sit with it for 45 minutes."
00:27:09,00:27:11,"And apparently, it was amazing."
00:27:11,00:27:11,Really?
00:27:11,00:27:13,"And it made the hair silky and smooth, and--"
00:27:13,00:27:18,"But I have made head-in shoulders too in one shampoo and conditioner, and that makes my hair silky and smooth."
00:27:18,00:27:22,"Andy, are there levels of silkeness and smoothness that I've not matched yet?"
00:27:22,00:27:22,You haven't lived.
00:27:22,00:27:26,"I can imagine one of these women from Chelsea going into the countryside afterwards,"
00:27:26,00:27:30,"and walking through a field, and all the female cows are like, do you smell something?"
00:27:30,00:27:31,Yeah.
00:27:31,00:27:39,"Well, it's funny to say that, because the people that ran this Salon,"
00:27:39,00:27:42,"told the Metro a new, sorry, these pervert fraudsters, yeah, it's gone."
00:27:42,00:27:48,"These quacks said to the Metro that the semen is refrigerated before use, and doesn't smell."
00:27:48,00:27:50,"I mean, it is come, but it's not, you know--"
00:27:50,00:27:52,It's not going to stay refrigerated.
00:27:52,00:27:53,That's the problem.
00:27:53,00:27:56,The body heat is going to cause that to warm up.
00:27:56,00:27:57,"Yeah, but it's 45 minutes a bit."
00:27:57,00:28:01,"You were going to eat an egg from a bunch of people, like, what do you mean?"
00:28:01,00:28:03,"Like, don't get all--"
00:28:03,00:28:05,We do need to move on to our next factory.
00:28:05,00:28:06,No!
00:28:06,00:28:06,"Oh, yeah."
00:28:06,00:28:07,But we ran him.
00:28:07,00:28:11,I've got the dreams of engineering stuff about how the Fukushima
00:28:11,00:28:14,reacted dealt with its water after the terrible incident there.
00:28:14,00:28:15,But I'll save it.
00:28:15,00:28:16,You save it.
00:28:16,00:28:17,It's fascinating.
00:28:17,00:28:18,They built an underground wall with ice.
00:28:18,00:28:19,"Oh, he's going for it."
00:28:19,00:28:20,He's moving on.
00:28:20,00:28:27,"OK, we do need to move on."
00:28:27,00:28:31,"So it is time for fact number three, and that is--"
00:28:31,00:28:32,"Oh, it's Andy."
00:28:32,00:28:34,So--
00:28:34,00:28:38,"After the terrible incident at Fukushima,"
00:28:38,00:28:41,"the engineers, they're pulled off a miracle, a miracle,"
00:28:41,00:28:42,of preventing the radioactive.
00:28:42,00:28:47,"So they've got, imagine, a 1.5-kilometer radius circle."
00:28:47,00:28:50,"Oh, 30 meters underground filled with frozen brine."
00:28:50,00:28:51,Get off your phone.
00:28:51,00:28:52,Come on.
00:28:52,00:28:54,How's your phone?
00:28:54,00:28:58,I'll try to start against shock of its two seconds.
00:28:58,00:28:59,"OK, anyway."
00:28:59,00:29:00,Sorry.
00:29:00,00:29:03,"My fact is, the first named man who sent a letter"
00:29:03,00:29:06,bomb only invented it to get back at people
00:29:06,00:29:09,who had rejected all his other ideas for inventions.
00:29:09,00:29:12,So this is very funny.
00:29:12,00:29:14,I love this guy.
00:29:14,00:29:16,He's a very interesting historical figure.
00:29:16,00:29:18,"His name was Martin Eckenberg, and I was on the website"
00:29:18,00:29:21,"of the Clapham Society, which is a great website all about Clapham,"
00:29:21,00:29:23,"which is a part of South London, where I used to live."
00:29:23,00:29:28,"And he was a Swedish scientist, Martin Eckenberg, born in 1870."
00:29:28,00:29:33,He was kind of a gifted inventor in some ways.
00:29:33,00:29:36,"His ideas were decent, but the other problem that he had,"
00:29:36,00:29:38,"personally, was that he was a liar."
00:29:38,00:29:39,He was a cheat.
00:29:39,00:29:43,He claimed qualifications he didn't have.
00:29:43,00:29:45,He'd been kicked out of Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology
00:29:45,00:29:46,specifically for cheating.
00:29:46,00:29:47,He was a badden.
00:29:47,00:29:48,He was a badden.
00:29:48,00:29:49,He was a badden.
00:29:49,00:29:50,Fucking legend.
00:29:50,00:29:52,So free thinker.
00:29:52,00:29:53,A free thinker.
00:29:53,00:29:55,Outside the box kind of guy.
00:29:55,00:29:56,"But still, this didn't hold him back that much,"
00:29:56,00:29:59,because he moved to one of the nicest houses in Clapham.
00:29:59,00:30:02,It was this really beautiful mansion he moved to.
00:30:02,00:30:05,That's not the point of the fact.
00:30:05,00:30:07,"It's been replaced by flats now, so you can't go and visit it."
00:30:07,00:30:08,"But if you were, that's weird."
00:30:08,00:30:10,And you should be on a terror list.
00:30:10,00:30:12,"And then in 1905, if you thought, right,"
00:30:12,00:30:15,I'm going to get revenge on everyone who's turned down
00:30:15,00:30:17,"my ideas along the way, who turned me down for finance."
00:30:17,00:30:18,I am going to get back at you.
00:30:18,00:30:20,"And he's so basically created, started"
00:30:20,00:30:22,making his own letter bombs.
00:30:22,00:30:23,And there were packages sent through the post
00:30:23,00:30:24,to harm people before.
00:30:24,00:30:26,But I think he's the first named sort of--
00:30:26,00:30:28,I thought I think it was a bit unfair.
00:30:28,00:30:32,So like the first person that he really sent it to was a guy
00:30:32,00:30:35,"called London, who ran this company."
00:30:35,00:30:37,It was like an engineering company.
00:30:37,00:30:39,And Eckenberg had invented something
00:30:39,00:30:42,that could turn fish oil into engine oil.
00:30:42,00:30:44,And he thought it was going to make his millions.
00:30:44,00:30:45,But it failed.
00:30:45,00:30:47,"And so he thought, well, I'm going to get this guy London."
00:30:47,00:30:50,But the reason it failed is because the oil still
00:30:50,00:30:52,smelled a fish.
00:30:52,00:30:54,"So like if people put it in their cars,"
00:30:54,00:30:55,the car smelled a fish.
00:30:55,00:30:55,Right.
00:30:55,00:30:58,"So it's supposed to be that Harry isn't get that sent removed,"
00:30:58,00:30:59,but the pool's semen.
00:30:59,00:31:01,"Well, no, and ships that was going to be used on ships,"
00:31:01,00:31:03,"which have fish, obviously."
00:31:03,00:31:04,That's true.
00:31:04,00:31:05,"Hence the phrase, fish and ships."
00:31:05,00:31:06,"But yeah, that--"
00:31:06,00:31:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:09,00:31:11,"And then this guy, London, opens the packet."
00:31:11,00:31:13,"And it said, I read an article in the newspaper that"
00:31:13,00:31:16,"said, it rumbles and shook like thunder."
00:31:16,00:31:19,The director felt as if he had been hit by lightning
00:31:19,00:31:21,or tickled by lightning.
00:31:21,00:31:23,And intense flame burst out the box
00:31:23,00:31:26,"and burned his hands, arms, chest, and face terribly."
00:31:26,00:31:27,And his clothes went on fire.
00:31:27,00:31:29,"And the next day he got a postcard saying,"
00:31:29,00:31:33,a former employee has decided that you're ripe for the picking.
00:31:33,00:31:34,Yes.
00:31:34,00:31:36,What's interesting is that it's not
00:31:36,00:31:38,"as if he sent it from the post in the UK, which"
00:31:38,00:31:39,would be more traceable.
00:31:39,00:31:41,He went by boat back to Sweden.
00:31:41,00:31:43,"He assembled it there, sent it there,"
00:31:43,00:31:44,and then went back home.
00:31:44,00:31:46,So he really covered up his tracks.
00:31:46,00:31:48,But then he still set a postcard with his writing
00:31:48,00:31:51,identifiable on it to the person he'd just--
00:31:51,00:31:51,Yeah.
00:31:51,00:31:55,"I mean, he was caught for various quite stupid things"
00:31:55,00:31:55,like that.
00:31:55,00:31:56,Yeah.
00:31:56,00:31:59,Can I just rescind that I thought he was good?
00:31:59,00:32:00,"No, no."
00:32:00,00:32:02,"There's another thing as well, James,"
00:32:02,00:32:04,see if you still think he's good.
00:32:04,00:32:06,"When he was arrested, he claimed innocent."
00:32:06,00:32:08,"And then according to the New York Times,"
00:32:08,00:32:11,he lost his reason and was taken to an asylum.
00:32:11,00:32:14,He died two months later after his arrest
00:32:14,00:32:17,of what they said was apoplexy.
00:32:17,00:32:20,But the head of the Swedish detective service
00:32:20,00:32:22,"said that if he'd been sent back to Sweden,"
00:32:22,00:32:25,he would have also been tried for murdering his two wives.
00:32:25,00:32:26,Oh.
00:32:26,00:32:27,Right.
00:32:27,00:32:28,"Yeah, no, yeah."
00:32:28,00:32:29,How you feeling?
00:32:29,00:32:30,Sorry about that.
00:32:30,00:32:32,Let's get a live reaction from Jamie Morden sitting
00:32:32,00:32:32,right here.
00:32:32,00:32:33,Sounds fine.
00:32:33,00:32:34,Yeah.
00:32:34,00:32:35,Not too shabby.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"So apparently, what appears to have happened"
00:32:37,00:32:40,"is he poisoned his first two wives,"
00:32:40,00:32:41,and then he bribed the prison guards
00:32:41,00:32:44,"to get him the same poison, which he then took himself."
00:32:44,00:32:45,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:45,00:32:46,Unique thinker.
00:32:46,00:32:49,"And interestingly, today, if you go to the police museum"
00:32:49,00:32:52,"in Stockholm, there's a giant wax work,"
00:32:52,00:32:56,like a replica human-sized wax replica of him standing there.
00:32:56,00:32:59,"And not only that, they have a bunch of things"
00:32:59,00:33:00,that were to do with the case.
00:33:00,00:33:02,"So one of the bombings, which was sent to the Swedish"
00:33:02,00:33:05,"export society, was opened up by a man called John Hammer."
00:33:05,00:33:07,And John Hammer's thumb was blown off
00:33:07,00:33:09,as part of opening the scene.
00:33:09,00:33:11,"And if you go to the police museum in Stockholm,"
00:33:11,00:33:13,you can see the wax work of Morden Eckenberg.
00:33:13,00:33:16,And then you can see the actual thumb of John Hammer.
00:33:16,00:33:18,Thumbs up or thumbs down.
00:33:18,00:33:19,It's the--
00:33:19,00:33:19,"Yeah, he wasn't happy."
00:33:19,00:33:21,It's a definite thumbs down for me.
00:33:21,00:33:21,"It's, yeah."
00:33:21,00:33:23,"So it's very, very grim guy."
00:33:23,00:33:26,But he was an innovator of sorts.
00:33:26,00:33:28,"And as I say, people had been sending devices"
00:33:28,00:33:31,designed to hurt other people through the post for ages.
00:33:31,00:33:35,So the very first one was a thing called the bound box plot.
00:33:35,00:33:37,People were very worried about the weak party
00:33:37,00:33:39,"in the, I think, 18th century."
00:33:39,00:33:42,"And supposedly, that party were involved in some attempts"
00:33:42,00:33:43,to assassinate people.
00:33:43,00:33:44,Get this.
00:33:44,00:33:46,The very first ever thing sent through the post designed
00:33:46,00:33:48,"to harm someone, this bound box plot,"
00:33:48,00:33:51,"was a box full of, I think, the three pistols."
00:33:51,00:33:52,"When you open it, they all go off."
00:33:52,00:33:53,At you.
00:33:53,00:33:55,"Wow, I know."
00:33:55,00:33:55,And it was--
00:33:55,00:33:56,"Oh, my God."
00:33:56,00:34:00,"This is the story that it was thwarted by Jonathan Swift,"
00:34:00,00:34:02,"the author of ""Gull of his Travels."""
00:34:02,00:34:03,Yeah.
00:34:03,00:34:04,Because he was a political figure as well.
00:34:04,00:34:07,And he's supposedly noticed a thread on the box
00:34:07,00:34:09,and cut it before opening it.
00:34:09,00:34:13,"Oh, so he's the first red wire, blue wire cut moment"
00:34:13,00:34:15,that we've ever had for a bomb.
00:34:15,00:34:16,"Yeah, pretty cool."
00:34:16,00:34:19,And we talk about his books instead.
00:34:19,00:34:21,"But ""Eck and Berg"" was the first of a kind of new wave"
00:34:21,00:34:23,"where ""Gump out"" had been invented,"
00:34:23,00:34:25,"a post had improved, things like that."
00:34:25,00:34:26,And so there were anarchists.
00:34:26,00:34:28,"People were very, very worried about anarchists"
00:34:28,00:34:30,with their kind of cartoon-style bombs
00:34:30,00:34:31,that they'd be throwing.
00:34:31,00:34:32,Yeah.
00:34:32,00:34:35,"And he also invented a way to freeze dry milk, which"
00:34:35,00:34:36,is kind of similar to what we have today.
00:34:36,00:34:40,"So like instant custard, we wouldn't have it without him."
00:34:40,00:34:40,Really?
00:34:40,00:34:41,"Well, ""Eck and Berg."""
00:34:41,00:34:42,Wow.
00:34:42,00:34:44,"Jamie, you want to change your--"
00:34:44,00:34:46,"Because you go on often, but I know you don't mind custard,"
00:34:46,00:34:47,do you know?
00:34:47,00:34:49,"I'm a bit of custard, I mean, I'm--"
00:34:49,00:34:50,50/50.
00:34:50,00:34:51,It requires people.
00:34:51,00:34:54,"Now, I'll tell you why I think he's not a complete villain."
00:34:54,00:35:02,"So it's so interesting, which hills people choose to die on."
00:35:02,00:35:03,I find that really fascinating.
00:35:03,00:35:06,"I just kind of love the fact that through revenge,"
00:35:06,00:35:08,he invented something that was actually--
00:35:08,00:35:11,"I mean, not a good thing, but was--"
00:35:11,00:35:12,It was like a thing.
00:35:12,00:35:15,This silver lining is slimming down all the time.
00:35:15,00:35:17,I got to say.
00:35:17,00:35:20,"So it was for revenge, but he did event something really bad."
00:35:20,00:35:21,"Well, maybe it's just how my mind worked,"
00:35:21,00:35:25,"because I mean, I got quite heavily into revenge"
00:35:25,00:35:27,during my researching of this.
00:35:27,00:35:29,"So I was like, what else has revenge kind of created?"
00:35:29,00:35:34,And the rotary telephone is one thing that revenge has created.
00:35:34,00:35:39,"Yeah, because there was a guy called Alman Stroudger,"
00:35:39,00:35:41,and he was an undertaker in the late 19th century
00:35:41,00:35:43,in Kansas City.
00:35:43,00:35:46,"They were all manual switchboards at that point, obviously."
00:35:46,00:35:48,And he thought that the switchboard operators
00:35:48,00:35:52,"were deliberately fiddling with his connections,"
00:35:52,00:35:53,because--
00:35:53,00:35:57,"Wait, so you would call up and say, patch me through to this person."
00:35:57,00:36:01,"And he was convinced that this was being meddled with,"
00:36:01,00:36:05,"because the other undertakers across the town,"
00:36:05,00:36:08,I think their wife worked at the phone company.
00:36:08,00:36:12,"So someone dies, you put them through to the rival."
00:36:12,00:36:13,"And yeah, exactly."
00:36:13,00:36:14,So they were getting all the work.
00:36:14,00:36:16,"He was like, what's going on here?"
00:36:16,00:36:20,And so he invented the rotary telephone
00:36:20,00:36:21,to cut out the--
00:36:21,00:36:22,What was the one where you dial with this?
00:36:22,00:36:24,"Yeah, so you could dial it yourself."
00:36:24,00:36:24,That is amazing.
00:36:24,00:36:26,It's not amazing.
00:36:26,00:36:28,"Revenge, but not all bad."
00:36:28,00:36:29,OK.
00:36:29,00:36:30,It's like those spite houses.
00:36:30,00:36:31,"You know, spite houses."
00:36:31,00:36:33,And it's just so cool that something
00:36:33,00:36:35,that you build to screw someone over
00:36:35,00:36:38,ends up being worth more than the house that--
00:36:38,00:36:39,"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:36:39,00:36:41,I just love stuff like that.
00:36:41,00:36:42,"Just jumping back to Leatherbond's for a second,"
00:36:42,00:36:46,I've discovered that the former prime minister--
00:36:46,00:36:49,"well, a very long former prime minister, Anthony Eden--"
00:36:49,00:36:50,so prime minister of England--
00:36:50,00:36:53,he was almost killed by Leatherbond.
00:36:53,00:36:55,"Yeah, and this was prior to him being prime minister."
00:36:55,00:36:57,It was when he was foreign secretary.
00:36:57,00:37:02,And someone had hand-delivered a Leatherbond.
00:37:02,00:37:03,He took it.
00:37:03,00:37:05,"But he saw, oh, this looks a bit boring."
00:37:05,00:37:07,So he put it in his briefcase.
00:37:07,00:37:10,And he had it for 24 hours.
00:37:10,00:37:11,"He went home, he didn't open it."
00:37:11,00:37:13,He just had a whole day of not opening it.
00:37:13,00:37:14,And then Scotland got--
00:37:14,00:37:15,And that's a looked boring.
00:37:15,00:37:16,"Yeah, he thought it looked like a circular."
00:37:16,00:37:18,It looked like something that might have been dropped off.
00:37:18,00:37:20,And it was a generic thing.
00:37:20,00:37:21,"Oh, right, OK."
00:37:21,00:37:23,"And so then Scotland Yard got in contact and said,"
00:37:23,00:37:26,we're worried that something might have been sent to you
00:37:26,00:37:27,that is a bomb.
00:37:27,00:37:29,And he still didn't look at it.
00:37:29,00:37:31,"And it was his secretary who eventually went,"
00:37:31,00:37:32,that might be a bomb.
00:37:32,00:37:34,And then-- and it was.
00:37:34,00:37:36,And so it was just purely his absolute boredom
00:37:36,00:37:39,towards his letter that the most interesting letter
00:37:39,00:37:42,he ever received actually had.
00:37:42,00:37:43,"And that's the thing is, they're"
00:37:43,00:37:45,designed to go off when you open them out there.
00:37:45,00:37:47,"So you can carry them around, and it's fine."
00:37:47,00:37:52,"So for instance, you're told that if you work in a government"
00:37:52,00:37:54,"office and they might happen, a lot of people"
00:37:54,00:37:56,"when they get a letter that they're not sure about,"
00:37:56,00:37:58,"they put it in water, because they"
00:37:58,00:37:59,"think that's what you're supposed to do with a bomb,"
00:37:59,00:38:01,but you're absolutely not supposed to put it in water.
00:38:01,00:38:03,Because some of the explosives will explode
00:38:03,00:38:05,if you put them in a big-- is that so?
00:38:05,00:38:08,Also renders the letter completely illegible.
00:38:08,00:38:09,Exactly.
00:38:09,00:38:12,I've got stupid idea.
00:38:12,00:38:13,There are some tips.
00:38:13,00:38:14,"There are some useful tips, actually."
00:38:14,00:38:19,So warning signs include excess postage.
00:38:19,00:38:22,"Like, why is someone spending so much money on their parcel?"
00:38:22,00:38:24,Because you don't want to risk it getting returned to you.
00:38:24,00:38:27,Right.
00:38:27,00:38:29,No return address.
00:38:29,00:38:32,So the really clever bombers will leave the return address
00:38:32,00:38:33,off.
00:38:33,00:38:36,I think I would put the return address as my number two
00:38:36,00:38:38,nemesis.
00:38:38,00:38:39,"Yeah, nice."
00:38:39,00:38:40,Such a good idea.
00:38:40,00:38:41,Yeah.
00:38:41,00:38:42,Such a good idea.
00:38:42,00:38:44,Number two--
00:38:44,00:38:45,I think it's a long-old list.
00:38:45,00:38:48,"It's a long-old list, journalist."
00:38:48,00:38:49,Bad spelling.
00:38:49,00:38:50,Oh.
00:38:50,00:38:52,"Because there are a lot of people sending these things,"
00:38:52,00:38:54,and maybe I'm going to slide off letter bombs.
00:38:54,00:38:57,They're not the brightest buttons.
00:38:57,00:38:57,Really?
00:38:57,00:38:58,"Yeah, bad spelling."
00:38:58,00:39:00,Because they've just constructed a bomb.
00:39:00,00:39:02,It feels like you've got a basic--
00:39:02,00:39:03,Fair to get one.
00:39:03,00:39:04,What are you doing?
00:39:04,00:39:07,They might have studied the sciences and not the humanities.
00:39:07,00:39:08,"Yes, that's the point."
00:39:08,00:39:10,There are so many kinds of intelligence.
00:39:10,00:39:16,"Addressed personal, confidential, or do not x-ray."
00:39:16,00:39:21,That's wrong.
00:39:21,00:39:23,And the final one-- just for any of that
00:39:23,00:39:25,"have slipped through those many holes in the Swiss cheese,"
00:39:25,00:39:29,ticking sounds.
00:39:29,00:39:32,"Protrooting wires, OK, yeah, or aluminium foil."
00:39:32,00:39:35,"Or if it says ""acme bomb,"" on the front."
00:39:35,00:39:38,"If it's dropped off by a coyote who looks pleased with himself,"
00:39:38,00:39:40,that's another one.
00:39:40,00:39:41,I did read.
00:39:41,00:39:43,There was a-- what's the name of the journalist?
00:39:43,00:39:45,Slasov Zizek.
00:39:45,00:39:46,Slasov Zizek.
00:39:46,00:39:49,"Yeah, so he wrote this piece."
00:39:49,00:39:50,And the opening anecdote of the piece
00:39:50,00:39:53,at the top winner in the contest for the greatest blunder
00:39:53,00:39:56,of 1998 was a Latin American patriotic terrorist
00:39:56,00:39:58,who sent a letter bomb to a US consulate
00:39:58,00:40:00,in order to protest against America
00:40:00,00:40:02,interfering local politics.
00:40:02,00:40:04,"As a conscientious citizen, he wrote his return address"
00:40:04,00:40:05,on the envelope.
00:40:05,00:40:07,"However, he did not put enough stamps on it."
00:40:07,00:40:09,So that post was returned to him.
00:40:09,00:40:11,"Forgetting he'd put it in, he opened it, and blew himself up."
00:40:11,00:40:14,"He did, and he did what James said."
00:40:14,00:40:16,"Now, who knows if that's apocryphal, but it's--"
00:40:16,00:40:17,What's his name?
00:40:17,00:40:19,"All the fingerprints of Jack Waz, anyway, near this."
00:40:19,00:40:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:22,00:40:23,I'll tell you what.
00:40:23,00:40:25,That was the first time Jack Waz and Slasov Zizek
00:40:25,00:40:29,have been mentioned in the same sentence together.
00:40:29,00:40:33,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:40:33,00:40:36,It is time for our final fact of the show.
00:40:36,00:40:37,And that is James.
00:40:37,00:40:39,"OK, my fact this week is that there"
00:40:39,00:40:42,is currently a scandal in Thailand.
00:40:42,00:40:46,After at least a dozen supposedly celibate monks
00:40:46,00:40:52,admitted to having sex with a woman called Mrs. Gulf.
00:40:52,00:40:54,"James, you're a keen golfer."
00:40:54,00:40:55,That's how I found this.
00:40:55,00:40:56,I was googling gol.
00:40:56,00:41:00,"No, no, no, no."
00:41:00,00:41:02,"Now, I just read this in the news,"
00:41:02,00:41:04,and I thought it's very amusing.
00:41:04,00:41:06,It is a lot of senior monks.
00:41:06,00:41:08,"I mean, not amusing, if you're a monk,"
00:41:08,00:41:11,"because obviously a lot of them have lost their livelihoods,"
00:41:11,00:41:14,"including some as high-ranking as frat dep, which"
00:41:14,00:41:16,means angelic level.
00:41:16,00:41:19,"So this goes to the very, very top."
00:41:19,00:41:21,And it turns out they've been having relationships
00:41:21,00:41:23,"with this woman who's called Mrs. Gulf,"
00:41:23,00:41:25,and they've been transferring money to her.
00:41:25,00:41:28,"And they've found this lady, and they"
00:41:28,00:41:33,"found over 80,000 photos of naked monks on her phone."
00:41:33,00:41:36,How do they know their monks?
00:41:36,00:41:38,Sorry to quibble.
00:41:38,00:41:40,I reckon there's a way.
00:41:40,00:41:41,You reckon there's a way?
00:41:41,00:41:42,It's probably a way.
00:41:42,00:41:43,I reckon there's a way.
00:41:43,00:41:45,Probably it's the hair style down there.
00:41:45,00:41:49,"It's like a tons, yeah."
00:41:49,00:41:50,"80,000 is a lot."
00:41:50,00:41:52,Not necessarily all different monks.
00:41:52,00:41:54,They could have been--
00:41:54,00:41:56,I don't even know if I have that amount of storage on my phone
00:41:56,00:41:57,"for 80,000 photos."
00:41:57,00:41:58,"Yes, what was their data cloud like?"
00:41:58,00:42:00,This is really interesting.
00:42:00,00:42:01,Is she in the cloud?
00:42:01,00:42:02,She's using the cloud.
00:42:02,00:42:05,"So yeah, and the reason she's called Mrs. Gulf"
00:42:05,00:42:08,is because this is like common in Thailand
00:42:08,00:42:10,for people to have little short nicknames.
00:42:10,00:42:14,And you're kind of given them as a child by your parents.
00:42:14,00:42:16,And they don't really mean anything.
00:42:16,00:42:18,"It might be that this person's parents love Gulf,"
00:42:18,00:42:23,but more likely they just take a Western word that kind of sounds
00:42:23,00:42:24,fun or trendy or whatever.
00:42:24,00:42:26,And they just call that.
00:42:26,00:42:28,The most famous Thai person in the world
00:42:28,00:42:30,probably is Lisa from Blackpink.
00:42:30,00:42:32,And her nickname is Pockpack.
00:42:32,00:42:34,So they're just mostly just sounds
00:42:34,00:42:36,or they might be little words from other languages.
00:42:36,00:42:38,But it's just like a little nickname.
00:42:38,00:42:39,But people go by it in real life.
00:42:39,00:42:42,"Like as adults, you might still be known as that nickname."
00:42:42,00:42:43,Yeah.
00:42:43,00:42:46,But so this is an unbelievably fascinating story.
00:42:46,00:42:50,This one woman went around so many of these different monasteries
00:42:50,00:42:53,"and managed to talk in what were effectively,"
00:42:53,00:42:57,"I'm assuming, celibate monks into engaging not only in sex,"
00:42:57,00:42:59,but also having photos taken.
00:42:59,00:43:01,"And the top monks, some of them have fled the country."
00:43:01,00:43:03,We don't know quite where they are.
00:43:03,00:43:05,And they haven't said why they've done that.
00:43:05,00:43:09,"They're now investigating 300,000 other Buddhist monks"
00:43:09,00:43:11,in Thailand off the back of this
00:43:11,00:43:12,to see whether or not they're involved.
00:43:12,00:43:15,And she got a lot of money off the back of this.
00:43:15,00:43:18,"Was her own extortion, sort of, I'll release the photos."
00:43:18,00:43:19,So the photos would be shown back to them
00:43:19,00:43:21,and then they would have to pay money.
00:43:21,00:43:23,And a lot of the monks have been acquitted
00:43:23,00:43:25,where the police have decided that actually you just
00:43:25,00:43:28,gave her money because she was pleading for the money
00:43:28,00:43:30,and didn't engage in sexual activity.
00:43:30,00:43:31,And trust me.
00:43:31,00:43:33,"But you know how much money allegedly,"
00:43:33,00:43:39,she has netted the equivalent of $11.9 million from this.
00:43:39,00:43:41,"There's a lot of money in munching, isn't that?"
00:43:41,00:43:43,Isn't that?
00:43:43,00:43:45,"Yeah, that's a bigger career than I thought."
00:43:45,00:43:49,"Like no, my career advisor did not say,"
00:43:49,00:43:50,have you considered becoming a monk?
00:43:50,00:43:52,And I think it's like quite a big deal in Thailand
00:43:52,00:43:55,"because if you're a Buddhist, you"
00:43:55,00:43:57,"think that if someone becomes a monk,"
00:43:57,00:43:59,then they kind of automatically sort
00:43:59,00:44:02,of develop this strong resistance to temptation
00:44:02,00:44:03,and that kind of thing.
00:44:03,00:44:05,And so to find out that they haven't
00:44:05,00:44:07,was quite a big deal for a lot of people.
00:44:07,00:44:08,Yeah.
00:44:08,00:44:12,"I think this is very interesting, because I started reading about--"
00:44:12,00:44:13,"by the way, James, there's a very hard factor"
00:44:13,00:44:16,"to Google, like naughty monks."
00:44:16,00:44:19,And naughty nuns is actually even worse.
00:44:19,00:44:22,It's an even harder legit Google.
00:44:22,00:44:23,"But basically, there was a lot of this"
00:44:23,00:44:29,"in the 16th century in England, because monks and nuns"
00:44:29,00:44:32,and monasteries and nunneries were seen as hoppets of sin.
00:44:32,00:44:34,"And the idea was, they're all on the take."
00:44:34,00:44:37,"They're all selling pardoning for sins, that kind of thing,"
00:44:37,00:44:39,like they're all--
00:44:39,00:44:40,And they're all shacking up.
00:44:40,00:44:41,And there were some institutions--
00:44:41,00:44:42,Cancer Reformation.
00:44:42,00:44:43,"Like, Cancer Reformation, right."
00:44:43,00:44:46,But I think we've all been conned into thinking
00:44:46,00:44:49,"that monks and nuns are inherently sort of naughty figures,"
00:44:49,00:44:51,because they're absolutely not.
00:44:51,00:44:54,And I think we fall off a Henry VIII era propaganda.
00:44:54,00:44:55,And I'm blowing the lid off this.
00:44:55,00:44:59,"Not enough people talk about it, but I'm not afraid to."
00:44:59,00:45:02,"I'd just like to reference the paper by Christian Knudsen,"
00:45:02,00:45:04,"Sodomitic monks and other dissolution myths,"
00:45:04,00:45:07,the late medieval monastic decline narrative revisited.
00:45:07,00:45:08,And it is a belting read.
00:45:08,00:45:09,It's really good.
00:45:09,00:45:12,And can you tell us more about the Fukushima disaster?
00:45:12,00:45:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:45:15,00:45:21,"But like, Henry VIII wanted to dissolve the monasteries."
00:45:21,00:45:25,"I mean, because they owned a huge proportion of English land,"
00:45:25,00:45:25,right?
00:45:25,00:45:27,There was so wealthy.
00:45:27,00:45:29,"And Henry VIII thought, I'm going to discredit"
00:45:29,00:45:32,ecclesiastical institutions anyway I can.
00:45:32,00:45:35,"And every monastery in England, in 1535 and 6,"
00:45:35,00:45:37,got a visit from bureaucrats who were trying
00:45:37,00:45:41,to record every dubious incidents of behavior by a monk
00:45:41,00:45:42,or a nun they could.
00:45:42,00:45:44,"And there were some cases, absolutely."
00:45:44,00:45:47,There were some cases where monks had been playing the field
00:45:47,00:45:47,or whatever it is.
00:45:47,00:45:50,But they also had to come up with new crimes.
00:45:50,00:45:51,So they found dozens of instances
00:45:51,00:45:54,"recorded of voluntary pollution, which"
00:45:54,00:45:55,is just sort of playing with yourself.
00:45:55,00:45:57,But it's not.
00:45:57,00:46:00,"In one priori, West Acres, 76% of the monks"
00:46:00,00:46:02,were labeled incontinent by which they
00:46:02,00:46:05,mean romantically incontinent.
00:46:05,00:46:09,But 10 of those 13 were for just enjoying some cowl billiards.
00:46:09,00:46:12,"And so it's not cow, the cow goes in your head, doesn't it?"
00:46:12,00:46:13,You know what I mean?
00:46:13,00:46:14,Hardly ever.
00:46:14,00:46:19,I just think it's really interesting.
00:46:19,00:46:20,And I think we shouldn't fall for it.
00:46:20,00:46:22,"OK, well, we won't."
00:46:22,00:46:26,"But also, like, I'm a Catholic."
00:46:26,00:46:28,"I mean, you know, lapsed carefully."
00:46:28,00:46:29,"Like, you can do anything if you say sorry."
00:46:29,00:46:31,That's like the point.
00:46:31,00:46:31,Yes.
00:46:31,00:46:36,"But actually, the penance was quite severe, or it could be."
00:46:36,00:46:40,"So Richard Gray, one man called Richard Gray, a medieval England,"
00:46:40,00:46:42,he was found guilty of having sex with a nun.
00:46:42,00:46:44,And he was sentenced to being flogged while walking
00:46:44,00:46:48,"around Stanford church on four Sundays in a row,"
00:46:48,00:46:51,carrying a candle while dressed only in linen garments.
00:46:51,00:46:54,And then he had to make a barefoot pilgrimage
00:46:54,00:46:59,to Lincoln Cathedral from wherever he lived.
00:46:59,00:47:03,"Wow, that's a movable feast of a punishment, isn't it?"
00:47:03,00:47:04,"You just want a feast of art, right?"
00:47:04,00:47:06,I'm going to get a flat just outside Lincoln.
00:47:06,00:47:12,"Yeah, that was quite a mess for me to not say"
00:47:12,00:47:14,where he actually lived in my notes.
00:47:14,00:47:14,"No, that's not true."
00:47:14,00:47:18,"But then he, and then after that, he didn't do what he was supposed"
00:47:18,00:47:20,"to do, and they've excommunicated him."
00:47:20,00:47:23,"But in those days, being excommunicated was a big, old deal."
00:47:23,00:47:24,Right.
00:47:24,00:47:26,"Like, because it can't amaze you can't go to heaven,"
00:47:26,00:47:28,but it also amaze you can't be baptized.
00:47:28,00:47:31,"And you can't get married, you can't do all sorts of different things."
00:47:31,00:47:33,"Yeah, and actually, quite often, the women"
00:47:33,00:47:34,were punished more than the men.
00:47:34,00:47:38,"So two that happened quite close to each other,"
00:47:38,00:47:41,a guy called Nicholas Plymouth was a monk who
00:47:41,00:47:44,"has committed adultery with a Tanner's wife,"
00:47:44,00:47:47,and he was ordered to remain silent for one week.
00:47:47,00:47:49,"And around the same time, someone"
00:47:49,00:47:51,called Alice Longspray was sentenced
00:47:51,00:47:55,to a year of strict confinement after an affair with a priest.
00:47:55,00:47:56,That was double standards.
00:47:56,00:47:58,"It is double standards, yeah."
00:47:58,00:48:00,"James, you've spent time in Bhutan."
00:48:00,00:48:01,I have.
00:48:01,00:48:04,Did you ever hear of the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom
00:48:04,00:48:05,while you were out there?
00:48:05,00:48:07,"That's what they still call me that, man."
00:48:07,00:48:12,I wonder when the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom
00:48:12,00:48:14,is going to return.
00:48:14,00:48:20,So it's referring to amongst penis.
00:48:20,00:48:30,But so a question who your real friends were out there.
00:48:30,00:48:35,It was straights that they yelled at me at the streets.
00:48:35,00:48:36,Is that right?
00:48:36,00:48:37,"There was this guy, Druckper Cunley,"
00:48:37,00:48:39,and he was in the 1400s.
00:48:39,00:48:41,"Yeah, I've been to his church."
00:48:41,00:48:43,"You've been to his church, God, so he was interesting,"
00:48:43,00:48:46,"because he was known as the Saint of 5,000 women."
00:48:46,00:48:48,He was a fertility saint.
00:48:48,00:48:51,The idea was he thought sex should be incorporated
00:48:51,00:48:53,into reaching enlightenment.
00:48:53,00:48:56,And so classic.
00:48:56,00:48:59,"Yeah, you would meet the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom"
00:48:59,00:49:02,"as part of your hello to him, basically."
00:49:02,00:49:06,"And he was liked, but mad as fuck."
00:49:06,00:49:08,"Like, people genuinely thought he was."
00:49:08,00:49:09,And what I wanted--
00:49:09,00:49:11,It is known as the holy mad man or something like that.
00:49:11,00:49:13,"And he introduced this idea, which still goes on"
00:49:13,00:49:15,"in very spits of Bhutan today, which"
00:49:15,00:49:17,is that if you're setting up a new house
00:49:17,00:49:20,"and you need it to be blessed, you would basically graffiti,"
00:49:20,00:49:23,"fallists, put dig picks, all over, like,"
00:49:23,00:49:25,draw a penis all over the walls.
00:49:25,00:49:26,Did you see any--
00:49:26,00:49:28,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're on every house, Haslam."
00:49:28,00:49:29,Yeah.
00:49:29,00:49:31,In this particular town where he was from.
00:49:31,00:49:33,"And also, if you go into his church,"
00:49:33,00:49:36,a priest comes up to you with a giant fallace
00:49:36,00:49:38,and sort of touches you as if you'd
00:49:38,00:49:39,been knighted by the queen.
00:49:39,00:49:41,Rise.
00:49:41,00:49:41,Did you have that?
00:49:41,00:49:42,Yeah.
00:49:42,00:49:43,Wow.
00:49:43,00:49:44,Arise.
00:49:44,00:49:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:49:47,00:49:49,"If it's on every house, can you put it on a semi?"
00:49:49,00:49:49,Sorry.
00:49:49,00:49:50,Go on.
00:49:50,00:49:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:49:53,00:49:55,Do you want to know something cool about the first century
00:49:55,00:49:56,"saint, Thecla?"
00:49:56,00:49:57,"Yes, please."
00:49:57,00:49:57,"Yes, please."
00:49:57,00:49:58,"This was sent in by a listener, actually."
00:49:58,00:49:59,Lesson of Cat Brinker.
00:49:59,00:50:00,"So thanks, Cat, for this."
00:50:00,00:50:03,"This is the first century saint, Thecla."
00:50:03,00:50:06,She is the unofficial patron saint of computers
00:50:06,00:50:07,and the internet.
00:50:07,00:50:09,And can you work out why?
00:50:09,00:50:10,"It's going to be sex-connected, presumably."
00:50:10,00:50:13,Nope.
00:50:13,00:50:15,But you said it was to do with the internet.
00:50:15,00:50:15,"No, I know."
00:50:15,00:50:16,"No, I know."
00:50:16,00:50:18,What would a first century monk have to do with computers
00:50:18,00:50:19,and the internet?
00:50:19,00:50:21,She liked cats.
00:50:21,00:50:22,That's a really good one.
00:50:22,00:50:23,That's very close.
00:50:23,00:50:28,She was very racist all the time.
00:50:28,00:50:32,"It's because her name, Thecla, sounds like the Spanish word,"
00:50:32,00:50:34,"for a key, on a keyboard."
00:50:34,00:50:35,Thecla.
00:50:35,00:50:36,OK.
00:50:36,00:50:37,"Ah, Thecla."
00:50:37,00:50:39,You've not just wasted their time.
00:50:39,00:50:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:50:42,00:50:43,Unbelievable.
00:50:43,00:50:45,"If you'd like to know some other grabs of the word Thecla,"
00:50:45,00:50:48,I've got loads.
00:50:48,00:50:53,[MUSIC PLAYING]
