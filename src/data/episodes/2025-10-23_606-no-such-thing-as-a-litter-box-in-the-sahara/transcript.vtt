00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.560
 Hello, you lovely club fish member on Patreon.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.840
 Here is your announcement for the big news

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.840
 of changes happening to no such thing as a fish.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.040
 Well, first of all, the main thing to say to you guys

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.280
 is that if you want to stay exactly where you are,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.520
 then nothing changes.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.280
 Well, very slightly changes.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.720
 We are gonna move the bonus content to Wednesdays

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.560
 instead of Tuesdays.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.680
 That's just to make our workflow a little bit easier.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.520
 But every other week you will still get your episode

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.720
 of "Droppers Align" and in fact, "Droppers Align"

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.160
 will now become fortnightly.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.120
 We won't be doing any of the little bits and pieces

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.320
 instead, this is a "Droppers Align" zone.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.040
 If you would like to get involved with any other tiers,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.280
 so that is plenty more fish,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.960
 which includes video "Droppers Align"

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.000
 and full, more or less unedited episodes of fish

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.280
 then go to our "Plency More Fish" tier.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.880
 And if you would like to be a friend of the podcast,

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.520
 then the top tier is for you.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.240
 You will become custodian of a fact.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.720
 You will be able to come to our three monthly Zoom quizzes

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.600
 and you will also get into the archive

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 where we put basically the Museum of Fish.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.080
 So lots of other places you can go.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.200
 There's merch there as well.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 So go and explore if you want to.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.840
 But if not, then please stay here, "Droppers Align"

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.680
 and your every episodes of fish will stay exactly

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.840
 as they were.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.480
 Okay, on with the podcast.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.080
 (upbeat music)

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.160
 (upbeat music)

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.080
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.680
 (upbeat music)

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.800
 Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 of "No Such Thing As A Fish" a weekly podcast.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.200
 This week coming to you live

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.680
 from the London Podcast Festival.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.320
 (audience cheering)

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.600
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.440
 James Harkin, and Jamie Morton.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.760
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.400
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Jamie.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.640
 Iconic Fespian, "Bear Bome" had a walk on part

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.320
 in every single production at the "Geal Good Theater"

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.400
 in London's West End for 20 years.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.440
 And, fittingly, had a front page obituary

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.760
 in the stage newspaper.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.960
 He was also a cat.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.280
 (audience laughing)

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.480
 I know, I mean, what a hack, I'm sorry.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.760
 That is a Fespian cat, that is.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.840
 Yeah.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.960
 For people listening on the podcast next week,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.680
 or whenever it goes out, can you describe

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.720
 the cat who was Jamie?

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.800
 We've got a tabby cat, he's male,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.360
 and he's lounging on stage at the "Geal Good."

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.720
 Looking very happy with his beautifully lit,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.240
 it's black and white, it's very,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.200
 it's also like a headshot, but it's a full body.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 (audience laughing)

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.040
 Yeah.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.200
 Shays long kind of look.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.960
 That little, is that a photo of a tail?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.200
 He's like saying, "Paint me like one of your French cats."

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200
 It's giving that energy to them.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.720
 Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the way it is.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.760
 Same opulence as well around it in terms of the architecture.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.680
 Yeah, I mean, I love this cat.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.960
 So, I'm not gonna lie.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.160
 I fall in love with him this week.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.880
 I've never heard of him before, but now I love him.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.160
 So, when you say walk on roll in all the plays,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.560
 was that official?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.640
 Was he written into?

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.480
 No.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.320
 No.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.560
 So, he was the resident, is it like Mouser?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.560
 Is that the name?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.040
 Yeah, Mouser name, that they caught the mice.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.280
 And he just would randomly walk on stage during productions,

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.600
 which being a theatre director, I find chilling,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.280
 'cause you work so hard to kind of make a show good,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.200
 then some fucking cats just like wandering in front of everyone.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.520
 And what did the actors think of it?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.400
 Well, the actors loved this cat, almost uniformly.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.280
 I think there wasn't a single actor who didn't love beer bone,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.440
 'cause he is, as I said, a total hag.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.760
 I mean, look at him, but yeah, he was loved.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.880
 And people got very attached to him.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.920
 So much so that he had this obituary

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.960
 on the front page of the stage newspaper.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.200
 And people like Penelope Keith wrote obituries for him,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.880
 like loads of actors kind of got involved.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.960
 The stage, I hadn't heard of the stage,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.640
 is that like the main main thing that you can get on it?

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.000
 The Bible, Dan, honestly.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.840
 I love that.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.000
 No, I had actually heard of it.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.280
 I was just being them for a second, yeah.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.880
 Then they've heard of it too.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.240
 Oh, so it is just being staged.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.600
 It's a great news paper, yeah.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.520
 No, it is, it's a great news paper.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.600
 It's behind a play wall, but it's great.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.920
 Okay, a lot of people did love beer bone,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.800
 but beer bone would arrive on stage at moments

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.880
 that weren't necessarily good for a scene, you know?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.040
 There was one play that was on, which was called

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.040
 the House of Bernard Alba, which had a lot of sand

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.240
 all over the stage, which beer bone was the ultimate pooing ground.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.760
 It was, so that was not good, right?

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.600
 Well, it was not good for who, we loved it.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.600
 It adds realism to the play.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600
 That's where it's set.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.960
 If it's set in the pitiless desert of the Sahara,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.720
 it actually, I would say, kills the mood a bit,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.560
 to have a house cat, though enough.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.840
 Some people think it's good luck for a cat to be on stage

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.920
 and in America, at least, there was a superstition

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.800
 that if a black cat came into the theatre,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.880
 that was really good luck.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.880
 And if it came on the first night,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.200
 that was really, really good luck,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.960
 and the whole show was going to be amazing.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.800
 Right.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.480
 And so the fifth avenue theatre in New York

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.040
 used to keep a black cat backstage,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.160
 and then on the first show of every run,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.640
 that they would throw it out there,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.480
 so that it was on stage, and that was good luck.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.680
 And the reason you said, "Master" is second to go, Jamie.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.640
 The reason that cats used to be very, very important in theatre

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.880
 is because back in the day, food being thrown on stage

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.120
 to show your all-pleasure in a play was a massive thing.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.640
 So at the end of every night, food was just everywhere,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.560
 all over the stage, which brought in the mice,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.360
 and mice were a huge, huge problem.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.640
 So theatres would have sometimes up to 20 cats

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.960
 roaming around catching mice if they had problems.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.360
 But a lot of those cats will lie on their CVs, you know.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.480
 You've put on here, you also do birds.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.480
 Is that true?

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.280
 Yeah, because actually Bearbone was on the payroll, I read.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.480
 He was officially listed on the Gilgood payroll,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.640
 which, as a former accountant, I think,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.760
 brings up a whole host of problems.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.200
 Like, who pays the national insurance on that?

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.200
 Yeah, I wonder who his agent was.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.640
 I don't know, someone bloody good.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.920
 Yeah, 15% of a cat.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.480
 And apparently, he would disappear from time to time,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.200
 according to Dame Hilda Brackett.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.040
 He would dash off to see a particular friend

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.640
 at the Lyric Theatre.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.560
 His girlfriend?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.080
 Yeah, she said, "We used to hear lots of meows.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.920
 "This was so ho after all."

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.960
 I love it.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.040
 Do you think all of-- most West Emphaters have cats, as you said.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.560
 Yeah.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.400
 They're all mates.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.680
 Do they just, like, all meet up at--

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.840
 Like, that's a cute, that's a great show, though.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.680
 That's a charity book.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.280
 You should have seen the performance of this.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.360
 Well, lots of them are dead of cats, don't they?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.360
 So the Noel Coward Theatre had two cats.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.720
 They imagined a difficult girl cat and boy cat.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.920
 And I think boy cat only ever distinguished himself

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.640
 once when he ate Princess Margaret's bouquet.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.800
 Is that a euphemism?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.040
 No, it's not.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.440
 It's a bloody good one, isn't it?

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.160
 Yeah, apparently, he also escaped offstage

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.920
 during a performance of a musical five-guys named Mo.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.400
 And he would go under the stage,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.280
 and he would only come out when someone tap danced over him.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.640
 Right.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.960
 There was a cat called Ambrose at the Theatre Royal

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.880
 Jury Lane, which I think you performed her.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.480
 We have, yeah.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.800
 And this cat got into a beef with Michael Crawford.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.840
 He kept upstaging Michael Crawford.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.000
 And Michael Crawford had no sense of humor about this.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 It's Michael Crawford.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.360
 It's Michael Crawford, the original--

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.160
 Phantom.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.680
 Yes.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.880
 But was he also Frank Spencer?

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.600
 Yeah, Frank Spencer.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.840
 I'm a T. That guy.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.160
 A varied career.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.840
 I think we'll agree.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.040
 I was going to say, yeah, like--

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.400
 But then instead of Michael Crawford,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.960
 I was like kicking off about this cat.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.680
 But every single person in the theatre took the cat's side.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.880
 What does that say?

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.400
 Wow.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.760
 Yeah, I read about one that was at the Sadler's Wells.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.280
 It was called Sadler, the Cat.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.760
 And Sadler in 1956 just suddenly disappeared.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.200
 But unlike the other cats who would come on unprompted,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.200
 Sadler actually had a role in a play.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.800
 Oh, no.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.120
 So in the stage, magazine, they had an advert

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.360
 to audition for a new cat for the show.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.680
 And I found the advert.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.840
 It said, owing to the dramatic disappearance

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.560
 of Sadler, official theatre cat at the Wells,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.800
 the important feline role in the forthcoming production

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.880
 of School of Fathers, falls vacant.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.160
 Auditions will be held.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.520
 Applicants must be fully grown and capable

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.560
 of maintaining dignity and poise atop a 10-foot high wall.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.480
 Despite the distractions of a full operatic orchestra

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.160
 and audience laughter and applause,

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.720
 the chosen artist will receive full her service,

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.040
 one sardine and two complimentary tickets per performance.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.560
 Wow.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.800
 And did you see who got the part?

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.880
 It was a cat called Keats.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.760
 And according to the Daily Telegraphy Beat-Off,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.280
 a tough competition from cats called Fantasia, Nimbus, Klott,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.120
 and Mr. Woodbury Bentley.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.840
 And they had two auditions.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.080
 In the second audition, he jumped off the wall

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.640
 that he was sitting on and then walked over to the bar

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.920
 and started knocking down bottles.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.760
 And they decided this was a perfect cat for the theatre.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.760
 This is exactly what the old actors would do.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.760
 So happy.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.760
 Yeah.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.440
 So good.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.600
 How can you cast a cat in a play?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.560
 They just-- they famously don't play--

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.060
 Bull.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.340
 They play with Bulls, but you know what I mean?

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.340
 Yeah, and they're hard to direct, I would imagine.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.300
 Yeah, dogs, I think, do get a look in sometimes on the West End.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.500
 I was trying to find other animals

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.580
 that have been in West End productions.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.100
 Yeah.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.780
 So there was a Guardian report in 2001

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.340
 that there was a production of The Taming of the True,

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.300
 which had an entire cast of chickens.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.380
 And I cannot find out whether it was like a whole flock

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.100
 of chickens and a human cast or whether it

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.780
 was an entire cast of chickens.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.700
 But when they all fired, I think, they were sacked.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.660
 Yes, apparently for being too hysterical.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.980
 Again, I don't know what the--

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:57.780
 It's hysterical.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.620
 It's a kick.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.020
 I can't imagine how hysterical they

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.220
 got when they were told they were fired.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.180
 That's the big on the room.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.260
 Guys, we're going to have to let you go.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.460
 By the way, beer bomb, the cat.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.060
 Do we know-- do you guys know why it's called beer bomb?

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.180
 There was a famous actor called beer

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.220
 but I don't know what they're going to do.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.380
 Yeah, he was a theatre manager.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.180
 He was an actor as well.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.580
 His name was Sir Herbert Beerbomb Tree.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.860
 And he founded Radar, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.540
 Yeah.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.420
 And he's a pretty amazing character.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.780
 He released a few records.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.740
 He did hamlets to be or not to be on vinyl.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.660
 That's pretty cool.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.500
 I'm just really sin his own stuff.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.420
 And also, randomly, in the play Cats,

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.620
 there is a reference which is said to Gus from Geliorum.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.100
 Is that the name of the cat in it?

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.620
 The line is he's acted with Oving.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.060
 He's acted with Tree.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.380
 Cats, I'm so glad we're on Cats.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.140
 So thing one, when you think about it,

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.820
 cats is an antagravive cast.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.620
 OK.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.500
 And?

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.660
 Why does it make you think, doesn't it?

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.820
 Yeah.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.340
 Yeah.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.300
 It's also an antagram of acts.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.220
 Oh, my God.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.820
 I was so pleased with myself cast.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.220
 And they got to stack but without the cage.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.060
 Nah.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.820
 And they thought, oh, that's brilliant.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.220
 Is that it?

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.700
 That was the fact.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.660
 That was the fact.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.660
 He messaged us saying, I've got some amazing stuff on Cats

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.100
 that I need to say on stage.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.940
 I spent six hours reading about the musical cats

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.340
 because you had a cat's back, and that was it.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.100
 Well, I just wanted to introduce yours.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.220
 Yeah, go on, go on.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.340
 OK, well, I have quite a good one about Cats, the musical.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:30.860
 Do you?

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.860
 OK.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.740
 For its broadway run, they used over 49,000 condoms.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.220
 Oh, sorry.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.060
 Yeah.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.180
 Can we guess?

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:40.740
 Why?

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.740
 Densch.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:45.980
 Densch.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.980
 Sadly, Densch ruptured her Achilles,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.580
 so couldn't perform in Cats.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.740
 Although she was originally Cats.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.540
 She was meant to be.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.100
 She was originally Cats.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.100
 In Cats.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.100
 In Cats.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.900
 Yeah, why do you think they used so many condoms?

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.740
 To stop things from getting wet is my first thought.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.740
 Well, what sort of thing?

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.500
 You smuggle drugs for the cars.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.780
 No, you were on the right lines, James.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.380
 Yeah, to protect something.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:08.660
 Is it?

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.860
 OK.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:15.620
 Oh, is it for-- so a lot of preppers will use condoms

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.220
 to store water because a condom, like a water balloon,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.140
 you can hold gallons of water.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.180
 Absolutely not.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.620
 All right, no, I'm sorry.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.500
 If you ever go to Dan's for dinner,

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.340
 he offers still sparkling or gracing of spurnicide.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.100
 It's all right, Andy.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.180
 Cats have claws, don't they?

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:34.660
 Yes.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.300
 It's to protect the claws in transit.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.140
 And they had $49,000.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.500
 Well, real Cats have claws.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.980
 This is the show with people.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.980
 Yeah.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.020
 All right, put us out of my way.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.340
 It was-- you were right, James.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.060
 It was to protect their microphone packs,

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.420
 because they were sweating so much, because it's a Dan show, right?

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.620
 They're dancing so much that they would put their mic packs

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.180
 in condoms, if you'd--

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.180
 $49,000.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.020
 Yeah.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.380
 After each show, they were just like tip loads of condoms

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.700
 in the bin outside of this.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.700
 Oh, it's a sweet show.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.060
 While we're on Andrew Lloyd Webber,

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.180
 there's another cat connection, which

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.340
 is the fact that Phantom of the Opera now

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.340
 has a sequel.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.860
 Many, many years ago, Lloyd Webber was working on that sequel.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.780
 And he was rising it with Frederick Forsyth, the author.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.580
 The author, Jackal?

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.740
 Yeah, exactly.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.580
 So they were writing it.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.860
 He'd written all the music.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.660
 And he had it on his electric piano.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.060
 And then one day, he sat down to write a new song.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.420
 And his kitten, called Otto, stepped on the keyboard

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.220
 and erased the entire score.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.260
 And so we never got it.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.540
 The main thing about Cat Charlie is the movie,

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.020
 the amazing movie that came out a few years ago.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:36.860
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.740
 And it was really the start of the pandemic, I think.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.900
 It was right at the start of the pandemic, wasn't it?

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.660
 It was a bad moment.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.260
 I think we're claiming it caused the pandemic.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:43.780
 I don't know.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.300
 No, but it made it seem a lot longer.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.140
 You knew something bad was in the air when cats came out.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.100
 And the big thing about that is the CGI bum holes

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.340
 that all the cats had.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.140
 Wow.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:56.820
 What's that?

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.060
 Well, is it true or not?

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.220
 Because that is urban myth.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:01.740
 Is it true?

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.380
 It's urban myth.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.780
 So someone tweeted a guy called Jack Waz.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.700
 I think-- I mean, that sounds like an honest man, doesn't it?

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.540
 Jack Waz.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:09.980
 I think it's James.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.340
 You go to such impeccable lengths to source all of your facts.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.620
 James goes deep into newspaper archives from 200 years ago.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.060
 But he will also sometimes throw in like @JackWaz as a source.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.260
 @JackWaz is the New York Times of our day.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.740
 He said that a VFX producer, friend of a friend,

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.100
 was hired to get rid of the bum holes, right?

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.540
 But then the Daily Beast Online magazine

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.900
 found a VFX person, and they said it was true.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.060
 And they were definitely someone who worked on the show.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.260
 And they said what had happened was actually

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.220
 the way the visual effects worked

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.780
 is they had a very special way of the fur being made.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.060
 And the fur would go in little holes.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.860
 Like your hair does.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.700
 You know you have walls in your hair.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.020
 And so they had them on all the cats.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.300
 And it just so happened that if you got them any of them

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.620
 from a certain angle, it looked like they had female genitalia

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.140
 or an anus.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.340
 And they had to imply one person who, basically, it

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.060
 was their job to go through looking for the bum holes

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.380
 and then get rid of them.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.460
 Right, that's insane.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.140
 That's such a high-pressure job as well.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.780
 You've got to catch every single one, you know?

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.580
 It's true.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.260
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.260
 But Pokemon, yeah.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.420
 I love it.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.980
 They could catch all of the bum holes,

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.700
 but not Judith Ench is Wedding Ring, which

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.940
 is on throughout the fucking process.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:24.780
 Oh, is it?

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.260
 As like an old cat.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.460
 So you got all of the rings, but one, and yeah.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:29.980
 Exactly.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:36.900
 So it's time for fact number two.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.140
 And that is my fact.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.100
 My fact this week is that, at one of the oldest bath houses,

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.660
 in Japan, visitors have the option

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:50.580
 of soaking in hot water, cold water, electric water,

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.700
 or condom water.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:59.620
 We need to call them and suggest that.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.740
 No, the final one, there are many others,

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.060
 but the other one is radioactive water.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.740
 Ooh, yeah.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.340
 People also drink this water.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.140
 So it turns out, I thought this was going

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.380
 to be unique to this one place in Japan,

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.660
 which is a radium onsen.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.500
 And onsen is a word that means bath houses in Japan

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.660
 that use hot spring water, and they take natural source water.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.820
 And they use that.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.900
 There's something like 25,000 hot spring sources in Japan

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.500
 that they use.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.100
 They're everywhere.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.460
 Yeah, and 3,000 onsen establishments all over Japan.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.540
 So it's a real big thing there.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.100
 And so like the electric water that you would sit in,

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:37.660
 that actually sends mild electric currents through the water

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.700
 as you're sitting in it.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.740
 And people describe it as like being tickled by lightning

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.140
 as you're trying to relax.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.340
 So you're just how relaxing?

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.820
 Yeah, well, yeah.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.220
 Well, they see these baths not as necessarily

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.140
 completely relaxing.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.940
 It's all about rejuvenation, it's all about health and so on.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.860
 And so radioactive water, radium water, is a thing.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.900
 It's not bad for you, is it?

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.220
 The quantities are really, really small.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.460
 The quantities are less than you would get

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.500
 if you were on a flight, for example.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.140
 But that's flight.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.580
 You know, we get hit by radioactive flares from space

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.180
 as you're on a flight.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.260
 So James, quick, jump in with the top.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.620
 There is radiation that comes from space.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.020
 And if the closer you are to it, the less space.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:21.620
 Space.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.420
 Space.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.860
 Not Katy Perry, but it means you.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.180
 There's less of the atmosphere to block it out

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.020
 when your fervor up is the basics.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.580
 But if you're on a plane all the time, it'll be bad for you.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.020
 Like a air hostess or a pilot, for example.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.700
 And it's bad for you, it's bad for you.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.540
 What are you talking about?

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.100
 They said that it's safest way to travel.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:45.620
 No.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.820
 But if you live in Cornwall, there's radiation there, too.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.020
 Like, you know what I'm saying?

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.300
 But here's some kind of lead box at the end of this.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.460
 So there is radiation in Cornwall.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.980
 Cornwall has more background radiation than anywhere else.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.540
 But we all have a little bit.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.900
 And a normal person would get two to three millisieverts

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.820
 of radiation in a year.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.860
 But there's a place called Ramsar in a ran

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.340
 that has the highest radiation anywhere in the world.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.260
 It's because they have hot springs and radiation

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.060
 underground and it comes up.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.860
 And they get 260 millisieverts per year,

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.660
 which is more than 100 times what a normal person would get.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.700
 But actually, the cancer incidence there

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.700
 is lower than any of their neighbors.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.620
 Right.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.500
 And what people think is the people who live there,

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.700
 they have a higher proportion of what's called T-cells.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.540
 Remembering COVID, they said T-cells.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.500
 It's like, helped your immune system.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.900
 But it turns out that people there have

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.340
 got higher proportion of T-cells.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.940
 And it's the thing called Hormesis, which

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.660
 is the idea that very small low doses of something

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.900
 that would otherwise be harmful can actually make you stronger.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.220
 And it is really--

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.260
 I mean, I'm not saying everyone should go out now

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.340
 and get as much radiation as possible.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.620
 But it is genuinely exciting.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.620
 You have a great time.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:54.660
 That's amazing.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.180
 Yeah.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.140
 That really is amazing.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:56.940
 It's very cool.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.260
 So as I was saying a second ago, these are massive in Japan.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.980
 And I was trying to find more information

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.740
 about this very specific one in Osaka.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.020
 And the best place I could find out about it

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.940
 was a website called tatufriendlyonson.com.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.900
 And this is so interesting, because in Japan,

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.260
 when you go to an onsen, largely it's separated.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.300
 So men will go into one place.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:18.900
 One will go to another.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.420
 You have to be naked.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.980
 You've got to be completely naked.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.620
 And the problem is in Japan, if you have tattoos,

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.580
 you're not allowed to go and show your tattoos in these places

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.780
 because of the yakusa.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.420
 So a lot of foreigners arrive trying to go--

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.260
 --trying to go to the ganksters.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.700
 Yeah, the mafia, basically.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.660
 Yeah, who are tattooed, typically.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.540
 Yeah, exactly.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.020
 And so if you arrive and you've got like--

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:45.100
 Eternity, I love cherry, whatever on your face.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.180
 It's so revealing knowing what you would have gone for there.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.460
 I didn't want to talk about my actual tattoos.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.100
 OK, I will.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.500
 So thug life across your tummy, they won't let you in,

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.100
 because of the yakusa thing.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.820
 So this website basically lists all of the onsen's

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.020
 that you can go to, and that will allow you in.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.940
 Do you think the pork broth onsen would be one of those tattoo

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:07.900
 friendly ones?

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.980
 I think it might be, yeah, this is amazing.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:10.780
 This is--

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.860
 There's a place.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.180
 Well, it's the pork broth hot tub.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.780
 It's the unison spa.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.700
 And they have a massive ramen bath, basically.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.740
 And it's just slightly porky hot water.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.820
 It sounds amazing.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.020
 It's the noodles in there.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.300
 Well, they dangle above you a huge sculpture

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.860
 that looks like a pair of chopsticks holding noodles.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.180
 So it looks like you're about to--

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:29.680
 What?

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.380
 It's like you're a soft boiled egg.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.540
 It's like you're a--

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.500
 It's like you're--

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.900
 And if you've seen my physique, that I

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.380
 am like a soft boiled egg, basically.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.900
 But they've got a green tea bath.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.620
 They've got a sake bath, which is very slightly sake.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.860
 It's not obviously not all sake,

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.260
 because that'd be hugely expensive.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.340
 They've got a coffee bath, which does not look appetizing.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.340
 Yeah.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.620
 It looks really good.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.020
 It's safe if you have the runs, isn't it?

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.780
 Oh, yes.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:55.580
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.260
 Yeah, that sounds-- I'd love to go there.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.060
 It does look cool.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:00.580
 Sounds awesome.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.500
 I have been to Anonsan a few, in fact, in Japan.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.100
 Really?

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:08.300
 There's a thing in Japan called Hadakano sukiai,

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.700
 which means naked camaraderie.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.540
 And the idea is everyone gets naked.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.580
 You're all together in a big sort of jacuzzi with no bubbles.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:20.900
 And it means you're all emotionally together, open, honest.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.420
 That's the idea behind it.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.740
 And I must admit, I went in, ran in, had a bath, came out,

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.700
 and went back to my room as quickly as I could.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.460
 Oh, right.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.220
 You didn't have any--

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.500
 Not very communal for you then.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.260
 I don't speak Japanese.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.020
 But there are other ways of communicating, then.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.460
 Yeah, but they could share ads at the best of times

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.260
 is difficult.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.940
 I'm just a hawker's back to the last fact.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.180
 You know that Andrew Lloyd Webber has a 30-person hot tub.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:44.940
 That's disgusting.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.620
 Does he?

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.860
 So it's a 30-person hot tub, meaning everyone

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.140
 gets a slot on the outer wall.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.820
 What's the alternative?

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.620
 That it could--

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.260
 Bus format, where it is like six by four.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.020
 Like, what's the--

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.020
 Yeah, what?

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.900
 There's an aisle down the middle.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.660
 Tickets, please.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.700
 Chicken of fish?

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.300
 Nuts?

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:07.900
 No, we don't have any.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.420
 I can just concede, yours.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.020
 No, I don't-- yeah, I don't know what--

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:12.780
 yeah, I don't know.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.260
 I think it must be that everyone gets a bit of wall.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.660
 Otherwise, you're just popping about in the middle,

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.540
 feeling like a lemon, yeah.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.620
 I hate that bit, yeah.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:20.460
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.220
 Popping.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.260
 There is a spa in the southern island of Tremaccushu,

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.460
 and it opened up, I think, in 2017.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.660
 They'd announced it with big fanfare the year before.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.260
 They said, this is going to be--

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.340
 Actually, it wasn't a spa.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.020
 It was a spa-themed amusement park.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.700
 And they released some images of basically a rollercoaster

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.660
 that's full of bath rollercoaster.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.180
 OK.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.100
 And in a little bath, and that's your--

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.140
 Yeah, you know you get in the carriage, and it's a bath.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.300
 And you're in a spa.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.780
 That sounds fun.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.940
 They were not sure at the time if it could be done.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.820
 If it was beyond the can of humanity, but they did it.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:00.380
 So you're in a compartment that is a jacuzzi, basically?

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.580
 I think they didn't quite correct the full rollercoaster bath.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.700
 How do you-- yeah.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.500
 Because that would have been very heavy, obviously.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.340
 It would spill a lot.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.340
 It would spill a lot.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.380
 It's like an opposite log flume.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.820
 The water's in.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.220
 If you're really unlucky, you'll be dry at the end of it.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.740
 All the people waiting on the side, yeah.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.420
 Yeah, that's very interesting.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.300
 There's another one, which I wonder if that's there as well,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.940
 where you have an option of arriving,

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.420
 and they bury you up to your neck and sand.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.180
 And it's quite hot sand so that you can get whatever,

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.820
 you know, holistic therapy.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.100
 So have you ever done any sort of odd pampering things

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.940
 like this?

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.140
 That you're willing to admit, too?

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.940
 I was quite intrigued by the beer baths that you can do.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.620
 You know, in Europe, in the Czech Republic,

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.940
 there's a lot-- they're quite popular now.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.220
 You're just like bathing, like, hoppy water,

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.260
 a bit like your ramen.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.140
 I wonder if you'd be interested in this thing in Japan.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.460
 It's the Nightingale Fese's Facial.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.380
 Now, it's not what it sounds like.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.420
 It's Fese's from the Japanese Busch Wabler, which

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.900
 is not a true nightingale.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.220
 Oh, thank god.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.220
 In Japanese, it's brilliantly called Uguisu No Fun.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.940
 Right.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.940
 And apparently-- anyone around you, because you stink of shit.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.580
 Apparently, Victoria Beckham is a proponent of it.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.380
 Oh, no.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.380
 Wow.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:24.900
 OK.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.900
 That's extreme pampering things.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.140
 I read about the crying therapy rooms,

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.820
 which seems really nice.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.500
 The whole idea is to make you a sad as you could possibly be.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.780
 So you go in and you sit down and there's just sad movies

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.660
 playing on the screen, and someone sits next to you,

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.100
 just going to ask really sad, isn't it?

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.860
 And then they hand you tissues as you're crying.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.380
 Just me.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.500
 OK.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.500
 Give that one some else.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.500
 Oh, my god.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.500
 Oh, that sounds nice.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.980
 So we've got-- have a good cry.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.300
 Yeah, I'd buy that.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.140
 Just going back to Onsen, so these baths,

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.380
 would you eat an Onsen Tamago, which

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:04.620
 is a traditional Japanese egg, which is cooked in a Onsen?

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.820
 You put your egg in a rope net.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.820
 You put it in the Onsen, and the water's about 70 degrees,

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.060
 and you leave it in for 30 to 40 minutes.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.100
 And then it's done.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:14.900
 Question?

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.900
 Yeah.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.260
 Because there are two ways of cooking eggs in water.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.260
 Shell on and shell off.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.260
 So are we poaching this, bad boy, are we?

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.900
 No, this is, I believe it's shell on, I think.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.340
 Oh, that's fine.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.380
 Shell on, wow, there you go.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.060
 The audience has spoken shell on.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.700
 People in it, it can be in a bath.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.060
 It's not just a water bath, like a battery.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.940
 It's an actual Onsen.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:41.140
 And also, the eggs have a unique silky custard texture.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.220
 I bet they do.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:42.740
 Yeah.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.740
 I would eat that.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.220
 I'm sorry.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.260
 Can I just ask the person, was it a lady in the audience?

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.260
 She said, Shell on, have you had one of these?

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.260
 They're really good.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:49.860
 They're really good.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:50.660
 There you go.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.260
 You can't, you know, like a poached egg.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.260
 There's that like bit of white that never gets cooked.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.180
 And it's someone's like flamed on your plate.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.300
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.180
 Looks like a dementor in the water as it's boiling.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.260
 I've never seen a poached egg that hasn't got it.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.260
 Why do we put order this?

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:03.780
 It's foul.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.380
 Oh, I love a poached egg.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:05.980
 You do?

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.260
 Yeah, okay.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.060
 But they're just like, if it's in its wrapper,

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.300
 I don't mind where it's been.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.140
 It's wrapped.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.700
 I'd have a, I'd have a, if there was a banana, a banana in at the same time,

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.100
 pop that in the net, I don't mind.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.180
 Yeah.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.140
 Because it's been up her, up her chicken's bum, hasn't it, right?

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.820
 Right, let's not get fussy, you know.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.780
 I wish I had wrapped it up, I'll be honest.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.620
 Let's go.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.580
 But I just want the other weird spot thing.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.660
 There was that bullseam and hair treatment, right?

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.180
 Okay.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.020
 Did you hear it read about this in Chelsea?

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:36.860
 No.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.660
 In Chelsea?

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.660
 Yeah.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.180
 Okay.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.020
 It was a hair mask, basically.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.140
 In 2008, 2009.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.060
 Hair mask?

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:44.580
 Yeah.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.420
 It was this place called Harry's Salon in Chelsea.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:55.060
 It offered a 45-minute Aberdeen organic hair treatment, which was Aberdeen Angus,

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.940
 like good quality.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.740
 Bull comes.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:00.740
 Stuff.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:05.020
 Which women would like, I don't know, I guess, would pay like a lot of money to have,

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.380
 like, lathered over their hair, and would just like sit with it for 45 minutes.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.140
 And apparently, it was amazing.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:11.740
 Really?

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.980
 And it made the hair silky and smooth, and--

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.540
 But I have made head-in shoulders too in one shampoo and conditioner, and that makes my hair silky and smooth.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:22.020
 Andy, are there levels of silkeness and smoothness that I've not matched yet?

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.980
 You haven't lived.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.420
 I can imagine one of these women from Chelsea going into the countryside afterwards,

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:30.820
 and walking through a field, and all the female cows are like, do you smell something?

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:31.820
 Yeah.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:39.180
 Well, it's funny to say that, because the people that ran this Salon,

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.580
 told the Metro a new, sorry, these pervert fraudsters, yeah, it's gone.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:48.820
 These quacks said to the Metro that the semen is refrigerated before use, and doesn't smell.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.980
 I mean, it is come, but it's not, you know--

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.780
 It's not going to stay refrigerated.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.900
 That's the problem.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.380
 The body heat is going to cause that to warm up.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.940
 Yeah, but it's 45 minutes a bit.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.380
 You were going to eat an egg from a bunch of people, like, what do you mean?

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.020
 Like, don't get all--

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.020
 We do need to move on to our next factory.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.020
 No!

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:06.860
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:07.860
 But we ran him.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.460
 I've got the dreams of engineering stuff about how the Fukushima

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.660
 reacted dealt with its water after the terrible incident there.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.660
 But I'll save it.

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.660
 You save it.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.660
 It's fascinating.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.660
 They built an underground wall with ice.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.660
 Oh, he's going for it.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.660
 He's moving on.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:27.860
 OK, we do need to move on.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.220
 So it is time for fact number three, and that is--

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.580
 Oh, it's Andy.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.220
 So--

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:38.140
 After the terrible incident at Fukushima,

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.300
 the engineers, they're pulled off a miracle, a miracle,

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.580
 of preventing the radioactive.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:47.140
 So they've got, imagine, a 1.5-kilometer radius circle.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.540
 Oh, 30 meters underground filled with frozen brine.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:51.420
 Get off your phone.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.420
 Come on.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.180
 How's your phone?

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.060
 I'll try to start against shock of its two seconds.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.820
 OK, anyway.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.580
 Sorry.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.580
 My fact is, the first named man who sent a letter

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.020
 bomb only invented it to get back at people

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.380
 who had rejected all his other ideas for inventions.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.620
 So this is very funny.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.300
 I love this guy.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.340
 He's a very interesting historical figure.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.780
 His name was Martin Eckenberg, and I was on the website

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.980
 of the Clapham Society, which is a great website all about Clapham,

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.740
 which is a part of South London, where I used to live.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:28.500
 And he was a Swedish scientist, Martin Eckenberg, born in 1870.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.420
 He was kind of a gifted inventor in some ways.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.660
 His ideas were decent, but the other problem that he had,

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.900
 personally, was that he was a liar.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.900
 He was a cheat.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.100
 He claimed qualifications he didn't have.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.940
 He'd been kicked out of Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.940
 specifically for cheating.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.860
 He was a badden.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.620
 He was a badden.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.140
 He was a badden.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.540
 Fucking legend.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.140
 So free thinker.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.260
 A free thinker.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.420
 Outside the box kind of guy.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.940
 But still, this didn't hold him back that much,

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.100
 because he moved to one of the nicest houses in Clapham.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.260
 It was this really beautiful mansion he moved to.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.420
 That's not the point of the fact.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.420
 It's been replaced by flats now, so you can't go and visit it.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.740
 But if you were, that's weird.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.860
 And you should be on a terror list.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.460
 And then in 1905, if you thought, right,

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.140
 I'm going to get revenge on everyone who's turned down

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.660
 my ideas along the way, who turned me down for finance.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:18.860
 I am going to get back at you.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.420
 And he's so basically created, started

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.100
 making his own letter bombs.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.940
 And there were packages sent through the post

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:24.900
 to harm people before.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.940
 But I think he's the first named sort of--

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.900
 I thought I think it was a bit unfair.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.380
 So like the first person that he really sent it to was a guy

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.220
 called London, who ran this company.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.140
 It was like an engineering company.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.580
 And Eckenberg had invented something

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.220
 that could turn fish oil into engine oil.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.340
 And he thought it was going to make his millions.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.460
 But it failed.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.740
 And so he thought, well, I'm going to get this guy London.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.340
 But the reason it failed is because the oil still

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.100
 smelled a fish.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.140
 So like if people put it in their cars,

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.140
 the car smelled a fish.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:55.660
 Right.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.460
 So it's supposed to be that Harry isn't get that sent removed,

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.900
 but the pool's semen.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.900
 Well, no, and ships that was going to be used on ships,

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.460
 which have fish, obviously.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.260
 That's true.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.420
 Hence the phrase, fish and ships.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.420
 But yeah, that--

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.340
 And then this guy, London, opens the packet.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.860
 And it said, I read an article in the newspaper that

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.900
 said, it rumbles and shook like thunder.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.620
 The director felt as if he had been hit by lightning

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.500
 or tickled by lightning.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.380
 And intense flame burst out the box

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.340
 and burned his hands, arms, chest, and face terribly.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.780
 And his clothes went on fire.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.940
 And the next day he got a postcard saying,

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:33.860
 a former employee has decided that you're ripe for the picking.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:34.460
 Yes.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.220
 What's interesting is that it's not

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.180
 as if he sent it from the post in the UK, which

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.500
 would be more traceable.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.940
 He went by boat back to Sweden.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.780
 He assembled it there, sent it there,

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:44.660
 and then went back home.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.700
 So he really covered up his tracks.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.780
 But then he still set a postcard with his writing

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.340
 identifiable on it to the person he'd just--

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:51.620
 Yeah.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:55.020
 I mean, he was caught for various quite stupid things

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.940
 like that.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.940
 Yeah.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.420
 Can I just rescind that I thought he was good?

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.500
 No, no.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.180
 There's another thing as well, James,

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.340
 see if you still think he's good.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.420
 When he was arrested, he claimed innocent.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.780
 And then according to the New York Times,

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.940
 he lost his reason and was taken to an asylum.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.980
 He died two months later after his arrest

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.500
 of what they said was apoplexy.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.220
 But the head of the Swedish detective service

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.420
 said that if he'd been sent back to Sweden,

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.780
 he would have also been tried for murdering his two wives.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.620
 Oh.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.620
 Right.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.620
 Yeah, no, yeah.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.620
 How you feeling?

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.140
 Sorry about that.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.180
 Let's get a live reaction from Jamie Morden sitting

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:32.820
 right here.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.660
 Sounds fine.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.660
 Yeah.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.380
 Not too shabby.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.940
 So apparently, what appears to have happened

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.060
 is he poisoned his first two wives,

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.820
 and then he bribed the prison guards

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.860
 to get him the same poison, which he then took himself.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:45.900
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:46.860
 Unique thinker.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.900
 And interestingly, today, if you go to the police museum

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.300
 in Stockholm, there's a giant wax work,

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.620
 like a replica human-sized wax replica of him standing there.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.020
 And not only that, they have a bunch of things

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.100
 that were to do with the case.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.620
 So one of the bombings, which was sent to the Swedish

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.940
 export society, was opened up by a man called John Hammer.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.940
 And John Hammer's thumb was blown off

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.500
 as part of opening the scene.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.380
 And if you go to the police museum in Stockholm,

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.660
 you can see the wax work of Morden Eckenberg.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.740
 And then you can see the actual thumb of John Hammer.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.140
 Thumbs up or thumbs down.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.060
 It's the--

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.900
 Yeah, he wasn't happy.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.100
 It's a definite thumbs down for me.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:21.900
 It's, yeah.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.940
 So it's very, very grim guy.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.020
 But he was an innovator of sorts.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.860
 And as I say, people had been sending devices

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.500
 designed to hurt other people through the post for ages.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.340
 So the very first one was a thing called the bound box plot.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.580
 People were very worried about the weak party

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.300
 in the, I think, 18th century.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.260
 And supposedly, that party were involved in some attempts

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.620
 to assassinate people.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.420
 Get this.

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:46.780
 The very first ever thing sent through the post designed

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.700
 to harm someone, this bound box plot,

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.100
 was a box full of, I think, the three pistols.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.780
 When you open it, they all go off.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.780
 At you.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.060
 Wow, I know.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:55.940
 And it was--

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.460
 Oh, my God.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.740
 This is the story that it was thwarted by Jonathan Swift,

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.780
 the author of "Gull of his Travels."

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.300
 Yeah.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.900
 Because he was a political figure as well.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.620
 And he's supposedly noticed a thread on the box

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.580
 and cut it before opening it.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.540
 Oh, so he's the first red wire, blue wire cut moment

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.060
 that we've ever had for a bomb.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.220
 Yeah, pretty cool.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.420
 And we talk about his books instead.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.460
 But "Eck and Berg" was the first of a kind of new wave

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.420
 where "Gump out" had been invented,

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.140
 a post had improved, things like that.

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.820
 And so there were anarchists.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:28.420
 People were very, very worried about anarchists

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.380
 with their kind of cartoon-style bombs

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.660
 that they'd be throwing.

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:32.260
 Yeah.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.100
 And he also invented a way to freeze dry milk, which

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.900
 is kind of similar to what we have today.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.380
 So like instant custard, we wouldn't have it without him.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:40.900
 Really?

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.580
 Well, "Eck and Berg."

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.380
 Wow.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.660
 Jamie, you want to change your--

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.820
 Because you go on often, but I know you don't mind custard,

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:47.660
 do you know?

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.100
 I'm a bit of custard, I mean, I'm--

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.100
 50/50.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.180
 It requires people.

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.740
 Now, I'll tell you why I think he's not a complete villain.

00:34:54.740 --> 00:35:02.140
 So it's so interesting, which hills people choose to die on.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.300
 I find that really fascinating.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.380
 I just kind of love the fact that through revenge,

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.420
 he invented something that was actually--

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.380
 I mean, not a good thing, but was--

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.500
 It was like a thing.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.780
 This silver lining is slimming down all the time.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.460
 I got to say.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.260
 So it was for revenge, but he did event something really bad.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.460
 Well, maybe it's just how my mind worked,

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.700
 because I mean, I got quite heavily into revenge

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.300
 during my researching of this.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.980
 So I was like, what else has revenge kind of created?

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.700
 And the rotary telephone is one thing that revenge has created.

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:39.140
 Yeah, because there was a guy called Alman Stroudger,

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.900
 and he was an undertaker in the late 19th century

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.500
 in Kansas City.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.180
 They were all manual switchboards at that point, obviously.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.580
 And he thought that the switchboard operators

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:52.340
 were deliberately fiddling with his connections,

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.540
 because--

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.940
 Wait, so you would call up and say, patch me through to this person.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.860
 And he was convinced that this was being meddled with,

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.660
 because the other undertakers across the town,

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.820
 I think their wife worked at the phone company.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.740
 So someone dies, you put them through to the rival.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:13.580
 And yeah, exactly.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.540
 So they were getting all the work.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.860
 He was like, what's going on here?

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.220
 And so he invented the rotary telephone

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.340
 to cut out the--

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.580
 What was the one where you dial with this?

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.020
 Yeah, so you could dial it yourself.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:24.860
 That is amazing.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.140
 It's not amazing.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.260
 Revenge, but not all bad.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:29.260
 OK.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.700
 It's like those spite houses.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.660
 You know, spite houses.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.260
 And it's just so cool that something

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.860
 that you build to screw someone over

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.180
 ends up being worth more than the house that--

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.620
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.100
 I just love stuff like that.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.820
 Just jumping back to Leatherbond's for a second,

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:46.180
 I've discovered that the former prime minister--

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.540
 well, a very long former prime minister, Anthony Eden--

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.860
 so prime minister of England--

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.580
 he was almost killed by Leatherbond.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.580
 Yeah, and this was prior to him being prime minister.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.860
 It was when he was foreign secretary.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:02.660
 And someone had hand-delivered a Leatherbond.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:03.700
 He took it.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.620
 But he saw, oh, this looks a bit boring.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.500
 So he put it in his briefcase.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.020
 And he had it for 24 hours.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.340
 He went home, he didn't open it.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.660
 He just had a whole day of not opening it.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:14.500
 And then Scotland got--

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.340
 And that's a looked boring.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.940
 Yeah, he thought it looked like a circular.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.900
 It looked like something that might have been dropped off.

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.020
 And it was a generic thing.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.060
 Oh, right, OK.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.540
 And so then Scotland Yard got in contact and said,

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.260
 we're worried that something might have been sent to you

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.300
 that is a bomb.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.020
 And he still didn't look at it.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.420
 And it was his secretary who eventually went,

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.740
 that might be a bomb.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.100
 And then-- and it was.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.980
 And so it was just purely his absolute boredom

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.660
 towards his letter that the most interesting letter

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.020
 he ever received actually had.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.100
 And that's the thing is, they're

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.340
 designed to go off when you open them out there.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.860
 So you can carry them around, and it's fine.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:52.740
 So for instance, you're told that if you work in a government

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.780
 office and they might happen, a lot of people

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.860
 when they get a letter that they're not sure about,

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.260
 they put it in water, because they

00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.900
 think that's what you're supposed to do with a bomb,

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.580
 but you're absolutely not supposed to put it in water.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.860
 Because some of the explosives will explode

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.660
 if you put them in a big-- is that so?

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.460
 Also renders the letter completely illegible.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.500
 Exactly.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.300
 I've got stupid idea.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.260
 There are some tips.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.420
 There are some useful tips, actually.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:19.380
 So warning signs include excess postage.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.140
 Like, why is someone spending so much money on their parcel?

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.980
 Because you don't want to risk it getting returned to you.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.580
 Right.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.900
 No return address.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.500
 So the really clever bombers will leave the return address

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:33.260
 off.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.220
 I think I would put the return address as my number two

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.700
 nemesis.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.220
 Yeah, nice.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.100
 Such a good idea.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.020
 Yeah.

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.820
 Such a good idea.

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.020
 Number two--

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.820
 I think it's a long-old list.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.620
 It's a long-old list, journalist.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.740
 Bad spelling.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:50.260
 Oh.

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.220
 Because there are a lot of people sending these things,

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.500
 and maybe I'm going to slide off letter bombs.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.220
 They're not the brightest buttons.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:57.980
 Really?

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:58.780
 Yeah, bad spelling.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.780
 Because they've just constructed a bomb.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.540
 It feels like you've got a basic--

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.380
 Fair to get one.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.260
 What are you doing?

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.460
 They might have studied the sciences and not the humanities.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.660
 Yes, that's the point.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.300
 There are so many kinds of intelligence.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:16.980
 Addressed personal, confidential, or do not x-ray.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:21.980
 That's wrong.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.620
 And the final one-- just for any of that

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.860
 have slipped through those many holes in the Swiss cheese,

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.020
 ticking sounds.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:32.500
 Protrooting wires, OK, yeah, or aluminium foil.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.620
 Or if it says "acme bomb," on the front.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.220
 If it's dropped off by a coyote who looks pleased with himself,

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.580
 that's another one.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.500
 I did read.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.660
 There was a-- what's the name of the journalist?

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.140
 Slasov Zizek.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.140
 Slasov Zizek.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.180
 Yeah, so he wrote this piece.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.900
 And the opening anecdote of the piece

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.100
 at the top winner in the contest for the greatest blunder

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.460
 of 1998 was a Latin American patriotic terrorist

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.420
 who sent a letter bomb to a US consulate

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.220
 in order to protest against America

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.140
 interfering local politics.

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.500
 As a conscientious citizen, he wrote his return address

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.420
 on the envelope.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.700
 However, he did not put enough stamps on it.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.220
 So that post was returned to him.

00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.500
 Forgetting he'd put it in, he opened it, and blew himself up.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.260
 He did, and he did what James said.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.660
 Now, who knows if that's apocryphal, but it's--

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.260
 What's his name?

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.460
 All the fingerprints of Jack Waz, anyway, near this.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.060
 I'll tell you what.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.460
 That was the first time Jack Waz and Slasov Zizek

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:29.460
 have been mentioned in the same sentence together.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.540
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.300
 It is time for our final fact of the show.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.740
 And that is James.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.540
 OK, my fact this week is that there

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.540
 is currently a scandal in Thailand.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:46.140
 After at least a dozen supposedly celibate monks

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:52.260
 admitted to having sex with a woman called Mrs. Gulf.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.140
 James, you're a keen golfer.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.140
 That's how I found this.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.980
 I was googling gol.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.260
 No, no, no, no.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.260
 Now, I just read this in the news,

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.140
 and I thought it's very amusing.

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.060
 It is a lot of senior monks.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.300
 I mean, not amusing, if you're a monk,

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.060
 because obviously a lot of them have lost their livelihoods,

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.540
 including some as high-ranking as frat dep, which

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.380
 means angelic level.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.020
 So this goes to the very, very top.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.220
 And it turns out they've been having relationships

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.500
 with this woman who's called Mrs. Gulf,

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.980
 and they've been transferring money to her.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.060
 And they've found this lady, and they

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:33.420
 found over 80,000 photos of naked monks on her phone.

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.740
 How do they know their monks?

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.540
 Sorry to quibble.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.860
 I reckon there's a way.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:41.660
 You reckon there's a way?

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:42.260
 It's probably a way.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.500
 I reckon there's a way.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.460
 Probably it's the hair style down there.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.380
 It's like a tons, yeah.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.420
 80,000 is a lot.

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.420
 Not necessarily all different monks.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.420
 They could have been--

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.380
 I don't even know if I have that amount of storage on my phone

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.140
 for 80,000 photos.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.340
 Yes, what was their data cloud like?

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.380
 This is really interesting.

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.340
 Is she in the cloud?

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.820
 She's using the cloud.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.580
 So yeah, and the reason she's called Mrs. Gulf

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.020
 is because this is like common in Thailand

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.620
 for people to have little short nicknames.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.060
 And you're kind of given them as a child by your parents.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.180
 And they don't really mean anything.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.500
 It might be that this person's parents love Gulf,

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:23.500
 but more likely they just take a Western word that kind of sounds

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.940
 fun or trendy or whatever.

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.180
 And they just call that.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.100
 The most famous Thai person in the world

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.020
 probably is Lisa from Blackpink.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:32.180
 And her nickname is Pockpack.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.180
 So they're just mostly just sounds

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.420
 or they might be little words from other languages.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.060
 But it's just like a little nickname.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.700
 But people go by it in real life.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.100
 Like as adults, you might still be known as that nickname.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.100
 Yeah.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:46.620
 But so this is an unbelievably fascinating story.

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:50.940
 This one woman went around so many of these different monasteries

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.420
 and managed to talk in what were effectively,

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.140
 I'm assuming, celibate monks into engaging not only in sex,

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.340
 but also having photos taken.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.980
 And the top monks, some of them have fled the country.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.300
 We don't know quite where they are.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.180
 And they haven't said why they've done that.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:09.380
 They're now investigating 300,000 other Buddhist monks

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.260
 in Thailand off the back of this

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.660
 to see whether or not they're involved.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.380
 And she got a lot of money off the back of this.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.500
 Was her own extortion, sort of, I'll release the photos.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.980
 So the photos would be shown back to them

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.140
 and then they would have to pay money.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.100
 And a lot of the monks have been acquitted

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.820
 where the police have decided that actually you just

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.740
 gave her money because she was pleading for the money

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.900
 and didn't engage in sexual activity.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:31.420
 And trust me.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.540
 But you know how much money allegedly,

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:39.940
 she has netted the equivalent of $11.9 million from this.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:41.780
 There's a lot of money in munching, isn't that?

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.140
 Isn't that?

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.300
 Yeah, that's a bigger career than I thought.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.020
 Like no, my career advisor did not say,

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.860
 have you considered becoming a monk?

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.860
 And I think it's like quite a big deal in Thailand

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.660
 because if you're a Buddhist, you

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.420
 think that if someone becomes a monk,

00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.340
 then they kind of automatically sort

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.820
 of develop this strong resistance to temptation

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:03.980
 and that kind of thing.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:05.780
 And so to find out that they haven't

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.820
 was quite a big deal for a lot of people.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.620
 Yeah.

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:12.340
 I think this is very interesting, because I started reading about--

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.700
 by the way, James, there's a very hard factor

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.700
 to Google, like naughty monks.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.140
 And naughty nuns is actually even worse.

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.060
 It's an even harder legit Google.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.460
 But basically, there was a lot of this

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:29.380
 in the 16th century in England, because monks and nuns

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.340
 and monasteries and nunneries were seen as hoppets of sin.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.420
 And the idea was, they're all on the take.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.860
 They're all selling pardoning for sins, that kind of thing,

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.060
 like they're all--

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.300
 And they're all shacking up.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.780
 And there were some institutions--

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:42.700
 Cancer Reformation.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:43.980
 Like, Cancer Reformation, right.

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.700
 But I think we've all been conned into thinking

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.540
 that monks and nuns are inherently sort of naughty figures,

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.020
 because they're absolutely not.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.140
 And I think we fall off a Henry VIII era propaganda.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.340
 And I'm blowing the lid off this.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:59.100
 Not enough people talk about it, but I'm not afraid to.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.060
 I'd just like to reference the paper by Christian Knudsen,

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.700
 Sodomitic monks and other dissolution myths,

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.500
 the late medieval monastic decline narrative revisited.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.700
 And it is a belting read.

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.940
 It's really good.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.780
 And can you tell us more about the Fukushima disaster?

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:21.940
 But like, Henry VIII wanted to dissolve the monasteries.

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:25.460
 I mean, because they owned a huge proportion of English land,

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:25.820
 right?

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:27.300
 There was so wealthy.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.540
 And Henry VIII thought, I'm going to discredit

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.060
 ecclesiastical institutions anyway I can.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:35.660
 And every monastery in England, in 1535 and 6,

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.500
 got a visit from bureaucrats who were trying

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:41.140
 to record every dubious incidents of behavior by a monk

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.420
 or a nun they could.

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.540
 And there were some cases, absolutely.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.060
 There were some cases where monks had been playing the field

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:47.700
 or whatever it is.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.380
 But they also had to come up with new crimes.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.780
 So they found dozens of instances

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.380
 recorded of voluntary pollution, which

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:55.740
 is just sort of playing with yourself.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.540
 But it's not.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.620
 In one priori, West Acres, 76% of the monks

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:02.340
 were labeled incontinent by which they

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.140
 mean romantically incontinent.

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:09.260
 But 10 of those 13 were for just enjoying some cowl billiards.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.460
 And so it's not cow, the cow goes in your head, doesn't it?

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.780
 You know what I mean?

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:14.500
 Hardly ever.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:19.260
 I just think it's really interesting.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.860
 And I think we shouldn't fall for it.

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.140
 OK, well, we won't.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:26.740
 But also, like, I'm a Catholic.

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.300
 I mean, you know, lapsed carefully.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.860
 Like, you can do anything if you say sorry.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.100
 That's like the point.

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:31.940
 Yes.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:36.460
 But actually, the penance was quite severe, or it could be.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:40.260
 So Richard Gray, one man called Richard Gray, a medieval England,

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.620
 he was found guilty of having sex with a nun.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:44.980
 And he was sentenced to being flogged while walking

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.100
 around Stanford church on four Sundays in a row,

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.780
 carrying a candle while dressed only in linen garments.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:54.420
 And then he had to make a barefoot pilgrimage

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:59.780
 to Lincoln Cathedral from wherever he lived.

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:03.260
 Wow, that's a movable feast of a punishment, isn't it?

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.420
 You just want a feast of art, right?

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.340
 I'm going to get a flat just outside Lincoln.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:12.140
 Yeah, that was quite a mess for me to not say

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.140
 where he actually lived in my notes.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:14.740
 No, that's not true.

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:18.500
 But then he, and then after that, he didn't do what he was supposed

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.900
 to do, and they've excommunicated him.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.580
 But in those days, being excommunicated was a big, old deal.

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:24.380
 Right.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.300
 Like, because it can't amaze you can't go to heaven,

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.140
 but it also amaze you can't be baptized.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.820
 And you can't get married, you can't do all sorts of different things.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.620
 Yeah, and actually, quite often, the women

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:34.980
 were punished more than the men.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:38.020
 So two that happened quite close to each other,

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.620
 a guy called Nicholas Plymouth was a monk who

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.460
 has committed adultery with a Tanner's wife,

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.780
 and he was ordered to remain silent for one week.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.620
 And around the same time, someone

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.580
 called Alice Longspray was sentenced

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:55.580
 to a year of strict confinement after an affair with a priest.

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:56.580
 That was double standards.

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.500
 It is double standards, yeah.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.980
 James, you've spent time in Bhutan.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.580
 I have.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.540
 Did you ever hear of the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:05.700
 while you were out there?

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:07.340
 That's what they still call me that, man.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:12.460
 I wonder when the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.380
 is going to return.

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:20.180
 So it's referring to amongst penis.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:30.780
 But so a question who your real friends were out there.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:35.540
 It was straights that they yelled at me at the streets.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.140
 Is that right?

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.700
 There was this guy, Druckper Cunley,

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.860
 and he was in the 1400s.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.140
 Yeah, I've been to his church.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.580
 You've been to his church, God, so he was interesting,

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:46.860
 because he was known as the Saint of 5,000 women.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.820
 He was a fertility saint.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.420
 The idea was he thought sex should be incorporated

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.060
 into reaching enlightenment.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:56.620
 And so classic.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.020
 Yeah, you would meet the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:02.060
 as part of your hello to him, basically.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:06.220
 And he was liked, but mad as fuck.

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.500
 Like, people genuinely thought he was.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.500
 And what I wanted--

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.460
 It is known as the holy mad man or something like that.

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.820
 And he introduced this idea, which still goes on

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.740
 in very spits of Bhutan today, which

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.740
 is that if you're setting up a new house

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.700
 and you need it to be blessed, you would basically graffiti,

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.460
 fallists, put dig picks, all over, like,

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.260
 draw a penis all over the walls.

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:26.140
 Did you see any--

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're on every house, Haslam.

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.280
 Yeah.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.620
 In this particular town where he was from.

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:33.820
 And also, if you go into his church,

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.420
 a priest comes up to you with a giant fallace

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.140
 and sort of touches you as if you'd

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.900
 been knighted by the queen.

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.020
 Rise.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:41.820
 Did you have that?

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:42.340
 Yeah.

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.420
 Wow.

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.220
 Arise.

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:47.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.260
 If it's on every house, can you put it on a semi?

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:49.780
 Sorry.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:50.620
 Go on.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.420
 Do you want to know something cool about the first century

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.740
 saint, Thecla?

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:57.220
 Yes, please.

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:57.740
 Yes, please.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:58.740
 This was sent in by a listener, actually.

00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:59.660
 Lesson of Cat Brinker.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:00.860
 So thanks, Cat, for this.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.580
 This is the first century saint, Thecla.

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.100
 She is the unofficial patron saint of computers

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.340
 and the internet.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.060
 And can you work out why?

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.940
 It's going to be sex-connected, presumably.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.020
 Nope.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.140
 But you said it was to do with the internet.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:15.660
 No, I know.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.860
 No, I know.

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.940
 What would a first century monk have to do with computers

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.820
 and the internet?

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.460
 She liked cats.

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:22.580
 That's a really good one.

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.900
 That's very close.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.180
 She was very racist all the time.

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:32.580
 It's because her name, Thecla, sounds like the Spanish word,

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.740
 for a key, on a keyboard.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.740
 Thecla.

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.740
 OK.

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:37.740
 Ah, Thecla.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.580
 You've not just wasted their time.

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:42.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.780
 Unbelievable.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.380
 If you'd like to know some other grabs of the word Thecla,

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.300
 I've got loads.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:53.540
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:54.140
 That is it.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.340
 That is all of our facts.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.820
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.580
 Thank you for everyone who has joined us

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.460
 around the world on the live stream.

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:03.660
 We are all found on our online accounts.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.340
 You can get us on Instagram.

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:05.820
 I'm there.

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.220
 I'm on @Sriberland.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:07.980
 James.

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:08.660
 I'm on TikTok.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.300
 No, such thing as James Harkin.

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:10.980
 Andy?

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:15.140
 Oh, Instagram @MrsGolf.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.820
 80,000 photos on his grid.

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.780
 It's insane.

00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:19.820
 It's too much, mate.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.580
 It's too much.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.620
 And Jamie?

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:25.820
 Uncle Igor, it's weird, don't worry.

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.060
 OK.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:27.580
 Yep.

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.100
 And if you want to send us any of your facts,

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:33.900
 you can do that as well by going to podcast@QI.com.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.740
 So send us facts.

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.460
 Send us anything that you heard in this episode

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:37.420
 that you want to talk about.

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:40.780
 We take it all, and we bring it to our special secret room,

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:42.020
 which is part of Club Fish.

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.700
 We've got any Club Fish members here.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.940
 6, OK?

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.620
 Everybody.

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:52.180
 But we will read them out there as part of our mailbag specials.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:52.860
 So do do that.

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.260
 Go online, find out if we're coming to a town near you

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:56.380
 with more live shows.

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:57.740
 But otherwise, come back here next week

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:00.540
 for more of our actual show.

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:01.660
 It's all free.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:02.420
 Come and do that.

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.020
 Thank you so much, everyone, for being here tonight.

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:06.100
 London Podcast Festival.

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.100
 That was awesome.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.460
 We will see you again.

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.900
