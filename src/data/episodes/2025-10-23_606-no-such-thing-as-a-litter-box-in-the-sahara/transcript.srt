00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,560
 Hello, you lovely club fish member on Patreon.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,840
 Here is your announcement for the big news

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,840
 of changes happening to no such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,040
 Well, first of all, the main thing to say to you guys

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,280
 is that if you want to stay exactly where you are,

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,520
 then nothing changes.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,280
 Well, very slightly changes.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,720
 We are gonna move the bonus content to Wednesdays

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,560
 instead of Tuesdays.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,680
 That's just to make our workflow a little bit easier.

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,520
 But every other week you will still get your episode

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,720
 of "Droppers Align" and in fact, "Droppers Align"

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,160
 will now become fortnightly.

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,120
 We won't be doing any of the little bits and pieces

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,320
 instead, this is a "Droppers Align" zone.

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,040
 If you would like to get involved with any other tiers,

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,280
 so that is plenty more fish,

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,960
 which includes video "Droppers Align"

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,000
 and full, more or less unedited episodes of fish

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,280
 then go to our "Plency More Fish" tier.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,880
 And if you would like to be a friend of the podcast,

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,520
 then the top tier is for you.

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,240
 You will become custodian of a fact.

25
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,720
 You will be able to come to our three monthly Zoom quizzes

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,600
 and you will also get into the archive

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,600
 where we put basically the Museum of Fish.

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,080
 So lots of other places you can go.

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,200
 There's merch there as well.

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
 So go and explore if you want to.

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,840
 But if not, then please stay here, "Droppers Align"

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,680
 and your every episodes of fish will stay exactly

33
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,840
 as they were.

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,480
 Okay, on with the podcast.

35
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,080
 (upbeat music)

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,160
 (upbeat music)

37
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

38
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,680
 (upbeat music)

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,800
 Hello and welcome to another episode

40
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,800
 of "No Such Thing As A Fish" a weekly podcast.

41
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
 This week coming to you live

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,680
 from the London Podcast Festival.

43
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,320
 (audience cheering)

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,600
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

46
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,440
 James Harkin, and Jamie Morton.

47
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

49
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,760
 and in no particular order, here we go.

50
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,400
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Jamie.

51
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,640
 Iconic Fespian, "Bear Bome" had a walk on part

52
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,320
 in every single production at the "Geal Good Theater"

53
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,400
 in London's West End for 20 years.

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,440
 And, fittingly, had a front page obituary

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,760
 in the stage newspaper.

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,960
 He was also a cat.

57
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,280
 (audience laughing)

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,480
 I know, I mean, what a hack, I'm sorry.

59
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,760
 That is a Fespian cat, that is.

60
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,840
 Yeah.

61
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,960
 For people listening on the podcast next week,

62
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,680
 or whenever it goes out, can you describe

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,720
 the cat who was Jamie?

64
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,800
 We've got a tabby cat, he's male,

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,360
 and he's lounging on stage at the "Geal Good."

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,720
 Looking very happy with his beautifully lit,

67
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,240
 it's black and white, it's very,

68
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,200
 it's also like a headshot, but it's a full body.

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
 (audience laughing)

70
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,040
 Yeah.

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,200
 Shays long kind of look.

72
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,960
 That little, is that a photo of a tail?

73
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,200
 He's like saying, "Paint me like one of your French cats."

74
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
 It's giving that energy to them.

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,720
 Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the way it is.

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,760
 Same opulence as well around it in terms of the architecture.

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,680
 Yeah, I mean, I love this cat.

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,960
 So, I'm not gonna lie.

79
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,160
 I fall in love with him this week.

80
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,880
 I've never heard of him before, but now I love him.

81
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,160
 So, when you say walk on roll in all the plays,

82
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,560
 was that official?

83
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,640
 Was he written into?

84
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,480
 No.

85
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,320
 No.

86
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,560
 So, he was the resident, is it like Mouser?

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
 Is that the name?

88
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,040
 Yeah, Mouser name, that they caught the mice.

89
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,280
 And he just would randomly walk on stage during productions,

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,600
 which being a theatre director, I find chilling,

91
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,280
 'cause you work so hard to kind of make a show good,

92
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,200
 then some fucking cats just like wandering in front of everyone.

93
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,520
 And what did the actors think of it?

94
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,400
 Well, the actors loved this cat, almost uniformly.

95
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,280
 I think there wasn't a single actor who didn't love beer bone,

96
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,440
 'cause he is, as I said, a total hag.

97
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,760
 I mean, look at him, but yeah, he was loved.

98
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,880
 And people got very attached to him.

99
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,920
 So much so that he had this obituary

100
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,960
 on the front page of the stage newspaper.

101
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,200
 And people like Penelope Keith wrote obituries for him,

102
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,880
 like loads of actors kind of got involved.

103
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,960
 The stage, I hadn't heard of the stage,

104
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,640
 is that like the main main thing that you can get on it?

105
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,000
 The Bible, Dan, honestly.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,840
 I love that.

107
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,000
 No, I had actually heard of it.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,280
 I was just being them for a second, yeah.

109
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,880
 Then they've heard of it too.

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,240
 Oh, so it is just being staged.

111
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
 It's a great news paper, yeah.

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,520
 No, it is, it's a great news paper.

113
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,600
 It's behind a play wall, but it's great.

114
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,920
 Okay, a lot of people did love beer bone,

115
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,800
 but beer bone would arrive on stage at moments

116
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,880
 that weren't necessarily good for a scene, you know?

117
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,040
 There was one play that was on, which was called

118
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,040
 the House of Bernard Alba, which had a lot of sand

119
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,240
 all over the stage, which beer bone was the ultimate pooing ground.

120
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,760
 It was, so that was not good, right?

121
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,600
 Well, it was not good for who, we loved it.

122
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
 It adds realism to the play.

123
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
 Oh, yeah.

124
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 That's where it's set.

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,960
 If it's set in the pitiless desert of the Sahara,

126
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,720
 it actually, I would say, kills the mood a bit,

127
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,560
 to have a house cat, though enough.

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,840
 Some people think it's good luck for a cat to be on stage

129
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,920
 and in America, at least, there was a superstition

130
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,800
 that if a black cat came into the theatre,

131
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
 that was really good luck.

132
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,880
 And if it came on the first night,

133
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,200
 that was really, really good luck,

134
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,960
 and the whole show was going to be amazing.

135
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,800
 Right.

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,480
 And so the fifth avenue theatre in New York

137
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,040
 used to keep a black cat backstage,

138
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,160
 and then on the first show of every run,

139
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,640
 that they would throw it out there,

140
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,480
 so that it was on stage, and that was good luck.

141
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
 Oh, yeah.

142
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,680
 And the reason you said, "Master" is second to go, Jamie.

143
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,640
 The reason that cats used to be very, very important in theatre

144
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,880
 is because back in the day, food being thrown on stage

145
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,120
 to show your all-pleasure in a play was a massive thing.

146
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,640
 So at the end of every night, food was just everywhere,

147
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,560
 all over the stage, which brought in the mice,

148
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,360
 and mice were a huge, huge problem.

149
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,640
 So theatres would have sometimes up to 20 cats

150
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,960
 roaming around catching mice if they had problems.

151
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,360
 But a lot of those cats will lie on their CVs, you know.

152
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,480
 You've put on here, you also do birds.

153
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
 Is that true?

154
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

155
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,280
 Yeah, because actually Bearbone was on the payroll, I read.

156
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,480
 He was officially listed on the Gilgood payroll,

157
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,640
 which, as a former accountant, I think,

158
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,760
 brings up a whole host of problems.

159
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,200
 Like, who pays the national insurance on that?

160
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
 Yeah, I wonder who his agent was.

161
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,640
 I don't know, someone bloody good.

162
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,920
 Yeah, 15% of a cat.

163
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,480
 And apparently, he would disappear from time to time,

164
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,200
 according to Dame Hilda Brackett.

165
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,040
 He would dash off to see a particular friend

166
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,640
 at the Lyric Theatre.

167
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,560
 His girlfriend?

168
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,080
 Yeah, she said, "We used to hear lots of meows.

169
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,920
 "This was so ho after all."

170
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,120
 [LAUGHTER]

171
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,960
 I love it.

172
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,040
 Do you think all of-- most West Emphaters have cats, as you said.

173
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,560
 Yeah.

174
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,400
 They're all mates.

175
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,680
 Do they just, like, all meet up at--

176
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,840
 Like, that's a cute, that's a great show, though.

177
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,680
 That's a charity book.

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
 You should have seen the performance of this.

179
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,600
 [LAUGHTER]

180
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,360
 Well, lots of them are dead of cats, don't they?

181
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
 So the Noel Coward Theatre had two cats.

182
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,720
 They imagined a difficult girl cat and boy cat.

183
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,920
 And I think boy cat only ever distinguished himself

184
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,640
 once when he ate Princess Margaret's bouquet.

185
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,800
 Is that a euphemism?

186
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,040
 No, it's not.

187
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,440
 It's a bloody good one, isn't it?

188
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,160
 Yeah, apparently, he also escaped offstage

189
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,920
 during a performance of a musical five-guys named Mo.

190
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,400
 And he would go under the stage,

191
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,280
 and he would only come out when someone tap danced over him.

192
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,640
 Right.

193
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,720
 [LAUGHTER]

194
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,960
 There was a cat called Ambrose at the Theatre Royal

195
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,880
 Jury Lane, which I think you performed her.

196
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,360
 Oh, yeah.

197
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,480
 We have, yeah.

198
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,800
 And this cat got into a beef with Michael Crawford.

199
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,840
 He kept upstaging Michael Crawford.

200
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,000
 And Michael Crawford had no sense of humor about this.

201
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 It's Michael Crawford.

202
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,360
 It's Michael Crawford, the original--

203
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,160
 Phantom.

204
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,680
 Yes.

205
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,880
 But was he also Frank Spencer?

206
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,600
 Yeah, Frank Spencer.

207
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,840
 I'm a T. That guy.

208
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
 A varied career.

210
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,840
 I think we'll agree.

211
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,040
 I was going to say, yeah, like--

212
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,400
 But then instead of Michael Crawford,

213
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,960
 I was like kicking off about this cat.

214
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,680
 But every single person in the theatre took the cat's side.

215
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,880
 What does that say?

216
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,400
 Wow.

217
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,760
 Yeah, I read about one that was at the Sadler's Wells.

218
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,280
 It was called Sadler, the Cat.

219
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,760
 And Sadler in 1956 just suddenly disappeared.

220
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,200
 But unlike the other cats who would come on unprompted,

221
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
 Sadler actually had a role in a play.

222
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,800
 Oh, no.

223
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,120
 So in the stage, magazine, they had an advert

224
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,360
 to audition for a new cat for the show.

225
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,680
 And I found the advert.

226
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
 It said, owing to the dramatic disappearance

227
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,560
 of Sadler, official theatre cat at the Wells,

228
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,800
 the important feline role in the forthcoming production

229
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,880
 of School of Fathers, falls vacant.

230
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,160
 Auditions will be held.

231
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,520
 Applicants must be fully grown and capable

232
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,560
 of maintaining dignity and poise atop a 10-foot high wall.

233
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,480
 Despite the distractions of a full operatic orchestra

234
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,160
 and audience laughter and applause,

235
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,720
 the chosen artist will receive full her service,

236
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,040
 one sardine and two complimentary tickets per performance.

237
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,560
 Wow.

238
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,800
 And did you see who got the part?

239
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
 It was a cat called Keats.

240
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,760
 And according to the Daily Telegraphy Beat-Off,

241
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,280
 a tough competition from cats called Fantasia, Nimbus, Klott,

242
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,120
 and Mr. Woodbury Bentley.

243
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,840
 And they had two auditions.

244
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,080
 In the second audition, he jumped off the wall

245
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,640
 that he was sitting on and then walked over to the bar

246
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,920
 and started knocking down bottles.

247
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,760
 And they decided this was a perfect cat for the theatre.

248
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,760
 This is exactly what the old actors would do.

249
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
 So happy.

250
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
 Yeah.

251
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,440
 So good.

252
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,600
 How can you cast a cat in a play?

253
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,560
 They just-- they famously don't play--

254
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,060
 Bull.

255
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,340
 They play with Bulls, but you know what I mean?

256
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
 Yeah, and they're hard to direct, I would imagine.

257
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,300
 Yeah, dogs, I think, do get a look in sometimes on the West End.

258
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,500
 I was trying to find other animals

259
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,580
 that have been in West End productions.

260
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,100
 Yeah.

261
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,780
 So there was a Guardian report in 2001

262
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,340
 that there was a production of The Taming of the True,

263
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,300
 which had an entire cast of chickens.

264
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,380
 And I cannot find out whether it was like a whole flock

265
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,100
 of chickens and a human cast or whether it

266
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,780
 was an entire cast of chickens.

267
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,700
 But when they all fired, I think, they were sacked.

268
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,660
 Yes, apparently for being too hysterical.

269
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,980
 Again, I don't know what the--

270
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,780
 It's hysterical.

271
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,620
 It's a kick.

272
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,020
 I can't imagine how hysterical they

273
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,220
 got when they were told they were fired.

274
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,180
 That's the big on the room.

275
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,260
 Guys, we're going to have to let you go.

276
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,460
 By the way, beer bomb, the cat.

277
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,060
 Do we know-- do you guys know why it's called beer bomb?

278
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,180
 There was a famous actor called beer

279
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,220
 but I don't know what they're going to do.

280
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,380
 Yeah, he was a theatre manager.

281
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,180
 He was an actor as well.

282
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,580
 His name was Sir Herbert Beerbomb Tree.

283
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,860
 And he founded Radar, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.

284
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,540
 Yeah.

285
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,420
 And he's a pretty amazing character.

286
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,780
 He released a few records.

287
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,740
 He did hamlets to be or not to be on vinyl.

288
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,660
 That's pretty cool.

289
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,500
 I'm just really sin his own stuff.

290
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,420
 And also, randomly, in the play Cats,

291
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,620
 there is a reference which is said to Gus from Geliorum.

292
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,100
 Is that the name of the cat in it?

293
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,620
 The line is he's acted with Oving.

294
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,060
 He's acted with Tree.

295
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,380
 Cats, I'm so glad we're on Cats.

296
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,140
 So thing one, when you think about it,

297
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,820
 cats is an antagravive cast.

298
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,620
 OK.

299
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,500
 And?

300
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,660
 Why does it make you think, doesn't it?

301
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,820
 Yeah.

302
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,340
 Yeah.

303
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,300
 It's also an antagram of acts.

304
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,220
 Oh, my God.

305
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,820
 I was so pleased with myself cast.

306
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,220
 And they got to stack but without the cage.

307
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,060
 Nah.

308
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,820
 And they thought, oh, that's brilliant.

309
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,220
 Is that it?

310
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,700
 That was the fact.

311
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,660
 That was the fact.

312
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,660
 He messaged us saying, I've got some amazing stuff on Cats

313
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,100
 that I need to say on stage.

314
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,940
 I spent six hours reading about the musical cats

315
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,340
 because you had a cat's back, and that was it.

316
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,100
 Well, I just wanted to introduce yours.

317
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,220
 Yeah, go on, go on.

318
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,340
 OK, well, I have quite a good one about Cats, the musical.

319
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,860
 Do you?

320
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
 OK.

321
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,740
 For its broadway run, they used over 49,000 condoms.

322
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,220
 Oh, sorry.

323
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,060
 Yeah.

324
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,180
 Can we guess?

325
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,740
 Why?

326
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
 Densch.

327
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,180
 [LAUGHTER]

328
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,980
 Densch.

329
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
 Sadly, Densch ruptured her Achilles,

330
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,580
 so couldn't perform in Cats.

331
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,740
 Although she was originally Cats.

332
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,540
 She was meant to be.

333
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,100
 She was originally Cats.

334
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
 In Cats.

335
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
 In Cats.

336
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,900
 Yeah, why do you think they used so many condoms?

337
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,740
 To stop things from getting wet is my first thought.

338
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,740
 Well, what sort of thing?

339
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,500
 You smuggle drugs for the cars.

340
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,220
 [LAUGHTER]

341
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,780
 No, you were on the right lines, James.

342
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,380
 Yeah, to protect something.

343
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,660
 Is it?

344
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,860
 OK.

345
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,620
 Oh, is it for-- so a lot of preppers will use condoms

346
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,220
 to store water because a condom, like a water balloon,

347
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,140
 you can hold gallons of water.

348
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,180
 Absolutely not.

349
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,620
 All right, no, I'm sorry.

350
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,500
 If you ever go to Dan's for dinner,

351
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,340
 he offers still sparkling or gracing of spurnicide.

352
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,340
 [LAUGHTER]

353
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,100
 It's all right, Andy.

354
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,180
 Cats have claws, don't they?

355
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,660
 Yes.

356
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,300
 It's to protect the claws in transit.

357
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,140
 And they had $49,000.

358
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,500
 Well, real Cats have claws.

359
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,980
 This is the show with people.

360
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,980
 Yeah.

361
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,020
 All right, put us out of my way.

362
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,340
 It was-- you were right, James.

363
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,060
 It was to protect their microphone packs,

364
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,420
 because they were sweating so much, because it's a Dan show, right?

365
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,620
 They're dancing so much that they would put their mic packs

366
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,180
 in condoms, if you'd--

367
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,180
 $49,000.

368
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,020
 Yeah.

369
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,380
 After each show, they were just like tip loads of condoms

370
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,700
 in the bin outside of this.

371
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
 Oh, it's a sweet show.

372
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,060
 While we're on Andrew Lloyd Webber,

373
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,180
 there's another cat connection, which

374
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,340
 is the fact that Phantom of the Opera now

375
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,340
 has a sequel.

376
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,860
 Many, many years ago, Lloyd Webber was working on that sequel.

377
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,780
 And he was rising it with Frederick Forsyth, the author.

378
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,580
 The author, Jackal?

379
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,740
 Yeah, exactly.

380
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,580
 So they were writing it.

381
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,860
 He'd written all the music.

382
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,660
 And he had it on his electric piano.

383
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,060
 And then one day, he sat down to write a new song.

384
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,420
 And his kitten, called Otto, stepped on the keyboard

385
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,220
 and erased the entire score.

386
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,260
 And so we never got it.

387
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,540
 The main thing about Cat Charlie is the movie,

388
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,020
 the amazing movie that came out a few years ago.

389
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,860
 Oh, yeah.

390
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,740
 And it was really the start of the pandemic, I think.

391
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,900
 It was right at the start of the pandemic, wasn't it?

392
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,660
 It was a bad moment.

393
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,260
 I think we're claiming it caused the pandemic.

394
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,780
 I don't know.

395
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,300
 No, but it made it seem a lot longer.

396
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,140
 You knew something bad was in the air when cats came out.

397
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,100
 And the big thing about that is the CGI bum holes

398
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,340
 that all the cats had.

399
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,140
 Wow.

400
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,820
 What's that?

401
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,060
 Well, is it true or not?

402
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,220
 Because that is urban myth.

403
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,740
 Is it true?

404
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,380
 It's urban myth.

405
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,780
 So someone tweeted a guy called Jack Waz.

406
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,700
 I think-- I mean, that sounds like an honest man, doesn't it?

407
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,540
 Jack Waz.

408
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:09,980
 I think it's James.

409
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,340
 You go to such impeccable lengths to source all of your facts.

410
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,620
 James goes deep into newspaper archives from 200 years ago.

411
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,060
 But he will also sometimes throw in like @JackWaz as a source.

412
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,260
 @JackWaz is the New York Times of our day.

413
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,740
 He said that a VFX producer, friend of a friend,

414
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,100
 was hired to get rid of the bum holes, right?

415
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,540
 But then the Daily Beast Online magazine

416
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,900
 found a VFX person, and they said it was true.

417
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,060
 And they were definitely someone who worked on the show.

418
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,260
 And they said what had happened was actually

419
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,220
 the way the visual effects worked

420
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,780
 is they had a very special way of the fur being made.

421
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,060
 And the fur would go in little holes.

422
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,860
 Like your hair does.

423
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,700
 You know you have walls in your hair.

424
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,020
 And so they had them on all the cats.

425
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,300
 And it just so happened that if you got them any of them

426
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,620
 from a certain angle, it looked like they had female genitalia

427
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,140
 or an anus.

428
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,340
 And they had to imply one person who, basically, it

429
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,060
 was their job to go through looking for the bum holes

430
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,380
 and then get rid of them.

431
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,460
 Right, that's insane.

432
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,140
 That's such a high-pressure job as well.

433
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,780
 You've got to catch every single one, you know?

434
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,580
 It's true.

435
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,260
 Yeah, yeah.

436
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,260
 But Pokemon, yeah.

437
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,420
 I love it.

438
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,980
 They could catch all of the bum holes,

439
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,700
 but not Judith Ench is Wedding Ring, which

440
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,940
 is on throughout the fucking process.

441
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,780
 Oh, is it?

442
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,260
 As like an old cat.

443
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,460
 So you got all of the rings, but one, and yeah.

444
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:29,980
 Exactly.

445
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:36,900
 So it's time for fact number two.

446
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,140
 And that is my fact.

447
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,100
 My fact this week is that, at one of the oldest bath houses,

448
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,660
 in Japan, visitors have the option

449
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:50,580
 of soaking in hot water, cold water, electric water,

450
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,700
 or condom water.

451
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:59,620
 We need to call them and suggest that.

452
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,740
 No, the final one, there are many others,

453
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,060
 but the other one is radioactive water.

454
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,740
 Ooh, yeah.

455
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,340
 People also drink this water.

456
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,140
 So it turns out, I thought this was going

457
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,380
 to be unique to this one place in Japan,

458
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,660
 which is a radium onsen.

459
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,500
 And onsen is a word that means bath houses in Japan

460
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,660
 that use hot spring water, and they take natural source water.

461
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,820
 And they use that.

462
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,900
 There's something like 25,000 hot spring sources in Japan

463
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,500
 that they use.

464
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,100
 They're everywhere.

465
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,460
 Yeah, and 3,000 onsen establishments all over Japan.

466
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,540
 So it's a real big thing there.

467
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,100
 And so like the electric water that you would sit in,

468
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,660
 that actually sends mild electric currents through the water

469
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,700
 as you're sitting in it.

470
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,740
 And people describe it as like being tickled by lightning

471
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,140
 as you're trying to relax.

472
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,340
 So you're just how relaxing?

473
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,820
 Yeah, well, yeah.

474
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,220
 Well, they see these baths not as necessarily

475
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,140
 completely relaxing.

476
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,940
 It's all about rejuvenation, it's all about health and so on.

477
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,860
 And so radioactive water, radium water, is a thing.

478
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,900
 It's not bad for you, is it?

479
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,220
 The quantities are really, really small.

480
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,460
 The quantities are less than you would get

481
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,500
 if you were on a flight, for example.

482
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,140
 But that's flight.

483
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,580
 You know, we get hit by radioactive flares from space

484
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,180
 as you're on a flight.

485
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,260
 So James, quick, jump in with the top.

486
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,620
 There is radiation that comes from space.

487
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,020
 And if the closer you are to it, the less space.

488
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,620
 Space.

489
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,420
 Space.

490
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,860
 Not Katy Perry, but it means you.

491
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,060
 [LAUGHTER]

492
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,180
 There's less of the atmosphere to block it out

493
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,020
 when your fervor up is the basics.

494
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,580
 But if you're on a plane all the time, it'll be bad for you.

495
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,020
 Like a air hostess or a pilot, for example.

496
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,700
 And it's bad for you, it's bad for you.

497
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,540
 What are you talking about?

498
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,100
 They said that it's safest way to travel.

499
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,620
 No.

500
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,820
 But if you live in Cornwall, there's radiation there, too.

501
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,020
 Like, you know what I'm saying?

502
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,300
 But here's some kind of lead box at the end of this.

503
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,460
 So there is radiation in Cornwall.

504
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,980
 Cornwall has more background radiation than anywhere else.

505
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,540
 But we all have a little bit.

506
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,900
 And a normal person would get two to three millisieverts

507
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,820
 of radiation in a year.

508
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,860
 But there's a place called Ramsar in a ran

509
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,340
 that has the highest radiation anywhere in the world.

510
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,260
 It's because they have hot springs and radiation

511
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,060
 underground and it comes up.

512
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,860
 And they get 260 millisieverts per year,

513
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,660
 which is more than 100 times what a normal person would get.

514
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,700
 But actually, the cancer incidence there

515
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
 is lower than any of their neighbors.

516
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,620
 Right.

517
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,500
 And what people think is the people who live there,

518
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,700
 they have a higher proportion of what's called T-cells.

519
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,540
 Remembering COVID, they said T-cells.

520
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,500
 It's like, helped your immune system.

521
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,900
 But it turns out that people there have

522
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,340
 got higher proportion of T-cells.

523
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,940
 And it's the thing called Hormesis, which

524
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,660
 is the idea that very small low doses of something

525
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,900
 that would otherwise be harmful can actually make you stronger.

526
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,220
 And it is really--

527
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,260
 I mean, I'm not saying everyone should go out now

528
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,340
 and get as much radiation as possible.

529
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,620
 But it is genuinely exciting.

530
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,620
 You have a great time.

531
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,660
 That's amazing.

532
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,180
 Yeah.

533
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,140
 That really is amazing.

534
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,940
 It's very cool.

535
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,260
 So as I was saying a second ago, these are massive in Japan.

536
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,980
 And I was trying to find more information

537
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,740
 about this very specific one in Osaka.

538
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,020
 And the best place I could find out about it

539
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,940
 was a website called tatufriendlyonson.com.

540
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,900
 And this is so interesting, because in Japan,

541
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,260
 when you go to an onsen, largely it's separated.

542
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,300
 So men will go into one place.

543
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,900
 One will go to another.

544
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,420
 You have to be naked.

545
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,980
 You've got to be completely naked.

546
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,620
 And the problem is in Japan, if you have tattoos,

547
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,580
 you're not allowed to go and show your tattoos in these places

548
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,780
 because of the yakusa.

549
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,420
 So a lot of foreigners arrive trying to go--

550
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,260
 --trying to go to the ganksters.

551
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,700
 Yeah, the mafia, basically.

552
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,660
 Yeah, who are tattooed, typically.

553
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,540
 Yeah, exactly.

554
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,020
 And so if you arrive and you've got like--

555
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,100
 Eternity, I love cherry, whatever on your face.

556
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,180
 It's so revealing knowing what you would have gone for there.

557
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,460
 I didn't want to talk about my actual tattoos.

558
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,100
 OK, I will.

559
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,500
 So thug life across your tummy, they won't let you in,

560
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,100
 because of the yakusa thing.

561
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,820
 So this website basically lists all of the onsen's

562
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,020
 that you can go to, and that will allow you in.

563
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,940
 Do you think the pork broth onsen would be one of those tattoo

564
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,900
 friendly ones?

565
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,980
 I think it might be, yeah, this is amazing.

566
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,780
 This is--

567
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,860
 There's a place.

568
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,180
 Well, it's the pork broth hot tub.

569
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,780
 It's the unison spa.

570
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,700
 And they have a massive ramen bath, basically.

571
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,740
 And it's just slightly porky hot water.

572
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,820
 It sounds amazing.

573
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,020
 It's the noodles in there.

574
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,300
 Well, they dangle above you a huge sculpture

575
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,860
 that looks like a pair of chopsticks holding noodles.

576
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,180
 So it looks like you're about to--

577
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,680
 What?

578
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,380
 It's like you're a soft boiled egg.

579
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,540
 It's like you're a--

580
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,500
 It's like you're--

581
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,900
 And if you've seen my physique, that I

582
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,380
 am like a soft boiled egg, basically.

583
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,900
 But they've got a green tea bath.

584
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,620
 They've got a sake bath, which is very slightly sake.

585
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,860
 It's not obviously not all sake,

586
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,260
 because that'd be hugely expensive.

587
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,340
 They've got a coffee bath, which does not look appetizing.

588
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,340
 Yeah.

589
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,620
 It looks really good.

590
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,020
 It's safe if you have the runs, isn't it?

591
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,780
 Oh, yes.

592
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,580
 Oh, yeah.

593
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,300
 [LAUGHTER]

594
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,260
 Yeah, that sounds-- I'd love to go there.

595
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,060
 It does look cool.

596
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,580
 Sounds awesome.

597
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,500
 I have been to Anonsan a few, in fact, in Japan.

598
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,100
 Really?

599
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,300
 There's a thing in Japan called Hadakano sukiai,

600
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,700
 which means naked camaraderie.

601
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,540
 And the idea is everyone gets naked.

602
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,580
 You're all together in a big sort of jacuzzi with no bubbles.

603
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,900
 And it means you're all emotionally together, open, honest.

604
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,420
 That's the idea behind it.

605
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,740
 And I must admit, I went in, ran in, had a bath, came out,

606
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,700
 and went back to my room as quickly as I could.

607
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,460
 Oh, right.

608
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,220
 You didn't have any--

609
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,500
 Not very communal for you then.

610
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,260
 I don't speak Japanese.

611
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,020
 But there are other ways of communicating, then.

612
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,460
 Yeah, but they could share ads at the best of times

613
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,260
 is difficult.

614
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,940
 I'm just a hawker's back to the last fact.

615
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,180
 You know that Andrew Lloyd Webber has a 30-person hot tub.

616
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,940
 That's disgusting.

617
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,620
 Does he?

618
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,860
 So it's a 30-person hot tub, meaning everyone

619
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,140
 gets a slot on the outer wall.

620
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,820
 What's the alternative?

621
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,620
 That it could--

622
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,260
 Bus format, where it is like six by four.

623
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,020
 Like, what's the--

624
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
 Yeah, what?

625
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,900
 There's an aisle down the middle.

626
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,660
 Tickets, please.

627
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,700
 Chicken of fish?

628
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,300
 Nuts?

629
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,900
 No, we don't have any.

630
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,420
 I can just concede, yours.

631
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,020
 No, I don't-- yeah, I don't know what--

632
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,780
 yeah, I don't know.

633
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,260
 I think it must be that everyone gets a bit of wall.

634
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,660
 Otherwise, you're just popping about in the middle,

635
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,540
 feeling like a lemon, yeah.

636
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,620
 I hate that bit, yeah.

637
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,460
 Oh, yeah.

638
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,220
 Popping.

639
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,260
 There is a spa in the southern island of Tremaccushu,

640
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,460
 and it opened up, I think, in 2017.

641
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,660
 They'd announced it with big fanfare the year before.

642
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,260
 They said, this is going to be--

643
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,340
 Actually, it wasn't a spa.

644
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,020
 It was a spa-themed amusement park.

645
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,700
 And they released some images of basically a rollercoaster

646
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,660
 that's full of bath rollercoaster.

647
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,180
 OK.

648
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,100
 And in a little bath, and that's your--

649
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,140
 Yeah, you know you get in the carriage, and it's a bath.

650
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,300
 And you're in a spa.

651
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,780
 That sounds fun.

652
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,940
 They were not sure at the time if it could be done.

653
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,820
 If it was beyond the can of humanity, but they did it.

654
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,380
 So you're in a compartment that is a jacuzzi, basically?

655
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,580
 I think they didn't quite correct the full rollercoaster bath.

656
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,700
 How do you-- yeah.

657
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,500
 Because that would have been very heavy, obviously.

658
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,340
 It would spill a lot.

659
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
 It would spill a lot.

660
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,380
 It's like an opposite log flume.

661
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,820
 The water's in.

662
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,220
 If you're really unlucky, you'll be dry at the end of it.

663
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

664
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,740
 All the people waiting on the side, yeah.

665
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,420
 Yeah, that's very interesting.

666
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,300
 There's another one, which I wonder if that's there as well,

667
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,940
 where you have an option of arriving,

668
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,420
 and they bury you up to your neck and sand.

669
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,180
 And it's quite hot sand so that you can get whatever,

670
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,820
 you know, holistic therapy.

671
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,100
 So have you ever done any sort of odd pampering things

672
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,940
 like this?

673
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,140
 That you're willing to admit, too?

674
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,940
 I was quite intrigued by the beer baths that you can do.

675
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,620
 You know, in Europe, in the Czech Republic,

676
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,940
 there's a lot-- they're quite popular now.

677
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,220
 You're just like bathing, like, hoppy water,

678
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,260
 a bit like your ramen.

679
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,140
 I wonder if you'd be interested in this thing in Japan.

680
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,460
 It's the Nightingale Fese's Facial.

681
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,380
 Now, it's not what it sounds like.

682
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,420
 It's Fese's from the Japanese Busch Wabler, which

683
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,900
 is not a true nightingale.

684
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,220
 Oh, thank god.

685
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:15,220
 In Japanese, it's brilliantly called Uguisu No Fun.

686
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,940
 Right.

687
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,940
 And apparently-- anyone around you, because you stink of shit.

688
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,580
 Apparently, Victoria Beckham is a proponent of it.

689
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,380
 Oh, no.

690
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
 Wow.

691
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:24,900
 OK.

692
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,900
 That's extreme pampering things.

693
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,140
 I read about the crying therapy rooms,

694
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,820
 which seems really nice.

695
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,500
 The whole idea is to make you a sad as you could possibly be.

696
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,780
 So you go in and you sit down and there's just sad movies

697
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,660
 playing on the screen, and someone sits next to you,

698
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,100
 just going to ask really sad, isn't it?

699
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,860
 And then they hand you tissues as you're crying.

700
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,380
 Just me.

701
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,500
 OK.

702
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 Give that one some else.

703
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 Oh, my god.

704
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
 Oh, that sounds nice.

705
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,980
 So we've got-- have a good cry.

706
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,500
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

707
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,300
 Yeah, I'd buy that.

708
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,140
 Just going back to Onsen, so these baths,

709
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,380
 would you eat an Onsen Tamago, which

710
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:04,620
 is a traditional Japanese egg, which is cooked in a Onsen?

711
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,820
 You put your egg in a rope net.

712
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,820
 You put it in the Onsen, and the water's about 70 degrees,

713
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,060
 and you leave it in for 30 to 40 minutes.

714
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,100
 And then it's done.

715
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,900
 Question?

716
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
 Yeah.

717
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,260
 Because there are two ways of cooking eggs in water.

718
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,260
 Shell on and shell off.

719
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,260
 So are we poaching this, bad boy, are we?

720
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,900
 No, this is, I believe it's shell on, I think.

721
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,340
 Oh, that's fine.

722
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,380
 Shell on, wow, there you go.

723
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,060
 The audience has spoken shell on.

724
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,700
 People in it, it can be in a bath.

725
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,060
 It's not just a water bath, like a battery.

726
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,940
 It's an actual Onsen.

727
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:41,140
 And also, the eggs have a unique silky custard texture.

728
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,220
 I bet they do.

729
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:42,740
 Yeah.

730
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,740
 I would eat that.

731
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,220
 I'm sorry.

732
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,260
 Can I just ask the person, was it a lady in the audience?

733
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,260
 She said, Shell on, have you had one of these?

734
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,260
 They're really good.

735
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:49,860
 They're really good.

736
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,660
 There you go.

737
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,260
 You can't, you know, like a poached egg.

738
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,260
 There's that like bit of white that never gets cooked.

739
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,180
 And it's someone's like flamed on your plate.

740
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,300
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

741
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,180
 Looks like a dementor in the water as it's boiling.

742
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,260
 I've never seen a poached egg that hasn't got it.

743
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
 Why do we put order this?

744
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,780
 It's foul.

745
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,380
 Oh, I love a poached egg.

746
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:05,980
 You do?

747
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,260
 Yeah, okay.

748
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,060
 But they're just like, if it's in its wrapper,

749
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,300
 I don't mind where it's been.

750
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,140
 It's wrapped.

751
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,700
 I'd have a, I'd have a, if there was a banana, a banana in at the same time,

752
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,100
 pop that in the net, I don't mind.

753
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,180
 Yeah.

754
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,140
 Because it's been up her, up her chicken's bum, hasn't it, right?

755
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,820
 Right, let's not get fussy, you know.

756
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,060
 [LAUGHTER]

757
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,780
 I wish I had wrapped it up, I'll be honest.

758
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,620
 Let's go.

759
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,580
 But I just want the other weird spot thing.

760
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,660
 There was that bullseam and hair treatment, right?

761
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,180
 Okay.

762
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,020
 Did you hear it read about this in Chelsea?

763
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,860
 No.

764
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,660
 In Chelsea?

765
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,660
 Yeah.

766
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,180
 Okay.

767
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,020
 It was a hair mask, basically.

768
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,140
 In 2008, 2009.

769
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,060
 Hair mask?

770
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,580
 Yeah.

771
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,420
 It was this place called Harry's Salon in Chelsea.

772
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:55,060
 It offered a 45-minute Aberdeen organic hair treatment, which was Aberdeen Angus,

773
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,940
 like good quality.

774
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,740
 Bull comes.

775
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
 Stuff.

776
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,020
 Which women would like, I don't know, I guess, would pay like a lot of money to have,

777
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,380
 like, lathered over their hair, and would just like sit with it for 45 minutes.

778
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,140
 And apparently, it was amazing.

779
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,740
 Really?

780
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,980
 And it made the hair silky and smooth, and--

781
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,540
 But I have made head-in shoulders too in one shampoo and conditioner, and that makes my hair silky and smooth.

782
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,020
 Andy, are there levels of silkeness and smoothness that I've not matched yet?

783
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,980
 You haven't lived.

784
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,420
 I can imagine one of these women from Chelsea going into the countryside afterwards,

785
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,820
 and walking through a field, and all the female cows are like, do you smell something?

786
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,820
 Yeah.

787
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:39,180
 Well, it's funny to say that, because the people that ran this Salon,

788
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,580
 told the Metro a new, sorry, these pervert fraudsters, yeah, it's gone.

789
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:48,820
 These quacks said to the Metro that the semen is refrigerated before use, and doesn't smell.

790
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,980
 I mean, it is come, but it's not, you know--

791
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,780
 It's not going to stay refrigerated.

792
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,900
 That's the problem.

793
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,380
 The body heat is going to cause that to warm up.

794
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,940
 Yeah, but it's 45 minutes a bit.

795
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,380
 You were going to eat an egg from a bunch of people, like, what do you mean?

796
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,020
 Like, don't get all--

797
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,020
 We do need to move on to our next factory.

798
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,020
 No!

799
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,860
 Oh, yeah.

800
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,860
 But we ran him.

801
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,460
 I've got the dreams of engineering stuff about how the Fukushima

802
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,660
 reacted dealt with its water after the terrible incident there.

803
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,660
 But I'll save it.

804
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,660
 You save it.

805
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,660
 It's fascinating.

806
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,660
 They built an underground wall with ice.

807
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,660
 Oh, he's going for it.

808
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,660
 He's moving on.

809
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:27,860
 OK, we do need to move on.

810
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,220
 So it is time for fact number three, and that is--

811
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,580
 Oh, it's Andy.

812
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,220
 So--

813
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,140
 After the terrible incident at Fukushima,

814
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,300
 the engineers, they're pulled off a miracle, a miracle,

815
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,580
 of preventing the radioactive.

816
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,140
 So they've got, imagine, a 1.5-kilometer radius circle.

817
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,540
 Oh, 30 meters underground filled with frozen brine.

818
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,420
 Get off your phone.

819
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
 Come on.

820
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,180
 How's your phone?

821
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,060
 I'll try to start against shock of its two seconds.

822
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,820
 OK, anyway.

823
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,580
 Sorry.

824
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,580
 My fact is, the first named man who sent a letter

825
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,020
 bomb only invented it to get back at people

826
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,380
 who had rejected all his other ideas for inventions.

827
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,620
 So this is very funny.

828
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,300
 I love this guy.

829
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,340
 He's a very interesting historical figure.

830
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,780
 His name was Martin Eckenberg, and I was on the website

831
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,980
 of the Clapham Society, which is a great website all about Clapham,

832
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,740
 which is a part of South London, where I used to live.

833
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:28,500
 And he was a Swedish scientist, Martin Eckenberg, born in 1870.

834
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,420
 He was kind of a gifted inventor in some ways.

835
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,660
 His ideas were decent, but the other problem that he had,

836
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,900
 personally, was that he was a liar.

837
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,900
 He was a cheat.

838
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,100
 He claimed qualifications he didn't have.

839
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,940
 He'd been kicked out of Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology

840
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
 specifically for cheating.

841
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,860
 He was a badden.

842
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,620
 He was a badden.

843
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,140
 He was a badden.

844
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,540
 Fucking legend.

845
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,140
 So free thinker.

846
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,260
 A free thinker.

847
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,420
 Outside the box kind of guy.

848
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,940
 But still, this didn't hold him back that much,

849
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,100
 because he moved to one of the nicest houses in Clapham.

850
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,260
 It was this really beautiful mansion he moved to.

851
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,420
 That's not the point of the fact.

852
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,420
 It's been replaced by flats now, so you can't go and visit it.

853
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,740
 But if you were, that's weird.

854
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,860
 And you should be on a terror list.

855
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,460
 And then in 1905, if you thought, right,

856
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,140
 I'm going to get revenge on everyone who's turned down

857
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,660
 my ideas along the way, who turned me down for finance.

858
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,860
 I am going to get back at you.

859
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,420
 And he's so basically created, started

860
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,100
 making his own letter bombs.

861
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,940
 And there were packages sent through the post

862
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,900
 to harm people before.

863
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,940
 But I think he's the first named sort of--

864
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,900
 I thought I think it was a bit unfair.

865
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,380
 So like the first person that he really sent it to was a guy

866
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,220
 called London, who ran this company.

867
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,140
 It was like an engineering company.

868
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,580
 And Eckenberg had invented something

869
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,220
 that could turn fish oil into engine oil.

870
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,340
 And he thought it was going to make his millions.

871
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,460
 But it failed.

872
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,740
 And so he thought, well, I'm going to get this guy London.

873
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,340
 But the reason it failed is because the oil still

874
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,100
 smelled a fish.

875
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,140
 So like if people put it in their cars,

876
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,140
 the car smelled a fish.

877
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,660
 Right.

878
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,460
 So it's supposed to be that Harry isn't get that sent removed,

879
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,900
 but the pool's semen.

880
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
 Well, no, and ships that was going to be used on ships,

881
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,460
 which have fish, obviously.

882
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,260
 That's true.

883
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,420
 Hence the phrase, fish and ships.

884
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
 But yeah, that--

885
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,100
 [LAUGHTER]

886
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,340
 And then this guy, London, opens the packet.

887
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,860
 And it said, I read an article in the newspaper that

888
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,900
 said, it rumbles and shook like thunder.

889
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,620
 The director felt as if he had been hit by lightning

890
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,500
 or tickled by lightning.

891
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,380
 And intense flame burst out the box

892
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,340
 and burned his hands, arms, chest, and face terribly.

893
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,780
 And his clothes went on fire.

894
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,940
 And the next day he got a postcard saying,

895
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,860
 a former employee has decided that you're ripe for the picking.

896
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,460
 Yes.

897
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,220
 What's interesting is that it's not

898
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,180
 as if he sent it from the post in the UK, which

899
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,500
 would be more traceable.

900
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,940
 He went by boat back to Sweden.

901
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,780
 He assembled it there, sent it there,

902
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,660
 and then went back home.

903
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,700
 So he really covered up his tracks.

904
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,780
 But then he still set a postcard with his writing

905
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,340
 identifiable on it to the person he'd just--

906
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,620
 Yeah.

907
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,020
 I mean, he was caught for various quite stupid things

908
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,940
 like that.

909
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,940
 Yeah.

910
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,420
 Can I just rescind that I thought he was good?

911
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,500
 No, no.

912
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,180
 There's another thing as well, James,

913
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,340
 see if you still think he's good.

914
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,420
 When he was arrested, he claimed innocent.

915
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,780
 And then according to the New York Times,

916
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,940
 he lost his reason and was taken to an asylum.

917
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,980
 He died two months later after his arrest

918
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,500
 of what they said was apoplexy.

919
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,220
 But the head of the Swedish detective service

920
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,420
 said that if he'd been sent back to Sweden,

921
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,780
 he would have also been tried for murdering his two wives.

922
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,620
 Oh.

923
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,620
 Right.

924
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,620
 Yeah, no, yeah.

925
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,620
 How you feeling?

926
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,140
 Sorry about that.

927
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,180
 Let's get a live reaction from Jamie Morden sitting

928
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,820
 right here.

929
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,660
 Sounds fine.

930
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,660
 Yeah.

931
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,380
 Not too shabby.

932
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,940
 So apparently, what appears to have happened

933
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,060
 is he poisoned his first two wives,

934
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,820
 and then he bribed the prison guards

935
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,860
 to get him the same poison, which he then took himself.

936
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,900
 Yeah, yeah.

937
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,860
 Unique thinker.

938
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,900
 And interestingly, today, if you go to the police museum

939
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,300
 in Stockholm, there's a giant wax work,

940
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,620
 like a replica human-sized wax replica of him standing there.

941
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,020
 And not only that, they have a bunch of things

942
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,100
 that were to do with the case.

943
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,620
 So one of the bombings, which was sent to the Swedish

944
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,940
 export society, was opened up by a man called John Hammer.

945
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,940
 And John Hammer's thumb was blown off

946
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,500
 as part of opening the scene.

947
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,380
 And if you go to the police museum in Stockholm,

948
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,660
 you can see the wax work of Morden Eckenberg.

949
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,740
 And then you can see the actual thumb of John Hammer.

950
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,140
 Thumbs up or thumbs down.

951
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,060
 It's the--

952
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,900
 Yeah, he wasn't happy.

953
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,100
 It's a definite thumbs down for me.

954
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,900
 It's, yeah.

955
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,940
 So it's very, very grim guy.

956
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,020
 But he was an innovator of sorts.

957
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,860
 And as I say, people had been sending devices

958
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,500
 designed to hurt other people through the post for ages.

959
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,340
 So the very first one was a thing called the bound box plot.

960
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,580
 People were very worried about the weak party

961
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,300
 in the, I think, 18th century.

962
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,260
 And supposedly, that party were involved in some attempts

963
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,620
 to assassinate people.

964
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,420
 Get this.

965
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,780
 The very first ever thing sent through the post designed

966
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,700
 to harm someone, this bound box plot,

967
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,100
 was a box full of, I think, the three pistols.

968
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,780
 When you open it, they all go off.

969
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,780
 At you.

970
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,060
 Wow, I know.

971
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,940
 And it was--

972
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,460
 Oh, my God.

973
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,740
 This is the story that it was thwarted by Jonathan Swift,

974
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,780
 the author of "Gull of his Travels."

975
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,300
 Yeah.

976
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,900
 Because he was a political figure as well.

977
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,620
 And he's supposedly noticed a thread on the box

978
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,580
 and cut it before opening it.

979
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,540
 Oh, so he's the first red wire, blue wire cut moment

980
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,060
 that we've ever had for a bomb.

981
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,220
 Yeah, pretty cool.

982
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,420
 And we talk about his books instead.

983
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,460
 But "Eck and Berg" was the first of a kind of new wave

984
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,420
 where "Gump out" had been invented,

985
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,140
 a post had improved, things like that.

986
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,820
 And so there were anarchists.

987
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,420
 People were very, very worried about anarchists

988
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,380
 with their kind of cartoon-style bombs

989
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,660
 that they'd be throwing.

990
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,260
 Yeah.

991
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,100
 And he also invented a way to freeze dry milk, which

992
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,900
 is kind of similar to what we have today.

993
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,380
 So like instant custard, we wouldn't have it without him.

994
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:40,900
 Really?

995
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,580
 Well, "Eck and Berg."

996
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,380
 Wow.

997
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,660
 Jamie, you want to change your--

998
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,820
 Because you go on often, but I know you don't mind custard,

999
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,660
 do you know?

1000
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,100
 I'm a bit of custard, I mean, I'm--

1001
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,100
 50/50.

1002
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,180
 It requires people.

1003
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,740
 Now, I'll tell you why I think he's not a complete villain.

1004
00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:02,140
 So it's so interesting, which hills people choose to die on.

1005
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,300
 I find that really fascinating.

1006
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,380
 I just kind of love the fact that through revenge,

1007
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,420
 he invented something that was actually--

1008
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,380
 I mean, not a good thing, but was--

1009
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,500
 It was like a thing.

1010
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,780
 This silver lining is slimming down all the time.

1011
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,460
 I got to say.

1012
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,260
 So it was for revenge, but he did event something really bad.

1013
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,460
 Well, maybe it's just how my mind worked,

1014
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,700
 because I mean, I got quite heavily into revenge

1015
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,300
 during my researching of this.

1016
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,980
 So I was like, what else has revenge kind of created?

1017
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,700
 And the rotary telephone is one thing that revenge has created.

1018
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:39,140
 Yeah, because there was a guy called Alman Stroudger,

1019
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,900
 and he was an undertaker in the late 19th century

1020
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,500
 in Kansas City.

1021
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,180
 They were all manual switchboards at that point, obviously.

1022
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,580
 And he thought that the switchboard operators

1023
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,340
 were deliberately fiddling with his connections,

1024
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,540
 because--

1025
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,940
 Wait, so you would call up and say, patch me through to this person.

1026
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,860
 And he was convinced that this was being meddled with,

1027
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,660
 because the other undertakers across the town,

1028
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,820
 I think their wife worked at the phone company.

1029
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,740
 So someone dies, you put them through to the rival.

1030
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,580
 And yeah, exactly.

1031
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,540
 So they were getting all the work.

1032
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,860
 He was like, what's going on here?

1033
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,220
 And so he invented the rotary telephone

1034
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,340
 to cut out the--

1035
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,580
 What was the one where you dial with this?

1036
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,020
 Yeah, so you could dial it yourself.

1037
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,860
 That is amazing.

1038
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,140
 It's not amazing.

1039
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,260
 Revenge, but not all bad.

1040
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
 OK.

1041
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,700
 It's like those spite houses.

1042
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,660
 You know, spite houses.

1043
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,260
 And it's just so cool that something

1044
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,860
 that you build to screw someone over

1045
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,180
 ends up being worth more than the house that--

1046
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,620
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1047
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,100
 I just love stuff like that.

1048
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,820
 Just jumping back to Leatherbond's for a second,

1049
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,180
 I've discovered that the former prime minister--

1050
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,540
 well, a very long former prime minister, Anthony Eden--

1051
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,860
 so prime minister of England--

1052
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,580
 he was almost killed by Leatherbond.

1053
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,580
 Yeah, and this was prior to him being prime minister.

1054
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,860
 It was when he was foreign secretary.

1055
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,660
 And someone had hand-delivered a Leatherbond.

1056
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,700
 He took it.

1057
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,620
 But he saw, oh, this looks a bit boring.

1058
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,500
 So he put it in his briefcase.

1059
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,020
 And he had it for 24 hours.

1060
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,340
 He went home, he didn't open it.

1061
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,660
 He just had a whole day of not opening it.

1062
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,500
 And then Scotland got--

1063
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,340
 And that's a looked boring.

1064
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,940
 Yeah, he thought it looked like a circular.

1065
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,900
 It looked like something that might have been dropped off.

1066
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,020
 And it was a generic thing.

1067
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,060
 Oh, right, OK.

1068
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,540
 And so then Scotland Yard got in contact and said,

1069
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,260
 we're worried that something might have been sent to you

1070
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,300
 that is a bomb.

1071
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,020
 And he still didn't look at it.

1072
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,420
 And it was his secretary who eventually went,

1073
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,740
 that might be a bomb.

1074
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,100
 And then-- and it was.

1075
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,980
 And so it was just purely his absolute boredom

1076
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,660
 towards his letter that the most interesting letter

1077
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,020
 he ever received actually had.

1078
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,100
 And that's the thing is, they're

1079
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,340
 designed to go off when you open them out there.

1080
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,860
 So you can carry them around, and it's fine.

1081
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,740
 So for instance, you're told that if you work in a government

1082
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,780
 office and they might happen, a lot of people

1083
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,860
 when they get a letter that they're not sure about,

1084
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,260
 they put it in water, because they

1085
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,900
 think that's what you're supposed to do with a bomb,

1086
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,580
 but you're absolutely not supposed to put it in water.

1087
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,860
 Because some of the explosives will explode

1088
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,660
 if you put them in a big-- is that so?

1089
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,460
 Also renders the letter completely illegible.

1090
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,500
 Exactly.

1091
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,300
 I've got stupid idea.

1092
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,260
 There are some tips.

1093
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,420
 There are some useful tips, actually.

1094
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,380
 So warning signs include excess postage.

1095
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,140
 Like, why is someone spending so much money on their parcel?

1096
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,980
 Because you don't want to risk it getting returned to you.

1097
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,580
 Right.

1098
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,900
 No return address.

1099
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,500
 So the really clever bombers will leave the return address

1100
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,260
 off.

1101
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,220
 I think I would put the return address as my number two

1102
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,700
 nemesis.

1103
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,220
 Yeah, nice.

1104
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,100
 Such a good idea.

1105
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,020
 Yeah.

1106
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,820
 Such a good idea.

1107
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,020
 Number two--

1108
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,820
 I think it's a long-old list.

1109
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,620
 It's a long-old list, journalist.

1110
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,740
 Bad spelling.

1111
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,260
 Oh.

1112
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,220
 Because there are a lot of people sending these things,

1113
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,500
 and maybe I'm going to slide off letter bombs.

1114
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,220
 They're not the brightest buttons.

1115
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:57,980
 Really?

1116
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,780
 Yeah, bad spelling.

1117
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,780
 Because they've just constructed a bomb.

1118
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,540
 It feels like you've got a basic--

1119
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,380
 Fair to get one.

1120
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,260
 What are you doing?

1121
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,460
 They might have studied the sciences and not the humanities.

1122
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,660
 Yes, that's the point.

1123
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,300
 There are so many kinds of intelligence.

1124
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:16,980
 Addressed personal, confidential, or do not x-ray.

1125
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,980
 That's wrong.

1126
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,620
 And the final one-- just for any of that

1127
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,860
 have slipped through those many holes in the Swiss cheese,

1128
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,020
 ticking sounds.

1129
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,500
 Protrooting wires, OK, yeah, or aluminium foil.

1130
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,620
 Or if it says "acme bomb," on the front.

1131
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,220
 If it's dropped off by a coyote who looks pleased with himself,

1132
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,580
 that's another one.

1133
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,500
 I did read.

1134
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,660
 There was a-- what's the name of the journalist?

1135
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,140
 Slasov Zizek.

1136
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,140
 Slasov Zizek.

1137
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,180
 Yeah, so he wrote this piece.

1138
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,900
 And the opening anecdote of the piece

1139
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,100
 at the top winner in the contest for the greatest blunder

1140
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,460
 of 1998 was a Latin American patriotic terrorist

1141
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,420
 who sent a letter bomb to a US consulate

1142
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,220
 in order to protest against America

1143
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,140
 interfering local politics.

1144
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,500
 As a conscientious citizen, he wrote his return address

1145
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,420
 on the envelope.

1146
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,700
 However, he did not put enough stamps on it.

1147
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,220
 So that post was returned to him.

1148
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,500
 Forgetting he'd put it in, he opened it, and blew himself up.

1149
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,260
 He did, and he did what James said.

1150
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,660
 Now, who knows if that's apocryphal, but it's--

1151
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,260
 What's his name?

1152
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,460
 All the fingerprints of Jack Waz, anyway, near this.

1153
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,180
 [LAUGHTER]

1154
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,060
 I'll tell you what.

1155
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,460
 That was the first time Jack Waz and Slasov Zizek

1156
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,460
 have been mentioned in the same sentence together.

1157
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,540
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1158
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,300
 It is time for our final fact of the show.

1159
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,740
 And that is James.

1160
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,540
 OK, my fact this week is that there

1161
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,540
 is currently a scandal in Thailand.

1162
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,140
 After at least a dozen supposedly celibate monks

1163
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:52,260
 admitted to having sex with a woman called Mrs. Gulf.

1164
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,140
 James, you're a keen golfer.

1165
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,140
 That's how I found this.

1166
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,980
 I was googling gol.

1167
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,260
 No, no, no, no.

1168
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,260
 Now, I just read this in the news,

1169
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,140
 and I thought it's very amusing.

1170
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,060
 It is a lot of senior monks.

1171
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,300
 I mean, not amusing, if you're a monk,

1172
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,060
 because obviously a lot of them have lost their livelihoods,

1173
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,540
 including some as high-ranking as frat dep, which

1174
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,380
 means angelic level.

1175
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,020
 So this goes to the very, very top.

1176
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,220
 And it turns out they've been having relationships

1177
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,500
 with this woman who's called Mrs. Gulf,

1178
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,980
 and they've been transferring money to her.

1179
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,060
 And they've found this lady, and they

1180
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:33,420
 found over 80,000 photos of naked monks on her phone.

1181
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,740
 How do they know their monks?

1182
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,540
 Sorry to quibble.

1183
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,860
 I reckon there's a way.

1184
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,660
 You reckon there's a way?

1185
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,260
 It's probably a way.

1186
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,500
 I reckon there's a way.

1187
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,460
 Probably it's the hair style down there.

1188
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,380
 It's like a tons, yeah.

1189
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,420
 80,000 is a lot.

1190
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,420
 Not necessarily all different monks.

1191
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,420
 They could have been--

1192
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,380
 I don't even know if I have that amount of storage on my phone

1193
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,140
 for 80,000 photos.

1194
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,340
 Yes, what was their data cloud like?

1195
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,380
 This is really interesting.

1196
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,340
 Is she in the cloud?

1197
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,820
 She's using the cloud.

1198
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,580
 So yeah, and the reason she's called Mrs. Gulf

1199
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,020
 is because this is like common in Thailand

1200
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,620
 for people to have little short nicknames.

1201
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,060
 And you're kind of given them as a child by your parents.

1202
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,180
 And they don't really mean anything.

1203
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,500
 It might be that this person's parents love Gulf,

1204
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,500
 but more likely they just take a Western word that kind of sounds

1205
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,940
 fun or trendy or whatever.

1206
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,180
 And they just call that.

1207
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,100
 The most famous Thai person in the world

1208
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,020
 probably is Lisa from Blackpink.

1209
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,180
 And her nickname is Pockpack.

1210
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,180
 So they're just mostly just sounds

1211
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,420
 or they might be little words from other languages.

1212
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,060
 But it's just like a little nickname.

1213
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,700
 But people go by it in real life.

1214
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,100
 Like as adults, you might still be known as that nickname.

1215
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,100
 Yeah.

1216
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,620
 But so this is an unbelievably fascinating story.

1217
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,940
 This one woman went around so many of these different monasteries

1218
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,420
 and managed to talk in what were effectively,

1219
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:57,140
 I'm assuming, celibate monks into engaging not only in sex,

1220
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,340
 but also having photos taken.

1221
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,980
 And the top monks, some of them have fled the country.

1222
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,300
 We don't know quite where they are.

1223
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,180
 And they haven't said why they've done that.

1224
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:09,380
 They're now investigating 300,000 other Buddhist monks

1225
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,260
 in Thailand off the back of this

1226
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,660
 to see whether or not they're involved.

1227
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,380
 And she got a lot of money off the back of this.

1228
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,500
 Was her own extortion, sort of, I'll release the photos.

1229
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,980
 So the photos would be shown back to them

1230
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,140
 and then they would have to pay money.

1231
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,100
 And a lot of the monks have been acquitted

1232
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,820
 where the police have decided that actually you just

1233
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,740
 gave her money because she was pleading for the money

1234
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,900
 and didn't engage in sexual activity.

1235
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,420
 And trust me.

1236
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,540
 But you know how much money allegedly,

1237
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:39,940
 she has netted the equivalent of $11.9 million from this.

1238
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,780
 There's a lot of money in munching, isn't that?

1239
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,140
 Isn't that?

1240
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,300
 Yeah, that's a bigger career than I thought.

1241
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,020
 Like no, my career advisor did not say,

1242
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,860
 have you considered becoming a monk?

1243
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,860
 And I think it's like quite a big deal in Thailand

1244
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,660
 because if you're a Buddhist, you

1245
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,420
 think that if someone becomes a monk,

1246
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,340
 then they kind of automatically sort

1247
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,820
 of develop this strong resistance to temptation

1248
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,980
 and that kind of thing.

1249
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,780
 And so to find out that they haven't

1250
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,820
 was quite a big deal for a lot of people.

1251
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,620
 Yeah.

1252
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:12,340
 I think this is very interesting, because I started reading about--

1253
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,700
 by the way, James, there's a very hard factor

1254
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,700
 to Google, like naughty monks.

1255
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,140
 And naughty nuns is actually even worse.

1256
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,060
 It's an even harder legit Google.

1257
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,460
 But basically, there was a lot of this

1258
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:29,380
 in the 16th century in England, because monks and nuns

1259
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,340
 and monasteries and nunneries were seen as hoppets of sin.

1260
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,420
 And the idea was, they're all on the take.

1261
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,860
 They're all selling pardoning for sins, that kind of thing,

1262
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,060
 like they're all--

1263
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,300
 And they're all shacking up.

1264
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,780
 And there were some institutions--

1265
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,700
 Cancer Reformation.

1266
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,980
 Like, Cancer Reformation, right.

1267
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,700
 But I think we've all been conned into thinking

1268
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,540
 that monks and nuns are inherently sort of naughty figures,

1269
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,020
 because they're absolutely not.

1270
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,140
 And I think we fall off a Henry VIII era propaganda.

1271
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,340
 And I'm blowing the lid off this.

1272
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,100
 Not enough people talk about it, but I'm not afraid to.

1273
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,060
 I'd just like to reference the paper by Christian Knudsen,

1274
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,700
 Sodomitic monks and other dissolution myths,

1275
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,500
 the late medieval monastic decline narrative revisited.

1276
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,700
 And it is a belting read.

1277
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,940
 It's really good.

1278
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,780
 And can you tell us more about the Fukushima disaster?

1279
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,540
 [LAUGHTER]

1280
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:21,940
 But like, Henry VIII wanted to dissolve the monasteries.

1281
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,460
 I mean, because they owned a huge proportion of English land,

1282
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:25,820
 right?

1283
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,300
 There was so wealthy.

1284
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,540
 And Henry VIII thought, I'm going to discredit

1285
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,060
 ecclesiastical institutions anyway I can.

1286
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,660
 And every monastery in England, in 1535 and 6,

1287
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,500
 got a visit from bureaucrats who were trying

1288
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,140
 to record every dubious incidents of behavior by a monk

1289
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,420
 or a nun they could.

1290
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,540
 And there were some cases, absolutely.

1291
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,060
 There were some cases where monks had been playing the field

1292
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:47,700
 or whatever it is.

1293
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,380
 But they also had to come up with new crimes.

1294
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,780
 So they found dozens of instances

1295
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,380
 recorded of voluntary pollution, which

1296
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,740
 is just sort of playing with yourself.

1297
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,540
 But it's not.

1298
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,620
 In one priori, West Acres, 76% of the monks

1299
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,340
 were labeled incontinent by which they

1300
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,140
 mean romantically incontinent.

1301
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:09,260
 But 10 of those 13 were for just enjoying some cowl billiards.

1302
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,460
 And so it's not cow, the cow goes in your head, doesn't it?

1303
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,780
 You know what I mean?

1304
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,500
 Hardly ever.

1305
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:19,260
 I just think it's really interesting.

1306
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,860
 And I think we shouldn't fall for it.

1307
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,140
 OK, well, we won't.

1308
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,740
 But also, like, I'm a Catholic.

1309
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,300
 I mean, you know, lapsed carefully.

1310
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,860
 Like, you can do anything if you say sorry.

1311
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,100
 That's like the point.

1312
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:31,940
 Yes.

1313
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,460
 But actually, the penance was quite severe, or it could be.

1314
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,260
 So Richard Gray, one man called Richard Gray, a medieval England,

1315
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,620
 he was found guilty of having sex with a nun.

1316
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,980
 And he was sentenced to being flogged while walking

1317
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,100
 around Stanford church on four Sundays in a row,

1318
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,780
 carrying a candle while dressed only in linen garments.

1319
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,420
 And then he had to make a barefoot pilgrimage

1320
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,780
 to Lincoln Cathedral from wherever he lived.

1321
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,260
 Wow, that's a movable feast of a punishment, isn't it?

1322
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,420
 You just want a feast of art, right?

1323
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,340
 I'm going to get a flat just outside Lincoln.

1324
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:12,140
 Yeah, that was quite a mess for me to not say

1325
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,140
 where he actually lived in my notes.

1326
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,740
 No, that's not true.

1327
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,500
 But then he, and then after that, he didn't do what he was supposed

1328
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,900
 to do, and they've excommunicated him.

1329
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,580
 But in those days, being excommunicated was a big, old deal.

1330
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,380
 Right.

1331
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,300
 Like, because it can't amaze you can't go to heaven,

1332
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,140
 but it also amaze you can't be baptized.

1333
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,820
 And you can't get married, you can't do all sorts of different things.

1334
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,620
 Yeah, and actually, quite often, the women

1335
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,980
 were punished more than the men.

1336
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,020
 So two that happened quite close to each other,

1337
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,620
 a guy called Nicholas Plymouth was a monk who

1338
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,460
 has committed adultery with a Tanner's wife,

1339
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,780
 and he was ordered to remain silent for one week.

1340
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,620
 And around the same time, someone

1341
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,580
 called Alice Longspray was sentenced

1342
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,580
 to a year of strict confinement after an affair with a priest.

1343
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,580
 That was double standards.

1344
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,500
 It is double standards, yeah.

1345
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,980
 James, you've spent time in Bhutan.

1346
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:01,580
 I have.

1347
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,540
 Did you ever hear of the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

1348
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,700
 while you were out there?

1349
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,340
 That's what they still call me that, man.

1350
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:12,460
 I wonder when the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

1351
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,380
 is going to return.

1352
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:20,180
 So it's referring to amongst penis.

1353
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:30,780
 But so a question who your real friends were out there.

1354
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,540
 It was straights that they yelled at me at the streets.

1355
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,140
 Is that right?

1356
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,700
 There was this guy, Druckper Cunley,

1357
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,860
 and he was in the 1400s.

1358
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,140
 Yeah, I've been to his church.

1359
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,580
 You've been to his church, God, so he was interesting,

1360
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,860
 because he was known as the Saint of 5,000 women.

1361
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,820
 He was a fertility saint.

1362
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,420
 The idea was he thought sex should be incorporated

1363
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,060
 into reaching enlightenment.

1364
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,620
 And so classic.

1365
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,020
 Yeah, you would meet the thunderbolt of flaming wisdom

1366
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,060
 as part of your hello to him, basically.

1367
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:06,220
 And he was liked, but mad as fuck.

1368
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,500
 Like, people genuinely thought he was.

1369
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,500
 And what I wanted--

1370
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,460
 It is known as the holy mad man or something like that.

1371
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,820
 And he introduced this idea, which still goes on

1372
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,740
 in very spits of Bhutan today, which

1373
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,740
 is that if you're setting up a new house

1374
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,700
 and you need it to be blessed, you would basically graffiti,

1375
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,460
 fallists, put dig picks, all over, like,

1376
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,260
 draw a penis all over the walls.

1377
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,140
 Did you see any--

1378
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,780
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're on every house, Haslam.

1379
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,280
 Yeah.

1380
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,620
 In this particular town where he was from.

1381
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,820
 And also, if you go into his church,

1382
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,420
 a priest comes up to you with a giant fallace

1383
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,140
 and sort of touches you as if you'd

1384
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,900
 been knighted by the queen.

1385
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,020
 Rise.

1386
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:41,820
 Did you have that?

1387
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,340
 Yeah.

1388
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,420
 Wow.

1389
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,220
 Arise.

1390
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,100
 [LAUGHTER]

1391
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,260
 If it's on every house, can you put it on a semi?

1392
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:49,780
 Sorry.

1393
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,620
 Go on.

1394
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,100
 [LAUGHTER]

1395
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,420
 Do you want to know something cool about the first century

1396
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:56,740
 saint, Thecla?

1397
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,220
 Yes, please.

1398
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:57,740
 Yes, please.

1399
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,740
 This was sent in by a listener, actually.

1400
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,660
 Lesson of Cat Brinker.

1401
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,860
 So thanks, Cat, for this.

1402
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,580
 This is the first century saint, Thecla.

1403
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,100
 She is the unofficial patron saint of computers

1404
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,340
 and the internet.

1405
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,060
 And can you work out why?

1406
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,940
 It's going to be sex-connected, presumably.

1407
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,020
 Nope.

1408
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,140
 But you said it was to do with the internet.

1409
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:15,660
 No, I know.

1410
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,860
 No, I know.

1411
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,940
 What would a first century monk have to do with computers

1412
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,820
 and the internet?

1413
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,460
 She liked cats.

1414
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,580
 That's a really good one.

1415
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,900
 That's very close.

1416
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:28,180
 She was very racist all the time.

1417
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,580
 It's because her name, Thecla, sounds like the Spanish word,

1418
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,740
 for a key, on a keyboard.

1419
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,740
 Thecla.

1420
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,740
 OK.

1421
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,740
 Ah, Thecla.

1422
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,580
 You've not just wasted their time.

1423
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,780
 [LAUGHTER]

1424
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,780
 Unbelievable.

1425
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,380
 If you'd like to know some other grabs of the word Thecla,

1426
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,300
 I've got loads.

1428
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,140
 That is it.

1429
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,340
 That is all of our facts.

1430
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,820
 Thank you so much for listening.

1431
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,580
 Thank you for everyone who has joined us

1432
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,460
 around the world on the live stream.

1433
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,660
 We are all found on our online accounts.

1434
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,340
 You can get us on Instagram.

1435
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:05,820
 I'm there.

1436
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,220
 I'm on @Sriberland.

1437
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:07,980
 James.

1438
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,660
 I'm on TikTok.

1439
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,300
 No, such thing as James Harkin.

1440
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:10,980
 Andy?

1441
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,140
 Oh, Instagram @MrsGolf.

1442
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,820
 80,000 photos on his grid.

1443
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,780
 It's insane.

1444
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,820
 It's too much, mate.

1445
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,580
 It's too much.

1446
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,620
 And Jamie?

1447
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,820
 Uncle Igor, it's weird, don't worry.

1448
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,060
 OK.

1449
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:27,580
 Yep.

1450
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,100
 And if you want to send us any of your facts,

1451
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,900
 you can do that as well by going to podcast@QI.com.

1452
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,740
 So send us facts.

1453
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,460
 Send us anything that you heard in this episode

1454
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,420
 that you want to talk about.

1455
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,780
 We take it all, and we bring it to our special secret room,

1456
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,020
 which is part of Club Fish.

1457
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,700
 We've got any Club Fish members here.

1458
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,940
 6, OK?

1459
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,620
 Everybody.

1460
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,180
 But we will read them out there as part of our mailbag specials.

1461
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:52,860
 So do do that.

1462
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,260
 Go online, find out if we're coming to a town near you

1463
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,380
 with more live shows.

1464
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,740
 But otherwise, come back here next week

1465
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,540
 for more of our actual show.

1466
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,660
 It's all free.

1467
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,420
 Come and do that.

1468
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,020
 Thank you so much, everyone, for being here tonight.

1469
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,100
 London Podcast Festival.

1470
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,100
 That was awesome.

1471
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,460
 We will see you again.

1472
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,900
 Good bye.
