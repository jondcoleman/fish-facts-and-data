00:00:00,00:00:02,"Hi guys, we've got a seriously special guest on the podcast today."
00:00:02,00:00:08,It is Sarah Pasco and you're about to hear that she is brilliant and funny and fascinating
00:00:08,00:00:12,and has a book out which is also all of those three things.
00:00:12,00:00:17,"It's called Animal, or if you want the full, unedited title, it's called Animal, Cologne,"
00:00:17,00:00:21,the autobiography of a female body and it's out right now.
00:00:21,00:00:22,Go and get it.
00:00:22,00:00:24,"Okay, on with the show."
00:00:24,00:00:42,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:42,00:00:45,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:45,00:00:46,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:46,00:00:50,"I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, Anne Chazinski, James Harkin, and Sarah Pasco."
00:00:50,00:00:54,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from"
00:00:54,00:00:58,"the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:58,00:01:00,"Starting with you, Sarah Pasco."
00:01:00,00:01:08,"Okay, in the 1920s, scientists concluded that menstruating women wilted flowers."
00:01:08,00:01:15,"So, it's a proper scientist and so he's name, and it's a he, but his name's Bella Schick,"
00:01:15,00:01:17,"I think, I've only seen it written down."
00:01:17,00:01:22,"And he's a proper scientist, he cured diptheria, and I think apparently he was the first person"
00:01:22,00:01:27,"to use the word immunization, so he's a proper guy, but then one day he's made, was passing"
00:01:27,00:01:28,him some flowers.
00:01:28,00:01:33,"So she was like, I don't want to pass you the flowers, and then he's, do the flowers."
00:01:33,00:01:37,"And then the next day they were all wilted, these red roses, and she was like, oh, I knew"
00:01:37,00:01:38,that was going to happen.
00:01:38,00:01:39,I'm on my period.
00:01:39,00:01:40,"And he was like, what?"
00:01:40,00:01:42,"And she's like, yeah, women are poisonous when on their periods."
00:01:42,00:01:47,"They can't look at bread, or dogs, children, or such flowers, or go swimming."
00:01:47,00:01:51,"And he was like, oh my god, I'm a scientist, I didn't even know about this."
00:01:51,00:01:57,"So he then did all these experiments with women holding flowers and baking bread, and he"
00:01:57,00:02:02,"gave it the term menotoxin, which were emitted by women in their tear glands and their sweat"
00:02:02,00:02:03,glands.
00:02:03,00:02:12,"So his study showed, reading between the lines, and"
00:02:12,00:02:16,"I'm no conspiracy theorist, but reading between the lines, it sounded like the women held"
00:02:16,00:02:21,the flowers for quite a long time outside of water.
00:02:21,00:02:26,"And then they wilted, whereas flowers in water, the control group, they were fine."
00:02:26,00:02:30,"There was an experiment with bread as well, and one made, it was on her period."
00:02:30,00:02:33,"I mean, it must have been such a lovely house to work in."
00:02:33,00:02:37,"So she made everyone make bread, and hers, hers didn't rise as much."
00:02:37,00:02:42,"She was holding it in her hand, and the other, hers didn't rise as much for that exact"
00:02:42,00:02:43,reason.
00:02:43,00:02:46,"And then he was like, it's true, we were in bread."
00:02:46,00:02:50,"And so it was kind of supporting all of the really, really old taboos."
00:02:50,00:02:53,"And taboo means menstruation, that's where the word comes from."
00:02:53,00:02:54,No.
00:02:54,00:02:55,Yes.
00:02:55,00:02:57,"I mean, sacred, or it's a word for menstruating."
00:02:57,00:02:58,"Oh, god."
00:02:58,00:02:59,"Yeah, amazing, right?"
00:02:59,00:03:02,"Because it is one of those things where throughout history, the idea of menstruating"
00:03:02,00:03:06,women around certain things did affect plenty of the elder right about it.
00:03:06,00:03:11,"Oh, he wrote so many crazy things, like dogs would go mad, or the caterpillars would fall"
00:03:11,00:03:19,"out of the leaves of trees, and my favourite is that even ants wouldn't pick up the grains"
00:03:19,00:03:23,"if they, if menstruating women had touched the crumbs, like ants would have, no thank you"
00:03:23,00:03:24,disgusting.
00:03:24,00:03:26,Those would pass in that by.
00:03:26,00:03:27,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:27,00:03:28,And they'd call thunderstorms.
00:03:28,00:03:29,Yeah.
00:03:29,00:03:31,My favourite one is that they would dim mirrors.
00:03:31,00:03:32,Oh.
00:03:32,00:03:33,Yeah.
00:03:33,00:03:34,Wow.
00:03:34,00:03:35,Mirrors so dark.
00:03:35,00:03:37,"There's one positive belief, though, sound at least traditionally."
00:03:37,00:03:38,Yeah.
00:03:38,00:03:45,So this is a German occult writer called Henry Cornelius Agrippa.
00:03:45,00:03:49,And he said that menstruating women could protect crops from blight.
00:03:49,00:03:53,He said of menstrual women shall walk naked about the standing corn.
00:03:53,00:03:58,"They make all cankers, worms, beetles, flies, and all hurtful things fall off from the corn."
00:03:58,00:04:01,"But if they don't do it before sunrise, then the corn whibbers."
00:04:01,00:04:04,That sounds like the weirdest chat up right in the world.
00:04:04,00:04:11,Would you mind coming around and taking all your clothes off? You've got to be gone by morning.
00:04:11,00:04:13,But the other one's really interesting is the synchronicity thing.
00:04:13,00:04:17,So lots of people have this real common belief that women's synchronised periods has never
00:04:17,00:04:18,been scientifically proven.
00:04:18,00:04:19,Yeah.
00:04:19,00:04:20,Like one woman did a study.
00:04:20,00:04:21,"Actually, I've got her name and down."
00:04:21,00:04:35,She did a huge study on seven women.
00:04:35,00:04:39,And this is kind of mutated into people believing that pheromones mean that when women are living
00:04:39,00:04:41,"in the same house in close quarters, they suddenly sync up."
00:04:41,00:04:42,It's never been replicated.
00:04:42,00:04:45,They can't find any scientific reason why we would.
00:04:45,00:04:46,It's confirmation bias.
00:04:46,00:04:50,"So with a friend, do you notice a person who's like, ""Oh, suddenly, we're on at the same"
00:04:50,00:04:53,"time,"" or ""we have an overlap,"" which is nothing to do with when you ovulate, which would"
00:04:53,00:04:57,be the significant part of the reason to sync up with somebody.
00:04:57,00:05:00,And you ignore all the people you're around all the time and you never sync up with them
00:05:00,00:05:01,at all.
00:05:01,00:05:04,"Also, maybe they're lying because I recognise the claim of my housemates that I had my period"
00:05:04,00:05:08,"at the same time, so it was not to be left out, but maybe everyone else is doing that."
00:05:08,00:05:12,"Yeah, we're all synced up, but you don't want to be the loser who's not quite in tune"
00:05:12,00:05:13,with your mate.
00:05:13,00:05:14,I'm hiding your period.
00:05:14,00:05:23,"I've never, I've never been moved in case I'm like, ""Ah, I'm going to be coming on again!"""
00:05:23,00:05:24,I thought we were together on this one.
00:05:24,00:05:27,"McClendon, she defended her work because there have been lots of follow-up studies which,"
00:05:27,00:05:28,"as you said, have never found it."
00:05:28,00:05:33,And they've done studies for a full year and said there could be in the original study bits
00:05:33,00:05:35,"which synced up a little bit, but that was just through coincidence, really."
00:05:35,00:05:38,I think it's much more to do with the moon than it is to do with other women.
00:05:38,00:05:45,So the one thing that's quite interesting is that 30% of women have their periods during
00:05:45,00:05:51,"the full moon, and the next nearest group of women being the same is 12.5%, so that's"
00:05:51,00:05:56,"quite a huge, verifiable difference, and when women live in cities of electricity, they"
00:05:56,00:06:01,"have their period changes, how long their menstrual cycle has changed from now to now."
00:06:01,00:06:03,"I know, I know, it's like magic."
00:06:03,00:06:06,"It's to do with the melatonin in the brain, so women, let's start to get affected even"
00:06:06,00:06:10,"by when you start sleepingness or being an electric, biting all the time."
00:06:10,00:06:11,Your cycle changes.
00:06:11,00:06:14,"Because people do sleep less when there's a full moon, don't they?"
00:06:14,00:06:16,"And they think that's because of the lightness, yeah."
00:06:16,00:06:21,"So do people right up near the North Pole and Iceland and stuff have mental periods, do"
00:06:21,00:06:22,you think?
00:06:22,00:06:24,When they have 24 hour day and then 24 hour night?
00:06:24,00:06:25,Yeah.
00:06:25,00:06:26,I would love to know.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Yeah.
00:06:27,00:06:28,"Well, if anyone's listening now."
00:06:28,00:06:29,Contact us.
00:06:29,00:06:30,"Contact us, yeah."
00:06:30,00:06:32,With all of the details of your menstrual cycle.
00:06:32,00:06:33,At Shriberland.
00:06:33,00:06:40,So they do have positive connotations in some places.
00:06:40,00:06:45,There are various societies where women on their periods are thought to have magical powers.
00:06:45,00:06:49,"So I think in some Native American tribes, they would retreat to a moon hut for the duration"
00:06:49,00:06:50,of their periods.
00:06:50,00:06:54,And that meant that they didn't have to do any work and that they could just have spiritual
00:06:54,00:06:55,awakenings and stuff like that.
00:06:55,00:06:56,Yeah.
00:06:56,00:06:59,"But then again, I think you can read that from the other way, because you can go choose"
00:06:59,00:07:04,"to go to a hut where I think I sent away to a hut, don't worry, put your feet up, we'll"
00:07:04,00:07:05,handle this.
00:07:05,00:07:11,"Yeah, it's completely, see for me, I think, what a absolute freak I'd love to do nothing"
00:07:11,00:07:14,"for five days in a hut, but for most women, I guess that seems like you're being."
00:07:14,00:07:15,You like camping as well.
00:07:15,00:07:16,So this is...
00:07:16,00:07:17,Love a bit of camping.
00:07:17,00:07:20,"Yeah, especially because in these huts, people bring in your food and stuff."
00:07:20,00:07:21,Yeah.
00:07:21,00:07:22,There's nothing I love more than camping where someone else is doing the food.
00:07:22,00:07:24,"It's just like glamping, basically."
00:07:24,00:07:25,Exactly.
00:07:25,00:07:26,Yeah.
00:07:26,00:07:37,"And so, in terms of other experiments, there was a married couple called George and Olive"
00:07:37,00:07:43,"Smith, and they injected rats and mice with women's menstrual blood, and they all died."
00:07:43,00:07:49,"And they were like, ""See, toxic, poisonous, you inject, vaginal blood into a mask, terribly"
00:07:49,00:07:50,"dies."""
00:07:50,00:07:51,And then...
00:07:51,00:07:52,What did they expect it to do?
00:07:52,00:07:53,"Well, they just wanted to see."
00:07:53,00:07:58,"And then what they did is they then some other people did some follow-up studies, where they"
00:07:58,00:08:01,also gave them mice antibiotics because they thought they might be the bacteria from
00:08:01,00:08:02,used blood.
00:08:02,00:08:06,"So they were put injecting into the animals that was killing them, and then all of those"
00:08:06,00:08:07,animals survived.
00:08:07,00:08:09,"But they did describe like, ""Oh, but the mice were really affected."
00:08:09,00:08:11,"They kept cowering in the corner of the cages."""
00:08:11,00:08:12,"Like, ""I wonder why."""
00:08:12,00:08:17,"So, there's a really fun thing that people can watch on the internet if they want to."
00:08:17,00:08:22,It's a 1946 Walt Disney film called The Story of Mentioneration.
00:08:22,00:08:24,And it's better than Fantasia.
00:08:24,00:08:27,"Yeah, it's the first film they think that mentions the word vagina."
00:08:27,00:08:32,The science of it is fantastic in terms of the glands and the hormones behind it.
00:08:32,00:08:35,It's not a lot of stuff that's educational for children or young women.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"It's about the physical stuff, the stuff that you can see, and it's much more about the"
00:08:38,00:08:41,relationship of hormones in your body and what it's caused by and what's happening.
00:08:41,00:08:42,It's quite weird.
00:08:42,00:08:43,It's 10 minutes long.
00:08:43,00:08:44,Wow.
00:08:44,00:08:45,"It's banned, I think."
00:08:45,00:08:46,Because Mickey in it.
00:08:46,00:08:47,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:47,00:08:48,It's Mickey Spazperia.
00:08:48,00:08:49,It's confusing.
00:08:49,00:08:53,"And you get to inject it halfway through, I think, by Minnie's vaginal blood."
00:08:53,00:08:54,"Yeah, and he dies."
00:08:54,00:08:55,That's very sad.
00:08:55,00:09:04,"OK, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy."
00:09:04,00:09:10,My fact is that one proposed solution to plane hijackings in the 1970s was to build a pretend
00:09:10,00:09:13,Havana airport in South Florida.
00:09:13,00:09:20,"So the thing is that in the late '60s and early '70s, hijacking was a huge, huge problem and"
00:09:20,00:09:24,"it was very much in the sort of, you know, before 9/11 days when the main thing that happened"
00:09:24,00:09:28,"was someone would say, take this plane to a different place, and the big thing was take"
00:09:28,00:09:29,me to Cuba.
00:09:29,00:09:30,Yeah.
00:09:30,00:09:34,"Because obviously, Cuba, very nearby, come in a state and lots of people just would hijack"
00:09:34,00:09:37,"planes and fly, didn't fly into Cuba."
00:09:37,00:09:43,"And between 1968 and 1972, they sometimes happen once a week in the USA alone."
00:09:43,00:09:47,"In 1969, 82 planes were hijacked, which was a huge, huge thing."
00:09:47,00:09:51,And they didn't have any security at airports and people kept hijacking.
00:09:51,00:09:55,So people started contacting the American FAA with suggestions.
00:09:55,00:09:58,And one of them was setting up this fake Havana airport in South Florida.
00:09:58,00:10:03,"So everyone just, you know, so the pilot says, OK, you're going to fly you to Cuba."
00:10:03,00:10:05,They fly around the sea for a bit and then fly back.
00:10:05,00:10:06,I think that's how they do it.
00:10:06,00:10:07,Just subtly change direction.
00:10:07,00:10:08,They land.
00:10:08,00:10:10,And the CIA busts the hijacker.
00:10:10,00:10:15,"Yeah, they had a special anti hijacked task force, didn't they, which people could send"
00:10:15,00:10:16,in their ideas.
00:10:16,00:10:17,Yeah.
00:10:17,00:10:18,That's right.
00:10:18,00:10:19,Yeah.
00:10:19,00:10:20,And but people started taking the piss as well.
00:10:20,00:10:22,"One person said, make everyone wear boxing gloves so they can't hold a gun."
00:10:22,00:10:26,"But then they would just point their way again, yeah."
00:10:26,00:10:31,"There was one where someone said, play the Cuban national anthem before take off and arrest"
00:10:31,00:10:33,anyone who knows the lyrics.
00:10:33,00:10:39,"People are just so patriotic, they can't help but stand up and chant a lot."
00:10:39,00:10:42,"So first of all, the hijacking was going the other way, wasn't it?"
00:10:42,00:10:45,People trying to escape Cuba because you weren't at the child who took two places.
00:10:45,00:10:46,Right.
00:10:46,00:10:48,But my favorite one is the story about Alan Funt.
00:10:48,00:10:51,So it's 1969.
00:10:51,00:10:53,He was the presenter of Candid Camera.
00:10:53,00:10:55,"So he was very, very famous across the world."
00:10:55,00:11:01,"And then he was on an aeroplane, which had hijacking to go to Havana."
00:11:01,00:11:04,And he'd been recognized by a couple of people.
00:11:04,00:11:05,"So a man stood up and went, no, no."
00:11:05,00:11:06,This is a trick.
00:11:06,00:11:10,"And Alan Funt, the presenter, knows it is not a trick."
00:11:10,00:11:12,"It's like everyone, everyone calm down."
00:11:12,00:11:13,Let's just listen to the guys.
00:11:13,00:11:15,"And he was like, you're not going to get us."
00:11:15,00:11:16,This is so like you.
00:11:16,00:11:17,"Like, perfect."
00:11:17,00:11:18,So there's different cases.
00:11:18,00:11:19,His daughter's talked about it openly.
00:11:19,00:11:22,She remembers people dancing once they realized it was a trick.
00:11:22,00:11:27,"And her sister says, popping champagne and go, we're going to be on TV."
00:11:27,00:11:30,And it looks like he's trying to save the program.
00:11:30,00:11:31,Let's just take this seriously.
00:11:31,00:11:32,"Yeah, right."
00:11:32,00:11:34,There was the other guy who--
00:11:34,00:11:37,"So at first, people, I think, wanted to hijack the planes and go to Cuba."
00:11:37,00:11:38,And then people started to catch on that.
00:11:38,00:11:42,You could also ask for shed loads of money while you were doing that.
00:11:42,00:11:45,"And there was that guy Arthur Barclay, who was debating his tax bill."
00:11:45,00:11:48,And I think he started debating it in 1962.
00:11:48,00:11:50,And this went on for eight years.
00:11:50,00:11:51,And he kept going to him from Washington.
00:11:51,00:11:52,And there was quite a small tax bill.
00:11:52,00:11:54,It was like $472 he owed.
00:11:54,00:11:55,And he said he didn't owe.
00:11:55,00:11:56,It's the principal.
00:11:56,00:11:57,"Yeah, it is actually--"
00:11:57,00:11:59,I can imagine the money back.
00:11:59,00:12:00,That's still quite a lot of cash.
00:12:00,00:12:03,I can imagine James actually doing this.
00:12:03,00:12:06,"So eventually, he just hijacked this plane."
00:12:06,00:12:07,And he smuggled a gun on.
00:12:07,00:12:09,And he demanded that they do an emergency landing.
00:12:09,00:12:13,"And when they landed, they had to have $100 million waiting for him."
00:12:13,00:12:15,So the CIA would have to be there.
00:12:15,00:12:15,$100 million.
00:12:15,00:12:18,How do tax bills as he expected?
00:12:18,00:12:22,"If you get that kind of money, is that tax free?"
00:12:22,00:12:23,How does it work?
00:12:23,00:12:24,Is there anything gift?
00:12:24,00:12:25,Does it count as a gift?
00:12:25,00:12:28,There are places in the world where people have declared their guns
00:12:28,00:12:31,as expenses when they've done bank robberies and things like this.
00:12:31,00:12:36,"It was a famous case of a businessman, I think, claiming a ransom against tax."
00:12:36,00:12:37,I'm pretty sure.
00:12:37,00:12:40,I've never seen that on my tax return.
00:12:40,00:12:42,Can I gift aid the ransom?
00:12:42,00:12:48,"It's worth a bit more, actually, and then you get something more back."
00:12:48,00:12:50,"This guy, I just really love the idea of--"
00:12:50,00:12:54,he said I need $100 million cash waiting for me when we do this emergency landing.
00:12:54,00:12:55,So they landed the plane.
00:12:55,00:12:58,"And the plane had radioed down to the ground to the airport staff at the airport,"
00:12:58,00:13:00,"saying, you need to get as much cash as you can."
00:13:00,00:13:02,Just go into all the banks in the area.
00:13:02,00:13:05,"And so I, first of all, did all these airport staff running into all the banks"
00:13:05,00:13:08,"and saying, how much cash have you got to give it all to us now, please?"
00:13:08,00:13:13,"And they managed to get $100,000, so $100,000, which they brought to the airport waiting for him."
00:13:13,00:13:15,And they brought it onto the plane when it landed.
00:13:15,00:13:19,"And he opened up the sacks and was like, this isn't a 100 million display."
00:13:19,00:13:19,Do you think I'm an idiot?
00:13:19,00:13:21,And he took the plane off again.
00:13:21,00:13:24,"And so he was like, that's not nearly enough."
00:13:24,00:13:25,I asked for 100 million.
00:13:25,00:13:30,So then they got the government to really properly get enough bags of these realistic.
00:13:30,00:13:33,So they sent a bunch of CIA agents to stand down the runway
00:13:33,00:13:36,and they stuffed sacks with newspaper.
00:13:36,00:13:39,"What I would have done, I would have filled the bags with CIA agents."
00:13:39,00:13:41,"And as soon as he opened one, they burst out."
00:13:41,00:13:43,I'd have covered CIA agents with money.
00:13:43,00:13:47,"And then he tried to spend them, he got it."
00:13:47,00:13:49,And my truckers weren't all bad.
00:13:49,00:13:52,"I think sometimes they would just like disturb teenagers, weren't they?"
00:13:52,00:13:56,And there was that guy who hijacked a plane and wanted it to be taken to Cuba.
00:13:56,00:13:59,"And then he got distracted by another man on the plane, stood up and said,"
00:13:59,00:14:01,"hey, do you want to see my coin collection, mate?"
00:14:01,00:14:03,And he sort of dropped the gun.
00:14:03,00:14:05,"I was like, oh, yeah, I collect coins, actually."
00:14:05,00:14:08,And so that seems like someone who's not terrifying.
00:14:08,00:14:11,The first hijacker in Norwegian history.
00:14:11,00:14:15,He hijacked a plane in 1985 because he was fed up with society.
00:14:15,00:14:18,But then he surrendered his pistol to authorities one hour later
00:14:18,00:14:22,in exchange for more beer.
00:14:22,00:14:24,So he'd already had some beer.
00:14:24,00:14:28,After they started adding signs at airports about security.
00:14:28,00:14:32,"So in the early 1970s, when they'd started sort of screening passengers"
00:14:32,00:14:34,"to see who looked like they might be carrying weapons,"
00:14:34,00:14:37,all janitors at airports in America reported that they'd find just guns
00:14:37,00:14:40,"and knives and stuff, strewn in the flower beds outside the airport."
00:14:40,00:14:43,"Because when it first came in, people would come to airports,"
00:14:43,00:14:45,"playing to hijacker plane, and then see a sign that said,"
00:14:45,00:14:47,"by the way, we've got screening going on to see if you're going to hide that plane."
00:14:47,00:14:49,"Maybe it's like, sod this."
00:14:49,00:14:52,"All right, so it's not like, you know, if you go into a pub,"
00:14:52,00:14:54,"but you've got a kind of flag or something in your hand,"
00:14:54,00:14:55,"you're like, oh, I'm just going to have to leave this out here,"
00:14:55,00:14:57,because I can't take it in.
00:14:57,00:15:00,"It's not like they were just carrying guns around and thought, oh, no, it's not."
00:15:00,00:15:03,"I think it was in theory, it was people who were intending to hijack planes."
00:15:03,00:15:07,Do you often get to the pub with a can of lager or ready in your hands?
00:15:07,00:15:08,Just tough enough on the way.
00:15:08,00:15:10,"Oh, sure, yeah."
00:15:10,00:15:11,"That's called preloading, isn't it?"
00:15:11,00:15:12,"Yeah, I've heard of that."
00:15:12,00:15:14,"Do you know that near London, in Graves End,"
00:15:14,00:15:17,"there is a whole town where they do practice,"
00:15:17,00:15:20,a fake town where they do practice police things.
00:15:20,00:15:23,So like for hijackings or bombings or fires or riots.
00:15:23,00:15:24,Wow.
00:15:24,00:15:26,And there's pictures of that online as a whole flicker account.
00:15:26,00:15:31,"It's really odd, but all the public transport and nightclubs and there's a pizza land and everything."
00:15:31,00:15:34,That must be the most terrifying place to accidentally wander into.
00:15:34,00:15:35,Yeah.
00:15:35,00:15:36,Yeah.
00:15:36,00:15:37,That's the crime hub.
00:15:37,00:15:38,Yeah.
00:15:38,00:15:40,I think I saw photos of that at the other day.
00:15:40,00:15:43,There was photos of a train crash.
00:15:43,00:15:44,What would happen if a tube truck crashed?
00:15:44,00:15:45,Yes.
00:15:45,00:15:48,And they had people dressed up in makeup and they had emergency services coming.
00:15:48,00:15:49,Yeah.
00:15:49,00:15:53,"The spooky thing, in the '50s in Nevada, they did a whole city to test atomic bombs on."
00:15:53,00:15:55,"And they put people, they dress people up in mannequins."
00:15:55,00:15:57,They got all these JC Penny mannequins.
00:15:57,00:15:59,It looks like families having a nice time.
00:15:59,00:16:02,And then it's photographs in real time of what happened to their houses.
00:16:02,00:16:05,So I think it was like something like 43 kilotons was the most they let off.
00:16:05,00:16:07,When you think Hiroshima was 12 kilotons.
00:16:07,00:16:08,Whoa.
00:16:08,00:16:10,And people watch from six miles away.
00:16:10,00:16:14,And all these photographs are seeing just literally fire going through a house.
00:16:14,00:16:15,Wow.
00:16:15,00:16:16,You can still visit it.
00:16:16,00:16:17,Yeah.
00:16:17,00:16:18,"Richard Feynman, I think, watched those."
00:16:18,00:16:21,"And you know, the only person of all the people watching it,"
00:16:21,00:16:24,not to wear the special glasses that were given to everyone.
00:16:24,00:16:25,Why did we...
00:16:25,00:16:26,Why did we...
00:16:26,00:16:27,Because I'm a tough guy.
00:16:27,00:16:29,Because I'm a tough guy.
00:16:29,00:16:33,It's because he was in a car and he knew that the radiation wouldn't get through the glass.
00:16:33,00:16:34,Yeah.
00:16:34,00:16:35,Right?
00:16:35,00:16:36,Yeah.
00:16:36,00:16:37,Wow.
00:16:37,00:16:38,So he had advanced.
00:16:38,00:16:39,Yeah.
00:16:39,00:16:40,You've really got to trust your science.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Yeah.
00:16:41,00:16:42,To take a call like that.
00:16:42,00:16:44,I know exactly how this is going to work.
00:16:44,00:16:45,Okay.
00:16:45,00:16:50,"It's time for fact number three, and that is Chazinsky."
00:16:50,00:16:54,My fact is that this year an organisation will finish a 40-year-long study of Britain
00:16:54,00:16:57,"and post-boxes, at which point it will immediately start again."
00:16:57,00:16:58,What are they studying?
00:16:58,00:17:01,They're studying everything about all the post-boxes in Britain.
00:17:01,00:17:05,"And they've been going since 1976 when they started, they're called the letterbox study group."
00:17:05,00:17:10,"And they decided they had to document every single post-box, like what the Royal insignia was on it."
00:17:10,00:17:13,What kind of post-boxic was is it in a wall built into a wall?
00:17:13,00:17:14,Is it on a lamp pose?
00:17:14,00:17:17,Is there a lot of important things to be told about?
00:17:17,00:17:19,"Well, in part, it is a very strong word."
00:17:19,00:17:22,"I was really sneering of this idea, like, oh my god."
00:17:22,00:17:25,And then I found out a bit more and now I'm going to join.
00:17:25,00:17:27,Because I think it's so amazing what they're doing.
00:17:27,00:17:28,Me too.
00:17:28,00:17:29,How do you want to join them?
00:17:29,00:17:31,I think it's only boys in it so far.
00:17:31,00:17:32,"Actually, you're right."
00:17:32,00:17:34,I didn't really see a single interview with the woman.
00:17:34,00:17:35,No.
00:17:35,00:17:37,"They were all like, I watched some videos of them online."
00:17:37,00:17:39,"This guy Paul, who I'm now in love with."
00:17:39,00:17:42,"And he was like, oh, my wife is so understanding."
00:17:42,00:17:44,"He's like, well, she should be getting it out."
00:17:44,00:17:45,But it's really interesting.
00:17:45,00:17:49,I didn't know that the monarch who was reigning when the post-box made has their initials on it
00:17:49,00:17:52,"in Scotland, where, so in Scotland, they had to take off."
00:17:52,00:17:56,They were protesting Scotland when the first introduced the E1-1R.
00:17:56,00:17:57,Yeah.
00:17:57,00:18:00,"Because, obviously, she's the first Queen Elizabeth, not the second of Scotland."
00:18:00,00:18:01,Yeah.
00:18:01,00:18:02,And so they don't have it on them anymore.
00:18:02,00:18:04,"They just have a little, they have a little symbol."
00:18:04,00:18:05,Just like post-box.
00:18:05,00:18:06,Crown or something.
00:18:06,00:18:08,"Something wrong, but not saying she's second."
00:18:08,00:18:09,Yeah.
00:18:09,00:18:11,"I really like, and maybe this was a massive story,"
00:18:11,00:18:14,"but I missed it, that there were now a hundred golden post-boxes."
00:18:14,00:18:15,Yes.
00:18:15,00:18:16,That's so cool.
00:18:16,00:18:17,Did you not see one?
00:18:17,00:18:19,"I remember when the Olympics was on, they did the spray-painted one."
00:18:19,00:18:21,"When are they going to paint them back, I wonder?"
00:18:21,00:18:22,"I don't think they will, yeah."
00:18:22,00:18:23,No.
00:18:23,00:18:24,I think they ought to eventually.
00:18:24,00:18:25,Do you?
00:18:25,00:18:26,I feel very strongly about that.
00:18:26,00:18:27,You should treat them.
00:18:27,00:18:31,Because it's introducing a rogue element of individuality into the post-box design.
00:18:31,00:18:33,"I feel very strongly, but they should all be red."
00:18:33,00:18:35,"Well, there was a period when they were all getting painted red,"
00:18:35,00:18:37,because they were green and Victorian times.
00:18:37,00:18:39,And was that because people had won things or...?
00:18:39,00:18:41,"I think it was just to make them stand out more,"
00:18:41,00:18:43,because it's a green in rural environments.
00:18:43,00:18:44,You might think it was green.
00:18:44,00:18:45,"Yeah, exactly."
00:18:45,00:18:47,"For years, no one could post anything."
00:18:47,00:18:50,"Well, people were posting letters, but just into trees and bushes and things."
00:18:50,00:18:51,And it made the collection...
00:18:51,00:18:53,It's just helpful for the tree because it's made from paper.
00:18:53,00:18:55,It's like a corpse of a relative.
00:18:55,00:18:56,It's so mean.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"There was, in 2012, in Birmingham, New Street Station,"
00:18:59,00:19:03,"they found a post-box that had been covered up for like 50 years or something,"
00:19:03,00:19:05,and they kind of opened it.
00:19:05,00:19:08,And there was a load of letters in there that had just been sat there for years and years.
00:19:08,00:19:09,"Oh, wow."
00:19:09,00:19:10,Yeah.
00:19:10,00:19:11,And did they read them all?
00:19:11,00:19:12,They did.
00:19:12,00:19:16,They gave them to the Royal Mail and the Royal Mail took them to the people who they should have gone to.
00:19:16,00:19:17,"Oh, that's nice. Oh, my God."
00:19:17,00:19:19,Do we still have a dead letter office in this country?
00:19:19,00:19:20,What's that mean?
00:19:20,00:19:21,"Oh, I don't know."
00:19:21,00:19:23,It's where posts that they don't know how to deliver it.
00:19:23,00:19:26,"The instructions on the outside, the address is too vague."
00:19:26,00:19:28,And these guys are amazing.
00:19:28,00:19:31,And they crack the codes on the outside and they try to get in with that.
00:19:31,00:19:34,"They really vague, and they will get it to Father Christmas of Princess Diana"
00:19:34,00:19:35,as I hand out as a child.
00:19:35,00:19:36,Really?
00:19:36,00:19:37,Yeah?
00:19:37,00:19:38,What were you writing to them?
00:19:38,00:19:39,"Oh, like the pretty lady in the big house."
00:19:39,00:19:40,"Oh, what was I writing?"
00:19:40,00:19:41,"Yeah, good wishes."
00:19:41,00:19:42,Just a big fan.
00:19:42,00:19:45,It's to write loads of letters to the Royal Family.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Right.
00:19:46,00:19:47,And to Santa?
00:19:47,00:19:48,Not asking for presents.
00:19:48,00:19:49,"No, just wishing them well."
00:19:49,00:19:51,"Also, I thought we needed stuff to do in the downtime."
00:19:51,00:19:54,Everyone writes in December like when they want something.
00:19:54,00:19:55,I'm just going to write in May.
00:19:55,00:19:58,"Oh, you're just trying to get on that nice list, aren't you?"
00:19:58,00:19:59,Yeah.
00:19:59,00:20:00,Yeah.
00:20:00,00:20:04,Charles Dickens had his own post box in his house.
00:20:04,00:20:05,Woo.
00:20:05,00:20:06,"Yeah, we'll do."
00:20:06,00:20:10,You've got a letter box.
00:20:10,00:20:12,So the postman would come and collect the post from his house.
00:20:12,00:20:15,"From his house, yeah, it was built into the wall on the outside of his house."
00:20:15,00:20:18,"So it was in the area where he lived to, which was Gadsel, I think."
00:20:18,00:20:21,"So he lobbied the post office, said, ""Install it in my house, please."""
00:20:21,00:20:24,Because everyone from around the village would come to his house to post their letters.
00:20:24,00:20:27,"And the post he would arrive, open the thing in his house and pick up all the letters."
00:20:27,00:20:28,It was a private one.
00:20:28,00:20:29,It's a communal one for everyone.
00:20:29,00:20:30,It was also back then when he was alive.
00:20:30,00:20:33,They would have been up to 18 collections a day.
00:20:33,00:20:34,Whoa.
00:20:34,00:20:35,Yeah.
00:20:35,00:20:36,He's amazing.
00:20:36,00:20:37,I think it was in his so many letters.
00:20:37,00:20:38,"Yeah, that's insane."
00:20:38,00:20:39,So you could correspond with someone.
00:20:39,00:20:40,A few times in a day.
00:20:40,00:20:41,Yeah.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Yeah.
00:20:42,00:20:43,A few times in a single day.
00:20:43,00:20:44,But really?
00:20:44,00:20:45,Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:46,"I mean, my email does hundreds of thousands of collections a day."
00:20:46,00:20:47,So it's not actually extraordinary.
00:20:47,00:20:48,Yeah.
00:20:48,00:20:49,I found out about one now.
00:20:49,00:20:56,"So in Japan, there's underwater post box for scuba divers who then send letters to other scuba divers."
00:20:56,00:20:58,And they're waterproof letters that you put underneath.
00:20:58,00:20:59,And that's collected twice a day.
00:20:59,00:21:00,"Yeah, that's really cool."
00:21:00,00:21:03,Do you have to have your own underwater letter box?
00:21:03,00:21:05,I don't know how you tell it to your address.
00:21:05,00:21:06,I guess you just had to say that that's starfish.
00:21:06,00:21:08,That's starfish near the rock.
00:21:08,00:21:10,And then it would get to where you're going to collect it from.
00:21:10,00:21:11,That's amazing.
00:21:11,00:21:12,Yeah.
00:21:12,00:21:13,It's very remote.
00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah.
00:21:14,00:21:16,So the Everest Base Camp has a post box.
00:21:16,00:21:17,That's it.
00:21:17,00:21:18,Where else?
00:21:18,00:21:19,There's the Antarctic one.
00:21:19,00:21:20,Not sure if we've spoken about that before.
00:21:20,00:21:21,Really remote.
00:21:21,00:21:22,The polar bears.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Yeah.
00:21:23,00:21:24,"Well, yeah."
00:21:24,00:21:25,Exactly.
00:21:25,00:21:26,They did a application for it and they published it in the newspapers.
00:21:26,00:21:27,So we could see the application.
00:21:27,00:21:31,And they explained that the job would involve carrying big heavy box over slippery rocks and slushy snow.
00:21:31,00:21:34,And you'd have to survive on no heating or running water.
00:21:34,00:21:37,"That just says, are you happy not to shower for up to a month?"
00:21:37,00:21:41,Live in close proximity to three people and two thousand smelly penguins for five months?
00:21:41,00:21:42,Yes.
00:21:42,00:21:44,That sounds better than the Edinburgh Festival.
00:21:44,00:21:49,I was thinking it was on weird societies.
00:21:49,00:21:50,"Yeah, cool."
00:21:50,00:21:53,Or apparently boring societies.
00:21:53,00:21:57,"Do you guys know how popular, according to its website, the Biscuit Appreciation Society is?"
00:21:57,00:21:58,How popular?
00:21:58,00:21:59,It's very popular.
00:21:59,00:22:00,According to its website.
00:22:00,00:22:02,It's a very reliable website.
00:22:02,00:22:04,I believe everything they say.
00:22:04,00:22:11,So there's a message on their website saying that I'm really sorry we can't take any extra members as we have a backlog of memberships.
00:22:11,00:22:15,And there's a 17 year waiting list to get into the Biscuit Appreciation Society.
00:22:15,00:22:16,What?
00:22:16,00:22:20,It claims our membership currently stands at about three million appreciators.
00:22:20,00:22:22,I've never expected more than a couple.
00:22:22,00:22:24,Does it mean every time someone has a biscuit?
00:22:24,00:22:25,I know.
00:22:25,00:22:26,I don't know the list.
00:22:26,00:22:28,They obviously appreciate biscuits.
00:22:28,00:22:34,There's a movement of UFO alien believing people on Earth.
00:22:34,00:22:36,"And the aliens do that, don't they?"
00:22:36,00:22:42,"Well, what the aliens do is you can become a priest, but by kind of just going there and they make you a priest."
00:22:42,00:22:45,But they'll also make you a priest without you even knowing it.
00:22:45,00:22:49,So they kind of make celebrities priests just without even telling them.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"And they say, look at all these famous people who are priests."
00:22:51,00:22:54,"And the famous people are like, well, I didn't even know that."
00:22:54,00:22:58,I didn't even spy it to set up a fan club for myself.
00:22:58,00:23:02,"I just was like, Robbie Williams, big fan of mine."
00:23:02,00:23:06,This was 6.7 billion members.
00:23:06,00:23:08,No waiting list.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Everyone's gone.
00:23:09,00:23:11,It's automatically answered.
00:23:11,00:23:14,Are we still disheartening that for the letters you get from Robbie Williams?
00:23:14,00:23:16,"Please remove me from your hand, lovely."
00:23:16,00:23:18,"It doesn't work like that, my friends."
00:23:18,00:23:20,They are a double member.
00:23:20,00:23:24,"The minute you try to leave, he'll love me more."
00:23:24,00:23:28,"In the old and days London, they used to be really odd kind of gentlemen's clubs,"
00:23:28,00:23:30,where they had very specific things they had to do.
00:23:30,00:23:33,So there was a murderous club where you were only allowed in if you'd ever killed a man.
00:23:33,00:23:36,"And there was the everlasting silence club where always someone had to be there,"
00:23:36,00:23:38,but you were not allowed to ever speak.
00:23:38,00:23:40,And it was for men who had to escape their noisy wives.
00:23:40,00:23:42,And there was a fartist club.
00:23:42,00:23:44,All these kind of really odd things.
00:23:44,00:23:46,Was the murderous club just a front set up by the police?
00:23:46,00:23:50,"All the club staff were hanging around saying, ""So who'd you kill?"""
00:23:50,00:23:55,I imagine that the murderous club would be people who used to be members of the silence club
00:23:55,00:23:58,after the fartist club walked in there.
00:23:58,00:24:02,"In Japan, there are drain spotters,"
00:24:02,00:24:06,"which I also want to be a member of the drain spotters club,"
00:24:06,00:24:10,which are people who spot drain covers because manhole covers in Japan are often really really beautiful.
00:24:10,00:24:12,And they've got these amazing designs.
00:24:12,00:24:15,Do you think they came up with a name first because it's like a pun on train spotters?
00:24:15,00:24:16,Yeah.
00:24:16,00:24:18,"Do you happen to read the urban Welsh book ""Train Spotting""?"
00:24:18,00:24:21,It's incredibly boring.
00:24:21,00:24:23,Can I tell you about one more?
00:24:23,00:24:24,"Yeah, we should move on."
00:24:24,00:24:26,"This is from the Del Men's club,"
00:24:26,00:24:28,who are a fantastic organisation.
00:24:28,00:24:29,And I'm quoting exactly here.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"""Bottle banker, Steve, I don't know if that's rhyming slang."""
00:24:32,00:24:33,It's not.
00:24:33,00:24:36,"""Bottle banker, Steve Wheeler, 66 from Molvin,"
00:24:36,00:24:40,"has spent 30 years collecting more than 20,000 milk bottles."
00:24:40,00:24:42,He found his first bottle in the mid-1980s.
00:24:42,00:24:50,"And now, Steve, who admits he doesn't even like milk, houses them in an 80-foot museum in his garden."""
00:24:50,00:24:52,"So, when he collects them, do they have milk in them?"
00:24:52,00:24:53,Don't know.
00:24:53,00:24:54,Right.
00:24:54,00:24:57,"I mean, if they do, I'm sure he gets rid of it pretty quickly."
00:24:57,00:24:58,That's why he hates milk so much.
00:24:58,00:25:00,"I think this is the mindset, man."
00:25:00,00:25:02,Milk is all disgusting.
00:25:02,00:25:04,Have you seen what happens to it?
00:25:04,00:25:06,How do people drink it every day is horrible?
00:25:06,00:25:10,"Okay, let's move on to our final fact."
00:25:10,00:25:11,And that is James.
00:25:11,00:25:16,"Okay, my fact this week is that in the middle ages, people slept with cow dung"
00:25:16,00:25:19,at the foot of the bed to keep bugs away.
00:25:19,00:25:20,Did it work?
00:25:20,00:25:22,"I think it did, to a certain extent."
00:25:22,00:25:23,Really?
00:25:23,00:25:24,Yeah.
00:25:24,00:25:25,"Because bugs will be attracted to the dung, right?"
00:25:25,00:25:27,Would it try them maybe just to the end of the bed?
00:25:27,00:25:29,"Also, it wasn't fresh dung."
00:25:29,00:25:30,No.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"So it was dried dung, and sometimes it set fire to it."
00:25:32,00:25:33,It was actually the smoke from the dung.
00:25:33,00:25:34,"Oh, so it's like incense?"
00:25:34,00:25:36,And so people still do that now.
00:25:36,00:25:37,Apparently.
00:25:37,00:25:38,"Yeah, wow."
00:25:38,00:25:41,"Yeah, sometimes people burn their houses down in order to keep a book open."
00:25:41,00:25:44,"Actually, there's loads of cases with bed bugs, where people have"
00:25:44,00:25:47,with alcohol and different kind of flammable things on their sofas and beds.
00:25:47,00:25:49,"And then, yeah, setting fire to the neighborhood."
00:25:49,00:25:52,"Yeah, I think there was a woman in Detroit recently, maybe the last couple of months."
00:25:52,00:25:53,Yeah.
00:25:53,00:25:56,"So yeah, I covered her apartment in alcohol and then turned up the heating super high."
00:25:56,00:25:57,I actually heard that was hard to get rid of them.
00:25:57,00:25:59,"Sometimes, once they do that, they go like, oh, I'll put alcohol on everything."
00:25:59,00:26:00,That's great.
00:26:00,00:26:01,That should do it.
00:26:01,00:26:03,And then I'll have a nice fag to relax.
00:26:03,00:26:04,Wow.
00:26:04,00:26:07,"Bed bugs are really hard to get rid of, aren't they?"
00:26:07,00:26:08,Yeah.
00:26:08,00:26:10,I've heard that they're getting thicker skin now to get rid of the insecticide.
00:26:10,00:26:13,And the horrible things people are saying about them.
00:26:13,00:26:14,Yeah.
00:26:14,00:26:21,"Insects evolve so much more quickly, because there's so many generations."
00:26:21,00:26:22,Yeah.
00:26:22,00:26:28,"The concentration of insecticide that you need to kill a bed bug now is about a thousand times more than it was, like, say, a hundred years ago."
00:26:28,00:26:29,Really?
00:26:29,00:26:30,Yeah.
00:26:30,00:26:32,"And apparently, it always takes three times."
00:26:32,00:26:34,You can't just get rid of them in one sweep.
00:26:34,00:26:35,It takes three goes round.
00:26:35,00:26:38,So what is wrong with having bed bugs?
00:26:38,00:26:40,I've never understood this.
00:26:40,00:26:42,So I don't think I've had them.
00:26:42,00:26:43,Yeah.
00:26:43,00:26:44,"But if I did, what would be there?"
00:26:44,00:26:46,"They cover you in painful, horrible, red-lived bites."
00:26:46,00:26:47,Do they?
00:26:47,00:26:48,They do.
00:26:48,00:26:49,It's okay.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"Because bedding apparently used to be worth, like, a third of people's possessions."
00:26:52,00:26:55,"And that's why, when they traveled, they would take their bed sheets and they're covering with them."
00:26:55,00:26:57,So they didn't use them in ins and stuff.
00:26:57,00:27:02,And I hadn't really even thought about the fact that it's so unusual now that we sleep in beds on our own.
00:27:02,00:27:03,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:27:03,00:27:06,"Until about the 19th century, you'd mainly share a bed with someone else, wouldn't you?"
00:27:06,00:27:07,"Yeah, if you stopped in a tavern."
00:27:07,00:27:11,"Well, like, if you had to travel lunch, you'd just have to sleep with, like, let the Henry have something."
00:27:11,00:27:12,"Yeah, that's right."
00:27:12,00:27:13,Wow.
00:27:13,00:27:14,Let the Henry and everyone read it.
00:27:14,00:27:15,I guess hostels.
00:27:15,00:27:17,Hostels are still kind of like that.
00:27:17,00:27:18,"Yeah, but there's bug beds."
00:27:18,00:27:21,"But you're in a room at Strangels, which is quite rare."
00:27:21,00:27:22,Yeah.
00:27:22,00:27:25,It's just like sharing a bed that was the standard that was the only option you'd have.
00:27:25,00:27:29,"In Tudor Medieval times, people who are wealthy enough to have a bed, which wasn't very many people,"
00:27:29,00:27:30,would always take it with them.
00:27:30,00:27:33,"So all beds were Z beds, foldable beds."
00:27:33,00:27:36,"And yeah, so the king would travel with his bed."
00:27:36,00:27:39,Any nobles would travel with their beds folded up on the back of their car.
00:27:39,00:27:44,"Well, I was reading something by Lucy Worsley, and she was saying that beds in that period were actually incredibly rare."
00:27:44,00:27:47,"For the poor, yeah, so it would just be a huge hole where everyone was sleeping."
00:27:47,00:27:51,So did they have cow dung on the floor next to them in their kind of their floor bed?
00:27:51,00:27:53,I think it was hanging up rather than nice.
00:27:53,00:27:54,"Yeah, really?"
00:27:54,00:27:56,Because it sounds like it would be spread at the foot of the bed.
00:27:56,00:27:57,Yeah.
00:27:57,00:27:59,But I think it's done kind of hanging up to keep the fries on.
00:27:59,00:28:02,"Oh my god, like the front of a car for--"
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Yeah, like an air freshener."
00:28:03,00:28:04,Like an air freshener.
00:28:04,00:28:06,The little tree.
00:28:06,00:28:11,So cow dung is great stuff.
00:28:11,00:28:13,Oh my goodness.
00:28:13,00:28:18,"So I did not know that you can, on the Indian Amazon website, you can buy cow dung cakes."
00:28:18,00:28:22,You can get them about roughly 6 for £2.50.
00:28:22,00:28:24,Are you good?
00:28:24,00:28:28,"So what it is, you get a cow pat and you mix it up with it, and then you slap it on a wall,"
00:28:28,00:28:33,"and it dries into a cake, and then you can burn that in a stove to cook food or--"
00:28:33,00:28:34,For religious ceremonies.
00:28:34,00:28:39,"People in cities these days don't use it for food cooking anymore, but yeah."
00:28:39,00:28:43,"So there's also an Indian centre which uses cow dung medicinally,"
00:28:43,00:28:46,and their claims are so extravagant.
00:28:46,00:28:47,"Oh, what is this?"
00:28:47,00:28:48,What is this?
00:28:48,00:28:53,"Okay, so this is in Ahmedabad, and one claim is walking on fresh cow dung is very healthy."
00:28:53,00:28:57,It completely heals all problems with your feet.
00:28:57,00:29:01,"They also have cow water, which is a urine-based soft drink."
00:29:01,00:29:08,"And the director of this facility said, ""This will end the market for carbonated fizzy drinks."""
00:29:08,00:29:10,I love these all problems with your feet.
00:29:10,00:29:11,I lost a foot.
00:29:11,00:29:13,Come over here!
00:29:13,00:29:14,So I'm so all problems.
00:29:14,00:29:15,"Not very long, yeah."
00:29:15,00:29:18,"And the sentence on this website just says,"
00:29:18,00:29:21,"""Mainstream doctors are divided about the medical benefits,"
00:29:21,00:29:26,"with some pointing out that the curative claims have never been validated by independent bodies."""
00:29:26,00:29:31,"Yeah, you can get cow urine aftershave, I think, because it's very good for your skin."
00:29:31,00:29:32,So just apparently.
00:29:32,00:29:35,So does this come from thinking that cows are precious?
00:29:35,00:29:36,"Yeah, it's in their religion."
00:29:36,00:29:38,"Yeah, because cows are sacred."
00:29:38,00:29:41,"And their dung is sacred as well, which is why it's religious rituals."
00:29:41,00:29:44,"That's what, yeah, it says here, their milk makes children more obedient."
00:29:44,00:29:46,That's part of the sacredness.
00:29:46,00:29:49,"And touching them can lower your blood pressure, that's one of the thoughts."
00:29:49,00:29:51,And they block nuclear radiation.
00:29:51,00:29:53,"Okay, well, I'm right with the first two, because they make sense."
00:29:53,00:29:56,"That yes, if children want some more milk, then they'll be more obedient."
00:29:56,00:29:58,"Yeah, I think it makes absolute sense."
00:29:58,00:30:00,"Stroking lots of pets, people have comforts."
00:30:00,00:30:01,And also that will calm you down.
00:30:01,00:30:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:30:02,00:30:03,Those quarters are fine.
00:30:03,00:30:04,And the nuclear...
00:30:04,00:30:07,"Well, not many people know, but Richard Feynman is talking about that."
00:30:07,00:30:08,"Yes, he's talking about that."
00:30:08,00:30:11,He just slapped a cow pat on his eyes.
00:30:11,00:30:12,Yeah.
00:30:12,00:30:16,And I've got another thing about old bedtime habits.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Great.
00:30:17,00:30:18,Better you feel tired.
00:30:18,00:30:19,Yeah.
00:30:19,00:30:21,So have you heard of bundling?
00:30:21,00:30:22,Yeah.
00:30:22,00:30:24,"Bando, you're jumping on someone's phone."
00:30:24,00:30:25,Someone gets a break from it.
00:30:25,00:30:26,"Oh, okay, no, no."
00:30:26,00:30:27,It's right for the very bottom of the bundle.
00:30:27,00:30:29,You don't have to be second in the bundle.
00:30:29,00:30:30,Why is it okay to be on the bottom?
00:30:30,00:30:31,I don't know.
00:30:31,00:30:34,"For some reason it's a snugly, but the second one on it's not comfortable."
00:30:34,00:30:36,You can kind of curl up and defend yourself a bit more if you're at the bottom.
00:30:36,00:30:37,"Yeah, if you're at the bottom."
00:30:37,00:30:38,Yeah.
00:30:38,00:30:40,You're spreading it when you're second in the bundle.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"But then I think you deserve it, because you're the first one jumping in on the bundle."
00:30:43,00:30:44,You're causing all the problems.
00:30:44,00:30:45,You don't know.
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Maybe the person underneath said, ""Bundle."""
00:30:46,00:30:48,You just have to follow the instruction.
00:30:48,00:30:50,Can you get people to bundle you?
00:30:50,00:30:55,"It's a bit silly pathetic if you lay down going, ""Bundles, everyone's going, no James."""
00:30:55,00:30:56,You're in your late 30s.
00:30:56,00:30:57,You haven't done that for a long time.
00:30:57,00:30:58,It's a terrible sleepover.
00:30:58,00:30:59,We're going.
00:30:59,00:31:04,"And then, Maga told G, ""That's when you do a bundle, but you're all got sleeping bags on."""
00:31:04,00:31:09,"So, bundling used to be when you wanted to introduce two unmarried children to each other."
00:31:09,00:31:10,"Of age, I should point out."
00:31:10,00:31:11,"Yes, okay."
00:31:11,00:31:14,"So, it'd be two boy and a girl unmarried."
00:31:14,00:31:18,And the parents would let them sleep in the same room for an evening.
00:31:18,00:31:20,The idea was to get to know each other.
00:31:20,00:31:24,"So, in order to prevent things from happening, from getting sexy,"
00:31:24,00:31:28,they used to either tie them to the bed.
00:31:28,00:31:32,"So, you would have to lay them tied, both of you, to the bed, and just have all evening."
00:31:32,00:31:37,"Or, they would put a ginormous wooden board just in the middle of the bed, separating you two."
00:31:37,00:31:39,"Surely, that's how people get fetishes."
00:31:39,00:31:40,"Maga, you're right."
00:31:40,00:31:41,That's the birth of a bed.
00:31:41,00:31:45,Your early sexual experience is all I mean tied up with.
00:31:45,00:31:47,I can't do it anyway.
00:31:47,00:31:48,How old are these young people?
00:31:48,00:31:50,I guess approaching marriage age.
00:31:50,00:31:53,"So, yeah, so they were kind of marriageable age."
00:31:53,00:31:54,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:31:54,00:31:56,"It was kind of, yeah."
00:31:56,00:31:58,"The roughly late teens, I think."
00:31:58,00:31:59,Yeah.
00:31:59,00:32:02,"So, the next guy I meet, and we're like, ""Hey, do you like being tied up?"""
00:32:02,00:32:04,Because I want to get to know you.
00:32:04,00:32:09,"That's why I always got kicked out of these bundling parties, you guys are going to show my rope."
00:32:09,00:32:11,You plop some wood.
00:32:11,00:32:14,The first draft of 50 Shades of Grey is actually incredibly boring.
00:32:14,00:32:15,A lot of conversation.
00:32:15,00:32:19,"I mean, also the final draft of 50 Shades of Grey is also incredibly boring, but that's not the point."
00:32:19,00:32:20,You haven't read 50 Shades of Grey.
00:32:20,00:32:22,I've read the first third of 50 Shades of Grey.
00:32:22,00:32:23,"Oh, what did you think?"
00:32:23,00:32:24,I have 17 Shades of Grey.
00:32:24,00:32:31,"I stopped after the third or fourth time, she shattered into a million pieces."
00:32:31,00:32:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:32,00:32:33,I thought it was...
00:32:33,00:32:34,Is that what happens?
00:32:34,00:32:37,Did you read Humpty Dumpty?
00:32:37,00:32:41,Anastasia calls all the King's horses and all the King's men.
00:32:41,00:32:42,Yeah.
00:32:42,00:32:44,"That's pretty rude, she's stubborn."
00:32:44,00:32:49,"Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts."
