00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
 Hi guys, we've got a seriously special guest on the podcast today.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:08,560
 It is Sarah Pasco and you're about to hear that she is brilliant and funny and fascinating

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,860
 and has a book out which is also all of those three things.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,840
 It's called Animal, or if you want the full, unedited title, it's called Animal, Cologne,

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,580
 the autobiography of a female body and it's out right now.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,580
 Go and get it.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,080
 Okay, on with the show.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:42,460
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,120
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,840
 I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, Anne Chazinski, James Harkin, and Sarah Pasco.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,520
 the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,760
 Starting with you, Sarah Pasco.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:08,320
 Okay, in the 1920s, scientists concluded that menstruating women wilted flowers.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,380
 So, it's a proper scientist and so he's name, and it's a he, but his name's Bella Schick,

17
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,480
 I think, I've only seen it written down.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,200
 And he's a proper scientist, he cured diptheria, and I think apparently he was the first person

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,800
 to use the word immunization, so he's a proper guy, but then one day he's made, was passing

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
 him some flowers.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,200
 So she was like, I don't want to pass you the flowers, and then he's, do the flowers.

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,640
 And then the next day they were all wilted, these red roses, and she was like, oh, I knew

23
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
 that was going to happen.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
 I'm on my period.

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
 And he was like, what?

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
 And she's like, yeah, women are poisonous when on their periods.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,920
 They can't look at bread, or dogs, children, or such flowers, or go swimming.

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,440
 And he was like, oh my god, I'm a scientist, I didn't even know about this.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,240
 So he then did all these experiments with women holding flowers and baking bread, and he

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,920
 gave it the term menotoxin, which were emitted by women in their tear glands and their sweat

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
 glands.

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:12,800
 So his study showed, reading between the lines, and

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,840
 I'm no conspiracy theorist, but reading between the lines, it sounded like the women held

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,120
 the flowers for quite a long time outside of water.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,640
 And then they wilted, whereas flowers in water, the control group, they were fine.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,600
 There was an experiment with bread as well, and one made, it was on her period.

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,520
 I mean, it must have been such a lovely house to work in.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,280
 So she made everyone make bread, and hers, hers didn't rise as much.

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,440
 She was holding it in her hand, and the other, hers didn't rise as much for that exact

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
 reason.

41
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,000
 And then he was like, it's true, we were in bread.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,320
 And so it was kind of supporting all of the really, really old taboos.

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,280
 And taboo means menstruation, that's where the word comes from.

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
 No.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
 Yes.

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
 I mean, sacred, or it's a word for menstruating.

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
 Oh, god.

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
 Yeah, amazing, right?

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,840
 Because it is one of those things where throughout history, the idea of menstruating

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,600
 women around certain things did affect plenty of the elder right about it.

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,680
 Oh, he wrote so many crazy things, like dogs would go mad, or the caterpillars would fall

52
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,240
 out of the leaves of trees, and my favourite is that even ants wouldn't pick up the grains

53
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,720
 if they, if menstruating women had touched the crumbs, like ants would have, no thank you

54
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
 disgusting.

55
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,200
 Those would pass in that by.

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
 Oh, yeah.

57
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
 And they'd call thunderstorms.

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
 Yeah.

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,160
 My favourite one is that they would dim mirrors.

60
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
 Oh.

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
 Yeah.

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
 Wow.

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
 Mirrors so dark.

64
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
 There's one positive belief, though, sound at least traditionally.

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
 Yeah.

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,880
 So this is a German occult writer called Henry Cornelius Agrippa.

67
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,080
 And he said that menstruating women could protect crops from blight.

68
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,160
 He said of menstrual women shall walk naked about the standing corn.

69
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,200
 They make all cankers, worms, beetles, flies, and all hurtful things fall off from the corn.

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,160
 But if they don't do it before sunrise, then the corn whibbers.

71
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,240
 That sounds like the weirdest chat up right in the world.

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:11,040
 Would you mind coming around and taking all your clothes off? You've got to be gone by morning.

73
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,160
 But the other one's really interesting is the synchronicity thing.

74
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,120
 So lots of people have this real common belief that women's synchronised periods has never

75
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
 been scientifically proven.

76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
 Yeah.

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
 Like one woman did a study.

78
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
 Actually, I've got her name and down.

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:35,280
 She did a huge study on seven women.

80
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,180
 And this is kind of mutated into people believing that pheromones mean that when women are living

81
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,820
 in the same house in close quarters, they suddenly sync up.

82
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,820
 It's never been replicated.

83
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,760
 They can't find any scientific reason why we would.

84
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
 It's confirmation bias.

85
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,360
 So with a friend, do you notice a person who's like, "Oh, suddenly, we're on at the same

86
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,640
 time," or "we have an overlap," which is nothing to do with when you ovulate, which would

87
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,960
 be the significant part of the reason to sync up with somebody.

88
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,660
 And you ignore all the people you're around all the time and you never sync up with them

89
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
 at all.

90
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,620
 Also, maybe they're lying because I recognise the claim of my housemates that I had my period

91
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,720
 at the same time, so it was not to be left out, but maybe everyone else is doing that.

92
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,360
 Yeah, we're all synced up, but you don't want to be the loser who's not quite in tune

93
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
 with your mate.

94
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
 I'm hiding your period.

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:23,320
 I've never, I've never been moved in case I'm like, "Ah, I'm going to be coming on again!"

96
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,520
 I thought we were together on this one.

97
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,600
 McClendon, she defended her work because there have been lots of follow-up studies which,

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,920
 as you said, have never found it.

99
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,160
 And they've done studies for a full year and said there could be in the original study bits

100
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,960
 which synced up a little bit, but that was just through coincidence, really.

101
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,560
 I think it's much more to do with the moon than it is to do with other women.

102
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,840
 So the one thing that's quite interesting is that 30% of women have their periods during

103
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,200
 the full moon, and the next nearest group of women being the same is 12.5%, so that's

104
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,440
 quite a huge, verifiable difference, and when women live in cities of electricity, they

105
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,280
 have their period changes, how long their menstrual cycle has changed from now to now.

106
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
 I know, I know, it's like magic.

107
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,920
 It's to do with the melatonin in the brain, so women, let's start to get affected even

108
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,920
 by when you start sleepingness or being an electric, biting all the time.

109
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
 Your cycle changes.

110
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,360
 Because people do sleep less when there's a full moon, don't they?

111
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,840
 And they think that's because of the lightness, yeah.

112
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,200
 So do people right up near the North Pole and Iceland and stuff have mental periods, do

113
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 you think?

114
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
 When they have 24 hour day and then 24 hour night?

115
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 Yeah.

116
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
 I would love to know.

117
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
 Yeah.

118
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
 Well, if anyone's listening now.

119
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
 Contact us.

120
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
 Contact us, yeah.

121
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
 With all of the details of your menstrual cycle.

122
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
 At Shriberland.

123
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,080
 So they do have positive connotations in some places.

124
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,600
 There are various societies where women on their periods are thought to have magical powers.

125
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,560
 So I think in some Native American tribes, they would retreat to a moon hut for the duration

126
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
 of their periods.

127
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,040
 And that meant that they didn't have to do any work and that they could just have spiritual

128
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,800
 awakenings and stuff like that.

129
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
 Yeah.

130
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,000
 But then again, I think you can read that from the other way, because you can go choose

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,600
 to go to a hut where I think I sent away to a hut, don't worry, put your feet up, we'll

132
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 handle this.

133
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,000
 Yeah, it's completely, see for me, I think, what a absolute freak I'd love to do nothing

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,720
 for five days in a hut, but for most women, I guess that seems like you're being.

135
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
 You like camping as well.

136
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
 So this is...

137
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
 Love a bit of camping.

138
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,160
 Yeah, especially because in these huts, people bring in your food and stuff.

139
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
 Yeah.

140
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,720
 There's nothing I love more than camping where someone else is doing the food.

141
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,320
 It's just like glamping, basically.

142
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
 Exactly.

143
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
 Yeah.

144
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:37,080
 And so, in terms of other experiments, there was a married couple called George and Olive

145
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,280
 Smith, and they injected rats and mice with women's menstrual blood, and they all died.

146
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,600
 And they were like, "See, toxic, poisonous, you inject, vaginal blood into a mask, terribly

147
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
 dies."

148
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
 And then...

149
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
 What did they expect it to do?

150
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
 Well, they just wanted to see.

151
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,200
 And then what they did is they then some other people did some follow-up studies, where they

152
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,880
 also gave them mice antibiotics because they thought they might be the bacteria from

153
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
 used blood.

154
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,080
 So they were put injecting into the animals that was killing them, and then all of those

155
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
 animals survived.

156
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,520
 But they did describe like, "Oh, but the mice were really affected.

157
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
 They kept cowering in the corner of the cages."

158
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
 Like, "I wonder why."

159
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,920
 So, there's a really fun thing that people can watch on the internet if they want to.

160
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,040
 It's a 1946 Walt Disney film called The Story of Mentioneration.

161
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
 And it's better than Fantasia.

162
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,560
 Yeah, it's the first film they think that mentions the word vagina.

163
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,000
 The science of it is fantastic in terms of the glands and the hormones behind it.

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,800
 It's not a lot of stuff that's educational for children or young women.

165
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,440
 It's about the physical stuff, the stuff that you can see, and it's much more about the

166
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,800
 relationship of hormones in your body and what it's caused by and what's happening.

167
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
 It's quite weird.

168
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
 It's 10 minutes long.

169
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
 Wow.

170
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
 It's banned, I think.

171
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
 Because Mickey in it.

172
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
 Yeah, yeah.

173
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
 It's Mickey Spazperia.

174
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
 It's confusing.

175
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,760
 And you get to inject it halfway through, I think, by Minnie's vaginal blood.

176
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
 Yeah, and he dies.

177
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
 That's very sad.

178
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:04,480
 OK, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

179
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,080
 My fact is that one proposed solution to plane hijackings in the 1970s was to build a pretend

180
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,440
 Havana airport in South Florida.

181
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,000
 So the thing is that in the late '60s and early '70s, hijacking was a huge, huge problem and

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,440
 it was very much in the sort of, you know, before 9/11 days when the main thing that happened

183
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,000
 was someone would say, take this plane to a different place, and the big thing was take

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 me to Cuba.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Yeah.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,960
 Because obviously, Cuba, very nearby, come in a state and lots of people just would hijack

187
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,360
 planes and fly, didn't fly into Cuba.

188
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,400
 And between 1968 and 1972, they sometimes happen once a week in the USA alone.

189
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,880
 In 1969, 82 planes were hijacked, which was a huge, huge thing.

190
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,760
 And they didn't have any security at airports and people kept hijacking.

191
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,920
 So people started contacting the American FAA with suggestions.

192
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,920
 And one of them was setting up this fake Havana airport in South Florida.

193
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,160
 So everyone just, you know, so the pilot says, OK, you're going to fly you to Cuba.

194
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,360
 They fly around the sea for a bit and then fly back.

195
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
 I think that's how they do it.

196
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,840
 Just subtly change direction.

197
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
 They land.

198
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
 And the CIA busts the hijacker.

199
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,400
 Yeah, they had a special anti hijacked task force, didn't they, which people could send

200
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
 in their ideas.

201
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
 Yeah.

202
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
 That's right.

203
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
 Yeah.

204
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
 And but people started taking the piss as well.

205
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
 One person said, make everyone wear boxing gloves so they can't hold a gun.

206
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,880
 But then they would just point their way again, yeah.

207
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,480
 There was one where someone said, play the Cuban national anthem before take off and arrest

208
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,480
 anyone who knows the lyrics.

209
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,640
 People are just so patriotic, they can't help but stand up and chant a lot.

210
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,360
 So first of all, the hijacking was going the other way, wasn't it?

211
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,160
 People trying to escape Cuba because you weren't at the child who took two places.

212
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
 Right.

213
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,600
 But my favorite one is the story about Alan Funt.

214
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,280
 So it's 1969.

215
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,240
 He was the presenter of Candid Camera.

216
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,200
 So he was very, very famous across the world.

217
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,520
 And then he was on an aeroplane, which had hijacking to go to Havana.

218
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,000
 And he'd been recognized by a couple of people.

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,880
 So a man stood up and went, no, no.

220
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
 This is a trick.

221
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,600
 And Alan Funt, the presenter, knows it is not a trick.

222
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
 It's like everyone, everyone calm down.

223
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
 Let's just listen to the guys.

224
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,400
 And he was like, you're not going to get us.

225
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
 This is so like you.

226
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
 Like, perfect.

227
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
 So there's different cases.

228
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,720
 His daughter's talked about it openly.

229
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,600
 She remembers people dancing once they realized it was a trick.

230
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,760
 And her sister says, popping champagne and go, we're going to be on TV.

231
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,120
 And it looks like he's trying to save the program.

232
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,240
 Let's just take this seriously.

233
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,360
 Yeah, right.

234
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,600
 There was the other guy who--

235
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,440
 So at first, people, I think, wanted to hijack the planes and go to Cuba.

236
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,680
 And then people started to catch on that.

237
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,040
 You could also ask for shed loads of money while you were doing that.

238
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,960
 And there was that guy Arthur Barclay, who was debating his tax bill.

239
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,840
 And I think he started debating it in 1962.

240
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,120
 And this went on for eight years.

241
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,720
 And he kept going to him from Washington.

242
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,800
 And there was quite a small tax bill.

243
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
 It was like $472 he owed.

244
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,760
 And he said he didn't owe.

245
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,720
 It's the principal.

246
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,480
 Yeah, it is actually--

247
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,000
 I can imagine the money back.

248
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,800
 That's still quite a lot of cash.

249
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,560
 I can imagine James actually doing this.

250
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,160
 So eventually, he just hijacked this plane.

251
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,880
 And he smuggled a gun on.

252
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,720
 And he demanded that they do an emergency landing.

253
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,880
 And when they landed, they had to have $100 million waiting for him.

254
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,280
 So the CIA would have to be there.

255
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,880
 $100 million.

256
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,520
 How do tax bills as he expected?

257
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,200
 If you get that kind of money, is that tax free?

258
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,240
 How does it work?

259
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,080
 Is there anything gift?

260
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
 Does it count as a gift?

261
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,960
 There are places in the world where people have declared their guns

262
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,360
 as expenses when they've done bank robberies and things like this.

263
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,880
 It was a famous case of a businessman, I think, claiming a ransom against tax.

264
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,720
 I'm pretty sure.

265
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,280
 I've never seen that on my tax return.

266
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,600
 Can I gift aid the ransom?

267
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,120
 It's worth a bit more, actually, and then you get something more back.

268
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,480
 This guy, I just really love the idea of--

269
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,480
 he said I need $100 million cash waiting for me when we do this emergency landing.

270
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,280
 So they landed the plane.

271
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,720
 And the plane had radioed down to the ground to the airport staff at the airport,

272
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,560
 saying, you need to get as much cash as you can.

273
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,040
 Just go into all the banks in the area.

274
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,680
 And so I, first of all, did all these airport staff running into all the banks

275
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
 and saying, how much cash have you got to give it all to us now, please?

276
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,840
 And they managed to get $100,000, so $100,000, which they brought to the airport waiting for him.

277
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,440
 And they brought it onto the plane when it landed.

278
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,080
 And he opened up the sacks and was like, this isn't a 100 million display.

279
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,880
 Do you think I'm an idiot?

280
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,480
 And he took the plane off again.

281
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,360
 And so he was like, that's not nearly enough.

282
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,320
 I asked for 100 million.

283
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,280
 So then they got the government to really properly get enough bags of these realistic.

284
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,680
 So they sent a bunch of CIA agents to stand down the runway

285
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,240
 and they stuffed sacks with newspaper.

286
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,360
 What I would have done, I would have filled the bags with CIA agents.

287
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,960
 And as soon as he opened one, they burst out.

288
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,760
 I'd have covered CIA agents with money.

289
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,360
 And then he tried to spend them, he got it.

290
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,520
 And my truckers weren't all bad.

291
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,400
 I think sometimes they would just like disturb teenagers, weren't they?

292
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,400
 And there was that guy who hijacked a plane and wanted it to be taken to Cuba.

293
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,880
 And then he got distracted by another man on the plane, stood up and said,

294
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,720
 hey, do you want to see my coin collection, mate?

295
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,000
 And he sort of dropped the gun.

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,240
 I was like, oh, yeah, I collect coins, actually.

297
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,120
 And so that seems like someone who's not terrifying.

298
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,160
 The first hijacker in Norwegian history.

299
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,600
 He hijacked a plane in 1985 because he was fed up with society.

300
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,680
 But then he surrendered his pistol to authorities one hour later

301
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,000
 in exchange for more beer.

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,720
 So he'd already had some beer.

303
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,240
 After they started adding signs at airports about security.

304
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,600
 So in the early 1970s, when they'd started sort of screening passengers

305
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,520
 to see who looked like they might be carrying weapons,

306
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,680
 all janitors at airports in America reported that they'd find just guns

307
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,240
 and knives and stuff, strewn in the flower beds outside the airport.

308
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,160
 Because when it first came in, people would come to airports,

309
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,200
 playing to hijacker plane, and then see a sign that said,

310
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,880
 by the way, we've got screening going on to see if you're going to hide that plane.

311
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,640
 Maybe it's like, sod this.

312
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,120
 All right, so it's not like, you know, if you go into a pub,

313
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,080
 but you've got a kind of flag or something in your hand,

314
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,880
 you're like, oh, I'm just going to have to leave this out here,

315
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,000
 because I can't take it in.

316
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,120
 It's not like they were just carrying guns around and thought, oh, no, it's not.

317
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,480
 I think it was in theory, it was people who were intending to hijack planes.

318
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,080
 Do you often get to the pub with a can of lager or ready in your hands?

319
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,440
 Just tough enough on the way.

320
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,000
 Oh, sure, yeah.

321
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,600
 That's called preloading, isn't it?

322
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,960
 Yeah, I've heard of that.

323
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,720
 Do you know that near London, in Graves End,

324
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,760
 there is a whole town where they do practice,

325
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,480
 a fake town where they do practice police things.

326
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,880
 So like for hijackings or bombings or fires or riots.

327
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,680
 Wow.

328
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,840
 And there's pictures of that online as a whole flicker account.

329
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,360
 It's really odd, but all the public transport and nightclubs and there's a pizza land and everything.

330
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,520
 That must be the most terrifying place to accidentally wander into.

331
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
 Yeah.

332
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
 Yeah.

333
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
 That's the crime hub.

334
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
 Yeah.

335
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,360
 I think I saw photos of that at the other day.

336
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,120
 There was photos of a train crash.

337
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,920
 What would happen if a tube truck crashed?

338
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
 Yes.

339
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,920
 And they had people dressed up in makeup and they had emergency services coming.

340
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
 Yeah.

341
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,640
 The spooky thing, in the '50s in Nevada, they did a whole city to test atomic bombs on.

342
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,840
 And they put people, they dress people up in mannequins.

343
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,520
 They got all these JC Penny mannequins.

344
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,120
 It looks like families having a nice time.

345
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,280
 And then it's photographs in real time of what happened to their houses.

346
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,720
 So I think it was like something like 43 kilotons was the most they let off.

347
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,520
 When you think Hiroshima was 12 kilotons.

348
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
 Whoa.

349
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,600
 And people watch from six miles away.

350
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,400
 And all these photographs are seeing just literally fire going through a house.

351
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
 Wow.

352
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
 You can still visit it.

353
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
 Yeah.

354
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,920
 Richard Feynman, I think, watched those.

355
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,800
 And you know, the only person of all the people watching it,

356
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,840
 not to wear the special glasses that were given to everyone.

357
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
 Why did we...

358
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
 Why did we...

359
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
 Because I'm a tough guy.

360
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
 Because I'm a tough guy.

361
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,640
 It's because he was in a car and he knew that the radiation wouldn't get through the glass.

362
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
 Yeah.

363
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
 Right?

364
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
 Yeah.

365
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
 Wow.

366
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
 So he had advanced.

367
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
 Yeah.

368
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
 You've really got to trust your science.

369
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
 Yeah.

370
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
 To take a call like that.

371
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
 I know exactly how this is going to work.

372
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
 Okay.

373
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,120
 It's time for fact number three, and that is Chazinsky.

374
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,800
 My fact is that this year an organisation will finish a 40-year-long study of Britain

375
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,800
 and post-boxes, at which point it will immediately start again.

376
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
 What are they studying?

377
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
 They're studying everything about all the post-boxes in Britain.

378
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,800
 And they've been going since 1976 when they started, they're called the letterbox study group.

379
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,800
 And they decided they had to document every single post-box, like what the Royal insignia was on it.

380
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
 What kind of post-boxic was is it in a wall built into a wall?

381
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
 Is it on a lamp pose?

382
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 Is there a lot of important things to be told about?

383
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
 Well, in part, it is a very strong word.

384
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,800
 I was really sneering of this idea, like, oh my god.

385
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
 And then I found out a bit more and now I'm going to join.

386
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 Because I think it's so amazing what they're doing.

387
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
 Me too.

388
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
 How do you want to join them?

389
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
 I think it's only boys in it so far.

390
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
 Actually, you're right.

391
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
 I didn't really see a single interview with the woman.

392
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
 No.

393
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 They were all like, I watched some videos of them online.

394
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
 This guy Paul, who I'm now in love with.

395
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
 And he was like, oh, my wife is so understanding.

396
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
 He's like, well, she should be getting it out.

397
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 But it's really interesting.

398
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,800
 I didn't know that the monarch who was reigning when the post-box made has their initials on it

399
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,800
 in Scotland, where, so in Scotland, they had to take off.

400
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 They were protesting Scotland when the first introduced the E1-1R.

401
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
 Yeah.

402
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,800
 Because, obviously, she's the first Queen Elizabeth, not the second of Scotland.

403
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
 Yeah.

404
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
 And so they don't have it on them anymore.

405
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
 They just have a little, they have a little symbol.

406
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
 Just like post-box.

407
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
 Crown or something.

408
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
 Something wrong, but not saying she's second.

409
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
 Yeah.

410
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
 I really like, and maybe this was a massive story,

411
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
 but I missed it, that there were now a hundred golden post-boxes.

412
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
 Yes.

413
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
 That's so cool.

414
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
 Did you not see one?

415
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
 I remember when the Olympics was on, they did the spray-painted one.

416
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
 When are they going to paint them back, I wonder?

417
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
 I don't think they will, yeah.

418
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
 No.

419
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
 I think they ought to eventually.

420
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
 Do you?

421
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 I feel very strongly about that.

422
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
 You should treat them.

423
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,800
 Because it's introducing a rogue element of individuality into the post-box design.

424
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
 I feel very strongly, but they should all be red.

425
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
 Well, there was a period when they were all getting painted red,

426
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
 because they were green and Victorian times.

427
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
 And was that because people had won things or...?

428
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
 I think it was just to make them stand out more,

429
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
 because it's a green in rural environments.

430
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
 You might think it was green.

431
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
 Yeah, exactly.

432
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
 For years, no one could post anything.

433
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,800
 Well, people were posting letters, but just into trees and bushes and things.

434
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
 And it made the collection...

435
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
 It's just helpful for the tree because it's made from paper.

436
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
 It's like a corpse of a relative.

437
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
 It's so mean.

438
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,800
 There was, in 2012, in Birmingham, New Street Station,

439
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,800
 they found a post-box that had been covered up for like 50 years or something,

440
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 and they kind of opened it.

441
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
 And there was a load of letters in there that had just been sat there for years and years.

442
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
 Oh, wow.

443
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
 Yeah.

444
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
 And did they read them all?

445
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
 They did.

446
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 They gave them to the Royal Mail and the Royal Mail took them to the people who they should have gone to.

447
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
 Oh, that's nice. Oh, my God.

448
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
 Do we still have a dead letter office in this country?

449
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
 What's that mean?

450
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
 Oh, I don't know.

451
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
 It's where posts that they don't know how to deliver it.

452
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,800
 The instructions on the outside, the address is too vague.

453
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
 And these guys are amazing.

454
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 And they crack the codes on the outside and they try to get in with that.

455
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,800
 They really vague, and they will get it to Father Christmas of Princess Diana

456
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
 as I hand out as a child.

457
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
 Really?

458
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
 Yeah?

459
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
 What were you writing to them?

460
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
 Oh, like the pretty lady in the big house.

461
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
 Oh, what was I writing?

462
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
 Yeah, good wishes.

463
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 Just a big fan.

464
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
 It's to write loads of letters to the Royal Family.

465
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
 Right.

466
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
 And to Santa?

467
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
 Not asking for presents.

468
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
 No, just wishing them well.

469
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
 Also, I thought we needed stuff to do in the downtime.

470
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,800
 Everyone writes in December like when they want something.

471
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
 I'm just going to write in May.

472
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,800
 Oh, you're just trying to get on that nice list, aren't you?

473
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 Yeah.

474
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
 Yeah.

475
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,800
 Charles Dickens had his own post box in his house.

476
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
 Woo.

477
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
 Yeah, we'll do.

478
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,800
 You've got a letter box.

479
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
 So the postman would come and collect the post from his house.

480
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,800
 From his house, yeah, it was built into the wall on the outside of his house.

481
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,800
 So it was in the area where he lived to, which was Gadsel, I think.

482
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,800
 So he lobbied the post office, said, "Install it in my house, please."

483
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
 Because everyone from around the village would come to his house to post their letters.

484
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,800
 And the post he would arrive, open the thing in his house and pick up all the letters.

485
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 It was a private one.

486
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
 It's a communal one for everyone.

487
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
 It was also back then when he was alive.

488
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,800
 They would have been up to 18 collections a day.

489
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
 Whoa.

490
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
 Yeah.

491
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
 He's amazing.

492
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
 I think it was in his so many letters.

493
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
 Yeah, that's insane.

494
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
 So you could correspond with someone.

495
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
 A few times in a day.

496
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
 Yeah.

497
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
 Yeah.

498
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
 A few times in a single day.

499
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
 But really?

500
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
 Yeah.

501
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
 I mean, my email does hundreds of thousands of collections a day.

502
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
 So it's not actually extraordinary.

503
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
 Yeah.

504
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 I found out about one now.

505
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:56,800
 So in Japan, there's underwater post box for scuba divers who then send letters to other scuba divers.

506
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
 And they're waterproof letters that you put underneath.

507
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
 And that's collected twice a day.

508
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
 Yeah, that's really cool.

509
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,800
 Do you have to have your own underwater letter box?

510
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
 I don't know how you tell it to your address.

511
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
 I guess you just had to say that that's starfish.

512
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
 That's starfish near the rock.

513
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
 And then it would get to where you're going to collect it from.

514
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
 That's amazing.

515
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
 Yeah.

516
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
 It's very remote.

517
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 Yeah.

518
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 So the Everest Base Camp has a post box.

519
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 That's it.

520
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
 Where else?

521
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
 There's the Antarctic one.

522
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
 Not sure if we've spoken about that before.

523
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
 Really remote.

524
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
 The polar bears.

525
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
 Yeah.

526
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
 Well, yeah.

527
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
 Exactly.

528
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
 They did a application for it and they published it in the newspapers.

529
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
 So we could see the application.

530
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 And they explained that the job would involve carrying big heavy box over slippery rocks and slushy snow.

531
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,800
 And you'd have to survive on no heating or running water.

532
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,800
 That just says, are you happy not to shower for up to a month?

533
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,800
 Live in close proximity to three people and two thousand smelly penguins for five months?

534
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
 Yes.

535
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
 That sounds better than the Edinburgh Festival.

536
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,800
 I was thinking it was on weird societies.

537
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
 Yeah, cool.

538
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,800
 Or apparently boring societies.

539
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,800
 Do you guys know how popular, according to its website, the Biscuit Appreciation Society is?

540
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
 How popular?

541
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
 It's very popular.

542
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
 According to its website.

543
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 It's a very reliable website.

544
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
 I believe everything they say.

545
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:11,800
 So there's a message on their website saying that I'm really sorry we can't take any extra members as we have a backlog of memberships.

546
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,800
 And there's a 17 year waiting list to get into the Biscuit Appreciation Society.

547
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
 What?

548
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,800
 It claims our membership currently stands at about three million appreciators.

549
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
 I've never expected more than a couple.

550
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
 Does it mean every time someone has a biscuit?

551
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
 I know.

552
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
 I don't know the list.

553
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
 They obviously appreciate biscuits.

554
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 There's a movement of UFO alien believing people on Earth.

555
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
 And the aliens do that, don't they?

556
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,800
 Well, what the aliens do is you can become a priest, but by kind of just going there and they make you a priest.

557
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,800
 But they'll also make you a priest without you even knowing it.

558
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,800
 So they kind of make celebrities priests just without even telling them.

559
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
 And they say, look at all these famous people who are priests.

560
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,800
 And the famous people are like, well, I didn't even know that.

561
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,800
 I didn't even spy it to set up a fan club for myself.

562
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,800
 I just was like, Robbie Williams, big fan of mine.

563
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,800
 This was 6.7 billion members.

564
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
 No waiting list.

565
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
 Everyone's gone.

566
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
 It's automatically answered.

567
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,800
 Are we still disheartening that for the letters you get from Robbie Williams?

568
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
 Please remove me from your hand, lovely.

569
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
 It doesn't work like that, my friends.

570
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
 They are a double member.

571
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,800
 The minute you try to leave, he'll love me more.

572
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,800
 In the old and days London, they used to be really odd kind of gentlemen's clubs,

573
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
 where they had very specific things they had to do.

574
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,800
 So there was a murderous club where you were only allowed in if you'd ever killed a man.

575
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,800
 And there was the everlasting silence club where always someone had to be there,

576
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
 but you were not allowed to ever speak.

577
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
 And it was for men who had to escape their noisy wives.

578
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 And there was a fartist club.

579
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 All these kind of really odd things.

580
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
 Was the murderous club just a front set up by the police?

581
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,800
 All the club staff were hanging around saying, "So who'd you kill?"

582
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 I imagine that the murderous club would be people who used to be members of the silence club

583
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,800
 after the fartist club walked in there.

584
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,800
 In Japan, there are drain spotters,

585
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,800
 which I also want to be a member of the drain spotters club,

586
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,800
 which are people who spot drain covers because manhole covers in Japan are often really really beautiful.

587
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
 And they've got these amazing designs.

588
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,800
 Do you think they came up with a name first because it's like a pun on train spotters?

589
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 Yeah.

590
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
 Do you happen to read the urban Welsh book "Train Spotting"?

591
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 It's incredibly boring.

592
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
 Can I tell you about one more?

593
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
 Yeah, we should move on.

594
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
 This is from the Del Men's club,

595
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
 who are a fantastic organisation.

596
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
 And I'm quoting exactly here.

597
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
 "Bottle banker, Steve, I don't know if that's rhyming slang."

598
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
 It's not.

599
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,800
 "Bottle banker, Steve Wheeler, 66 from Molvin,

600
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,800
 has spent 30 years collecting more than 20,000 milk bottles.

601
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
 He found his first bottle in the mid-1980s.

602
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:50,800
 And now, Steve, who admits he doesn't even like milk, houses them in an 80-foot museum in his garden."

603
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,800
 So, when he collects them, do they have milk in them?

604
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
 Don't know.

605
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 Right.

606
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,800
 I mean, if they do, I'm sure he gets rid of it pretty quickly.

607
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
 That's why he hates milk so much.

608
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,800
 I think this is the mindset, man.

609
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
 Milk is all disgusting.

610
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
 Have you seen what happens to it?

611
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 How do people drink it every day is horrible?

612
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,800
 Okay, let's move on to our final fact.

613
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
 And that is James.

614
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,800
 Okay, my fact this week is that in the middle ages, people slept with cow dung

615
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,800
 at the foot of the bed to keep bugs away.

616
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
 Did it work?

617
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
 I think it did, to a certain extent.

618
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
 Really?

619
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
 Yeah.

620
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
 Because bugs will be attracted to the dung, right?

621
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
 Would it try them maybe just to the end of the bed?

622
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
 Also, it wasn't fresh dung.

623
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
 No.

624
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
 So it was dried dung, and sometimes it set fire to it.

625
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
 It was actually the smoke from the dung.

626
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
 Oh, so it's like incense?

627
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,800
 And so people still do that now.

628
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 Apparently.

629
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
 Yeah, wow.

630
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,800
 Yeah, sometimes people burn their houses down in order to keep a book open.

631
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,800
 Actually, there's loads of cases with bed bugs, where people have

632
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,800
 with alcohol and different kind of flammable things on their sofas and beds.

633
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
 And then, yeah, setting fire to the neighborhood.

634
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,800
 Yeah, I think there was a woman in Detroit recently, maybe the last couple of months.

635
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
 Yeah.

636
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
 So yeah, I covered her apartment in alcohol and then turned up the heating super high.

637
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
 I actually heard that was hard to get rid of them.

638
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
 Sometimes, once they do that, they go like, oh, I'll put alcohol on everything.

639
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
 That's great.

640
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
 That should do it.

641
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
 And then I'll have a nice fag to relax.

642
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
 Wow.

643
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,800
 Bed bugs are really hard to get rid of, aren't they?

644
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
 Yeah.

645
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 I've heard that they're getting thicker skin now to get rid of the insecticide.

646
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,800
 And the horrible things people are saying about them.

647
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
 Yeah.

648
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:21,800
 Insects evolve so much more quickly, because there's so many generations.

649
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
 Yeah.

650
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,800
 The concentration of insecticide that you need to kill a bed bug now is about a thousand times more than it was, like, say, a hundred years ago.

651
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
 Really?

652
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 Yeah.

653
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 And apparently, it always takes three times.

654
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
 You can't just get rid of them in one sweep.

655
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 It takes three goes round.

656
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,800
 So what is wrong with having bed bugs?

657
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
 I've never understood this.

658
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 So I don't think I've had them.

659
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
 Yeah.

660
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
 But if I did, what would be there?

661
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
 They cover you in painful, horrible, red-lived bites.

662
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
 Do they?

663
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
 They do.

664
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
 It's okay.

665
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,800
 Because bedding apparently used to be worth, like, a third of people's possessions.

666
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,800
 And that's why, when they traveled, they would take their bed sheets and they're covering with them.

667
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,800
 So they didn't use them in ins and stuff.

668
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,800
 And I hadn't really even thought about the fact that it's so unusual now that we sleep in beds on our own.

669
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
 Yeah, absolutely.

670
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,800
 Until about the 19th century, you'd mainly share a bed with someone else, wouldn't you?

671
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
 Yeah, if you stopped in a tavern.

672
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,800
 Well, like, if you had to travel lunch, you'd just have to sleep with, like, let the Henry have something.

673
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
 Yeah, that's right.

674
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
 Wow.

675
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
 Let the Henry and everyone read it.

676
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
 I guess hostels.

677
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
 Hostels are still kind of like that.

678
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
 Yeah, but there's bug beds.

679
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,800
 But you're in a room at Strangels, which is quite rare.

680
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
 Yeah.

681
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,800
 It's just like sharing a bed that was the standard that was the only option you'd have.

682
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,800
 In Tudor Medieval times, people who are wealthy enough to have a bed, which wasn't very many people,

683
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,800
 would always take it with them.

684
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,800
 So all beds were Z beds, foldable beds.

685
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
 And yeah, so the king would travel with his bed.

686
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,800
 Any nobles would travel with their beds folded up on the back of their car.

687
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,800
 Well, I was reading something by Lucy Worsley, and she was saying that beds in that period were actually incredibly rare.

688
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,800
 For the poor, yeah, so it would just be a huge hole where everyone was sleeping.

689
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,800
 So did they have cow dung on the floor next to them in their kind of their floor bed?

690
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
 I think it was hanging up rather than nice.

691
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
 Yeah, really?

692
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
 Because it sounds like it would be spread at the foot of the bed.

693
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
 Yeah.

694
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
 But I think it's done kind of hanging up to keep the fries on.

695
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
 Oh my god, like the front of a car for--

696
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,800
 Yeah, like an air freshener.

697
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
 Like an air freshener.

698
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
 The little tree.

699
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,800
 So cow dung is great stuff.

700
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
 Oh my goodness.

701
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,800
 So I did not know that you can, on the Indian Amazon website, you can buy cow dung cakes.

702
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,800
 You can get them about roughly 6 for £2.50.

703
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
 Are you good?

704
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 So what it is, you get a cow pat and you mix it up with it, and then you slap it on a wall,

705
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,800
 and it dries into a cake, and then you can burn that in a stove to cook food or--

706
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 For religious ceremonies.

707
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,800
 People in cities these days don't use it for food cooking anymore, but yeah.

708
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,800
 So there's also an Indian centre which uses cow dung medicinally,

709
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,800
 and their claims are so extravagant.

710
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
 Oh, what is this?

711
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
 What is this?

712
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,800
 Okay, so this is in Ahmedabad, and one claim is walking on fresh cow dung is very healthy.

713
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,800
 It completely heals all problems with your feet.

714
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,800
 They also have cow water, which is a urine-based soft drink.

715
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:08,800
 And the director of this facility said, "This will end the market for carbonated fizzy drinks."

716
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
 I love these all problems with your feet.

717
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
 I lost a foot.

718
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
 Come over here!

719
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
 So I'm so all problems.

720
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
 Not very long, yeah.

721
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,800
 And the sentence on this website just says,

722
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,800
 "Mainstream doctors are divided about the medical benefits,

723
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 with some pointing out that the curative claims have never been validated by independent bodies."

724
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,800
 Yeah, you can get cow urine aftershave, I think, because it's very good for your skin.

725
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
 So just apparently.

726
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
 So does this come from thinking that cows are precious?

727
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
 Yeah, it's in their religion.

728
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 Yeah, because cows are sacred.

729
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,800
 And their dung is sacred as well, which is why it's religious rituals.

730
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
 That's what, yeah, it says here, their milk makes children more obedient.

731
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
 That's part of the sacredness.

732
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,800
 And touching them can lower your blood pressure, that's one of the thoughts.

733
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
 And they block nuclear radiation.

734
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
 Okay, well, I'm right with the first two, because they make sense.

735
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,800
 That yes, if children want some more milk, then they'll be more obedient.

736
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,800
 Yeah, I think it makes absolute sense.

737
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
 Stroking lots of pets, people have comforts.

738
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 And also that will calm you down.

739
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
 Yeah, yeah.

740
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 Those quarters are fine.

741
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
 And the nuclear...

742
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,800
 Well, not many people know, but Richard Feynman is talking about that.

743
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
 Yes, he's talking about that.

744
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,800
 He just slapped a cow pat on his eyes.

745
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
 Yeah.

746
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,800
 And I've got another thing about old bedtime habits.

747
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
 Great.

748
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
 Better you feel tired.

749
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
 Yeah.

750
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
 So have you heard of bundling?

751
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
 Yeah.

752
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
 Bando, you're jumping on someone's phone.

753
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
 Someone gets a break from it.

754
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
 Oh, okay, no, no.

755
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
 It's right for the very bottom of the bundle.

756
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
 You don't have to be second in the bundle.

757
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
 Why is it okay to be on the bottom?

758
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
 I don't know.

759
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,800
 For some reason it's a snugly, but the second one on it's not comfortable.

760
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
 You can kind of curl up and defend yourself a bit more if you're at the bottom.

761
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
 Yeah, if you're at the bottom.

762
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
 Yeah.

763
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
 You're spreading it when you're second in the bundle.

764
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,800
 But then I think you deserve it, because you're the first one jumping in on the bundle.

765
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
 You're causing all the problems.

766
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
 You don't know.

767
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
 Maybe the person underneath said, "Bundle."

768
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
 You just have to follow the instruction.

769
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
 Can you get people to bundle you?

770
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,800
 It's a bit silly pathetic if you lay down going, "Bundles, everyone's going, no James."

771
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
 You're in your late 30s.

772
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
 You haven't done that for a long time.

773
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
 It's a terrible sleepover.

774
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
 We're going.

775
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,800
 And then, Maga told G, "That's when you do a bundle, but you're all got sleeping bags on."

776
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,800
 So, bundling used to be when you wanted to introduce two unmarried children to each other.

777
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
 Of age, I should point out.

778
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
 Yes, okay.

779
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,800
 So, it'd be two boy and a girl unmarried.

780
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,800
 And the parents would let them sleep in the same room for an evening.

781
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
 The idea was to get to know each other.

782
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,800
 So, in order to prevent things from happening, from getting sexy,

783
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,800
 they used to either tie them to the bed.

784
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,800
 So, you would have to lay them tied, both of you, to the bed, and just have all evening.

785
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,800
 Or, they would put a ginormous wooden board just in the middle of the bed, separating you two.

786
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
 Surely, that's how people get fetishes.

787
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
 Maga, you're right.

788
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
 That's the birth of a bed.

789
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,800
 Your early sexual experience is all I mean tied up with.

790
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
 I can't do it anyway.

791
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
 How old are these young people?

792
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
 I guess approaching marriage age.

793
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,800
 So, yeah, so they were kind of marriageable age.

794
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
 Yeah, I don't know.

795
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
 It was kind of, yeah.

796
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
 The roughly late teens, I think.

797
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
 Yeah.

798
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,800
 So, the next guy I meet, and we're like, "Hey, do you like being tied up?"

799
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
 Because I want to get to know you.

800
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,800
 That's why I always got kicked out of these bundling parties, you guys are going to show my rope.

801
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
 You plop some wood.

802
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,800
 The first draft of 50 Shades of Grey is actually incredibly boring.

803
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
 A lot of conversation.

804
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,800
 I mean, also the final draft of 50 Shades of Grey is also incredibly boring, but that's not the point.

805
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
 You haven't read 50 Shades of Grey.

806
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
 I've read the first third of 50 Shades of Grey.

807
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
 Oh, what did you think?

808
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
 I have 17 Shades of Grey.

809
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:31,800
 I stopped after the third or fourth time, she shattered into a million pieces.

810
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
 Oh, yeah.

811
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
 I thought it was...

812
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
 Is that what happens?

813
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,800
 Did you read Humpty Dumpty?

814
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,800
 Anastasia calls all the King's horses and all the King's men.

815
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
 Yeah.

816
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
 That's pretty rude, she's stubborn.

817
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,800
 Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts.

818
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
