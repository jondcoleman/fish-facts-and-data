00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. Thank you all"
00:00:06,00:00:12,for snapping up tickets for our upcoming Thunder Nerds Tour. It's going to be so much fun and
00:00:12,00:00:19,so many of you have already got tickets. It has been absolutely staggering to be honest.
00:00:19,00:00:23,"We have sold out a number of the dates. There's still quite a lot of tickets available though,"
00:00:23,00:00:29,so do go to NoSuchThingsAsFish.com/live to see what tickets are available now. But the
00:00:29,00:00:34,"main reason that I've come here today is to speak directly to the people of Sydney,"
00:00:34,00:00:40,"Australia. You, of all the people around the world, have really pulled out all the stops"
00:00:40,00:00:47,"and helped us to sell out the Sydney Opera House in just a couple of days. Absolute insanity,"
00:00:47,00:00:54,it has to be said. But thank you for doing that. We're going to put on an extra show in Sydney.
00:00:54,00:01:01,"Now, the details of that will first be told to Club Fish members. At the beginning of your next"
00:01:01,00:01:08,"bit of bonus content, which is due to come out on the 11th of June, you people will have a pre-sale"
00:01:08,00:01:14,"and then if there are any tickets left, they will go on sale on the 14th of June and we'll give"
00:01:14,00:01:18,details at the top of that Friday's show. So that's the big news. We're really looking forward
00:01:18,00:01:23,"to this tour. It's going to be absolutely amazing. If you haven't got tickets yet, then do not Dilly"
00:01:23,00:01:28,"Dally because they are going super, super fast. And like I said, you can get those at"
00:01:28,00:01:34,NoSixThingsAsFish.com/live. One more thing to say and that is that there is a bit of an odd
00:01:34,00:01:41,thing about this week's show. That is that one member of the team was unable to make it to the
00:01:41,00:01:47,"office on time, despite leaving home on time. They never made it. I will leave it up to you to"
00:01:47,00:01:53,"guess who that's going to be. But what it means is that this was a three-person show. Obviously,"
00:01:53,00:01:59,"we very much missed the person in question, but hopefully you will enjoy this show nonetheless."
00:01:59,00:02:05,"Anyway, no more to say apart from, as we always do every week on with the podcast."
00:02:06,00:02:26,"Hello and welcome to another episode of NoSixThingsAsFish, coming to you from the QI offices in"
00:02:26,00:02:34,"Hobern. My name is Anna Toshinsky and I'm joined here today by James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:02:34,00:02:41,"and a superior replacement to Dan Shriver in the form of, if you're seeing the video clip of this,"
00:02:41,00:02:46,a puppet of Dan Shriver who will say much less. And I think that'll be appreciated.
00:02:46,00:02:54,I'm afraid Dan is stuck on a train somewhere in the east of England. #BrokenBritain. Let's go.
00:02:54,00:02:58,Nice to hear BrokenBritain making a comeback. No one said that for years.
00:02:58,00:03:03,"Is that quite dated? We're too busy living it, you know. No, Dan, this is the first ever,"
00:03:03,00:03:08,"I think, three-person podcast we've ever done. Yeah. If you prefer the format, let us know."
00:03:08,00:03:13,I think this could be it. Do you think? We might crack it.
00:03:13,00:03:17,"I just want to say, Dan, if you're listening, which I know you will be, I really missed you."
00:03:17,00:03:24,"James was the first one to suggest. He said, ""Let's cut the soundbag loose."" He kept saying,"
00:03:24,00:03:27,"kept saying it over and over again. He said that before your train was even delayed, actually."
00:03:27,00:03:32,We had a whole train going. How do we ditch Dan? It was actually me that stopped the train.
00:03:32,00:03:38,I put five people on the track and then one person on another track.
00:03:38,00:03:43,"You put one leaf on the line, so we'll be there for a couple of days."
00:03:43,00:03:47,"Anyway, we're going to kick off with fact number one, and because I'm hosting,"
00:03:47,00:03:53,"I've made that my fact. My fact this week is that as part of the preparations for D-Day,"
00:03:53,00:03:59,one scientist persuaded another to inhale oxygen until she vomited. They got married
00:03:59,00:04:04,shortly afterwards. It's sort of a weird rom-com in a fact.
00:04:04,00:04:07,Is it a meat-cute? Maybe they already knew each other.
00:04:07,00:04:08,I don't know what meat-cute says.
00:04:08,00:04:12,"God, guys, that's in a rom-com, the moment where the couple, they bump into each other,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,"she drops all her stuff, he helps her pick them up."
00:04:14,00:04:15,She vomits.
00:04:15,00:04:19,"She vomits. They're under the ocean, maybe? Is this, they're in a hyperbaric chamber?"
00:04:19,00:04:24,"They're simulating me under the ocean, certainly. Okay, well, it's the original meat-cute."
00:04:24,00:04:29,This is from this amazing book that I need to cite. It's written by someone called Rachel
00:04:29,00:04:33,"Lance, who was actually a blast injury specialist and a researcher into bodies"
00:04:33,00:04:38,"surviving the extremes of being underwater, but she's written this book called Chamber Divers,"
00:04:38,00:04:43,"and she's uncovered this story, which is that. The D-Day landings hadn't happened yet. This is"
00:04:43,00:04:51,"Second World War, but there had been a disastrous Canadian beach landing in the Second World War"
00:04:51,00:04:56,"on the beaches of France, and it'd been disastrous because they had based it on a bunch of old photos"
00:04:56,00:05:01,"they had, like, old holiday photos from the 1920s. You're joking. And they're like, where's the Ferris"
00:05:01,00:05:07,"Wheel? Exactly. Where's all the zombies? So you've got to make landfall by the donkeys, right?"
00:05:07,00:05:13,"And it turned out the donkeys and the Ferris Wheel and all of that had been replaced by German guns,"
00:05:13,00:05:19,"which is such bad luck, and it was awful and a huge number of casualties."
00:05:19,00:05:22,"Was it that the sand had moved, or the tides had moved the sand,"
00:05:22,00:05:25,or that they couldn't land in the same way because of the ocean conditions?
00:05:25,00:05:28,"I think it was that they couldn't tell what the terrain was like based on the pictures,"
00:05:28,00:05:31,"so they thought it was going to be nice and sandy. It was very rocky, it was very hazardous,"
00:05:31,00:05:35,"couldn't land properly, really bad, and so it became apparent that in order to do a successful"
00:05:35,00:05:40,"beach landing to invade the Germans, the Allies would have to know more about the coastline,"
00:05:40,00:05:45,"which would mean divers getting right up to the beach, spending a long time underwater,"
00:05:45,00:05:48,"going deep down, getting up to the beach, then popping up at night, and actually figuring out"
00:05:48,00:05:53,"exactly what was on the beach. And to do that, we needed to know how to dive, which we didn't really"
00:05:53,00:05:56,in the 40s. Interesting. You know what I was reading yesterday? I was reading a book about
00:05:56,00:06:03,"the history of barbed wire, and this is really off topic, but there was a thing in it how during"
00:06:03,00:06:10,"the war, they used to put barbed wire under the sea, so as in when people would come and land,"
00:06:10,00:06:14,"you would jump off the boat and start running up, but your feet would get tangled because there's"
00:06:14,00:06:23,barbed wire under the sea. No way. Under the sea. It's not better. That's mean. It was a time of
00:06:23,00:06:30,"meanies, 39 to 45. That's extraordinary, I did not know that. But that would be useful for your"
00:06:30,00:06:34,"divers as well, because they would notice it, I guess. They'd see it exactly with the goggles on,"
00:06:34,00:06:38,"because they wear goggles, don't they? Anyway, this is a long-winded way of getting to the"
00:06:38,00:06:44,"point that there were these two researchers, JBS Haldane and Helen Spowate, they worked for UCL,"
00:06:44,00:06:49,"and they shut themselves repeatedly in these hyperbaric chambers, chambers that could be"
00:06:49,00:06:54,filled up with oxygen and simulate underwater pressures. They did this over and over again
00:06:54,00:06:59,"to find out the effects on the human body so that the D-Day landings could happen,"
00:06:59,00:07:05,"and Helen Spowate is in there, and she's the one who's inhaling pure oxygen, because it's the other"
00:07:05,00:07:10,"body deals with oxygen at high pressures, because it can be very dangerous, and JBS Haldane is"
00:07:10,00:07:16,"sitting next to her taking notes in this hyperbaric chamber, and she managed to last for 33 minutes"
00:07:16,00:07:21,"on pure oxygen before she tore the breathing tube out of her mouth, vomited repeatedly,"
00:07:21,00:07:26,"hallucinated, and said, ""I'm done, thanks."" Well, she might have said, ""I'm done, thanks,"" because"
00:07:26,00:07:31,"I read about what happens to you in those situations, and yeah, your voice goes really"
00:07:31,00:07:35,"high, like you're on helium. I didn't know that. They should do that at kids' birthday party,"
00:07:35,00:07:39,"shouldn't they? Well, it's kind of tutor. Yeah, exactly. Well, there's a lot of vomiting at kids'"
00:07:39,00:07:44,"birthday parties and stuff like that. It does sound kind of fun, apart from people can't whistle,"
00:07:44,00:07:49,"when there's so much oxygen either. Oh, no. So, you know, it's... Well, I wouldn't like that,"
00:07:49,00:07:54,"because I'm a whistler. Are you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get told off for whistling from my wife's family,"
00:07:54,00:07:58,"who think it's bad luck in the house. Well, you're whistling out of the window passing women,"
00:07:58,00:08:06,"aren't you? And you've got your heart hat on. They're right. It really affected Haldane,"
00:08:06,00:08:10,"didn't it? So, I read that in the course of this research, he got a bubble at the base of his spine,"
00:08:10,00:08:14,"which stayed there for the rest of his life, and it made it incredibly painful for him to sit down"
00:08:14,00:08:20,"anywhere. No. Yeah. Yeah, no, he was extremely dangerous. He was an incredible guy, JBS Haldane."
00:08:20,00:08:26,"He was, yeah. John Byrdon Sanderson Haldane. He was amazing. I was just saying before we started"
00:08:26,00:08:29,"recording this, sometimes you meet someone researching his podcast, and you think, ""I just"
00:08:29,00:08:34,"want to spend weeks with you. I just want to do like a month-long special of the show about this guy."""
00:08:34,00:08:38,"Andy, if you spent weeks with him, he'd make you do so much mad stuff that you wouldn't have"
00:08:38,00:08:42,"the guts for, I'm afraid. No, okay, fair enough. But he was constantly experimenting on himself,"
00:08:42,00:08:45,"and his dad was also a really famous scientist who experimented on him,"
00:08:45,00:08:50,"and he did all of this science, despite not having a science degree even. He studied maths,"
00:08:50,00:08:54,"and then classics. I'm sorry to say, but if you do that, you're going to end up with a bubble"
00:08:54,00:08:59,"on your butt. Move into the professionals, mate. No, you're right, you're right, you're right."
00:08:59,00:09:03,"But he was a geneticist by training, and yet throughout his life, he was constantly doing"
00:09:03,00:09:07,"crazy experiments. Which were really useful as well. Really useful, yeah. You know, he really did"
00:09:07,00:09:13,find out a lot about how the body responds to these pressures and different gases. I think he
00:09:13,00:09:18,"did a lot of research into nitrogen as well. If we get overexposed in nitrogen, he went down, I think."
00:09:18,00:09:23,"When he was about 13, he was first experimented on undersea by his father. This is a life-long"
00:09:23,00:09:29,"thing for Haldane, right? He and his father, who was called also John Haldane. John Scott Haldane,"
00:09:29,00:09:35,"sorry, yeah, yeah. They went up to the west coast of Scotland on HMS Spanker, which was a navy"
00:09:35,00:09:40,"ship. Do you have a cap? I do. I have a naval cap with the band HMS Spanker, which was an old prop"
00:09:40,00:09:46,"from QI. And I wear that standing at my window, and I also have that complaint. And his father was"
00:09:46,00:09:51,"trying to work out the speed divers should rise at to stop getting the bends, the decompression"
00:09:51,00:09:55,"sickness. And they didn't know what caused that, and he found out basically. And Haldane senior"
00:09:55,00:10:00,"put his volunteers, including his 13-year-old son, Jack, in a badly fitting diving suit,"
00:10:00,00:10:04,got them to repeatedly go down into the sea and then come back up at different speeds.
00:10:04,00:10:09,He did work out eventually how to come back up. But Jack Jr. became incredibly cold and frightened.
00:10:09,00:10:12,He was 13 years old. And his dad just apparently dosed him with lots of whiskey and then put him
00:10:12,00:10:18,"to bed. And that was parenting in the audience. And then we look back and think, what a legend."
00:10:20,00:10:26,"That's true. Because actually it was him and Naomi, his sister. And she was a sort of equally"
00:10:26,00:10:32,amazing character. So she was four years younger than JBS Haldane. And their dad experimented on
00:10:32,00:10:37,both of them constantly. Apparently Naomi's job as a child from literally the age of three was to
00:10:37,00:10:41,monitor test subjects through an observation window in these gas chambers that he'd set up.
00:10:41,00:10:45,"Make sure your brother's not dead. It was literally that if they fell unconscious,"
00:10:45,00:10:51,"she had to drag them out and resuscitate them. Jesus. Honestly, I'm starting to warm a little"
00:10:51,00:10:58,"less to this guy. I'm just imagining what a genius he would have been in adult life,"
00:10:58,00:11:03,"Haldane. Had he not had his brain squashed by gases every weekend. Maybe it was,"
00:11:03,00:11:07,that's the equivalent of the bonk on the head though. Maybe that was what sparked the genius.
00:11:07,00:11:13,"Yeah, maybe. Maybe we should all be doing it. Yeah. Actually, he's been his whole life being"
00:11:13,00:11:16,"gassed. I've just realized he was gassed in the First World War as well. His entire life,"
00:11:16,00:11:21,"he was, yeah, yeah. So he was in the Black Watch and the Black Watch are very famous scotch"
00:11:21,00:11:26,"regiment. You know, they're sort of like legends of the British army. Black Watch, didn't they?"
00:11:26,00:11:31,"That's right. Cassio. And that's why they never started their attacks on time,"
00:11:31,00:11:36,"because they'd all drifted a little bit. One, two, three, beat it. Let's go. The German's just"
00:11:36,00:11:42,opened the machine gun fire as soon as I hear this huge beat. And so his job was trench mortar
00:11:42,00:11:46,"officers. So he had to lead groups to throw bombs by hand into enemy trenches. I mean,"
00:11:46,00:11:50,"it's quite fierce and hard and horrible work. Yeah. He loved it. And he was gassed, which"
00:11:50,00:11:55,"sparked an interest in mustard gas and experimenting on that. But while he was at the front, I"
00:11:55,00:12:00,"loved this, he was writing back and forth with Naomi, his sister, about mouse genetics. And he"
00:12:00,00:12:04,"later, he boasted he was the only officer to complete a scientific paper from a forward"
00:12:04,00:12:09,"position of the Black Watch. No way. That's amazing. It is amazing. But he must have been like,"
00:12:09,00:12:13,"the gas comes towards him. He must be like getting a Madeleine moment of his childhood,"
00:12:13,00:12:19,"mustn't he? He's like, oh, this reminds me of old dad. He's taking off his mask,"
00:12:19,00:12:25,"maybe getting his milk pad out. Can we talk about Helen Spearway? Yeah, she was also awesome."
00:12:25,00:12:29,"This is, she was the other one in the diving experience. She was the one who vomited."
00:12:29,00:12:33,"Yes. And who he did marry. And they did mention after vomiting all over him,"
00:12:33,00:12:37,"they did get married afterwards. Go on. She reminds me a bit of Erica McAllister,"
00:12:37,00:12:44,"because she, her most of her research was on Drosophilia, fruit flies. So she was a world expert"
00:12:44,00:12:51,"on fruit flies, basically. And then she later wrote a paper about pathogenesis in guppies,"
00:12:51,00:12:57,in the fish. So that means that a female guppy can give birth without having sex. Virgin birth.
00:12:57,00:13:01,Virgin birth. But she also said that possibly it could happen in humans because of her work in
00:13:01,00:13:06,"guppies. She was like, well, there's no reason if it happens in guppies, it can't happen in puppies,"
00:13:06,00:13:14,"and then in humans. Guppies, puppies, humans. She was extremely harker as well, wasn't she,"
00:13:14,00:13:19,as you'd have to be. They sort of found each other's soulmates in each other. And she was quite
00:13:19,00:13:25,a strange character. So there's a Time Magazine report of an incident that happened to her in
00:13:25,00:13:31,"1956, which you have to bear in mind it is 1956. It began, Britain's a blonde biologist,"
00:13:31,00:13:38,"Helen Spurway Haldane, wife of brilliant biologist, JBS Haldane. The plund and the brilliant."
00:13:38,00:13:46,Emerged from a London pub after downing three and a half pints of bitter
00:13:46,00:13:52,"and encountered a bobby, stamped on his police dog's tail and clouted the cop. So she was clearly"
00:13:52,00:13:57,a bit feisty. Maybe she was just experimenting what would happen if a dog got his tail stumped on.
00:13:57,00:14:01,"Maybe she was. Well, the answer, it turns out, is you end up in prison for two months."
00:14:01,00:14:06,"Two months, well, yeah. Yeah, but she was offered to pay a fine. And she said, no, not up for it."
00:14:06,00:14:09,"And she was about to go to India. And she said, I'll fit in much better with some of the other"
00:14:09,00:14:14,"people who've gone to India if I've done a prison spell. Basically, that's why they left Britain."
00:14:14,00:14:19,"So Haldane was at Cambridge and she got arrested for drunken disorderly. And he said, well,"
00:14:19,00:14:24,"let's just go to India then. Really? Yeah. But whenever anyone asked him why, he said,"
00:14:24,00:14:29,"oh, I am the Suez crisis. I think the government has handled that so badly that I want to leave"
00:14:29,00:14:32,the UK and I want to go to India. But it's actually because his wife was a piss ass.
00:14:32,00:14:38,Because I read that I read a few reasons that he gave. One was that he was broke as well.
00:14:38,00:14:42,"Like after the war, his lab had no money and he was broke. And those pipes are bitter."
00:14:42,00:14:46,And he'd be given a really good job offer from the Indian Statistical Institute.
00:14:46,00:14:50,But also he then claimed this is a bit more in the Suez line of things that he just didn't
00:14:50,00:14:55,want to wear socks anymore. He said 60 years in socks is enough. So I'm moving to India.
00:14:55,00:15:00,"Yeah, okay. We don't have to wear socks. Well, also one thing he really liked, apart from the"
00:15:00,00:15:03,"nice job offer and, you know, the cultural that he liked the socialism there, because they had"
00:15:03,00:15:09,a lot of socialism in India at the time. And he was a former communist. He spent years and years
00:15:09,00:15:16,"in the Communist Party and slightly embarrassed himself a bit over Lysenko, who was the dodgy"
00:15:16,00:15:19,Soviet pseudoscientist who claimed he was going to revolutionize crops.
00:15:19,00:15:25,"Well, yeah, that's the thing. Like Lysenko, he was the one who said Darwin's theories are not"
00:15:25,00:15:29,"completely correct. But obviously for Haldane, this is a big problem because he was such a"
00:15:29,00:15:33,"geneticist and he was so... That's weird. Like for him, like to be a world expert on genetics,"
00:15:33,00:15:36,"for a while, he was kind of saying, well, you know, there might be something in it. And he"
00:15:36,00:15:41,slightly compromised his scientific principles. Naomi was also a socialist. I was here. Okay.
00:15:41,00:15:45,"And committed socialist. But anyway, she also proofread Lord of the Rings"
00:15:45,00:15:49,in her spare time. Get out. She in fact wrote over 19 novels. She was
00:15:49,00:15:54,incredibly... What are you going to say? Over 90% of it. The Great Dundervalued Women.
00:15:54,00:15:58,Yeah. She proofread it. Yeah. She's not... I've got him to kind of pair it down a little bit.
00:15:58,00:16:04,"It was actually 19 books long. No, if she wrote 90 books, she's not the master of decision."
00:16:04,00:16:10,"Haldane's first wife, Charlotte Franken, was a daughter of an alien. Oh, yeah."
00:16:10,00:16:16,"Go on. Yeah. Dan? No response from Dan there? No, he's just sat there. Okay. He's stunned."
00:16:16,00:16:24,You've stolen his only fact. Her father was Jewish and the son of a German. And during the
00:16:24,00:16:29,"First World War, there was a thing called the Alien Restrictions Act. If you personally wasn't a"
00:16:29,00:16:34,"British citizen, then they would... You would have less rights than anyone else in the country."
00:16:34,00:16:39,So he decided to leave and left Charlotte on her own. But she became a reporter for the Daily
00:16:39,00:16:44,"Express, apparently, because... And this is according to the dictionary of national biography,"
00:16:44,00:16:47,because her father had taught her to drink like a man.
00:16:47,00:16:54,So that helped her to become a reporter for the Express. I believe it. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty
00:16:54,00:16:58,"much the only qualification you needed. But she was actually married when she met Haldane,"
00:16:58,00:17:04,and she got divorced. And the divorce quoted Haldane as a person in the divorce. And he basically got
00:17:04,00:17:08,fired from Cambridge because of that. And he was quoted as a person who'd been
00:17:09,00:17:13,"monkeying about with... Exactly. He came, which was very uptight back in those days, wasn't it?"
00:17:13,00:17:18,He was brought up in front of the sex-very... The what? The sex-very...
00:17:18,00:17:27,"V-E-R-E. V-I-R-I. What are they? Well, sex. Six men. Six men. Yeah. So they were the moral guardians"
00:17:27,00:17:31,"of the University of Cambridge, which if you'd done anything wrong, you would be brought up in"
00:17:31,00:17:36,"front of them and they say, ""You're going to lose your position in my universe."" Wow. The sex-very."
00:17:36,00:17:41,"That must have led to some confusion. People turning up for a good time, seeing the plaque"
00:17:41,00:17:47,"on the door. Well, Haldane, he contested the charge he won. He started calling the sex-very"
00:17:47,00:17:52,the sex-weary. Brilliant. That's a bit of a joke. Brilliant. And they basically lost all of their
00:17:52,00:17:57,"authority. Wow. And they weren't there anymore. Not thanks solely to that pun. No, but it was"
00:17:57,00:18:03,"really part of it. Really? Well, the pun, but the whole, you know, escapade was part of it. Yeah."
00:18:03,00:18:08,"Of course, if you are speaking classical Latin the way it's traditionally spoken is pronounced"
00:18:08,00:18:13,"sex-weary anyway, isn't it? Oh, maybe you've seen better jokes. Even better back in those days."
00:18:13,00:18:14,That's great. Latin.
00:18:14,00:18:26,"OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My fact is that the Swiss have a special"
00:18:26,00:18:32,"kind of wrestling trouser named the Schwingerhausen, with a special belt for your opponent to hang onto."
00:18:32,00:18:38,"Well, does your opponent want to hang onto your trousers? Well, the Schwingerhausen are these"
00:18:38,00:18:43,heavy trunks that you wear in the Alps when you're wrestling with your fellow farmers and loggers
00:18:43,00:18:50,and herdsmen and all of that. It's quite a blokey sport traditionally. It's been making strides.
00:18:50,00:18:55,"There are some lady-swingers now, but traditionally it was a lads occupation."
00:18:55,00:19:01,"And basically, you put your right hand on your opponent's belt, your left hand on their right"
00:19:01,00:19:08,"leg, you brace, I'm sure, and then you tussle. And you're trying to make your opponent vulnerable"
00:19:08,00:19:14,"to the Schwinger, the Schwinger, which the holds. There are dozens of holds. The average Schwinger"
00:19:14,00:19:20,"masters several Schwinger, three or four, but there are no loads, but like you have"
00:19:20,00:19:23,"your three or four signature moves. It's kind of like Street Fighter, the arcade game."
00:19:23,00:19:28,"And once you enact a Schwinger, your opponent might go for a Geigen Schwinger, which is a"
00:19:28,00:19:35,counterhold. And you get points for the holds that you make. I think you just get points for
00:19:35,00:19:39,throwing your opponent or moving them. Maybe it's moving them out. I think it's just throwing
00:19:39,00:19:43,"them on the floor. It seems to be the aim. And it does. If you watch videos, it's very"
00:19:43,00:19:47,crotch heavy a lot of the time. Because if you imagine you've grabbed someone's belt loops
00:19:47,00:19:51,"from behind and you sort of, a lot of the time, just shoving them towards you, aren't they? As"
00:19:51,00:19:55,"they're doing the same. So you sort of crotch on crotch quite a lot of the time, and then"
00:19:55,00:19:59,"eventually one of you flips the other onto the ground and you've won the bout. Yeah, amazing."
00:19:59,00:20:05,And the competitions are often known as Swing Fests. Yeah. But don't get them mistaken with the
00:20:05,00:20:11,"South London Swing Fest, which is a celebration of swing music. The Sussex Swing Fest, which is a"
00:20:11,00:20:18,"golf competition, or Swing Fest, a Swinger only festival from East Yorkshire. Is that swinging,"
00:20:18,00:20:21,"swinging? Yeah, yeah. That's right. That's. So we'll get mixed up with any of those if you want to go"
00:20:21,00:20:26,"for your homoerotic Swiss wrestling competition. Yeah, leather trousers would be useful. I think"
00:20:26,00:20:30,"they'd probably be useful for a few of those. For all of those, really. Absolutely. There should be"
00:20:30,00:20:35,"one of those flowcharts in a magazine, which Swing Fest are you? Oh yeah, yeah. Do you have leather"
00:20:35,00:20:41,"trousers? That doesn't help us. Yeah, and I read a great article in the German Language Press about"
00:20:41,00:20:47,"Paul Eggiman, who's a master saddler, and he makes the wrestling trousers. And he's one of,"
00:20:47,00:20:52,"I think, a handful of people who now truly knows the art of how to make a stringer horser."
00:20:52,00:20:56,"And did you read it in German? No, I clicked the button that said,"
00:20:56,00:21:01,"I toggle from German to English. Oh, right. I always do that as well. I even felt languages"
00:21:01,00:21:07,"that I could speak. Even for English, you toggle. More English, please. More Englishy."
00:21:07,00:21:14,Yeah. And there's quite a nice thing at the end where it's a sort of respectful thing. At the
00:21:14,00:21:18,"end, the winner ends the match by brushing the sawdust off the loser's back. Oh, yeah."
00:21:18,00:21:21,"Oh, really? What do you think that used to be? That he brushed off his back?"
00:21:21,00:21:27,"He's going to get a tissue. Come on. Oh, dear. It's huge, though, isn't it? I mean,"
00:21:27,00:21:33,"it's, I think it's one of the most well attended sports in Switzerland, if not the most, about"
00:21:33,00:21:38,"300,000 people attend the finals, which happen every year to crown the king of the swingers."
00:21:38,00:21:41,Brilliant. The jumble VIP.
00:21:43,00:21:47,"There was a magazine called Schwinger Zeitung magazine,"
00:21:47,00:21:55,"which the first edition was in 1907. And in that edition, they talk about bets being placed in"
00:21:55,00:22:01,"taverns on swinging. But it's also, it's amazing. There's a big article about how terrible cycling"
00:22:01,00:22:07,"is. It's so weird. When was this? 1907. Really? So weird. But yeah, I guess that's when it was"
00:22:07,00:22:13,"taking off, you know, so that will be a... People were quite anti. They were anti-women cycling,"
00:22:13,00:22:17,"especially. Why did they think it was bad? Well, because it was an imported sport,"
00:22:17,00:22:23,"and compared to swinging, which obviously all normal, upstanding Swiss people love to do,"
00:22:23,00:22:27,cycling involves wretched hunchback figures on their velocities.
00:22:27,00:22:32,"You can't commute to work by swinging, can you? You can swing your way to work."
00:22:32,00:22:36,"If you and another Schwinger grab each other, then throw yourselves off the mountain,"
00:22:36,00:22:41,"you can get down to your office in a kind of wheel formation. So you are the bike, basically, yeah."
00:22:41,00:22:46,"It's one of the three Swiss national sports, or often cited as one of the three really traditional"
00:22:46,00:22:51,Swiss national sports. And the other two... Can we guess? Swiss national sports skiing?
00:22:51,00:22:58,"I doubt it, but give it a go. Skiing. I'd say no from me. Cowriding. You've got to put a bell"
00:22:58,00:23:04,"around the neck of the biggest bull in the valley. I think, you know, that's not a terrible guess."
00:23:04,00:23:09,"Blowing that massive horn, that big alpine horn thing. Oh yeah, the Alpenhorning."
00:23:09,00:23:14,"Oh, yodeling. I don't think that's a sport. Are you calling that a sport? No, I'm going to tell you."
00:23:14,00:23:19,Eating Toblerone. You'll kick yourself. Making knives. Anonymous bank accounts.
00:23:19,00:23:25,Protecting the Pope. Yes. I'm going to tell you if that's all right.
00:23:29,00:23:37,"Oh, Dan, what was that you said, Dan? Stein's tossing and hornooson. Yeah, you're absolutely right, Dan."
00:23:37,00:23:42,"Did I not say hornooson? Did you say hornooson? Well, I said horn. It has nothing to do with horns."
00:23:42,00:23:46,"I think it's like a giant... I've watched a bit of it. It's really fun. It's like fly swatting,"
00:23:46,00:23:51,"but on a giant scale. And it's a bit like golf. Someone swings this whip at the hornoos,"
00:23:51,00:23:56,"which is a hornet. Oh, I've seen it. It's like a golf club, but it's like got a whip bit on the end."
00:23:56,00:24:02,"Exactly. Yeah, I've seen that. It's like if you had a trick golf club that was flexible and you hit"
00:24:02,00:24:07,"it. So what am I hitting it at? You're hitting it at this massive field in front of you or slope,"
00:24:07,00:24:12,"and up the slope are the opponent, and they're all holding these huge flapping bats that look like"
00:24:12,00:24:17,giant fly swats. And their job is to swat your ball out of the air. And you've got to see...
00:24:17,00:24:22,"Sounds incredibly difficult. Wait, so I'm whipping my ball into the air,"
00:24:22,00:24:26,"and they're trying to swat my ball out of the air. So imagine I hit a golf ball to you,"
00:24:26,00:24:31,"you're 200 yards away, and you've got a tennis racket, and you're trying to hit the golf ball"
00:24:31,00:24:36,before it lands. Right. But with additional difficulties. And you're trying to get it what
00:24:36,00:24:40,passed me? Or... You're trying to get it to hit the ground before someone swats it.
00:24:40,00:24:44,"Right, okay, okay. Such a pretty basic concept. It's the kind of game you come up with as a"
00:24:44,00:24:49,"seven-year-old with your sibling, and they've stuck with it. And it's huge. And in fact,"
00:24:49,00:24:53,"Rudolf Minger, who I'm sure you guys know, was a 1950s Swiss politician."
00:24:53,00:25:00,"Dan, no, please. Come on, mate. It's just a name. It's not funny. It's not a funny name. It's just"
00:25:00,00:25:05,a name. He said it was the ultimate mark of patriotism alongside wrestling and yodeling.
00:25:05,00:25:08,Can I tell you a thing or two about Leather trousers? Sure.
00:25:08,00:25:16,"Did we talk ever about the ale conner? I don't think so. So basically, this was this idea that"
00:25:16,00:25:22,"in the old days, the way you tested beer was that you'd go to a pub, you'd pour the beer onto a"
00:25:22,00:25:27,"wooden bench, and then you'd sit down and you'd see if you stuck to it. Right? And this is a myth."
00:25:27,00:25:32,"It's a complete myth. Is it really? It's from 1911. How interesting. Yeah. It's from this book,"
00:25:32,00:25:37,"Inns, Ales and Drinking Customs of Old England. So it already sounds like copper bottom nonsense."
00:25:37,00:25:43,The idea was that like a publican might put extra sugar in or something like that. Exactly.
00:25:43,00:25:48,And it would make it sticky. Yeah. So you'd come in wearing your leather trousers. You get some
00:25:48,00:25:52,"beer, pour it on your bench, sit down, and then you'd sit there for half an hour and try and"
00:25:52,00:25:58,"stand up. And if you stuck to it, it had too much sugar in and it was impure. If the bench came up"
00:25:58,00:26:03,"with your arse as we stood up, then that was treacle. And if they would walk out with the"
00:26:03,00:26:06,bench stuck on their arse and they'd take your plaque to show you a license with them as they
00:26:06,00:26:12,"went. And it's a hooey. How interesting that that's not true. There were ale conners, but they tasted."
00:26:12,00:26:15,There are no contemporary sources on the time saying they sat in a pint. Makes no sense.
00:26:15,00:26:19,"Because if it's got sugar in it, you would be able to taste it, wouldn't you? Yeah."
00:26:19,00:26:25,"That's the test. Dave, Dave, why aren't you pouring it? No, no, this is how I do it."
00:26:25,00:26:30,"But no, it just tastes really sweet. It tastes like honey. No, no, I'm going to sit on it for half"
00:26:30,00:26:35,"an hour. Is this my tea or yours? No, no, it's got sugar in it. Sit on it and see. You've never"
00:26:35,00:26:39,"had that exchange, have you? No. And if the nail was strong enough, it could make something stick"
00:26:39,00:26:44,"to a table. Like, it's sticky. That's brilliant. That's a real exploding of a very niche QI myth,"
00:26:44,00:26:49,which is something we specialise in. Absolutely. I tried to find something interesting out about
00:26:49,00:26:53,"Theresa May's leather trousers, which for international listeners who don't keep a"
00:26:53,00:26:58,"hawk eye on British news, Theresa May, former Prime Minister wore some leather trousers famously"
00:26:58,00:27:03,in a photo shoot at 2016 and got in huge trouble for it. It's probably why she had to leave.
00:27:03,00:27:10,Because it was revealed that they'd cost £995 and also they would just noticeably
00:27:10,00:27:14,leather trousers. Yeah. And that was worth a lot more before Brexit as well.
00:27:14,00:27:22,And did you find anything? It was a very hard design. All I found out was that she really
00:27:22,00:27:28,"didn't want to wear them. And it was the director of communications, Fiona Hill, who you may well"
00:27:28,00:27:33,"remember, who insisted that Amanda Wakeley, the designer, send a van full of clothes to Downing"
00:27:33,00:27:39,Street and sort of squeaked her into these leather trousers. I'm imagining that scene in Ross from
00:27:39,00:27:45,"Friends, when he has to sort of pat flour down his legs. And yes, her other director of comms,"
00:27:45,00:27:48,"Katie Perry, said she didn't even like the bloody trousers. They were the wrong kind"
00:27:48,00:27:54,"of brown, if you know what I mean. Which I don't. No. But it was quite mad because Cameron did"
00:27:54,00:27:58,"habitually wear another male lead as to habitually wear things that cost £3,500. So when everyone"
00:27:58,00:28:03,"was demanding that she declare it, you know, have you declared this on your register of"
00:28:03,00:28:07,"interest? I imagine Rishi Sonak's wife, France, cost more than that. Yeah. Are they leather?"
00:28:07,00:28:10,Let's put in a freedom of information request and find out.
00:28:10,00:28:18,"He's at the press conference. He's answered all the big questions he goes to. Yeah,"
00:28:18,00:28:27,no such thing as a fish. That would be amazing if he could get into those junkets. Oh my God.
00:28:27,00:28:30,We've got to do that. How do you get into those junkets?
00:28:30,00:28:39,The Lederhosen has been banned from time to time in Germany. The church banned it during the 19th
00:28:39,00:28:48,"century revival of Lederhosen. What? And in 1913, the Munich Archbishop declared Lederhosen immoral."
00:28:48,00:28:53,"And they've got a Lederhosen scene in Peru as well. There's this tiny bit of Peru,"
00:28:53,00:28:57,"this village called Pozuzu, between the Andes and the Amazon. And it was set up by Austria"
00:28:57,00:29:03,"and German immigrants led by a priest called Joseph Egg. Hang on, you had another egg earlier?"
00:29:03,00:29:08,"Yeah, he did. Did I? Yeah, an egg name in your German article that you'd got Google to translate"
00:29:08,00:29:17,"for you. Oh yeah, Paul Eggiman, the master saddler. I am the Eggiman. Yeah. Anyway, so every year they"
00:29:17,00:29:23,"have Pozuzu Fest. So these Germans went over to South America, did they? Yes. Right, okay."
00:29:24,00:29:30,"As we said in the previous episode, when? 100 years before. Okay, okay. The unpleasantness."
00:29:30,00:29:35,"Although King Edward VIII wore Lederhosen on his honeymoon with Wallace Simpson,"
00:29:35,00:29:40,"where he went and met Hitler. Did he? On their honeymoon, they went off and had a meeting with"
00:29:40,00:29:45,"Hitler. It's very romantic, isn't it? It's every girl's dream. Yeah, foe of the podcast."
00:29:45,00:29:50,"They went to the Eagles Nest, which is that, you know, it's called Berchtesgaden. It's sort of"
00:29:50,00:29:56,Hitler's very high mountain alpine retreat. It does sound like a bit of a glamping situation. Maybe
00:29:56,00:30:03,"she thought when he said we're going to the Eagles Nest, I found it on Airbnb. She didn't quite"
00:30:03,00:30:17,"realise. Airy and BNB. Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is James. Okay, my fact this"
00:30:17,00:30:25,"week is that in 1963, a fire at the Curry Building was put out by a man called Bum Fatou."
00:30:25,00:30:28,"It was also started by him, though."
00:30:28,00:30:38,"He was just setting fire to his Fatou's. And no, this is a fact about Key West in Florida."
00:30:38,00:30:45,"And city? Yeah, it's a city. Yeah, it's the southernmost city in mainland America. I'm pretty"
00:30:45,00:30:52,"sure. I know because it's right at the tip of the Florida Keys. It is, you know what, the keys,"
00:30:52,00:30:56,"you can drive there. So it's kind of mainland, but the truth is there's lots of bridges,"
00:30:56,00:31:02,"because the keys are so close together. So they've been bridged all the way. Yeah, I've never been"
00:31:02,00:31:06,there. It sounds like an amazing bit of the world. It's great. It's really good. Let's talk about it
00:31:06,00:31:15,in a bit. So Bum Fatou was a major figure in 1960s Key West because he
00:31:15,00:31:23,"was a fire chief. Okay. And he was a friend, I believe, of Julio Dupu, who was one of the"
00:31:23,00:31:29,main surgeons in the town. But I thought his name was marginally funnier. So we'll talk about him.
00:31:29,00:31:35,But he was really good. And the reason I came across him actually is because there is a musical
00:31:35,00:31:40,that's been written about him called Bum Fatou the Musical. And it was written by Pamela Stevenson.
00:31:40,00:31:46,"Oh, yeah. Who is Billy Conley's wife. Yeah. And she's a writer. She's a shrink and a comedian."
00:31:46,00:31:49,"And she wrote a long route from sort of Rodgers and Hammerstein, hasn't it?"
00:31:49,00:31:54,We really run out of all the evidence. We've done Hamilton and we've done lots of other
00:31:54,00:32:04,"like key figures in American history. So he was the fire chief. He wore red suits, drove around in"
00:32:04,00:32:11,"a lime green Ford Galaxy, which had a Yoruba shrine on its hood, a Yoruba as in the Nigerian"
00:32:11,00:32:17,"religion. Yes, he was a practitioner, wasn't he? Yeah. Of the Yoruba religion. He called himself"
00:32:17,00:32:24,"El Jefe. El Jefe, if you want to give it this androcytes of pronunciation, which is more funny."
00:32:24,00:32:28,"Was that the chief? The chief, yes. Okay. I think he painted that on his car, didn't he?"
00:32:28,00:32:35,"Yeah, he had a license plate that said El Jefe. Yeah. And he eventually got done for selling drugs"
00:32:35,00:32:40,out of the fire department. That is tragic. Can I just ask about the Curry Factory fire?
00:32:40,00:32:44,"Oh, yeah. Do you know anything else about that? Yeah, I can tell you that it was owned by Mr. Curry,"
00:32:44,00:32:50,"whose name, have I written it down? So he didn't make Curry? Or did he have to be called Mr. Curry,"
00:32:50,00:32:54,"but it was a Curry factory as well? No, no, no, it wasn't a factory, it was Curry building."
00:32:55,00:33:02,"And he was Mr. Curry, and he was the first millionaire in Florida, and he was a wrecker."
00:33:02,00:33:09,"So a big thing in Key West back in the day is you would have people sort of sat on big towers,"
00:33:09,00:33:14,"and whenever a ship went past, if it wrecked, they would go wrecker high, wrecker high, and"
00:33:14,00:33:18,all the men would run out and try and get at the wreck. And then it was just like finders keepers?
00:33:18,00:33:22,"It was just finders keepers, and then they would have a big auction in Key West every month where"
00:33:22,00:33:26,they would sell everything that they got from the wrecks. Because that's very bad behavior wrecking.
00:33:26,00:33:31,"Well, it's bad behavior where you put the light up and you lure a ship onto the rocks. I think"
00:33:31,00:33:37,"actually most of that is relatively mythical. That's rare, isn't it? And I think that's really,"
00:33:37,00:33:41,"really different. That's like the difference between murdering someone and pickpocketing a dead body,"
00:33:41,00:33:45,and I think one is much worse than the other. Anna is really clear about the difference between
00:33:45,00:33:51,"those things. No, you're right, wrecking is sort of different to, yeah. I think that's all, the myths"
00:33:51,00:33:54,"about that are in Cornwall, aren't they? Yeah, but no, no, the myths are the same in Key West,"
00:33:54,00:33:59,"actually. Yeah, basically, in fact, if you read about wrecking in Cornwall and wrecking in Key West,"
00:33:59,00:34:03,"it's all the same stories. It's the same myths. It's the same, you know."
00:34:03,00:34:07,There must be quite a lot to mimic a lighthouse accurately if you don't have a lighthouse. Do
00:34:07,00:34:12,"you know what I mean? I've got a pretty good Halloween costume, actually. This is awesome."
00:34:12,00:34:17,"Just going around flashing people. Look, as a former subscriber to Lamp Magazine, I can assure"
00:34:17,00:34:23,"you that I've done my reading on this. Anyway, can we say why Fato was called Fato? Sorry, why"
00:34:23,00:34:27,"he was called Bum? Yeah, Fato was his actual name. Fato was his name, and his first name,"
00:34:27,00:34:31,"his birth name was Joseph Fato, and his parents probably thought, well, you know, it's an unfortunate"
00:34:31,00:34:36,"surname, but at least it can't get any worse. And then he loved fire from a young age, and he was"
00:34:36,00:34:40,"always hanging around the fire station, and he was known as the little bum, the American version,"
00:34:40,00:34:45,"meaning tramp, you know, or one friend reported that he was always bumming things, which again"
00:34:45,00:34:49,"shows the difference between American and British English. Oh, I don't know. You would say it can"
00:34:49,00:34:54,"have bummer's cigarette. Yeah. And he disappeared, didn't he? In the end, he vanished, and he was"
00:34:54,00:35:00,never found. He's somewhere with Lord Lucan and Elvis. And Chugha. Yeah. And Chugha at the party
00:35:00,00:35:05,"of the century. Because he was flogging drugs. Yes, and he got caught because he tried to sell it to"
00:35:05,00:35:12,"an undercover police officer, and then they arrested him, and then he was out on bail, and they thought"
00:35:12,00:35:18,"that probably he would go out to prison for a long, long, long, long time, or perhaps he would"
00:35:18,00:35:24,dob in the people who gave him the gear in the first place. Right. Because he had connections
00:35:24,00:35:33,with Cuba. So then he disappeared. Maybe he drove off and started a new life. Maybe the people who
00:35:33,00:35:38,"didn't want him to dob them in, might have dubbed him off. And there was a lot of stuff like that"
00:35:38,00:35:44,"going on. I mean, it was a very shady, gang-heavy world. And in fact, the person who dobbed him in,"
00:35:44,00:35:49,"who basically told this undercover agent to go and set him up, was a guy called Titus Rudolph"
00:35:49,00:35:53,"Walters. And he convinced the undercover agent, who was a guy called Larry Dollar,"
00:35:53,00:35:57,who I quite like. Larry Dollar. Larry? Everyone in the story has a great name.
00:35:57,00:36:03,"They do. Titus Walters is a good name. Larry Dollar. But Titus, before the deal even happened,"
00:36:03,00:36:09,"where Faso was set up by Larry Dollar, Titus, who dobbed him in, was brutally murdered. And I"
00:36:09,00:36:13,ended up reading this description of his murder. And it was extraordinary. He was like the Rasputin
00:36:13,00:36:18,"of his time. He was murdered by, you know, other gang people who shot him in the head multiple"
00:36:18,00:36:21,"times. He just wouldn't die. He was like crawling out of the bathroom. Eventually,"
00:36:21,00:36:25,they had to inject him with heroin and drain cleaner to kill him off.
00:36:25,00:36:29,"Lorx, were you just reading it to make sure that somebody had been through his pockets?"
00:36:32,00:36:39,Yeah. A few good things that Faso did when he was fire chief. He installed a system which turned
00:36:39,00:36:44,all the traffic lights near the fire station on green with a push of a button. That's fantastic.
00:36:44,00:36:46,"No, that sounds incredibly dangerous. Wait, all of them are the ones..."
00:36:46,00:36:53,All of the ones that he needed to go to to get to the main road. That's brilliant.
00:36:53,00:36:58,"There's only like one main road in Key West, really. That's really clever. That's a really good idea."
00:36:58,00:37:03,"Yeah. Well, he did it. I bet he used it bit nefariously sometimes. He's late for a date."
00:37:03,00:37:08,Do modern fire engines have that capacity to turn? I don't think so. I don't know if you just turn
00:37:08,00:37:12,"the sirens and go through red lights, don't they? Yeah, I think you're right."
00:37:12,00:37:18,But he also had a hotline to his home phone that required no dialing. So if he was at home and
00:37:18,00:37:22,"there was a fire, someone could just press one button like the bat phone, the Fato phone."
00:37:24,00:37:30,"The Fato phone is a completely different prank toy. Instead of a spotlight into the sky,"
00:37:30,00:37:35,"it's just they play the noise of a huge guff over Key West. No, he hears it."
00:37:35,00:37:42,"He stops flogging cocaine to a student and says, ""I must go."" He runs into a phone box and he pulls"
00:37:42,00:37:48,"on the Fato costume. I think, do you know what? He would be 104 years old now and part of me does"
00:37:48,00:37:52,"hope maybe he's still out there somewhere. Oh, me too. Right, you know? There's a weird..."
00:37:52,00:37:53,Listening to this show.
00:37:53,00:38:00,There's a weird coincidence about him or just like a weird collision of histories
00:38:00,00:38:04,"where his parents owned a restaurant in Key West, which is called Victoria,"
00:38:04,00:38:09,"and they sold it to a guy called Joe Russell, who was mates with Ernest Hemingway,"
00:38:09,00:38:16,who'd recently come from Cuba. So Ernest Hemingway has come from Cuba. He visits this restaurant
00:38:16,00:38:19,that's just been sold by Bum Fato's family. Right.
00:38:19,00:38:22,"And he says, ""You know what? You should call this place Sloppy Joe's,"
00:38:22,00:38:25,"because that's the name of a place that I used to go to in Havana."" Oh."
00:38:25,00:38:29,And that is now incredibly iconic Sloppy Joe's. Is that still... I've been there.
00:38:29,00:38:32,"And have you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been to the Sloppy Joe's."
00:38:32,00:38:35,"Of course, yeah. Well, there you go. That was named suggested by Ernest Hemingway. No."
00:38:35,00:38:41,"And it's this iconic bar. And in fact, once it changed lodgings because the rents were massively"
00:38:41,00:38:45,increased and so it moved across the road. But the bar never closed when it moved.
00:38:45,00:38:49,The people just picked up their drinks as they moved venue and walked across the road.
00:38:49,00:38:54,That's very good. That's brilliant. That's commitment to your customers.
00:38:54,00:38:56,That's fantastic. A few other good things that Fato did.
00:38:56,00:39:00,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll just quickly say. So he ordered the replacement"
00:39:00,00:39:06,"of all foam mattresses in the jails, because if there was a fire, he knew they would release cyanide."
00:39:06,00:39:09,So they were really dangerous. So he got rid of all the foam mattresses.
00:39:09,00:39:13,And obviously the irony of that is the likelihood was that he would have ended up on one of these
00:39:13,00:39:18,"mattresses, you know, when he got arrested. See, if it had been Haldane, Haldane would have"
00:39:18,00:39:22,delighted in setting fire to one of the mattresses while he lay on it.
00:39:22,00:39:29,Delicious cyanide. And the other thing was that he was like the unofficial welcome for Cuban Exiles.
00:39:29,00:39:34,"So a lot of people will leave in Cuba at the time because Castro had just come in, right?"
00:39:34,00:39:39,So he would provide food and accommodation just for the first couple of days when you arrived
00:39:39,00:39:42,in Key West and then maybe even sort you out with a job and stuff like that.
00:39:42,00:39:47,"That's interesting. Yeah, it's very close. In fact, I think is it closer to Cuba than it is to Miami?"
00:39:47,00:39:52,"It's close to Cuba. It's harder to drive, I could say that much."
00:39:52,00:39:55,"You'd need a sort of subterranean Haldane designed car, yeah."
00:39:55,00:39:58,"The road down that you drove along, James, it used to be a train."
00:39:58,00:40:04,"Yeah, you can see it, actually. I think there are still some bits of railway, I think, I think so."
00:40:04,00:40:08,"It was called Flagler's Folly, because it was Henry Flagler, who was a millionaire,"
00:40:08,00:40:12,"and he had this vision of a railway all the way down to Key West,"
00:40:12,00:40:15,"all the way through the Florida Keys, all the bridges that you drive over now."
00:40:15,00:40:18,And it was his life's work. It took $50 million of his money.
00:40:18,00:40:21,It nearly killed him. He finally saw it open the year before he died.
00:40:21,00:40:26,"And in fact, he had gone blind by then. He was in his 80s by the time it opened."
00:40:26,00:40:29,"And he couldn't see his life's achievement,"
00:40:29,00:40:34,"but he could hear as he arrived on the train at Key West, the children of Key West cheering"
00:40:34,00:40:40,as he stepped off the train. And he was weeping at emotion at this amazing achievement.
00:40:40,00:40:42,"Did you know the, I learned something about Miami, which I didn't know,"
00:40:42,00:40:44,which was very interesting in the course of this.
00:40:44,00:40:49,So the only reason he could bring the railroad down to Florida Keys all the way down
00:40:49,00:40:54,"was because it had extended down to Miami. But there was a woman called Julia Tuttle,"
00:40:54,00:41:01,who lived on what became Miami in the 1890s. And she really wanted to improve her business standing.
00:41:01,00:41:05,"So she owned a few hundred acres of land. She wanted the railroad to come down there,"
00:41:05,00:41:09,"because obviously that's very useful commercially. And she wrote to him saying,"
00:41:09,00:41:12,"bring your railway down here, bring it down here. And he said, no, can't be bothered."
00:41:12,00:41:13,She invented Disneyland.
00:41:13,00:41:19,"Well, Dan, she's not quite that cool. But she did, the story goes,"
00:41:19,00:41:25,"sent him during the Great Frost of 1894, some flowering orange blossom from South in Miami,"
00:41:25,00:41:31,"saying, look, our fields are so fertile, even though it's so cold, that it's a great place to,"
00:41:31,00:41:36,"you know, set up shop. And he eventually was persuaded to build the railway down there."
00:41:36,00:41:40,And therefore Miami is the only city of any note in America founded by a woman.
00:41:40,00:41:43,"So she's, she's the founder of Miami. I did not know that."
00:41:43,00:41:46,"No, but she didn't make Disneyland. So what's the point?"
00:41:46,00:41:50,"I read this website. I got to say it was, it was fun facts about Key West."
00:41:50,00:41:56,"Look, just judge for yourselves. At one point, about 10% of Key West's population was chickens."
00:41:56,00:41:59,"Okay. Okay, that's all right. They've got wild chickens. All right, well, all right, here's another."
00:41:59,00:42:02,"I want to know what population they're counting, are they counting the insects?"
00:42:02,00:42:04,"Because when they're saying 10% of its population,"
00:42:04,00:42:06,you've got a good point. Are they covering all animals at that point?
00:42:06,00:42:09,You can't just include humans and chickens. You can't.
00:42:09,00:42:11,The bacteriophages. What about them?
00:42:11,00:42:17,"Okay. All right, I've got two more fun facts from the same website for you."
00:42:17,00:42:20,Key West was a major hub for salt production in the 1800s.
00:42:20,00:42:22,Okay. That is fine.
00:42:22,00:42:23,I'm feeling the fun. Because it's near the sea.
00:42:23,00:42:25,"Yeah, I guess. I'm feeling the fun draining away a bit."
00:42:25,00:42:27,"All right, here's, here's the Nadel of the Coffin."
00:42:27,00:42:31,Key West is home to the largest historical district of wooden structures
00:42:31,00:42:36,on the U.S. Department of the Interior's National Register of Historic Places.
00:42:36,00:42:37,"Wow. Dan, wake up."
00:42:37,00:42:44,"The sad thing is, I know how excited you are about that fact, Andy."
00:42:44,00:42:45,"Yeah, I mean, that's, that's mega."
00:42:45,00:42:49,"Well, a lot of the wooden structures would have been lookouts for wreckers as well."
00:42:49,00:42:51,"Because they built, there's, I think there are some that are still there,"
00:42:51,00:42:54,"although they might be reproductions, but they're just like,"
00:42:54,00:42:59,"if you can imagine like a 30-foot building, but it's just like slats of wood,"
00:42:59,00:43:01,almost like in the shape of a lighthouse.
00:43:01,00:43:03,I'm thinking of an umpire's chair.
00:43:03,00:43:04,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:04,00:43:05,Like a bigger version of that.
00:43:05,00:43:09,"Like that, but with a big sort of flat top, which you can stand on."
00:43:09,00:43:09,That's cool.
00:43:09,00:43:12,"Although they do have one of those in Low Sugarloaf Key,"
00:43:12,00:43:15,"which is one of the Florida Keys, which isn't one of those."
00:43:15,00:43:17,"It is a similar looking structure,"
00:43:17,00:43:21,but it used to be filled with ground-up female bat genitals.
00:43:21,00:43:26,"This, firstly, grim, and second, sorry, just want to say that."
00:43:26,00:43:28,"Secondly, is it to lure in male bats?"
00:43:28,00:43:29,Is it a bat trap?
00:43:29,00:43:30,"Oh my God, you've got it."
00:43:30,00:43:31,Andy's got it.
00:43:31,00:43:32,And why do you want a bat trap?
00:43:32,00:43:34,You've got too many bats.
00:43:34,00:43:35,"No, no, you want more bats."
00:43:35,00:43:35,You want more?
00:43:35,00:43:36,"Oh, you're a bat farmer."
00:43:36,00:43:38,"Um, no, there's a mosquito problem."
00:43:38,00:43:41,There was a mosquito problem in the 1920s.
00:43:41,00:43:44,So a chap called Richard Clyde Percy read a book
00:43:44,00:43:46,about how to get bats to kill mosquitoes.
00:43:46,00:43:49,"Wrote to the guy who wrote the book, said, ""How do I do this?"""
00:43:49,00:43:53,"And he said, ""Build a tower, fill it with ground-up female bat genitals."""
00:43:53,00:43:54,What do they have to be ground up?
00:43:54,00:43:57,Can you just put female bats in the tower with that?
00:43:57,00:43:59,You've got to have the ground up.
00:43:59,00:44:01,Maybe it's easier to source ground-up genitals.
00:44:01,00:44:03,That's so weird.
00:44:03,00:44:05,"I guess without being ground up, the female bats can maybe fly away,"
00:44:05,00:44:08,"whereas in this way, when they're ground, they're genital ground up."
00:44:08,00:44:10,I presume you've killed the whole bat.
00:44:10,00:44:11,And you've had to take--
00:44:11,00:44:12,And you've had to--
00:44:12,00:44:13,But why not just grind up the whole--
00:44:13,00:44:14,Is it to lure male bats?
00:44:14,00:44:17,"Yes, and the male bats come and they eat all the mosquitoes."
00:44:17,00:44:19,So it's only the male bats that eat the mosquitoes?
00:44:19,00:44:22,"No, I think just that's the only way you can lure bats."
00:44:22,00:44:25,"Yeah, the males are probably more likely to be like,"
00:44:25,00:44:27,"""Well, I can smell female genitals."
00:44:27,00:44:30,"They might be not attached to a bat anymore or ground up,"
00:44:30,00:44:32,"but beggars can't be cheesed."""
00:44:32,00:44:33,Give it a go.
00:44:33,00:44:42,"Okay, it's time for our final fact, and that is Dan's fact."
00:44:42,00:44:45,Should we get him to send it as a voicemail?
00:44:45,00:44:47,And I'll play it in.
00:44:47,00:44:47,That's a good idea.
00:44:47,00:44:49,That's a great idea. Let's do that now.
00:44:50,00:44:53,"My fact this week is that for over two decades,"
00:44:53,00:44:57,the actors Grace Kelly and Alec Guinness secretly hit a tomahawk
00:44:57,00:45:00,in each other's hotel rooms around the world.
00:45:00,00:45:05,"Well, great fact, Dan."
00:45:05,00:45:06,I've got loads of questions about it.
00:45:06,00:45:07,"Yeah, tell us more."
00:45:07,00:45:09,Who's Grace Kelly?
00:45:09,00:45:13,"Actually, I didn't look into Dan's fact,"
00:45:13,00:45:15,"and sorry to peel back the curtain for a second,"
00:45:15,00:45:17,he's still not here live in the room.
00:45:17,00:45:19,So I'm not sure exactly what happened with this story.
00:45:19,00:45:21,"No, I'm not either. Did you, Andy?"
00:45:21,00:45:22,"Yes, thankfully I did."
00:45:22,00:45:22,"That was good, wasn't it?"
00:45:22,00:45:25,"Because I went and read Alec Guinness's memoir,"
00:45:25,00:45:26,and so it's a story he told.
00:45:26,00:45:29,"Basically, he was making this film called The Swan,"
00:45:29,00:45:30,and Grace Kelly was in it too.
00:45:30,00:45:33,"And if you don't know who Alec Guinness and Grace Kelly are,"
00:45:33,00:45:34,they're two of the greats.
00:45:34,00:45:35,That's all we need to say.
00:45:35,00:45:36,The greatest actors ever.
00:45:36,00:45:36,Brilliant.
00:45:36,00:45:39,"And Alec Guinness, he got given this tomahawk"
00:45:39,00:45:42,"by some Native Americans who were also involved in the filming,"
00:45:42,00:45:43,and it was massive.
00:45:43,00:45:45,"It was a kind of, it wasn't a prop, it was a proper thing."
00:45:45,00:45:46,"And it was really heavy,"
00:45:46,00:45:48,and he didn't want to take it at the end of the job.
00:45:48,00:45:51,"So he asked Hotel Porter, as he was leaving,"
00:45:51,00:45:52,"you know, going off to the next job, whatever,"
00:45:52,00:45:55,to slip it into Grace Kelly's bed as a kind of joke.
00:45:55,00:45:56,"You know, it's a sort of silly thing,"
00:45:56,00:45:57,"because she would have known it was his,"
00:45:57,00:45:59,because she'd seen him do it.
00:45:59,00:46:00,"And then a few years after that,"
00:46:00,00:46:02,he came home from a performance in London.
00:46:02,00:46:04,"He was doing a lot of theatre at the time,"
00:46:04,00:46:05,and he found it in his bed.
00:46:05,00:46:07,"And done, done, done."
00:46:07,00:46:09,And she had found a way somehow to smuggle it into his bed.
00:46:09,00:46:11,I don't know if she ever told her end of the story.
00:46:11,00:46:11,"Oh, that's great."
00:46:11,00:46:13,"He waits a few more years,"
00:46:13,00:46:17,and then he finds out that she's doing a project in the USA
00:46:17,00:46:20,"with someone who he doesn't know, actually."
00:46:20,00:46:23,"And he gets in contact via a third party of the,"
00:46:23,00:46:25,"I think, the poet she was doing this work with."
00:46:25,00:46:26,She was traveling over this poet.
00:46:26,00:46:28,"And he gets in contact via a third party,"
00:46:28,00:46:30,"so her companion can honestly say,"
00:46:30,00:46:32,"""No, I've never met or spoken to Alec Guinness."""
00:46:32,00:46:33,"So he really goes to a length,"
00:46:33,00:46:36,and then he gets it back into her bed that way.
00:46:36,00:46:37,But wait a minute.
00:46:37,00:46:39,"Like, that does seem a bit pointless,"
00:46:39,00:46:40,because is she going around her whole life
00:46:40,00:46:43,just checking that everyone doesn't know Alec Guinness?
00:46:43,00:46:45,She only hangs around with people who don't know Alec Guinness.
00:46:45,00:46:47,"After she's found it in her bed,"
00:46:47,00:46:50,"she comes downstairs the next morning and says to the poet,"
00:46:50,00:46:51,"""You don't know Alec Guinness at all, do you?"""
00:46:51,00:46:53,"And he can honestly say,"
00:46:53,00:46:54,"""No, I've never met Alec Guinness."""
00:46:54,00:46:55,"But he did, it was,"
00:46:55,00:46:57,and then eventually he goes to Hollywood in 1979
00:46:57,00:46:58,to receive an Oscar.
00:46:58,00:47:00,And what does he find in his bed?
00:47:00,00:47:03,"Grace Kelly, no, he finds the tomahawk in his bed."
00:47:03,00:47:07,"And yeah, so that was a long-running good Hollywood prank."
00:47:07,00:47:09,And then one of them murdered the other with the tomahawk.
00:47:09,00:47:09,That's right.
00:47:09,00:47:11,"That's famous, yeah."
00:47:11,00:47:13,Grace Kelly died tragically.
00:47:13,00:47:15,"I think she did die,"
00:47:15,00:47:16,"because I didn't read the whole story,"
00:47:16,00:47:19,"but it skimmed it, and she did die, A."
00:47:19,00:47:21,And she died without ever being acknowledged.
00:47:21,00:47:23,So I think that's this really weird thing that's left hanging.
00:47:23,00:47:25,Her and Alec Guinness never discussed that.
00:47:25,00:47:27,"No, they never mentioned it to each other."
00:47:27,00:47:28,"She died in the car crash, didn't she?"
00:47:28,00:47:30,"Yeah, I think in the early '80s."
00:47:30,00:47:33,"She was still very young, she was in her 50s at the time."
00:47:33,00:47:35,But she died a princess.
00:47:35,00:47:36,She did.
00:47:36,00:47:39,In many ways we all die princesses.
00:47:39,00:47:39,"Oh, is that right?"
00:47:39,00:47:42,"In many ways we all die a pauper,"
00:47:42,00:47:43,because you can't take it with you.
00:47:43,00:47:44,Pretty good point.
00:47:44,00:47:46,"Well, she died in an incredibly wealthy princess."
00:47:46,00:47:50,"So yeah, she was the princess of Monica."
00:47:50,00:47:53,"Yeah, some listeners will remember maybe."
00:47:53,00:47:56,"Some, few listeners."
00:47:56,00:47:59,"She married Prince Rainier of Monica, Rainier than here."
00:47:59,00:48:02,"It's actually a lot drier, I would suspect, in Monica."
00:48:02,00:48:04,"Yeah, not as rainy."
00:48:04,00:48:09,"And she was 26, which means that her Hollywood career,"
00:48:09,00:48:12,"the grand total of five years, maximum, I believe."
00:48:12,00:48:14,"Yeah, she was in 11 movies, I think."
00:48:14,00:48:16,"Because he forced her to stop, basically."
00:48:16,00:48:18,"Yeah, although I think she was up for it, wasn't she?"
00:48:18,00:48:19,She was keen to retire.
00:48:19,00:48:22,"In fact, do you know why, one of the explanations she gave for why she left?"
00:48:22,00:48:24,"Suez, the Suez crisis."
00:48:24,00:48:26,She didn't like wearing socks.
00:48:26,00:48:28,"Yeah, I've been wearing socks 26 years, that's long enough."
00:48:28,00:48:31,"She said, ""When I first came to Hollywood five years ago,"
00:48:31,00:48:34,my makeup call was at 8am.
00:48:34,00:48:36,I'll be God damned if I'm going to stay in the business
00:48:36,00:48:38,where I have to get up earlier and earlier
00:48:38,00:48:40,"and it takes longer and longer to get me in front of the camera."""
00:48:40,00:48:42,"I think saying, ""As she gets older and older,"
00:48:42,00:48:44,she's going to have to come in earlier and earlier
00:48:44,00:48:45,"to get the makeup with me."""
00:48:45,00:48:47,"That's very funny, I see that point, yeah."
00:48:47,00:48:49,"I thought you'd empathize, James, with that a bit."
00:48:49,00:48:52,"Well, because I'm allergic to makeup, pretty much."
00:48:52,00:48:54,"And, you know, you're used to a lion."
00:48:54,00:48:56,Because you have to get in at 6am every day
00:48:56,00:48:59,for extensive hair and makeup before the board.
00:48:59,00:49:01,I thought you were talking about yesterday we did some filming
00:49:01,00:49:03,and I was wearing makeup and just came out in...
00:49:03,00:49:04,No.
00:49:04,00:49:04,Sobbing.
00:49:04,00:49:06,"Yeah, if you see the film, we sound chivalrous,"
00:49:06,00:49:08,but James is streaming from his eyes.
00:49:08,00:49:09,"Well, that's working with you, Anna."
00:49:09,00:49:10,That's so...
00:49:10,00:49:13,"I blame it on the makeup, yeah."
00:49:13,00:49:14,"No, I think he did forced his retire"
00:49:14,00:49:17,because he also banned any showing of her movies in Monaco.
00:49:17,00:49:19,"Well, I heard that, but I also heard that"
00:49:19,00:49:21,she was in the middle of a big contract with MGM.
00:49:21,00:49:24,"You know, you sign up to these seven films and all of that."
00:49:24,00:49:26,"And I think the deal, part of the deal was that"
00:49:26,00:49:28,"she would be freed from the contract,"
00:49:28,00:49:29,"she didn't have to make any more movies,"
00:49:29,00:49:31,but the wedding was filmed and broadcast
00:49:31,00:49:33,to 30 million people and it was in cinemas.
00:49:33,00:49:34,"Yeah, that was a million people,"
00:49:34,00:49:37,like half the population of the UK that is at that time.
00:49:37,00:49:39,"There were nearly 2,000 journalists at the wedding."
00:49:39,00:49:43,"Yeah, but not many like Kings or Queens of Europe were there."
00:49:43,00:49:45,Because they all kind of disagreed with it
00:49:45,00:49:47,because it was a royal marrying of plebeian.
00:49:47,00:49:50,"So, yeah, a lot of the royals got invited,"
00:49:50,00:49:51,but none of them went.
00:49:51,00:49:53,"Wow, that's interesting."
00:49:53,00:49:55,"Because it was a very much an arranged marriage,"
00:49:55,00:49:57,"it seems like, as in it was,"
00:49:57,00:49:59,I believe it was suggested to Arania
00:49:59,00:50:01,that he find a Hollywood star to marry
00:50:01,00:50:03,because they wanted to increase tourism
00:50:03,00:50:05,since the war people had stopped going.
00:50:05,00:50:06,"That's right. And the person who suggested it,"
00:50:06,00:50:07,did you see that?
00:50:07,00:50:09,Aristotle Onassis.
00:50:09,00:50:11,"Oh, yes, the ship guy."
00:50:11,00:50:12,"Greek shipping magnate, again,"
00:50:12,00:50:13,"crazy name, crazy guy."
00:50:13,00:50:15,Later husband of Jackie Kennedy.
00:50:15,00:50:17,"Jackie Kennedy, yes."
00:50:17,00:50:18,I believe his yacht had
00:50:18,00:50:20,barstools made out of Wales foreskins.
00:50:20,00:50:21,That's correct.
00:50:21,00:50:24,"Oh, so he didn't have taste, all right."
00:50:24,00:50:28,There were female whales were flocking to his ship.
00:50:28,00:50:31,Grace Kelly's story is very interesting
00:50:31,00:50:33,because it's kind of a riches to riches story.
00:50:33,00:50:34,"Like, she grew up really wealthy."
00:50:34,00:50:37,Her father was a brick magnate called Jack Kelly.
00:50:37,00:50:39,"He was amazing, actually."
00:50:39,00:50:40,He was an Olympic gold medalist
00:50:40,00:50:42,"and her mother was a competitive swimmer,"
00:50:42,00:50:43,Grace Kelly's mum.
00:50:43,00:50:45,"So very athletic, be honest,"
00:50:45,00:50:47,the entire family worked stunningly good-looking.
00:50:47,00:50:48,"You know, it was not surprising"
00:50:48,00:50:49,that she became a Hollywood star.
00:50:49,00:50:51,"He was a rower, wasn't he?"
00:50:51,00:50:53,That's why he got his meddling.
00:50:53,00:50:56,"And she said once someone asked her,"
00:50:56,00:50:58,"""Grace Kelly, would you write an autobiography?"""
00:50:58,00:50:59,"And she said, ""No, but I would like"
00:50:59,00:51:00,"to write a biography of my father."""
00:51:00,00:51:06,"And in 1920, he wanted to be in the Henley Regatta,"
00:51:06,00:51:09,which is a big posh rowing competition in the UK.
00:51:09,00:51:11,"But he was banned because in those days,"
00:51:11,00:51:15,"anyone who was a mechanic, artisan, or labourer,"
00:51:15,00:51:17,or works in any menial activity
00:51:17,00:51:19,was not allowed to take part in the Henley Regatta.
00:51:19,00:51:20,Really? Really? Absolutely.
00:51:20,00:51:22,Was that a sort of class barrier?
00:51:22,00:51:23,"Yes, it was."
00:51:23,00:51:25,"But it, well, it was."
00:51:25,00:51:26,"Sounds like what, as opposed to like,"
00:51:26,00:51:28,you don't want them to take the time off their job.
00:51:28,00:51:28,Well...
00:51:28,00:51:29,What if someone's plumbing doesn't get fixed?
00:51:29,00:51:31,"Well, according to them,"
00:51:31,00:51:33,it was because they wanted it to be amateur.
00:51:33,00:51:36,"And if you had a job as a bricklayer,"
00:51:36,00:51:38,then you were technically a professional.
00:51:38,00:51:39,It's unfair.
00:51:39,00:51:42,It's actually cheating to have big muscles from your work.
00:51:42,00:51:45,Only softies who've been spent their whole lives
00:51:45,00:51:47,"punting so far, reading a little bit of Tennyson."
00:51:47,00:51:48,"Yeah, yeah."
00:51:48,00:51:51,"So, obviously, it was class-based,"
00:51:51,00:51:53,but he was very annoyed about it.
00:51:53,00:51:55,"But in the same year, there was an Olympics,"
00:51:55,00:51:58,and he won his Olympic rowing medal.
00:51:58,00:52:02,"And apparently, he mailed his cap to King George V,"
00:52:02,00:52:05,"with a note saying, ""Greetings from a bricklayer."""
00:52:05,00:52:06,Nice slam.
00:52:06,00:52:07,"If that got to George V,"
00:52:07,00:52:09,"and if George V had any idea what,"
00:52:09,00:52:13,who's the random American brick dude?
00:52:13,00:52:15,"And then in 2003,"
00:52:15,00:52:18,the Princess Grace Kelly Challenge Cup
00:52:18,00:52:19,"was launched by the role regatta,"
00:52:19,00:52:22,"which was in memory of Grace Kelly,"
00:52:22,00:52:24,"but also in memory of John Kelly,"
00:52:24,00:52:26,who they had snubbed all those years earlier.
00:52:26,00:52:27,Wow.
00:52:27,00:52:29,"I read he was nicknamed,"
00:52:29,00:52:31,"""The most perfectly formed American male,"""
00:52:31,00:52:33,which is quite an accolade to have.
00:52:33,00:52:34,Sexy.
00:52:34,00:52:35,Yeah.
00:52:35,00:52:36,"That is, that's impressive, you know."
00:52:36,00:52:37,It's because it's quite a high bar.
00:52:37,00:52:40,It's not like the most well-formed man in-
00:52:40,00:52:45,"It's interesting, isn't it?"
00:52:45,00:52:47,Becoming a princess is such an odd thing.
00:52:47,00:52:47,"Like, what have you done?"
00:52:47,00:52:48,"Oh, I've won an Oscar."
00:52:48,00:52:51,"Oh, well, I've secured the Grimaldi succession,"
00:52:51,00:52:53,"actually, because the current Monaco prince"
00:52:53,00:52:54,"is her son, Albert."
00:52:54,00:52:55,Yeah.
00:52:55,00:52:57,"And the reason they were so desperate to find her,"
00:52:57,00:52:59,"as you sort of allude to,"
00:52:59,00:53:00,"is that if he didn't have a son,"
00:53:00,00:53:03,I think the monarchy would have not existed.
00:53:03,00:53:03,They needed a child.
00:53:03,00:53:04,They needed a son.
00:53:04,00:53:06,So they had to take fertility tests.
00:53:06,00:53:07,She had to be properly tested
00:53:07,00:53:10,to check that she could have a children.
00:53:10,00:53:12,"She also had to have a virginity test,"
00:53:12,00:53:13,but it wasn't taken very seriously.
00:53:13,00:53:14,It wasn't a...
00:53:14,00:53:15,"It can't be, Grace Kelly."
00:53:15,00:53:16,Grace Kelly did.
00:53:16,00:53:19,"And she would absolutely have flunked that,"
00:53:19,00:53:21,"because she'd had a love life before, you know."
00:53:21,00:53:23,She had lots of boyfriends and things like that.
00:53:23,00:53:25,Was it like a written test?
00:53:25,00:53:27,Like a driving theory test?
00:53:27,00:53:29,Was it like that?
00:53:29,00:53:30,Have you ever shagged anyone?
00:53:30,00:53:32,"Yeah, I think it was a formality,"
00:53:32,00:53:35,rather than a rigidly observed thing.
00:53:35,00:53:36,"But I mean, still weird, you know."
00:53:36,00:53:37,Gosh.
00:53:37,00:53:37,Alec Guinness.
00:53:37,00:53:39,"No one ever gave him a virginity test,"
00:53:39,00:53:40,as far as I can tell.
00:53:40,00:53:41,Alec Guinness?
00:53:41,00:53:41,Yeah.
00:53:41,00:53:42,"No, as far as I know."
00:53:42,00:53:47,He was called Alec Stephen until he was 14.
00:53:47,00:53:49,"And then someone just said,"
00:53:49,00:53:50,"""Oh, you're not called Alec Stephen."
00:53:50,00:53:51,"You're called Alec Guinness."""
00:53:51,00:53:55,"What was his middle name from, I think, his mum?"
00:53:55,00:53:58,His mother married David Daniel Stephen.
00:53:59,00:54:03,So he was given his stepfather's name in day-to-day life.
00:54:03,00:54:07,"But on the birth certificate, he was actually Alec Guinness."
00:54:07,00:54:09,"But it was only when he was 14 that his mum just said to him,"
00:54:09,00:54:11,"""Oh, by the way, that's not your name."
00:54:11,00:54:12,The thing that everyone's been calling you
00:54:12,00:54:13,"for the last 14 years."""
00:54:13,00:54:14,That's not your name.
00:54:14,00:54:15,You know this beer that everyone likes?
00:54:15,00:54:16,"What is that, instead?"
00:54:16,00:54:19,"We spoke earlier about how, Andy,"
00:54:19,00:54:21,we were wondering whether you would be friends with Haldane.
00:54:21,00:54:22,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:54:22,00:54:25,Whether it might be a bit much for you.
00:54:25,00:54:27,I hate sort of all the experiments and all the sign language.
00:54:27,00:54:28,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:54:28,00:54:30,I probably would not see him a lot socially.
00:54:30,00:54:33,"Well, Alec Guinness, according to the"
00:54:33,00:54:34,"Dictionary of National Biography,"
00:54:34,00:54:36,was a stickler for punctuality
00:54:36,00:54:37,and for good service in restaurants
00:54:37,00:54:39,of which he was a connoisseur.
00:54:39,00:54:41,"He hated change, which, in his opinion,"
00:54:41,00:54:43,was almost always for the worse.
00:54:43,00:54:46,"And he hated any assaults on the English language,"
00:54:46,00:54:48,particularly those said on the BBC.
00:54:48,00:54:51,Why are you assuming anything about
00:54:51,00:54:53,how we would have clearly been the best of friends?
00:54:53,00:54:55,"I mean, we wouldn't have spoken much,"
00:54:55,00:54:57,but we would have approved of each other.
00:54:57,00:54:58,"Yeah, yeah, a silent nod."
00:54:58,00:54:59,"In the street, yeah."
00:54:59,00:55:02,"It is weird, isn't it, that the thing he hated most of all"
00:55:02,00:55:04,is the thing that now he's best remembered for.
00:55:04,00:55:06,"Like most widely, you know,"
00:55:06,00:55:08,you can talk about The Bridge on the River Quay
00:55:08,00:55:10,"or you can talk about kind hearts and coronets,"
00:55:10,00:55:12,"but he's best remembered for Star Wars,"
00:55:12,00:55:14,which he thought was basically a film for children.
00:55:14,00:55:17,"And which made him rich, quite rich."
00:55:17,00:55:19,"You know, he got 2% of the profits."
00:55:19,00:55:21,"It must have been very rich, I imagine."
00:55:21,00:55:23,"It's a bit mealy-mouth, isn't it?"
00:55:23,00:55:25,"He would always say how bad the dialogue was,"
00:55:25,00:55:27,and he was getting millions and millions from it.
00:55:27,00:55:30,He claims he was taxed very heavily on those proceeds.
00:55:30,00:55:31,"So really, once it all that was over,"
00:55:31,00:55:33,"he got tough and safe in it, you know."
00:55:33,00:55:34,"Yeah, yeah."
00:55:34,00:55:36,But he was embarrassed.
00:55:36,00:55:39,"Harrison Ford kept calling him Mother Superior on set,"
00:55:39,00:55:41,and he felt very old and out of touch.
00:55:41,00:55:44,"It was the thing that everyone really knew him for,"
00:55:44,00:55:46,and people started to treat him as a kind of agony
00:55:46,00:55:50,"aren't for it, because Obi-Wan Kenobi is a kind of wise being."
00:55:50,00:55:51,I've only seen Star Wars once.
00:55:51,00:55:53,"I think he's like a wise man, right?"
00:55:53,00:55:54,I reckon he must be.
00:55:54,00:55:56,"He wears a cloak, doesn't he?"
00:55:56,00:55:57,"Yeah, he's wise."
00:55:57,00:55:59,There's no one who wears a cloak who isn't wise.
00:55:59,00:55:59,No.
00:55:59,00:56:00,There you go.
00:56:00,00:56:03,Please write in with your examples of people who aren't.
00:56:03,00:56:05,"But yeah, people used to write to him and say,"
00:56:05,00:56:06,"""Please, can you give me advice on this?"""
00:56:06,00:56:09,"He said, ""An example of a request I would typically get,"""
00:56:09,00:56:11,"so there's an interview, is, you know,"
00:56:11,00:56:12,"a married couple wrote to me once saying,"
00:56:12,00:56:14,"""We're having problems in our relationship."
00:56:14,00:56:16,"Can you come and live with us and sort them out for us, please?"""
00:56:16,00:56:19,"Oh, my God, that's a proposition, though, isn't it?"
00:56:19,00:56:22,"Yeah, that's a bit of a gotschfinger vibes, isn't it?"
00:56:22,00:56:25,"The thing is, if you've played Hamlet, Shiloh, Macbeth, you know,"
00:56:25,00:56:26,"and then you've played Obi-Wan,"
00:56:26,00:56:29,"you must feel a bit like you've slummed it, you know,"
00:56:29,00:56:31,because he was one of the great classical stage actors
00:56:31,00:56:31,of the 20th century.
00:56:31,00:56:33,"Like, he took it really, really, really seriously."
00:56:33,00:56:34,He did.
00:56:34,00:56:35,"His art, you know."
00:56:35,00:56:36,"Well, as many people say,"
00:56:36,00:56:38,not as good a stage actor as the true great.
00:56:38,00:56:41,"A level below the Olivier's and the Gilgames, according to some."
00:56:41,00:56:42,"Oh, wow."
00:56:42,00:56:42,This is great.
00:56:42,00:56:43,This is the slam.
00:56:43,00:56:44,"Oh, my goodness."
00:56:44,00:56:45,Sick burn.
00:56:45,00:56:48,"Even he said, ""I'm really only suited to smaller parts."""
00:56:48,00:56:49,"It was very modest, wasn't he?"
00:56:49,00:56:49,Wow.
00:56:49,00:56:50,Okay.
00:56:50,00:56:51,I did find a bad review of his stuff.
00:56:51,00:56:54,"It mentions both podcast, Adolf Hitler,"
00:56:54,00:57:00,"where a film he was in called Hitler the Last 10 Days from 1973,"
00:57:00,00:57:01,"and the telegraph said,"
00:57:01,00:57:02,"""In Hitler the Last 10 Days, Guinness,"
00:57:02,00:57:05,having discovered through his usual assiduous research
00:57:05,00:57:06,"that Hitler was a boring man,"
00:57:06,00:57:08,unfortunately succeeded brilliantly
00:57:08,00:57:10,"in bringing this interpretation to the screen."""
00:57:10,00:57:14,I'm not going to ask you a quick quiz question.
00:57:14,00:57:16,"Quite a neat quiz question, maybe."
00:57:16,00:57:19,But Anna Guinness played Lawrence of Arabia
00:57:19,00:57:20,in--
00:57:20,00:57:20,Okay.
00:57:20,00:57:21,Okay.
00:57:21,00:57:23,In what did he play Lawrence of Arabia?
00:57:23,00:57:24,Oh.
00:57:24,00:57:26,Was it in Lawrence of Arabia?
00:57:26,00:57:28,It wasn't James.
00:57:28,00:57:29,"God, you've played a fool of yourself."
00:57:29,00:57:30,Have I?
00:57:30,00:57:33,He played King Faisal in Lawrence of Arabia.
00:57:33,00:57:36,"But bizarrely, two years before the film Lawrence of Arabia--"
00:57:36,00:57:37,Lawrence of Arabia.
00:57:37,00:57:38,It's all right.
00:57:38,00:57:39,Sorry.
00:57:39,00:57:40,It's the version I accidentally watched.
00:57:40,00:57:45,"I can see why this shocked audience is in 1960, actually."
00:57:45,00:57:50,There's your episode title.
00:57:50,00:57:51,"It's so nice, isn't it?"
00:57:51,00:57:52,When it just--
00:57:52,00:57:55,"I can't call it ""Nurse"" because it's Lawrence of Arabia."
00:57:55,00:57:56,"It just falls right into your lap, you know?"
00:57:56,00:57:59,Do you even see sounds that have pittance?
00:57:59,00:58:02,Okay.
00:58:02,00:58:06,"Before he starred in Lawrence of Arabia two years earlier,"
00:58:06,00:58:09,"he played Lawrence of Arabia in a play called ""Ross."""
00:58:09,00:58:11,So he played him.
00:58:11,00:58:13,"And then they were casting for Lawrence of Arabia,"
00:58:13,00:58:15,"and they were said, ""Do you want to be in Lawrence of Arabia?"""
00:58:15,00:58:16,Yeah.
00:58:16,00:58:19,What a strange name for a movie about Lawrence of Arabia.
00:58:19,00:58:20,Yes.
00:58:20,00:58:22,They named it after that guy from France who put flour on his legs.
00:58:22,00:58:29,Okay.
00:58:29,00:58:29,That is it.
00:58:29,00:58:30,That's all of our facts.
