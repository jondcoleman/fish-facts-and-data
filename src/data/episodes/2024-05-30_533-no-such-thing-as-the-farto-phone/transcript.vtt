00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. Thank you all

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.840
 for snapping up tickets for our upcoming Thunder Nerds Tour. It's going to be so much fun and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.240
 so many of you have already got tickets. It has been absolutely staggering to be honest.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.160
 We have sold out a number of the dates. There's still quite a lot of tickets available though,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.920
 so do go to NoSuchThingsAsFish.com/live to see what tickets are available now. But the

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.480
 main reason that I've come here today is to speak directly to the people of Sydney,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.580
 Australia. You, of all the people around the world, have really pulled out all the stops

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:47.400
 and helped us to sell out the Sydney Opera House in just a couple of days. Absolute insanity,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.280
 it has to be said. But thank you for doing that. We're going to put on an extra show in Sydney.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.160
 Now, the details of that will first be told to Club Fish members. At the beginning of your next

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.280
 bit of bonus content, which is due to come out on the 11th of June, you people will have a pre-sale

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.360
 and then if there are any tickets left, they will go on sale on the 14th of June and we'll give

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.640
 details at the top of that Friday's show. So that's the big news. We're really looking forward

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.240
 to this tour. It's going to be absolutely amazing. If you haven't got tickets yet, then do not Dilly

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.040
 Dally because they are going super, super fast. And like I said, you can get those at

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.680
 NoSixThingsAsFish.com/live. One more thing to say and that is that there is a bit of an odd

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.720
 thing about this week's show. That is that one member of the team was unable to make it to the

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.960
 office on time, despite leaving home on time. They never made it. I will leave it up to you to

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.800
 guess who that's going to be. But what it means is that this was a three-person show. Obviously,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.000
 we very much missed the person in question, but hopefully you will enjoy this show nonetheless.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 Anyway, no more to say apart from, as we always do every week on with the podcast.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:26.840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of NoSixThingsAsFish, coming to you from the QI offices in

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.440
 Hobern. My name is Anna Toshinsky and I'm joined here today by James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.800
 and a superior replacement to Dan Shriver in the form of, if you're seeing the video clip of this,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.840
 a puppet of Dan Shriver who will say much less. And I think that'll be appreciated.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.200
 I'm afraid Dan is stuck on a train somewhere in the east of England. #BrokenBritain. Let's go.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.760
 Nice to hear BrokenBritain making a comeback. No one said that for years.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.480
 Is that quite dated? We're too busy living it, you know. No, Dan, this is the first ever,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.520
 I think, three-person podcast we've ever done. Yeah. If you prefer the format, let us know.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.080
 I think this could be it. Do you think? We might crack it.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.720
 I just want to say, Dan, if you're listening, which I know you will be, I really missed you.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.040
 James was the first one to suggest. He said, "Let's cut the soundbag loose." He kept saying,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.800
 kept saying it over and over again. He said that before your train was even delayed, actually.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.040
 We had a whole train going. How do we ditch Dan? It was actually me that stopped the train.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.280
 I put five people on the track and then one person on another track.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.320
 You put one leaf on the line, so we'll be there for a couple of days.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.800
 Anyway, we're going to kick off with fact number one, and because I'm hosting,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.800
 I've made that my fact. My fact this week is that as part of the preparations for D-Day,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.560
 one scientist persuaded another to inhale oxygen until she vomited. They got married

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.840
 shortly afterwards. It's sort of a weird rom-com in a fact.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.080
 Is it a meat-cute? Maybe they already knew each other.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.440
 I don't know what meat-cute says.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.440
 God, guys, that's in a rom-com, the moment where the couple, they bump into each other,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.920
 she drops all her stuff, he helps her pick them up.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.640
 She vomits.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.960
 She vomits. They're under the ocean, maybe? Is this, they're in a hyperbaric chamber?

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.120
 They're simulating me under the ocean, certainly. Okay, well, it's the original meat-cute.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.480
 This is from this amazing book that I need to cite. It's written by someone called Rachel

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.080
 Lance, who was actually a blast injury specialist and a researcher into bodies

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.360
 surviving the extremes of being underwater, but she's written this book called Chamber Divers,

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.880
 and she's uncovered this story, which is that. The D-Day landings hadn't happened yet. This is

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.000
 Second World War, but there had been a disastrous Canadian beach landing in the Second World War

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.600
 on the beaches of France, and it'd been disastrous because they had based it on a bunch of old photos

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.720
 they had, like, old holiday photos from the 1920s. You're joking. And they're like, where's the Ferris

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.560
 Wheel? Exactly. Where's all the zombies? So you've got to make landfall by the donkeys, right?

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.000
 And it turned out the donkeys and the Ferris Wheel and all of that had been replaced by German guns,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.960
 which is such bad luck, and it was awful and a huge number of casualties.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.440
 Was it that the sand had moved, or the tides had moved the sand,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.080
 or that they couldn't land in the same way because of the ocean conditions?

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.360
 I think it was that they couldn't tell what the terrain was like based on the pictures,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.320
 so they thought it was going to be nice and sandy. It was very rocky, it was very hazardous,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.800
 couldn't land properly, really bad, and so it became apparent that in order to do a successful

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.520
 beach landing to invade the Germans, the Allies would have to know more about the coastline,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.000
 which would mean divers getting right up to the beach, spending a long time underwater,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.760
 going deep down, getting up to the beach, then popping up at night, and actually figuring out

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.320
 exactly what was on the beach. And to do that, we needed to know how to dive, which we didn't really

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.840
 in the 40s. Interesting. You know what I was reading yesterday? I was reading a book about

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.880
 the history of barbed wire, and this is really off topic, but there was a thing in it how during

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.040
 the war, they used to put barbed wire under the sea, so as in when people would come and land,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.360
 you would jump off the boat and start running up, but your feet would get tangled because there's

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:23.640
 barbed wire under the sea. No way. Under the sea. It's not better. That's mean. It was a time of

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:30.120
 meanies, 39 to 45. That's extraordinary, I did not know that. But that would be useful for your

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.120
 divers as well, because they would notice it, I guess. They'd see it exactly with the goggles on,

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.360
 because they wear goggles, don't they? Anyway, this is a long-winded way of getting to the

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.040
 point that there were these two researchers, JBS Haldane and Helen Spowate, they worked for UCL,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.720
 and they shut themselves repeatedly in these hyperbaric chambers, chambers that could be

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.200
 filled up with oxygen and simulate underwater pressures. They did this over and over again

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.240
 to find out the effects on the human body so that the D-Day landings could happen,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.080
 and Helen Spowate is in there, and she's the one who's inhaling pure oxygen, because it's the other

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.760
 body deals with oxygen at high pressures, because it can be very dangerous, and JBS Haldane is

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.360
 sitting next to her taking notes in this hyperbaric chamber, and she managed to last for 33 minutes

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.240
 on pure oxygen before she tore the breathing tube out of her mouth, vomited repeatedly,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.760
 hallucinated, and said, "I'm done, thanks." Well, she might have said, "I'm done, thanks," because

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.400
 I read about what happens to you in those situations, and yeah, your voice goes really

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.640
 high, like you're on helium. I didn't know that. They should do that at kids' birthday party,

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.960
 shouldn't they? Well, it's kind of tutor. Yeah, exactly. Well, there's a lot of vomiting at kids'

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.520
 birthday parties and stuff like that. It does sound kind of fun, apart from people can't whistle,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.800
 when there's so much oxygen either. Oh, no. So, you know, it's... Well, I wouldn't like that,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.680
 because I'm a whistler. Are you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get told off for whistling from my wife's family,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.840
 who think it's bad luck in the house. Well, you're whistling out of the window passing women,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:06.760
 aren't you? And you've got your heart hat on. They're right. It really affected Haldane,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.520
 didn't it? So, I read that in the course of this research, he got a bubble at the base of his spine,

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.280
 which stayed there for the rest of his life, and it made it incredibly painful for him to sit down

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:20.440
 anywhere. No. Yeah. Yeah, no, he was extremely dangerous. He was an incredible guy, JBS Haldane.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.440
 He was, yeah. John Byrdon Sanderson Haldane. He was amazing. I was just saying before we started

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.160
 recording this, sometimes you meet someone researching his podcast, and you think, "I just

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.600
 want to spend weeks with you. I just want to do like a month-long special of the show about this guy."

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.680
 Andy, if you spent weeks with him, he'd make you do so much mad stuff that you wouldn't have

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.440
 the guts for, I'm afraid. No, okay, fair enough. But he was constantly experimenting on himself,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.480
 and his dad was also a really famous scientist who experimented on him,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.520
 and he did all of this science, despite not having a science degree even. He studied maths,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.600
 and then classics. I'm sorry to say, but if you do that, you're going to end up with a bubble

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.160
 on your butt. Move into the professionals, mate. No, you're right, you're right, you're right.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.400
 But he was a geneticist by training, and yet throughout his life, he was constantly doing

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.160
 crazy experiments. Which were really useful as well. Really useful, yeah. You know, he really did

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:13.640
 find out a lot about how the body responds to these pressures and different gases. I think he

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.360
 did a lot of research into nitrogen as well. If we get overexposed in nitrogen, he went down, I think.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.800
 When he was about 13, he was first experimented on undersea by his father. This is a life-long

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.400
 thing for Haldane, right? He and his father, who was called also John Haldane. John Scott Haldane,

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.160
 sorry, yeah, yeah. They went up to the west coast of Scotland on HMS Spanker, which was a navy

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.920
 ship. Do you have a cap? I do. I have a naval cap with the band HMS Spanker, which was an old prop

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.840
 from QI. And I wear that standing at my window, and I also have that complaint. And his father was

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.160
 trying to work out the speed divers should rise at to stop getting the bends, the decompression

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.560
 sickness. And they didn't know what caused that, and he found out basically. And Haldane senior

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.680
 put his volunteers, including his 13-year-old son, Jack, in a badly fitting diving suit,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.520
 got them to repeatedly go down into the sea and then come back up at different speeds.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.320
 He did work out eventually how to come back up. But Jack Jr. became incredibly cold and frightened.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.760
 He was 13 years old. And his dad just apparently dosed him with lots of whiskey and then put him

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:18.680
 to bed. And that was parenting in the audience. And then we look back and think, what a legend.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:26.840
 That's true. Because actually it was him and Naomi, his sister. And she was a sort of equally

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:32.040
 amazing character. So she was four years younger than JBS Haldane. And their dad experimented on

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:37.560
 both of them constantly. Apparently Naomi's job as a child from literally the age of three was to

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.880
 monitor test subjects through an observation window in these gas chambers that he'd set up.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.880
 Make sure your brother's not dead. It was literally that if they fell unconscious,

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.480
 she had to drag them out and resuscitate them. Jesus. Honestly, I'm starting to warm a little

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:58.120
 less to this guy. I'm just imagining what a genius he would have been in adult life,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.880
 Haldane. Had he not had his brain squashed by gases every weekend. Maybe it was,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.560
 that's the equivalent of the bonk on the head though. Maybe that was what sparked the genius.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.080
 Yeah, maybe. Maybe we should all be doing it. Yeah. Actually, he's been his whole life being

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.600
 gassed. I've just realized he was gassed in the First World War as well. His entire life,

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.640
 he was, yeah, yeah. So he was in the Black Watch and the Black Watch are very famous scotch

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.280
 regiment. You know, they're sort of like legends of the British army. Black Watch, didn't they?

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.320
 That's right. Cassio. And that's why they never started their attacks on time,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:36.680
 because they'd all drifted a little bit. One, two, three, beat it. Let's go. The German's just

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:42.360
 opened the machine gun fire as soon as I hear this huge beat. And so his job was trench mortar

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.280
 officers. So he had to lead groups to throw bombs by hand into enemy trenches. I mean,

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.520
 it's quite fierce and hard and horrible work. Yeah. He loved it. And he was gassed, which

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.320
 sparked an interest in mustard gas and experimenting on that. But while he was at the front, I

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.520
 loved this, he was writing back and forth with Naomi, his sister, about mouse genetics. And he

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.920
 later, he boasted he was the only officer to complete a scientific paper from a forward

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.560
 position of the Black Watch. No way. That's amazing. It is amazing. But he must have been like,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.560
 the gas comes towards him. He must be like getting a Madeleine moment of his childhood,

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:19.720
 mustn't he? He's like, oh, this reminds me of old dad. He's taking off his mask,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.720
 maybe getting his milk pad out. Can we talk about Helen Spearway? Yeah, she was also awesome.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.640
 This is, she was the other one in the diving experience. She was the one who vomited.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.640
 Yes. And who he did marry. And they did mention after vomiting all over him,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.560
 they did get married afterwards. Go on. She reminds me a bit of Erica McAllister,

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:44.920
 because she, her most of her research was on Drosophilia, fruit flies. So she was a world expert

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:51.640
 on fruit flies, basically. And then she later wrote a paper about pathogenesis in guppies,

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.400
 in the fish. So that means that a female guppy can give birth without having sex. Virgin birth.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.960
 Virgin birth. But she also said that possibly it could happen in humans because of her work in

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.440
 guppies. She was like, well, there's no reason if it happens in guppies, it can't happen in puppies,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:14.760
 and then in humans. Guppies, puppies, humans. She was extremely harker as well, wasn't she,

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.080
 as you'd have to be. They sort of found each other's soulmates in each other. And she was quite

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:25.240
 a strange character. So there's a Time Magazine report of an incident that happened to her in

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:31.480
 1956, which you have to bear in mind it is 1956. It began, Britain's a blonde biologist,

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:38.760
 Helen Spurway Haldane, wife of brilliant biologist, JBS Haldane. The plund and the brilliant.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:46.360
 Emerged from a London pub after downing three and a half pints of bitter

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:52.040
 and encountered a bobby, stamped on his police dog's tail and clouted the cop. So she was clearly

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:57.080
 a bit feisty. Maybe she was just experimenting what would happen if a dog got his tail stumped on.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.320
 Maybe she was. Well, the answer, it turns out, is you end up in prison for two months.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.600
 Two months, well, yeah. Yeah, but she was offered to pay a fine. And she said, no, not up for it.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.880
 And she was about to go to India. And she said, I'll fit in much better with some of the other

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.440
 people who've gone to India if I've done a prison spell. Basically, that's why they left Britain.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.560
 So Haldane was at Cambridge and she got arrested for drunken disorderly. And he said, well,

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.120
 let's just go to India then. Really? Yeah. But whenever anyone asked him why, he said,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.320
 oh, I am the Suez crisis. I think the government has handled that so badly that I want to leave

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.760
 the UK and I want to go to India. But it's actually because his wife was a piss ass.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:38.040
 Because I read that I read a few reasons that he gave. One was that he was broke as well.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.040
 Like after the war, his lab had no money and he was broke. And those pipes are bitter.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.760
 And he'd be given a really good job offer from the Indian Statistical Institute.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.600
 But also he then claimed this is a bit more in the Suez line of things that he just didn't

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.880
 want to wear socks anymore. He said 60 years in socks is enough. So I'm moving to India.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.200
 Yeah, okay. We don't have to wear socks. Well, also one thing he really liked, apart from the

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.720
 nice job offer and, you know, the cultural that he liked the socialism there, because they had

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.240
 a lot of socialism in India at the time. And he was a former communist. He spent years and years

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:16.200
 in the Communist Party and slightly embarrassed himself a bit over Lysenko, who was the dodgy

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.640
 Soviet pseudoscientist who claimed he was going to revolutionize crops.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:25.160
 Well, yeah, that's the thing. Like Lysenko, he was the one who said Darwin's theories are not

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.080
 completely correct. But obviously for Haldane, this is a big problem because he was such a

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.800
 geneticist and he was so... That's weird. Like for him, like to be a world expert on genetics,

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.680
 for a while, he was kind of saying, well, you know, there might be something in it. And he

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.560
 slightly compromised his scientific principles. Naomi was also a socialist. I was here. Okay.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.000
 And committed socialist. But anyway, she also proofread Lord of the Rings

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.080
 in her spare time. Get out. She in fact wrote over 19 novels. She was

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:54.200
 incredibly... What are you going to say? Over 90% of it. The Great Dundervalued Women.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.920
 Yeah. She proofread it. Yeah. She's not... I've got him to kind of pair it down a little bit.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:04.520
 It was actually 19 books long. No, if she wrote 90 books, she's not the master of decision.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:10.520
 Haldane's first wife, Charlotte Franken, was a daughter of an alien. Oh, yeah.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:16.280
 Go on. Yeah. Dan? No response from Dan there? No, he's just sat there. Okay. He's stunned.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:24.520
 You've stolen his only fact. Her father was Jewish and the son of a German. And during the

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:29.480
 First World War, there was a thing called the Alien Restrictions Act. If you personally wasn't a

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.440
 British citizen, then they would... You would have less rights than anyone else in the country.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.800
 So he decided to leave and left Charlotte on her own. But she became a reporter for the Daily

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.840
 Express, apparently, because... And this is according to the dictionary of national biography,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.400
 because her father had taught her to drink like a man.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:54.280
 So that helped her to become a reporter for the Express. I believe it. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.360
 much the only qualification you needed. But she was actually married when she met Haldane,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:04.680
 and she got divorced. And the divorce quoted Haldane as a person in the divorce. And he basically got

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.440
 fired from Cambridge because of that. And he was quoted as a person who'd been

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.800
 monkeying about with... Exactly. He came, which was very uptight back in those days, wasn't it?

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.600
 He was brought up in front of the sex-very... The what? The sex-very...

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:27.400
 V-E-R-E. V-I-R-I. What are they? Well, sex. Six men. Six men. Yeah. So they were the moral guardians

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.800
 of the University of Cambridge, which if you'd done anything wrong, you would be brought up in

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.360
 front of them and they say, "You're going to lose your position in my universe." Wow. The sex-very.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.800
 That must have led to some confusion. People turning up for a good time, seeing the plaque

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:47.400
 on the door. Well, Haldane, he contested the charge he won. He started calling the sex-very

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.360
 the sex-weary. Brilliant. That's a bit of a joke. Brilliant. And they basically lost all of their

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:57.560
 authority. Wow. And they weren't there anymore. Not thanks solely to that pun. No, but it was

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:03.880
 really part of it. Really? Well, the pun, but the whole, you know, escapade was part of it. Yeah.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.120
 Of course, if you are speaking classical Latin the way it's traditionally spoken is pronounced

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.400
 sex-weary anyway, isn't it? Oh, maybe you've seen better jokes. Even better back in those days.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.840
 That's great. Latin.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:26.120
 OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My fact is that the Swiss have a special

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:32.120
 kind of wrestling trouser named the Schwingerhausen, with a special belt for your opponent to hang onto.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:38.200
 Well, does your opponent want to hang onto your trousers? Well, the Schwingerhausen are these

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.640
 heavy trunks that you wear in the Alps when you're wrestling with your fellow farmers and loggers

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:50.440
 and herdsmen and all of that. It's quite a blokey sport traditionally. It's been making strides.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.560
 There are some lady-swingers now, but traditionally it was a lads occupation.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:01.160
 And basically, you put your right hand on your opponent's belt, your left hand on their right

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:08.920
 leg, you brace, I'm sure, and then you tussle. And you're trying to make your opponent vulnerable

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:14.360
 to the Schwinger, the Schwinger, which the holds. There are dozens of holds. The average Schwinger

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:20.200
 masters several Schwinger, three or four, but there are no loads, but like you have

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.880
 your three or four signature moves. It's kind of like Street Fighter, the arcade game.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.600
 And once you enact a Schwinger, your opponent might go for a Geigen Schwinger, which is a

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:35.160
 counterhold. And you get points for the holds that you make. I think you just get points for

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.400
 throwing your opponent or moving them. Maybe it's moving them out. I think it's just throwing

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.480
 them on the floor. It seems to be the aim. And it does. If you watch videos, it's very

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.240
 crotch heavy a lot of the time. Because if you imagine you've grabbed someone's belt loops

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.240
 from behind and you sort of, a lot of the time, just shoving them towards you, aren't they? As

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.080
 they're doing the same. So you sort of crotch on crotch quite a lot of the time, and then

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.480
 eventually one of you flips the other onto the ground and you've won the bout. Yeah, amazing.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:05.880
 And the competitions are often known as Swing Fests. Yeah. But don't get them mistaken with the

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:11.640
 South London Swing Fest, which is a celebration of swing music. The Sussex Swing Fest, which is a

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:18.200
 golf competition, or Swing Fest, a Swinger only festival from East Yorkshire. Is that swinging,

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.720
 swinging? Yeah, yeah. That's right. That's. So we'll get mixed up with any of those if you want to go

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.920
 for your homoerotic Swiss wrestling competition. Yeah, leather trousers would be useful. I think

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.440
 they'd probably be useful for a few of those. For all of those, really. Absolutely. There should be

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.400
 one of those flowcharts in a magazine, which Swing Fest are you? Oh yeah, yeah. Do you have leather

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:41.800
 trousers? That doesn't help us. Yeah, and I read a great article in the German Language Press about

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:47.160
 Paul Eggiman, who's a master saddler, and he makes the wrestling trousers. And he's one of,

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:52.200
 I think, a handful of people who now truly knows the art of how to make a stringer horser.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.040
 And did you read it in German? No, I clicked the button that said,

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:01.400
 I toggle from German to English. Oh, right. I always do that as well. I even felt languages

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:07.960
 that I could speak. Even for English, you toggle. More English, please. More Englishy.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:14.200
 Yeah. And there's quite a nice thing at the end where it's a sort of respectful thing. At the

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.600
 end, the winner ends the match by brushing the sawdust off the loser's back. Oh, yeah.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.560
 Oh, really? What do you think that used to be? That he brushed off his back?

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:27.800
 He's going to get a tissue. Come on. Oh, dear. It's huge, though, isn't it? I mean,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:33.240
 it's, I think it's one of the most well attended sports in Switzerland, if not the most, about

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:38.840
 300,000 people attend the finals, which happen every year to crown the king of the swingers.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.560
 Brilliant. The jumble VIP.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:47.320
 There was a magazine called Schwinger Zeitung magazine,

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:55.080
 which the first edition was in 1907. And in that edition, they talk about bets being placed in

00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:01.560
 taverns on swinging. But it's also, it's amazing. There's a big article about how terrible cycling

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:07.240
 is. It's so weird. When was this? 1907. Really? So weird. But yeah, I guess that's when it was

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:13.080
 taking off, you know, so that will be a... People were quite anti. They were anti-women cycling,

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.240
 especially. Why did they think it was bad? Well, because it was an imported sport,

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:23.160
 and compared to swinging, which obviously all normal, upstanding Swiss people love to do,

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.400
 cycling involves wretched hunchback figures on their velocities.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.680
 You can't commute to work by swinging, can you? You can swing your way to work.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.760
 If you and another Schwinger grab each other, then throw yourselves off the mountain,

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.720
 you can get down to your office in a kind of wheel formation. So you are the bike, basically, yeah.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.760
 It's one of the three Swiss national sports, or often cited as one of the three really traditional

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.960
 Swiss national sports. And the other two... Can we guess? Swiss national sports skiing?

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:58.760
 I doubt it, but give it a go. Skiing. I'd say no from me. Cowriding. You've got to put a bell

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.120
 around the neck of the biggest bull in the valley. I think, you know, that's not a terrible guess.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.800
 Blowing that massive horn, that big alpine horn thing. Oh yeah, the Alpenhorning.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.040
 Oh, yodeling. I don't think that's a sport. Are you calling that a sport? No, I'm going to tell you.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:19.800
 Eating Toblerone. You'll kick yourself. Making knives. Anonymous bank accounts.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.800
 Protecting the Pope. Yes. I'm going to tell you if that's all right.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:37.320
 Oh, Dan, what was that you said, Dan? Stein's tossing and hornooson. Yeah, you're absolutely right, Dan.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.440
 Did I not say hornooson? Did you say hornooson? Well, I said horn. It has nothing to do with horns.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.120
 I think it's like a giant... I've watched a bit of it. It's really fun. It's like fly swatting,

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.400
 but on a giant scale. And it's a bit like golf. Someone swings this whip at the hornoos,

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.680
 which is a hornet. Oh, I've seen it. It's like a golf club, but it's like got a whip bit on the end.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:02.120
 Exactly. Yeah, I've seen that. It's like if you had a trick golf club that was flexible and you hit

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:07.400
 it. So what am I hitting it at? You're hitting it at this massive field in front of you or slope,

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:12.360
 and up the slope are the opponent, and they're all holding these huge flapping bats that look like

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:17.640
 giant fly swats. And their job is to swat your ball out of the air. And you've got to see...

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.360
 Sounds incredibly difficult. Wait, so I'm whipping my ball into the air,

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:26.600
 and they're trying to swat my ball out of the air. So imagine I hit a golf ball to you,

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.720
 you're 200 yards away, and you've got a tennis racket, and you're trying to hit the golf ball

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:36.920
 before it lands. Right. But with additional difficulties. And you're trying to get it what

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.920
 passed me? Or... You're trying to get it to hit the ground before someone swats it.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.680
 Right, okay, okay. Such a pretty basic concept. It's the kind of game you come up with as a

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:49.320
 seven-year-old with your sibling, and they've stuck with it. And it's huge. And in fact,

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.720
 Rudolf Minger, who I'm sure you guys know, was a 1950s Swiss politician.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:25:00.520
 Dan, no, please. Come on, mate. It's just a name. It's not funny. It's not a funny name. It's just

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:05.720
 a name. He said it was the ultimate mark of patriotism alongside wrestling and yodeling.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.760
 Can I tell you a thing or two about Leather trousers? Sure.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:16.440
 Did we talk ever about the ale conner? I don't think so. So basically, this was this idea that

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:22.040
 in the old days, the way you tested beer was that you'd go to a pub, you'd pour the beer onto a

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:27.320
 wooden bench, and then you'd sit down and you'd see if you stuck to it. Right? And this is a myth.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:32.360
 It's a complete myth. Is it really? It's from 1911. How interesting. Yeah. It's from this book,

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:37.480
 Inns, Ales and Drinking Customs of Old England. So it already sounds like copper bottom nonsense.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:43.320
 The idea was that like a publican might put extra sugar in or something like that. Exactly.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.440
 And it would make it sticky. Yeah. So you'd come in wearing your leather trousers. You get some

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.600
 beer, pour it on your bench, sit down, and then you'd sit there for half an hour and try and

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:58.600
 stand up. And if you stuck to it, it had too much sugar in and it was impure. If the bench came up

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.000
 with your arse as we stood up, then that was treacle. And if they would walk out with the

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.760
 bench stuck on their arse and they'd take your plaque to show you a license with them as they

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:12.280
 went. And it's a hooey. How interesting that that's not true. There were ale conners, but they tasted.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.880
 There are no contemporary sources on the time saying they sat in a pint. Makes no sense.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.240
 Because if it's got sugar in it, you would be able to taste it, wouldn't you? Yeah.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:25.720
 That's the test. Dave, Dave, why aren't you pouring it? No, no, this is how I do it.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:30.280
 But no, it just tastes really sweet. It tastes like honey. No, no, I'm going to sit on it for half

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.560
 an hour. Is this my tea or yours? No, no, it's got sugar in it. Sit on it and see. You've never

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.800
 had that exchange, have you? No. And if the nail was strong enough, it could make something stick

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.680
 to a table. Like, it's sticky. That's brilliant. That's a real exploding of a very niche QI myth,

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.240
 which is something we specialise in. Absolutely. I tried to find something interesting out about

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.480
 Theresa May's leather trousers, which for international listeners who don't keep a

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.360
 hawk eye on British news, Theresa May, former Prime Minister wore some leather trousers famously

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.000
 in a photo shoot at 2016 and got in huge trouble for it. It's probably why she had to leave.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:10.440
 Because it was revealed that they'd cost £995 and also they would just noticeably

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.040
 leather trousers. Yeah. And that was worth a lot more before Brexit as well.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:22.920
 And did you find anything? It was a very hard design. All I found out was that she really

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:28.360
 didn't want to wear them. And it was the director of communications, Fiona Hill, who you may well

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:33.160
 remember, who insisted that Amanda Wakeley, the designer, send a van full of clothes to Downing

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:39.080
 Street and sort of squeaked her into these leather trousers. I'm imagining that scene in Ross from

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:45.400
 Friends, when he has to sort of pat flour down his legs. And yes, her other director of comms,

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.360
 Katie Perry, said she didn't even like the bloody trousers. They were the wrong kind

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:54.040
 of brown, if you know what I mean. Which I don't. No. But it was quite mad because Cameron did

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.840
 habitually wear another male lead as to habitually wear things that cost £3,500. So when everyone

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.000
 was demanding that she declare it, you know, have you declared this on your register of

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.640
 interest? I imagine Rishi Sonak's wife, France, cost more than that. Yeah. Are they leather?

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.840
 Let's put in a freedom of information request and find out.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:18.840
 He's at the press conference. He's answered all the big questions he goes to. Yeah,

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:27.960
 no such thing as a fish. That would be amazing if he could get into those junkets. Oh my God.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.680
 We've got to do that. How do you get into those junkets?

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:39.960
 The Lederhosen has been banned from time to time in Germany. The church banned it during the 19th

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:48.440
 century revival of Lederhosen. What? And in 1913, the Munich Archbishop declared Lederhosen immoral.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:53.000
 And they've got a Lederhosen scene in Peru as well. There's this tiny bit of Peru,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.080
 this village called Pozuzu, between the Andes and the Amazon. And it was set up by Austria

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:03.160
 and German immigrants led by a priest called Joseph Egg. Hang on, you had another egg earlier?

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:08.920
 Yeah, he did. Did I? Yeah, an egg name in your German article that you'd got Google to translate

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:17.800
 for you. Oh yeah, Paul Eggiman, the master saddler. I am the Eggiman. Yeah. Anyway, so every year they

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:23.640
 have Pozuzu Fest. So these Germans went over to South America, did they? Yes. Right, okay.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:30.840
 As we said in the previous episode, when? 100 years before. Okay, okay. The unpleasantness.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.720
 Although King Edward VIII wore Lederhosen on his honeymoon with Wallace Simpson,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.360
 where he went and met Hitler. Did he? On their honeymoon, they went off and had a meeting with

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:45.160
 Hitler. It's very romantic, isn't it? It's every girl's dream. Yeah, foe of the podcast.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.360
 They went to the Eagles Nest, which is that, you know, it's called Berchtesgaden. It's sort of

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:56.280
 Hitler's very high mountain alpine retreat. It does sound like a bit of a glamping situation. Maybe

00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:03.080
 she thought when he said we're going to the Eagles Nest, I found it on Airbnb. She didn't quite

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:17.720
 realise. Airy and BNB. Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is James. Okay, my fact this

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:25.640
 week is that in 1963, a fire at the Curry Building was put out by a man called Bum Fatou.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.280
 It was also started by him, though.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:38.200
 He was just setting fire to his Fatou's. And no, this is a fact about Key West in Florida.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:45.720
 And city? Yeah, it's a city. Yeah, it's the southernmost city in mainland America. I'm pretty

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:52.120
 sure. I know because it's right at the tip of the Florida Keys. It is, you know what, the keys,

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.840
 you can drive there. So it's kind of mainland, but the truth is there's lots of bridges,

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:02.280
 because the keys are so close together. So they've been bridged all the way. Yeah, I've never been

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.760
 there. It sounds like an amazing bit of the world. It's great. It's really good. Let's talk about it

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:15.640
 in a bit. So Bum Fatou was a major figure in 1960s Key West because he

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:23.240
 was a fire chief. Okay. And he was a friend, I believe, of Julio Dupu, who was one of the

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:29.080
 main surgeons in the town. But I thought his name was marginally funnier. So we'll talk about him.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:35.320
 But he was really good. And the reason I came across him actually is because there is a musical

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.760
 that's been written about him called Bum Fatou the Musical. And it was written by Pamela Stevenson.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:46.760
 Oh, yeah. Who is Billy Conley's wife. Yeah. And she's a writer. She's a shrink and a comedian.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.720
 And she wrote a long route from sort of Rodgers and Hammerstein, hasn't it?

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.840
 We really run out of all the evidence. We've done Hamilton and we've done lots of other

00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:04.120
 like key figures in American history. So he was the fire chief. He wore red suits, drove around in

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:11.080
 a lime green Ford Galaxy, which had a Yoruba shrine on its hood, a Yoruba as in the Nigerian

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:17.640
 religion. Yes, he was a practitioner, wasn't he? Yeah. Of the Yoruba religion. He called himself

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:24.280
 El Jefe. El Jefe, if you want to give it this androcytes of pronunciation, which is more funny.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.840
 Was that the chief? The chief, yes. Okay. I think he painted that on his car, didn't he?

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:35.720
 Yeah, he had a license plate that said El Jefe. Yeah. And he eventually got done for selling drugs

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.280
 out of the fire department. That is tragic. Can I just ask about the Curry Factory fire?

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.840
 Oh, yeah. Do you know anything else about that? Yeah, I can tell you that it was owned by Mr. Curry,

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:50.680
 whose name, have I written it down? So he didn't make Curry? Or did he have to be called Mr. Curry,

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.360
 but it was a Curry factory as well? No, no, no, it wasn't a factory, it was Curry building.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:02.920
 And he was Mr. Curry, and he was the first millionaire in Florida, and he was a wrecker.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:09.480
 So a big thing in Key West back in the day is you would have people sort of sat on big towers,

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:14.280
 and whenever a ship went past, if it wrecked, they would go wrecker high, wrecker high, and

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.520
 all the men would run out and try and get at the wreck. And then it was just like finders keepers?

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.680
 It was just finders keepers, and then they would have a big auction in Key West every month where

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.280
 they would sell everything that they got from the wrecks. Because that's very bad behavior wrecking.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:31.400
 Well, it's bad behavior where you put the light up and you lure a ship onto the rocks. I think

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:37.160
 actually most of that is relatively mythical. That's rare, isn't it? And I think that's really,

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:41.240
 really different. That's like the difference between murdering someone and pickpocketing a dead body,

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.320
 and I think one is much worse than the other. Anna is really clear about the difference between

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:51.000
 those things. No, you're right, wrecking is sort of different to, yeah. I think that's all, the myths

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.760
 about that are in Cornwall, aren't they? Yeah, but no, no, the myths are the same in Key West,

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:59.480
 actually. Yeah, basically, in fact, if you read about wrecking in Cornwall and wrecking in Key West,

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.320
 it's all the same stories. It's the same myths. It's the same, you know.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.560
 There must be quite a lot to mimic a lighthouse accurately if you don't have a lighthouse. Do

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:12.760
 you know what I mean? I've got a pretty good Halloween costume, actually. This is awesome.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.880
 Just going around flashing people. Look, as a former subscriber to Lamp Magazine, I can assure

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:23.000
 you that I've done my reading on this. Anyway, can we say why Fato was called Fato? Sorry, why

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.800
 he was called Bum? Yeah, Fato was his actual name. Fato was his name, and his first name,

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.560
 his birth name was Joseph Fato, and his parents probably thought, well, you know, it's an unfortunate

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:36.280
 surname, but at least it can't get any worse. And then he loved fire from a young age, and he was

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.680
 always hanging around the fire station, and he was known as the little bum, the American version,

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.000
 meaning tramp, you know, or one friend reported that he was always bumming things, which again

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.480
 shows the difference between American and British English. Oh, I don't know. You would say it can

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.440
 have bummer's cigarette. Yeah. And he disappeared, didn't he? In the end, he vanished, and he was

00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:00.440
 never found. He's somewhere with Lord Lucan and Elvis. And Chugha. Yeah. And Chugha at the party

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:05.960
 of the century. Because he was flogging drugs. Yes, and he got caught because he tried to sell it to

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:12.920
 an undercover police officer, and then they arrested him, and then he was out on bail, and they thought

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:18.280
 that probably he would go out to prison for a long, long, long, long time, or perhaps he would

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:24.280
 dob in the people who gave him the gear in the first place. Right. Because he had connections

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:33.160
 with Cuba. So then he disappeared. Maybe he drove off and started a new life. Maybe the people who

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:38.680
 didn't want him to dob them in, might have dubbed him off. And there was a lot of stuff like that

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:44.120
 going on. I mean, it was a very shady, gang-heavy world. And in fact, the person who dobbed him in,

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:49.480
 who basically told this undercover agent to go and set him up, was a guy called Titus Rudolph

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.560
 Walters. And he convinced the undercover agent, who was a guy called Larry Dollar,

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.560
 who I quite like. Larry Dollar. Larry? Everyone in the story has a great name.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:03.240
 They do. Titus Walters is a good name. Larry Dollar. But Titus, before the deal even happened,

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:09.480
 where Faso was set up by Larry Dollar, Titus, who dobbed him in, was brutally murdered. And I

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.880
 ended up reading this description of his murder. And it was extraordinary. He was like the Rasputin

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.600
 of his time. He was murdered by, you know, other gang people who shot him in the head multiple

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.800
 times. He just wouldn't die. He was like crawling out of the bathroom. Eventually,

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.960
 they had to inject him with heroin and drain cleaner to kill him off.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.320
 Lorx, were you just reading it to make sure that somebody had been through his pockets?

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:39.640
 Yeah. A few good things that Faso did when he was fire chief. He installed a system which turned

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:44.120
 all the traffic lights near the fire station on green with a push of a button. That's fantastic.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.840
 No, that sounds incredibly dangerous. Wait, all of them are the ones...

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:53.640
 All of the ones that he needed to go to to get to the main road. That's brilliant.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.360
 There's only like one main road in Key West, really. That's really clever. That's a really good idea.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:03.080
 Yeah. Well, he did it. I bet he used it bit nefariously sometimes. He's late for a date.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:08.680
 Do modern fire engines have that capacity to turn? I don't think so. I don't know if you just turn

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.200
 the sirens and go through red lights, don't they? Yeah, I think you're right.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:18.920
 But he also had a hotline to his home phone that required no dialing. So if he was at home and

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.760
 there was a fire, someone could just press one button like the bat phone, the Fato phone.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:30.200
 The Fato phone is a completely different prank toy. Instead of a spotlight into the sky,

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:35.720
 it's just they play the noise of a huge guff over Key West. No, he hears it.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:42.200
 He stops flogging cocaine to a student and says, "I must go." He runs into a phone box and he pulls

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:48.520
 on the Fato costume. I think, do you know what? He would be 104 years old now and part of me does

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:52.920
 hope maybe he's still out there somewhere. Oh, me too. Right, you know? There's a weird...

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.960
 Listening to this show.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:38:00.200
 There's a weird coincidence about him or just like a weird collision of histories

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:04.360
 where his parents owned a restaurant in Key West, which is called Victoria,

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:09.880
 and they sold it to a guy called Joe Russell, who was mates with Ernest Hemingway,

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:16.120
 who'd recently come from Cuba. So Ernest Hemingway has come from Cuba. He visits this restaurant

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.480
 that's just been sold by Bum Fato's family. Right.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.600
 And he says, "You know what? You should call this place Sloppy Joe's,

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.480
 because that's the name of a place that I used to go to in Havana." Oh.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:29.400
 And that is now incredibly iconic Sloppy Joe's. Is that still... I've been there.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.440
 And have you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been to the Sloppy Joe's.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.960
 Of course, yeah. Well, there you go. That was named suggested by Ernest Hemingway. No.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:41.160
 And it's this iconic bar. And in fact, once it changed lodgings because the rents were massively

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.320
 increased and so it moved across the road. But the bar never closed when it moved.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.960
 The people just picked up their drinks as they moved venue and walked across the road.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.040
 That's very good. That's brilliant. That's commitment to your customers.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:56.920
 That's fantastic. A few other good things that Fato did.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.280
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll just quickly say. So he ordered the replacement

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:06.200
 of all foam mattresses in the jails, because if there was a fire, he knew they would release cyanide.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.400
 So they were really dangerous. So he got rid of all the foam mattresses.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.640
 And obviously the irony of that is the likelihood was that he would have ended up on one of these

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:18.760
 mattresses, you know, when he got arrested. See, if it had been Haldane, Haldane would have

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.440
 delighted in setting fire to one of the mattresses while he lay on it.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:29.560
 Delicious cyanide. And the other thing was that he was like the unofficial welcome for Cuban Exiles.

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.520
 So a lot of people will leave in Cuba at the time because Castro had just come in, right?

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:39.320
 So he would provide food and accommodation just for the first couple of days when you arrived

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.840
 in Key West and then maybe even sort you out with a job and stuff like that.

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.960
 That's interesting. Yeah, it's very close. In fact, I think is it closer to Cuba than it is to Miami?

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.920
 It's close to Cuba. It's harder to drive, I could say that much.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.960
 You'd need a sort of subterranean Haldane designed car, yeah.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.600
 The road down that you drove along, James, it used to be a train.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:04.520
 Yeah, you can see it, actually. I think there are still some bits of railway, I think, I think so.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.520
 It was called Flagler's Folly, because it was Henry Flagler, who was a millionaire,

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.120
 and he had this vision of a railway all the way down to Key West,

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.160
 all the way through the Florida Keys, all the bridges that you drive over now.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.120
 And it was his life's work. It took $50 million of his money.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:21.960
 It nearly killed him. He finally saw it open the year before he died.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.120
 And in fact, he had gone blind by then. He was in his 80s by the time it opened.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.240
 And he couldn't see his life's achievement,

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:34.040
 but he could hear as he arrived on the train at Key West, the children of Key West cheering

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:40.200
 as he stepped off the train. And he was weeping at emotion at this amazing achievement.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.920
 Did you know the, I learned something about Miami, which I didn't know,

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.600
 which was very interesting in the course of this.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:49.800
 So the only reason he could bring the railroad down to Florida Keys all the way down

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.040
 was because it had extended down to Miami. But there was a woman called Julia Tuttle,

00:40:54.040 --> 00:41:01.720
 who lived on what became Miami in the 1890s. And she really wanted to improve her business standing.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.000
 So she owned a few hundred acres of land. She wanted the railroad to come down there,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.080
 because obviously that's very useful commercially. And she wrote to him saying,

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.200
 bring your railway down here, bring it down here. And he said, no, can't be bothered.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.800
 She invented Disneyland.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:19.240
 Well, Dan, she's not quite that cool. But she did, the story goes,

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:25.880
 sent him during the Great Frost of 1894, some flowering orange blossom from South in Miami,

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:31.720
 saying, look, our fields are so fertile, even though it's so cold, that it's a great place to,

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:36.040
 you know, set up shop. And he eventually was persuaded to build the railway down there.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.520
 And therefore Miami is the only city of any note in America founded by a woman.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.720
 So she's, she's the founder of Miami. I did not know that.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.040
 No, but she didn't make Disneyland. So what's the point?

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.680
 I read this website. I got to say it was, it was fun facts about Key West.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:56.040
 Look, just judge for yourselves. At one point, about 10% of Key West's population was chickens.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.320
 Okay. Okay, that's all right. They've got wild chickens. All right, well, all right, here's another.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.120
 I want to know what population they're counting, are they counting the insects?

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.440
 Because when they're saying 10% of its population,

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.920
 you've got a good point. Are they covering all animals at that point?

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.720
 You can't just include humans and chickens. You can't.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.800
 The bacteriophages. What about them?

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:17.880
 Okay. All right, I've got two more fun facts from the same website for you.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.920
 Key West was a major hub for salt production in the 1800s.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.440
 Okay. That is fine.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.800
 I'm feeling the fun. Because it's near the sea.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.720
 Yeah, I guess. I'm feeling the fun draining away a bit.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.720
 All right, here's, here's the Nadel of the Coffin.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.800
 Key West is home to the largest historical district of wooden structures

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:36.680
 on the U.S. Department of the Interior's National Register of Historic Places.

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.960
 Wow. Dan, wake up.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:44.040
 The sad thing is, I know how excited you are about that fact, Andy.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.240
 Yeah, I mean, that's, that's mega.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:49.480
 Well, a lot of the wooden structures would have been lookouts for wreckers as well.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.960
 Because they built, there's, I think there are some that are still there,

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.600
 although they might be reproductions, but they're just like,

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:59.640
 if you can imagine like a 30-foot building, but it's just like slats of wood,

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.800
 almost like in the shape of a lighthouse.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.640
 I'm thinking of an umpire's chair.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.880
 Like a bigger version of that.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.000
 Like that, but with a big sort of flat top, which you can stand on.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:09.960
 That's cool.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.440
 Although they do have one of those in Low Sugarloaf Key,

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.160
 which is one of the Florida Keys, which isn't one of those.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.400
 It is a similar looking structure,

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.320
 but it used to be filled with ground-up female bat genitals.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:26.200
 This, firstly, grim, and second, sorry, just want to say that.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.840
 Secondly, is it to lure in male bats?

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:29.640
 Is it a bat trap?

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.520
 Oh my God, you've got it.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.080
 Andy's got it.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.280
 And why do you want a bat trap?

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.120
 You've got too many bats.

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.320
 No, no, you want more bats.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:35.880
 You want more?

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.920
 Oh, you're a bat farmer.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.920
 Um, no, there's a mosquito problem.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.240
 There was a mosquito problem in the 1920s.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.280
 So a chap called Richard Clyde Percy read a book

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.440
 about how to get bats to kill mosquitoes.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.240
 Wrote to the guy who wrote the book, said, "How do I do this?"

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.080
 And he said, "Build a tower, fill it with ground-up female bat genitals."

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.280
 What do they have to be ground up?

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.640
 Can you just put female bats in the tower with that?

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.720
 You've got to have the ground up.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.960
 Maybe it's easier to source ground-up genitals.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.000
 That's so weird.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.800
 I guess without being ground up, the female bats can maybe fly away,

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.680
 whereas in this way, when they're ground, they're genital ground up.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.120
 I presume you've killed the whole bat.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.480
 And you've had to take--

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.200
 And you've had to--

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.480
 But why not just grind up the whole--

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.840
 Is it to lure male bats?

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.480
 Yes, and the male bats come and they eat all the mosquitoes.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.640
 So it's only the male bats that eat the mosquitoes?

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.120
 No, I think just that's the only way you can lure bats.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.320
 Yeah, the males are probably more likely to be like,

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.880
 "Well, I can smell female genitals.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.920
 They might be not attached to a bat anymore or ground up,

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.280
 but beggars can't be cheesed."

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.560
 Give it a go.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:42.600
 Okay, it's time for our final fact, and that is Dan's fact.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.720
 Should we get him to send it as a voicemail?

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.160
 And I'll play it in.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:47.960
 That's a good idea.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.240
 That's a great idea. Let's do that now.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.480
 My fact this week is that for over two decades,

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.880
 the actors Grace Kelly and Alec Guinness secretly hit a tomahawk

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.760
 in each other's hotel rooms around the world.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:05.240
 Well, great fact, Dan.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.760
 I've got loads of questions about it.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:07.560
 Yeah, tell us more.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.480
 Who's Grace Kelly?

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.720
 Actually, I didn't look into Dan's fact,

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.640
 and sorry to peel back the curtain for a second,

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.320
 he's still not here live in the room.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.480
 So I'm not sure exactly what happened with this story.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.000
 No, I'm not either. Did you, Andy?

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.120
 Yes, thankfully I did.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:22.840
 That was good, wasn't it?

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.160
 Because I went and read Alec Guinness's memoir,

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.520
 and so it's a story he told.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.000
 Basically, he was making this film called The Swan,

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.280
 and Grace Kelly was in it too.

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.640
 And if you don't know who Alec Guinness and Grace Kelly are,

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.520
 they're two of the greats.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.240
 That's all we need to say.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.280
 The greatest actors ever.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:36.840
 Brilliant.

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.960
 And Alec Guinness, he got given this tomahawk

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.280
 by some Native Americans who were also involved in the filming,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.240
 and it was massive.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.800
 It was a kind of, it wasn't a prop, it was a proper thing.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.600
 And it was really heavy,

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.440
 and he didn't want to take it at the end of the job.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.240
 So he asked Hotel Porter, as he was leaving,

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.840
 you know, going off to the next job, whatever,

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.400
 to slip it into Grace Kelly's bed as a kind of joke.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.520
 You know, it's a sort of silly thing,

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.560
 because she would have known it was his,

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.080
 because she'd seen him do it.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.920
 And then a few years after that,

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.920
 he came home from a performance in London.

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.440
 He was doing a lot of theatre at the time,

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.560
 and he found it in his bed.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.160
 And done, done, done.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.400
 And she had found a way somehow to smuggle it into his bed.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.160
 I don't know if she ever told her end of the story.

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:11.880
 Oh, that's great.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.240
 He waits a few more years,

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:17.560
 and then he finds out that she's doing a project in the USA

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.280
 with someone who he doesn't know, actually.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.240
 And he gets in contact via a third party of the,

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.000
 I think, the poet she was doing this work with.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.520
 She was traveling over this poet.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.440
 And he gets in contact via a third party,

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.040
 so her companion can honestly say,

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.120
 "No, I've never met or spoken to Alec Guinness."

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.800
 So he really goes to a length,

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.520
 and then he gets it back into her bed that way.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:37.320
 But wait a minute.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.000
 Like, that does seem a bit pointless,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.920
 because is she going around her whole life

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.480
 just checking that everyone doesn't know Alec Guinness?

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.800
 She only hangs around with people who don't know Alec Guinness.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.560
 After she's found it in her bed,

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:50.040
 she comes downstairs the next morning and says to the poet,

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.800
 "You don't know Alec Guinness at all, do you?"

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.000
 And he can honestly say,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.520
 "No, I've never met Alec Guinness."

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.480
 But he did, it was,

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.800
 and then eventually he goes to Hollywood in 1979

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.920
 to receive an Oscar.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.280
 And what does he find in his bed?

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.320
 Grace Kelly, no, he finds the tomahawk in his bed.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.160
 And yeah, so that was a long-running good Hollywood prank.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.240
 And then one of them murdered the other with the tomahawk.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:09.720
 That's right.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.320
 That's famous, yeah.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.000
 Grace Kelly died tragically.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.160
 I think she did die,

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:16.120
 because I didn't read the whole story,

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.320
 but it skimmed it, and she did die, A.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.080
 And she died without ever being acknowledged.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.320
 So I think that's this really weird thing that's left hanging.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.480
 Her and Alec Guinness never discussed that.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.080
 No, they never mentioned it to each other.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.200
 She died in the car crash, didn't she?

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.680
 Yeah, I think in the early '80s.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.880
 She was still very young, she was in her 50s at the time.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.480
 But she died a princess.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:36.040
 She did.

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.080
 In many ways we all die princesses.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:39.800
 Oh, is that right?

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.440
 In many ways we all die a pauper,

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.560
 because you can't take it with you.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.840
 Pretty good point.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.680
 Well, she died in an incredibly wealthy princess.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.440
 So yeah, she was the princess of Monica.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.240
 Yeah, some listeners will remember maybe.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.040
 Some, few listeners.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.560
 She married Prince Rainier of Monica, Rainier than here.

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.600
 It's actually a lot drier, I would suspect, in Monica.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.360
 Yeah, not as rainy.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:09.640
 And she was 26, which means that her Hollywood career,

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.520
 the grand total of five years, maximum, I believe.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:14.200
 Yeah, she was in 11 movies, I think.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.600
 Because he forced her to stop, basically.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.520
 Yeah, although I think she was up for it, wasn't she?

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.720
 She was keen to retire.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.840
 In fact, do you know why, one of the explanations she gave for why she left?

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.200
 Suez, the Suez crisis.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.120
 She didn't like wearing socks.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.120
 Yeah, I've been wearing socks 26 years, that's long enough.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.800
 She said, "When I first came to Hollywood five years ago,

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.040
 my makeup call was at 8am.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.360
 I'll be God damned if I'm going to stay in the business

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.200
 where I have to get up earlier and earlier

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.920
 and it takes longer and longer to get me in front of the camera."

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.840
 I think saying, "As she gets older and older,

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.600
 she's going to have to come in earlier and earlier

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.640
 to get the makeup with me."

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.320
 That's very funny, I see that point, yeah.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.240
 I thought you'd empathize, James, with that a bit.

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:52.120
 Well, because I'm allergic to makeup, pretty much.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.840
 And, you know, you're used to a lion.

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:56.440
 Because you have to get in at 6am every day

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.000
 for extensive hair and makeup before the board.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.080
 I thought you were talking about yesterday we did some filming

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.880
 and I was wearing makeup and just came out in...

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:04.360
 No.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:04.920
 Sobbing.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.840
 Yeah, if you see the film, we sound chivalrous,

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.280
 but James is streaming from his eyes.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.960
 Well, that's working with you, Anna.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.840
 That's so...

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.160
 I blame it on the makeup, yeah.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.680
 No, I think he did forced his retire

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.880
 because he also banned any showing of her movies in Monaco.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.880
 Well, I heard that, but I also heard that

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.720
 she was in the middle of a big contract with MGM.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.040
 You know, you sign up to these seven films and all of that.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.760
 And I think the deal, part of the deal was that

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.120
 she would be freed from the contract,

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.560
 she didn't have to make any more movies,

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.080
 but the wedding was filmed and broadcast

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.320
 to 30 million people and it was in cinemas.

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.920
 Yeah, that was a million people,

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.480
 like half the population of the UK that is at that time.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.560
 There were nearly 2,000 journalists at the wedding.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:43.160
 Yeah, but not many like Kings or Queens of Europe were there.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.080
 Because they all kind of disagreed with it

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.400
 because it was a royal marrying of plebeian.

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.600
 So, yeah, a lot of the royals got invited,

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.720
 but none of them went.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.080
 Wow, that's interesting.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.480
 Because it was a very much an arranged marriage,

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.160
 it seems like, as in it was,

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.160
 I believe it was suggested to Arania

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.320
 that he find a Hollywood star to marry

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.560
 because they wanted to increase tourism

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.240
 since the war people had stopped going.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.680
 That's right. And the person who suggested it,

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:07.400
 did you see that?

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.800
 Aristotle Onassis.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.800
 Oh, yes, the ship guy.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.840
 Greek shipping magnate, again,

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:13.720
 crazy name, crazy guy.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.480
 Later husband of Jackie Kennedy.

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.240
 Jackie Kennedy, yes.

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.920
 I believe his yacht had

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.680
 barstools made out of Wales foreskins.

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.320
 That's correct.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.200
 Oh, so he didn't have taste, all right.

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:28.040
 There were female whales were flocking to his ship.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.240
 Grace Kelly's story is very interesting

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.000
 because it's kind of a riches to riches story.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.600
 Like, she grew up really wealthy.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.480
 Her father was a brick magnate called Jack Kelly.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.000
 He was amazing, actually.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.680
 He was an Olympic gold medalist

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:42.520
 and her mother was a competitive swimmer,

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.240
 Grace Kelly's mum.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.400
 So very athletic, be honest,

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.640
 the entire family worked stunningly good-looking.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.760
 You know, it was not surprising

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.800
 that she became a Hollywood star.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.400
 He was a rower, wasn't he?

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.080
 That's why he got his meddling.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.040
 And she said once someone asked her,

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.120
 "Grace Kelly, would you write an autobiography?"

00:50:58.120 --> 00:50:59.320
 And she said, "No, but I would like

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.840
 to write a biography of my father."

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:06.120
 And in 1920, he wanted to be in the Henley Regatta,

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:09.640
 which is a big posh rowing competition in the UK.

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.880
 But he was banned because in those days,

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:15.080
 anyone who was a mechanic, artisan, or labourer,

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.240
 or works in any menial activity

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.160
 was not allowed to take part in the Henley Regatta.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.280
 Really? Really? Absolutely.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.680
 Was that a sort of class barrier?

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.320
 Yes, it was.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.080
 But it, well, it was.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.440
 Sounds like what, as opposed to like,

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.040
 you don't want them to take the time off their job.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:28.520
 Well...

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.960
 What if someone's plumbing doesn't get fixed?

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.160
 Well, according to them,

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.960
 it was because they wanted it to be amateur.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.760
 And if you had a job as a bricklayer,

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.680
 then you were technically a professional.

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.560
 It's unfair.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.040
 It's actually cheating to have big muscles from your work.

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:45.240
 Only softies who've been spent their whole lives

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.640
 punting so far, reading a little bit of Tennyson.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.000
 So, obviously, it was class-based,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.800
 but he was very annoyed about it.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.640
 But in the same year, there was an Olympics,

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.440
 and he won his Olympic rowing medal.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:02.120
 And apparently, he mailed his cap to King George V,

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.080
 with a note saying, "Greetings from a bricklayer."

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.840
 Nice slam.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:07.800
 If that got to George V,

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.640
 and if George V had any idea what,

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:13.160
 who's the random American brick dude?

00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:15.480
 And then in 2003,

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.040
 the Princess Grace Kelly Challenge Cup

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.800
 was launched by the role regatta,

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.520
 which was in memory of Grace Kelly,

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.760
 but also in memory of John Kelly,

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.840
 who they had snubbed all those years earlier.

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:27.160
 Wow.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:29.080
 I read he was nicknamed,

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.640
 "The most perfectly formed American male,"

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.880
 which is quite an accolade to have.

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.680
 Sexy.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:35.240
 Yeah.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.600
 That is, that's impressive, you know.

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.960
 It's because it's quite a high bar.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.760
 It's not like the most well-formed man in-

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.160
 It's interesting, isn't it?

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.080
 Becoming a princess is such an odd thing.

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:47.880
 Like, what have you done?

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.680
 Oh, I've won an Oscar.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.000
 Oh, well, I've secured the Grimaldi succession,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.400
 actually, because the current Monaco prince

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.920
 is her son, Albert.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.480
 Yeah.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.800
 And the reason they were so desperate to find her,

00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.240
 as you sort of allude to,

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.600
 is that if he didn't have a son,

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.240
 I think the monarchy would have not existed.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:03.960
 They needed a child.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.840
 They needed a son.

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.440
 So they had to take fertility tests.

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.800
 She had to be properly tested

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.040
 to check that she could have a children.

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.040
 She also had to have a virginity test,

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.160
 but it wasn't taken very seriously.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.360
 It wasn't a...

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.640
 It can't be, Grace Kelly.

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.280
 Grace Kelly did.

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:19.560
 And she would absolutely have flunked that,

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.720
 because she'd had a love life before, you know.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.720
 She had lots of boyfriends and things like that.

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.080
 Was it like a written test?

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.960
 Like a driving theory test?

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.000
 Was it like that?

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.520
 Have you ever shagged anyone?

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.600
 Yeah, I think it was a formality,

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.240
 rather than a rigidly observed thing.

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.440
 But I mean, still weird, you know.

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.240
 Gosh.

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:37.960
 Alec Guinness.

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.720
 No one ever gave him a virginity test,

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.520
 as far as I can tell.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.240
 Alec Guinness?

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:41.640
 Yeah.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.920
 No, as far as I know.

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:47.320
 He was called Alec Stephen until he was 14.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.080
 And then someone just said,

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.840
 "Oh, you're not called Alec Stephen.

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.800
 You're called Alec Guinness."

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:55.880
 What was his middle name from, I think, his mum?

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.200
 His mother married David Daniel Stephen.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:03.560
 So he was given his stepfather's name in day-to-day life.

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.160
 But on the birth certificate, he was actually Alec Guinness.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.720
 But it was only when he was 14 that his mum just said to him,

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.080
 "Oh, by the way, that's not your name.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.360
 The thing that everyone's been calling you

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.320
 for the last 14 years."

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.120
 That's not your name.

00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.720
 You know this beer that everyone likes?

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.680
 What is that, instead?

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.000
 We spoke earlier about how, Andy,

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.560
 we were wondering whether you would be friends with Haldane.

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.920
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.160
 Whether it might be a bit much for you.

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.560
 I hate sort of all the experiments and all the sign language.

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.840
 I probably would not see him a lot socially.

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.080
 Well, Alec Guinness, according to the

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.280
 Dictionary of National Biography,

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.120
 was a stickler for punctuality

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.880
 and for good service in restaurants

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:39.160
 of which he was a connoisseur.

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.800
 He hated change, which, in his opinion,

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.400
 was almost always for the worse.

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.360
 And he hated any assaults on the English language,

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.760
 particularly those said on the BBC.

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.080
 Why are you assuming anything about

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.240
 how we would have clearly been the best of friends?

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.720
 I mean, we wouldn't have spoken much,

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.000
 but we would have approved of each other.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.760
 Yeah, yeah, a silent nod.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:54:59.800
 In the street, yeah.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.600
 It is weird, isn't it, that the thing he hated most of all

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.600
 is the thing that now he's best remembered for.

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.680
 Like most widely, you know,

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.280
 you can talk about The Bridge on the River Quay

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.600
 or you can talk about kind hearts and coronets,

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.360
 but he's best remembered for Star Wars,

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.120
 which he thought was basically a film for children.

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:17.320
 And which made him rich, quite rich.

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.480
 You know, he got 2% of the profits.

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.080
 It must have been very rich, I imagine.

00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.000
 It's a bit mealy-mouth, isn't it?

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.240
 He would always say how bad the dialogue was,

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.480
 and he was getting millions and millions from it.

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.120
 He claims he was taxed very heavily on those proceeds.

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.800
 So really, once it all that was over,

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.240
 he got tough and safe in it, you know.

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.680
 But he was embarrassed.

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.960
 Harrison Ford kept calling him Mother Superior on set,

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.960
 and he felt very old and out of touch.

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.040
 It was the thing that everyone really knew him for,

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.200
 and people started to treat him as a kind of agony

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.360
 aren't for it, because Obi-Wan Kenobi is a kind of wise being.

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.640
 I've only seen Star Wars once.

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.560
 I think he's like a wise man, right?

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.600
 I reckon he must be.

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.680
 He wears a cloak, doesn't he?

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.240
 Yeah, he's wise.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.080
 There's no one who wears a cloak who isn't wise.

00:55:59.080 --> 00:55:59.640
 No.

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.920
 There you go.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.320
 Please write in with your examples of people who aren't.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.240
 But yeah, people used to write to him and say,

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.920
 "Please, can you give me advice on this?"

00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.480
 He said, "An example of a request I would typically get,"

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.080
 so there's an interview, is, you know,

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.520
 a married couple wrote to me once saying,

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.040
 "We're having problems in our relationship.

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.680
 Can you come and live with us and sort them out for us, please?"

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.240
 Oh, my God, that's a proposition, though, isn't it?

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:22.200
 Yeah, that's a bit of a gotschfinger vibes, isn't it?

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.240
 The thing is, if you've played Hamlet, Shiloh, Macbeth, you know,

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.840
 and then you've played Obi-Wan,

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.080
 you must feel a bit like you've slummed it, you know,

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.000
 because he was one of the great classical stage actors

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:31.800
 of the 20th century.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.720
 Like, he took it really, really, really seriously.

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.120
 He did.

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.080
 His art, you know.

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.040
 Well, as many people say,

00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.200
 not as good a stage actor as the true great.

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.560
 A level below the Olivier's and the Gilgames, according to some.

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.440
 Oh, wow.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:42.920
 This is great.

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:43.640
 This is the slam.

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:44.280
 Oh, my goodness.

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.160
 Sick burn.

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.120
 Even he said, "I'm really only suited to smaller parts."

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.320
 It was very modest, wasn't he?

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:49.880
 Wow.

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.280
 Okay.

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.800
 I did find a bad review of his stuff.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.440
 It mentions both podcast, Adolf Hitler,

00:56:54.440 --> 00:57:00.360
 where a film he was in called Hitler the Last 10 Days from 1973,

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.240
 and the telegraph said,

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.920
 "In Hitler the Last 10 Days, Guinness,

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.160
 having discovered through his usual assiduous research

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.760
 that Hitler was a boring man,

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.760
 unfortunately succeeded brilliantly

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.840
 in bringing this interpretation to the screen."

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.440
 I'm not going to ask you a quick quiz question.

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.360
 Quite a neat quiz question, maybe.

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:19.880
 But Anna Guinness played Lawrence of Arabia

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:20.200
 in--

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:20.920
 Okay.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:21.400
 Okay.

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.720
 In what did he play Lawrence of Arabia?

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.920
 Oh.

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:26.760
 Was it in Lawrence of Arabia?

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.280
 It wasn't James.

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.800
 God, you've played a fool of yourself.

00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:30.360
 Have I?

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.400
 He played King Faisal in Lawrence of Arabia.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.120
 But bizarrely, two years before the film Lawrence of Arabia--

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.800
 Lawrence of Arabia.

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:38.600
 It's all right.

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:39.160
 Sorry.

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.520
 It's the version I accidentally watched.

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:45.240
 I can see why this shocked audience is in 1960, actually.

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:50.280
 There's your episode title.

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.320
 It's so nice, isn't it?

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.520
 When it just--

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:55.160
 I can't call it "Nurse" because it's Lawrence of Arabia.

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:56.600
 It just falls right into your lap, you know?

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.080
 Do you even see sounds that have pittance?

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:02.040
 Okay.

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.440
 Before he starred in Lawrence of Arabia two years earlier,

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:09.800
 he played Lawrence of Arabia in a play called "Ross."

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.640
 So he played him.

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.480
 And then they were casting for Lawrence of Arabia,

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.640
 and they were said, "Do you want to be in Lawrence of Arabia?"

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.040
 Yeah.

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.080
 What a strange name for a movie about Lawrence of Arabia.

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.040
 Yes.

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:22.600
 They named it after that guy from France who put flour on his legs.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:29.160
 Okay.

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:29.640
 That is it.

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.520
 That's all of our facts.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.040
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:35.240
