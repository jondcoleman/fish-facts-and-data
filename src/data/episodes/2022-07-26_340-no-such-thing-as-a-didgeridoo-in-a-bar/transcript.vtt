00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.200
 you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.280
 James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tachinsky, and once again we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go, starting

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.840
 with you, Andy. My fact is that along with their drink New Yorkers in Bars used to be served a

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:54.720
 sandwich full of rubber. What? Yummy. Yummy. Why on earth would that be? Well this is a sort of

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.840
 legal loophole that bars had to jump through in order to serve their customers. So it's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.200
 sort of something called the Reigns Law basically. People were trying to curb public drunkenness

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.400
 in the 1890s in America and in particular in New York and this politician called John Reigns got

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.400
 this law passed which was designed to put nasty bars out of business. So there were various,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.760
 you know, the cost of a liquor license tripled and you had to keep your curtains open on a Sunday

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.080
 so that police officers could host all sorts of things. Wow. The law was partly designed to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.600
 shut down Sunday drinking and that was very annoying for people and for bars because it was

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.640
 the most profitable day of the week and it was most people's only day off. But there was a loophole

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.080
 in the law where if you were serving a meal you could serve a drink with it any day of the week

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.520
 as long as you were a lodging house with ten rooms or more, okay? So all these bar owners

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.800
 suddenly teamed up with lodging houses and they opened just one room on the ground floor in the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.480
 basement. They said, "Oh, this is a dining room for an establishment. This is not a bar at all."

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.520
 And they said they were serving meals to the guests at the lodging houses and what the meal

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.720
 consisted of was the single sandwich which would sometimes have a little puck of rubber in the

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.480
 middle or it would sometimes just be a weak old sandwich which you would get given with your drink

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.440
 and the barman said, "There, there's your meal." And then they take away the sandwich immediately.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.560
 Like they'd leave it there for two seconds and they'd take it away to the next table

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.640
 and it would be served to whoever else had also ordered a meal with their drink.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.200
 And that was the loophole. I read that sometimes the sandwich was either a rock or a brick between

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.760
 two slices of bread. Yeah, that's taking the piss out of the loophole a bit, right? It is taking

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.600
 the piss and yet they went to court over it and they said, "Well, no, it looks like they are serving

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.560
 a meal." So I don't know who the judge was for that case but yeah. Yeah, there was actually,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.600
 there was an incident I think where in about 1902 police were called to a bar because there was a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.200
 massive brawl two guys about to kill each other and one of the people was a customer who'd been

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.800
 genuinely hungry so he'd ordered a sandwich and the innkeeper had brought him the sandwich and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.880
 then tried to take it away and the customer started eating it and been like, "I've ordered a sandwich,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.560
 mate." And the innkeeper said, "No, no, you don't understand. We don't really eat these." And it

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.320
 ended up in a huge fight and the law enforcement arrived and said, "Look, there's been a misunderstanding.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.840
 It's just pretend sandwiches here. Give it back to the barman and we won't prosecute you for trying

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.560
 to eat your restaurant lunch." Wow, so funny. That's brilliant. I love how much this backfired

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 on John Reigns who put this law in place for the Sunday drinking for the fact that the sandwich

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.400
 itself became known as the Reigns sandwich. Yeah. The fact that all these new establishments

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.120
 that opened up in order to use that loophole to their advantage were called Reigns hotels.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.120
 I mean, they really slapped this guy in the face with his own dickhead law.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.280
 Yeah. And it was bad as well because not only did the number of hotels rock it,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.560
 so Brooklyn went from having 13 actual hotels to having 800 hotels in six months, which is insane,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.520
 but there were lots of beds nearby, obviously, so it led to lots of casual sex and prostitution

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.920
 happening because you got really, really drunk not eating your sandwiches and then there was a

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.160
 bedroom right upstairs. Yeah, they had to have a minimum of 10 rooms, didn't they? Yeah. But they

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.800
 tended to be just tiny little boxes with a bed in there. Yeah. I just want to say for the people

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.320
 at home because Andy is doing a really good job of saying it with his voice, but he is actually

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:36.800
 doing the imaginary quote marks every time he does, like, say, "hotel or sandwich." I certainly am.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.600
 James. Do it again. Do you think the rubber sandwiches is the origin of all American cheese

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.480
 today? Oh, a sick burn on American cheese. Yeah. There is still a kind of Reigns sandwich today,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.920
 and it's been brought in this year in New York. This is really exciting new stuff. So it's because

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.840
 of the coronavirus, New York introduced rules about serving alcohol when you can get a proper drink,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.960
 and it said you have to order food. There is a bar in Buffalo, New York, which has a food menu,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.840
 and, sorry, hang on, let me just say that again, a food menu. There we are. It includes items like

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.720
 just a few grapes, nine French fries, and literally the smallest piece of cheesecake you'll ever see,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.920
 and they all cost a dollar, and they're all technically food, and they're designed to get

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.600
 around safety legislation, which is really meant to be helping the situation.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.800
 What's the idea, sorry, with the safety? Is that so no one can share your food?

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.360
 I think it's because they don't want loads of people going to bars all the time,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.800
 but they don't mind people going to restaurants a bit.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.760
 I think that's the design. It's not because people sharing food is leading to the spread of the virus.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.120
 It could be to stop the obesity crisis if everyone's only eating the smallest piece of cheesecake

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.720
 you've ever seen. Absolutely. Getting one grape for dessert, but no one else is going to finger that

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.080
 one grape if that's all you've got, so it's good for the German folks. The bars in late 19th century,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.120
 New York, sound pretty amazing, these places. Apparently the earliest ones that were in the

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.840
 Bowery area of New York, they didn't have glasses, they just had a barrel of beer or booze, some kind

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.680
 of booze, and what you did is you would pay three cents, and they would give you a rubber tube,

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.880
 and for your three cents you were allowed to drink until you ran out of breath.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:41.760
 And so what people learn how to do is, you know, like some musicians can do this circular breathing,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.000
 which means you can play notes for longer and longer. Some people learned how to do that,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.280
 so they didn't have to breathe through their mouths, they could just breathe through their

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.840
 noses, and they could just drink more and more and more. That's so funny. You'd have to ban anyone

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.080
 who belonged to an orchestra from entering your bar. See a bunch of guys with didgeridoo's turning

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:08.000
 up. No, absolutely not. Out you go. Out. Yeah, the Bowery sound amazing, right? Like back in the

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.160
 19th century, it was just packed with so many bars that went outdoor, and it was largely men playing

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.280
 cards and drinking and having little meals and so on. And I've actually been to…

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.600
 I remember that in Gangs of New York. There's a whole seat where someone has a little meal,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.080
 isn't there? I remember that. I love the fight and the tap-ass joint in Gangs of New York.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:38.160
 Lee and I, the Caprio, digs into a canapé. I've been to the Bowery. I don't know if you guys

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.640
 have that sort of area of New York. I've actually performed there. I did a performance as a drag

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.960
 queen. I had to create a drag queen character. I was called Danomite. Yeah, I was Danomite.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.440
 It came with that explosion sound. And there's still the remnants of this kind of awesome

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.400
 bohemianness about it, which I imagine what these 19th century bars must have been like,

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.400
 you know, this kind of wild sort of outlawy kind of place.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.520
 Can we go back to your drag career briefly? Yeah. And you have to do it. It's quite

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:17.280
 cocketish that name. I think Danomite. Oh, yeah. I was interviewing a famous drag act in America,

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:24.480
 in New York. And as part of the interview, she, as Linda, suggested that I experience it. So she

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.720
 made me come up with a character. She dressed me up. And then we did this big bingo night at the

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:36.560
 Bowery. And I was Danomite. Oh, was that part of the name, actually? Would that have been in your

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.560
 passport? It would have said Danomite and then open brackets, head explodes. Close brackets.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.440
 No, no, it's explosion. It's not head explodes. It's just the way you did for people at home.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.440
 Dan did the head exploding gesture. Yes. Sorry, that is confusing for the listeners as well.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.160
 A lot of this show has so far relied on some visuals that we're going to mean nothing to anyone.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:07.040
 You might have fit in quite nicely at Billy Mcglory's Armory Hall, Dan, which was the hardest

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:13.920
 chorus of all the bars in New York in that time. So whenever you went there and got drunk, you

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:20.000
 would basically always get robbed. That was just known that that would happen. And it would be by

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.560
 either the female regulars or Billy Mcglory used to hire men dressed as women to go and

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.560
 rob people in the bar. So you would get, basically, you would get robbed and then they would drag you

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.160
 from your table. A bouncer would drag you from the table. They would throw you out in the street.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.480
 And then when you were outside, the bouncer would try and get anything else that was left on you.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.640
 And then if there was anything left at all, the people walking past would get it. And then if

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.880
 you didn't have anything, they would steal your clothes. So basically, you would just, oh, if

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.040
 you got drunk there, you would end up naked outside without your phone, without your wallet,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.200
 without anything. Why do people go to this pub? Why do they keep going to the pub?

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:03.760
 It was well known as being an extremely kind of rough place that locals would go. And it was

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.240
 the people from out of town that would get the treatment. But a lot of people would go because

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.920
 there was like a balcony upstairs because it kicked off so often in this pub that people would pay to

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.720
 sit in the balcony so they could watch the fights happening. Wow. Isn't that amazing?

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.280
 I was just looking at, I was looking a little bit at the Temperance Movement in Britain, which was

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.920
 also quite strong around these parts. So America didn't have a monopoly on it. And this is throughout

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.840
 the 19th century. And William Gladstone, who was obviously Prime Minister multiple times,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.920
 tried to temper people's alcohol consumption and drunkenness by encouraging people to sell wine

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.720
 and encouraging the wider consumption of wine, in fact. And it was because everyone was drinking

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:47.200
 spirits. And he thought that this would be encouraging, more sophisticated sort of drinking,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:54.720
 which we all know is always successful. But he also made it so that food shops and grocers

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.960
 didn't need a license to sell alcohol. So they could all start selling alcohol. And again,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.080
 this was to encourage people not to get so drunk because he wanted to end what he called the unnatural

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:10.640
 divorce between food and alcohol. So the idea is that you either go to a bar or you go to a grocery

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.680
 shop. So people just get really drunk without eating. But the controversial thing about the

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:21.840
 grocers was that it meant that women would be able to buy alcohol. So obviously, if you could only

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.360
 buy alcohol in bars, a bit risque for a woman to go to a bar, definitely not on her own. But if

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.360
 they were going on a food shop, they could buy a bottle of wine. And there's paper written on it,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.520
 which said obtaining alcohol from a licensed grocer is regarded as perfectly acceptable

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.160
 if women are using it for dining, cooking and entertaining. However, there are concerns that

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:47.520
 some women are purchasing alcohol for their own personal use. So extremely controversial.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.440
 Wow. Just while we're on the boundary, I did find one or two more good names of bars that were in

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.280
 the bar in the late 19th century. There was the Burnt Rag, there was Chick Trickers Flea Bag,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:06.880
 and McGurk Suicide Hall. Now, I can't work out exactly why McGurk Suicide Hall was so named,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:13.600
 but it was the first ever bar to deploy an armed bouncer. And his name was Eat Him Up,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.360
 Jack McManus. It sounds like a wrestler, doesn't it? He does. He absolutely does. I think he basically

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.320
 was. He was repeatedly arrested for assault. And yet, every time it came to do an actual police

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.600
 lineup, people mysteriously had an attack of amnesia when they were asked to point out which

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.080
 absolutely thug is the one who beat you up. Some of the most famous bouncers around that time in

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:40.240
 New York were women. There was one called Gallus Meg, and I'll read you this quote about her.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:46.320
 "It was her custom after she'd felt an obstreperous customer with her club to clutch his ear between

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.160
 her teeth and drag him to the door amid the frenzy cheers of onlookers. Though she would

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.280
 knock you out with a club and they grab your ear with her teeth and drag you by the ear with her

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.800
 teeth. And then what would happen is if the victim tried to fight back, she would bite the ear off

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.960
 and then they would put it in a jar and they would keep all the ears behind the bar."

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:13.520
 What? No! This didn't happen. I'm telling you this happened. This happened because she had an

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:19.440
 enemy who was another female bouncer known as Sadie the Goat. Okay? And Sadie the Goat once had

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.680
 her ear bitten off by Gallus Meg in 1869. And she had to leave the area in disgrace because she'd

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.080
 been kicked out of this bar and she'd lost the fight to Gallus Meg. And she walked down to the

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.040
 waterfront and she saw a few people trying to kind of rob a boat and they were failing quite

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.800
 badly and she was like, "Okay, I'm going to help you guys out here." And she helped them to rob this

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.400
 boat and then they decided to take over the boat, put a Jolly Roger on the front of it,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.600
 and sail up and down the river just stealing things from people and kidnapping people and

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:56.320
 becoming like pirates. And they did this for quite a few weeks until eventually the locals decided

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.200
 to get guns and stop them from doing it. And so once she'd done all that and finished all that,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:07.280
 she went back to the bar where Gallus Meg was and kind of made up with her. And Gallus Meg gave her

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.320
 her ear back, which she always wore in the lockets around the neck for the rest of her life. Wow!

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.120
 Wow! So she labelled the jars of whose ear as well? I mean, because that's... If you're wearing an

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.960
 earring, you would know which one was yours, wouldn't you? Awesome. There we go. I think I'd

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.200
 recognise my own ear in a jar of his. Do you think you'd have to go to the bar and show them your

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:31.440
 other ear and say, "Have you got one that looks like this?" Yeah, exactly. Have you got a size

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:38.480
 8? And go into the back. I'd be like, "I'm sorry, this is all we have left." Twice the size. It was

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:48.640
 a really big dude. Did you know they used to flavour drinks with dead rats during temperance

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.760
 and prohibition? Yeah. Oh, during prohibition? What, to put people off? No, to put people,

00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:01.200
 to turn people on. Well, I don't know how to turn them. Well, there you go. Bars had to come up,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.840
 or Speekies had to come up with such imaginative ways of simulating the taste of what had been

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.840
 legitimate alcohol, because they were getting all their alcohol from sort of petrol and,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.680
 you know, these cat-stove fuel and like ink-used alcohol to make it. So you had to try and make

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.200
 that taste a bit like gin. And so apparently, to simulate the flavour of bourbon, you added

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.360
 dead rats or rotten meat to moonshine and you let it sit for a few days. That's true. Wow.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.120
 Apparently so, then you take it out. And similarly, to simulate scotch, you wanted a smoky flavour,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.960
 and apparently there was creosote, which is like an antiseptic made from tar,

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.760
 and that would make it taste nice and smoky. Wow. But the temperance movement is still going

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:49.200
 strong in the US, in various states. I mean, like Utah, if you try and buy alcohol in Utah,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.720
 it's not pill slog sometimes. I didn't know that Utah, until 2017, every single bar had to have

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.320
 not an iron curtain, but a Zion curtain. Are you familiar with this? I wasn't,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.040
 but I saw this as well. It's amazing, isn't it? It's incredible. It's crazy. So basically,

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.400
 it's a barrier, has to be erected between customer and bartender, so that no customers can see any

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.840
 of the drinks being poured or mixed. And the idea is that it protects young people and innocent

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:21.040
 people from the glamour of bartending and drinking. Right. And so, you just sit at a bar and you've

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.320
 got this big perspex shield in your face all the time. Yeah, it's always like frosty glass,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.560
 isn't it? So you can't see them. Are you like, it looks like they're holding a rat. What is that?

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.680
 All they need to do to stop the glamour of bartending is just introduce

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.800
 weather spoons to Utah. No one will see the impossible glory of drinking there.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.040
 Imagine if they filmed cocktail in Utah, and they had Tom Cruise doing all these dances,

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.520
 but you can't see it because there's a frosty screen in front of them.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.480
 Do you think every time you order a Hendricks, they actually just chuck a Gordon's in?

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.080
 Because you're not going to know, are you? No. Yeah, I bet they never say,

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.080
 "It's Pepsi, okay." But you are to go.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:10.800
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.760
 My fact this week is that dead fish can swim upstream.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:23.760
 Absolutely insane. And this, I have to say thank you to someone called Robert Teeling,

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.880
 who sent me a link to this ages ago, and I came across it again. And basically,

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:34.320
 this was sort of discovered by mistake a few years ago when scientists at MIT and Harvard

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:40.160
 were looking at how trout cope when they're swimming upstream but behind an obstacle.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.520
 So imagine if you're in the water and you've got a rounded obstacle in front of you,

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.760
 that deflects some of the current. So it goes around the sides of you. So it's a bit easier

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.560
 like a slipstream kind of thing. A bit like a slipstream. Yeah, exactly. And so they were

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.400
 looking at like putting live trout in the water and seeing how that worked. And then

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.400
 according to this article, they unintentionally, that's those quote marks again,

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:06.400
 they unintentionally put a dead trout in the water behind this rounded objects.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:12.560
 And they were completely amazed to see it swam upstream. So it swam towards this obstacle,

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.680
 but properly sort of like swimming, like you would see a fish swim. And then eventually,

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.640
 it would get really, really close. And then you're in sort of a suction region,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.560
 which really is like a slipstream, where it got sucked into the obstacle,

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.000
 bounced back and landed back where it started and swam towards it again.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.920
 Yeah. And just kept doing this.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.280
 There's a video online, you can see of it, right? It's pretty amazing.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.480
 It's basically like a zombie fish, really.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.800
 It's pretty mad that that's actually dead.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:44.240
 Isn't it the case though that so if you were, say, by a river bed and there was

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:50.000
 fish swimming upstream, most likely it is alive because it's...

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.560
 I think that is true, yeah. I read that as well.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.600
 Most fish that you see swimming are alive, yeah.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.880
 It's important not to let this kind of misinformation get out without correcting...

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.960
 You don't want people going down to the river with their friends and family just going,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.960
 "See that fish that's swimming dead? Do that one? Probably dead as well."

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.880
 No, something as alive fish turns out.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:19.200
 Yeah. But also, the circumstances, like they were saying that when they put the dead trout in,

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.320
 it happened to land in the sweetest of sweet spots that if it was in any other conditions,

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.360
 that never would have happened. So again, it's sort of,

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.720
 you just wouldn't probably see that in nature ever, really.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.240
 Well, I think you might do a bit. So the way it works is some very complicated fluid dynamics,

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.360
 but I think very simplified. When you've got kind of a rounded object in water and you've got a

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:47.360
 current going past it, as the current goes past it, it generates these little vortexes of water.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:53.120
 And what seems to be happening is that this pattern of spiralling vortexes makes the fish

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:58.720
 spine move in a specific way that sort of propels it. So fish are very flexible spines.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.840
 And these vortexes sort of give energy to the fish. The fish takes energy from the vortexes

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.400
 and then swims upstream. But yeah, you do have to be in a particular place and fish,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.120
 yeah, there aren't loads of dead fish jumping upstream to source.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.760
 But it does mean that a fish could swim with no effort, doesn't it?

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.960
 A fish could not use its muscles at all. And it would still,

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.760
 if it was in this right spot, get upstream, which is pretty cool.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.680
 And so it's incredibly useful to fish this phenomenon because, yeah, they're incredibly

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.000
 sensitive. So they can tell the movement of water behind certain rocks. So they'll sort of

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.240
 sense the vortexes that are behind a rock and then they can swim towards that rock.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.840
 And that'll mean that they have to expend much less energy because the rock just sort of sucks

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.880
 them towards it. It's very useful. One thing in looking into this fact that I never realised,

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.160
 and probably you three did know this, but so a fish swims, as we all know, I'm doing it with

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:56.800
 my hands here, but in the sort of fishy motion, right? It's sort of... You've explained it perfectly,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.920
 yeah. So its spine allows for it from its head to its tail. It's a sort of...

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.720
 It's a wave. It's a landscape. Yeah, it's like landscape mode. But for mammals...

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.640
 It's a landscape mode. It's not a portrait mode.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.120
 What?

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.000
 Sea horses are in portrait mode. Sea horses are portraits, especially in landscape.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.120
 We're finding it very hard to describe this. The spines go along, whereas for mammals,

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.160
 so dolphins and so on, the spines go like our spines. So they move up and down,

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:31.440
 as opposed to left to right, as it were. So your spine on a dolphin goes along the very

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.520
 top of the dolphin, right? Whereas in the fish, it goes right through the middle of the fish.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:40.400
 Is that what you're saying? Exactly. And that's the distinction between what is a fish and what is

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.320
 a mammal in the ocean. And I'd never realised that before, and that's why their fins are

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.040
 positioned differently as well on their body. Yeah, that's very cool. So fish wouldn't be able

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.120
 to do butterfly stroke, for instance, would they? Is butterfly the fastest or is it the slowest?

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.560
 I can't remember. It's got to be the slowest. It's not the breaststroke.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:04.240
 I think it's in between. It's neither. It is fast. But it's not as fast as front crawl,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:10.320
 for instance. Okay. I was reading about Michael Phelps' top speed, is why there is method here.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.760
 You sort of said an incorrect fact that wouldn't have even been that interesting if it were correct.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:21.120
 It's going to bring him onto this very interesting fact that he's about saying about Michael Phelps.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.440
 Front-loading pressure onto my bad facts before I said that. Thank you.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.120
 Sorry, please. Go on.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.280
 It was just, I was just kind of amazed at how crap at swimming we are relative to fish,

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:39.040
 because the fastest fish swim at about 70 miles an hour. The fastest submarines don't even do

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.880
 that much, and some of them are nuclear power. They go at about 50 miles an hour, absolute top speed.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:48.720
 Wow. Michael Phelps, maybe the greatest swimmer of all time, can do about 4.7 miles an hour,

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.040
 and he can do that for 100 meters, and then he has to stop.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.280
 Andy, you're saying top speed of a fish was what, through that?

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.720
 I said 70 miles an hour.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.880
 70 miles an hour, and that's, yeah, so the very fastest ones, obviously.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.120
 Yeah, exactly. There's a few amazing fast ones, so swordfish and sailfish and so on.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.440
 I was looking at a list of the fastest fish. My favorite one, just for its name,

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.480
 because of its speed, and I don't know if the name is tied in with the speed, but it's called the Wahoo.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:26.000
 It has to be right. It has to be that it's just like, it's just having a great time.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.760
 And is it particularly fast?

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:33.760
 Yeah, yeah. It goes just under a few miles an hour under the fastest speed of fish.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.760
 Have you ever seen a fish treadmill?

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.720
 Oh, God. Almost every week, whenever an animal were discussing, they seem to go on a treadmill,

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.360
 don't they? I'm starting to feel a little bit self-conscious that I don't go on treadmills,

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.760
 because every other animal that the animal kingdom seems to.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.680
 I think whenever we discuss an animal on this podcast, we shouldn't mention if it's been

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.160
 on a treadmill, but we should always mention if it hasn't. That's the interesting fact at this point.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.280
 Ants have never been on treadmills.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.280
 That's a good point.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.760
 Go on. What are they doing on treadmills?

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.040
 Well, obviously, it's not a rubber treadmill, as we would understand it,

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.760
 but it's for scientists to experiment on how fish propel themselves, so they have to get a,

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.040
 you know, a tank with a current flowing in one direction.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:21.440
 And they then put plastic particles in the water, and they record where they go as the fish swims,

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.920
 so you can kind of see how the fish is thrusting, so you can see the directions

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.440
 that all the water is moving as well.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.800
 So it's like one of those things in a water park where you sit on a rubber ring,

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.080
 and it just takes you slowly around the water park, like that kind of thing,

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.760
 like a lazy river.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.440
 Yes, but except in this version of the water park, you are having to resist the flow of the current

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.640
 to keep yourself in the same place for hours on end.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.880
 Okay, but that's when you're on those things.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.160
 If you don't have a rubber ring, the best thing is to try and beat the currents,

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.600
 isn't it? You're really trying to swim as fast as you can against the current,

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.400
 and then normal people on the rubber rings are going, "What the fuck are you doing?

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.240
 This is a rubber ring thing."

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.440
 They're like, "No, that's fun."

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.200
 Aren't you being clocked by people in rubber rings coming past you and banging into you as you go?

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.400
 Yeah, that's the problem, actually.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.960
 This is why you're not allowed to go to sliding splash anymore, James.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.600
 That's the reason.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.400
 So many reasons.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.800
 And so they've just found a load of new fish that can actually walk on land.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.600
 I think we've always known there were one or two of these.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.800
 They've just looked at a bunch of fish and looked at the way their pelvic bones are,

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:32.320
 and they've worked out that there's at least 11 species of fish that definitely can walk on land.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:32.880
 So cool.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.360
 They're not good at walking though, are they?

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.320
 They're not as good as us.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.480
 Like when you see a seal on the sand, sort of flapping its fins around.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.600
 Well, I think that's the thing, I think why Andy was a little bit unfair about Michael Phelps,

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.160
 because it's not like fish are able to run as quickly as us.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.960
 So why are we expected to be able to swim as fast as them?

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.200
 There should be a competition which is to work out the species on earth,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.960
 which is least crap at everything.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.120
 The best all-rounder.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:01.760
 The best all-rounder, exactly.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:07.120
 It must be a kind of bird, right, because nothing else can fly.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.600
 So you're not actually a flying fish.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.560
 A flying fish.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.720
 Oh, come on, it's not flying, it's just sort of jumping quite high.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.480
 Are they quite good?

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:23.520
 They put flying fish in a what they call the wind tunnel quite recently, some scientists.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.560
 It was a dead one, but they filled it with stuff to make it like as sturdy as an alive one.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.600
 And they found out that the way that it collides is actually almost as good as some of the best

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.040
 gliders in the avian kingdom.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.520
 There we go.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.560
 That's a strong contender.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.560
 They can fly, they can swim when they're dead.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.480
 This is a very strong contender.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.320
 There must be a bird which can swim really pretty well.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.280
 I was thinking ducks.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.000
 I mean, they're pretty shit at everything, aren't they?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.160
 They're shit at walking, they're shit at swimming, and they're not great at flying.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.560
 But they can do all of them.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:01.840
 Yeah, I think actually the duck is a very strong contender for this incredibly boring.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.960
 Well, it's felt, you know, that's probably where the sprinting actually.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.120
 I don't know, Phelps is going to be the human rep for the thing.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.080
 I'm just sort of felling him in.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.720
 Because if you think about it, the triathlon, which is swimming, running, and cycling,

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.880
 the cycling bit is a bit of a fake.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.080
 I mean, it's a fake spot, isn't it?

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.200
 We invented the bicycle.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.400
 It's not natural.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.640
 It should be swimming, running, and flying the triathlon.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:34.400
 Although it would be fun to put a trout on a bicycle and see how it fared in a triathlon.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.800
 The British government has its own fish farm, which I didn't know.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.760
 And it breeds tons and tons of fish every year, just to fill up ponds around the place.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.400
 It's really cool.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.240
 Why do they fill up?

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:50.400
 Well, there are all these sort of bodies of water, which, you know, I don't know.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.920
 Is it for fishers?

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.240
 It's partly for fishermen, but it's also partly, I think, for general health,

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.800
 and to keep species in good nick.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.080
 But it's called the National Corse Fish Farm.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.040
 And last year, they produced 12.3 tons of fish to put in rivers and ponds.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.680
 They released 7.6 million fish.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.760
 And they're just sending bags around the country of fish and buckets of fish.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.880
 And then you get to release hundreds and hundreds of them into a river.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.000
 It looks really fun.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.880
 And they do fish rescue as well.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:26.800
 Because sometimes the hot weather will cause rivers to flow very low,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.800
 or oxygen levels will drop.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.040
 And this can be fatal to fish, which needs certain levels of oxygen in the water.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.200
 So they have to go, and they either relocate the fish,

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.320
 or they pump oxygen into the water in these places.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.120
 Really?

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:39.520
 I know.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.200
 I want to find out more about these people,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.920
 because this sounds like a really cool government body to fish rescue.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.840
 The government gets a lot of stick these days,

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.840
 but no one's saying about how they're pumping oxygen into water.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.600
 Right. No one talks about the National Corse Fish Farm,

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.120
 and I think it's a damn shame.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.280
 Is that how fish get at lakes?

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.400
 Because I've always wondered.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.760
 Because, I mean, how do they get there?

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.600
 You know, you see a lake, and it's a relatively new one.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.200
 It's only been around for a few hundred years.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.160
 It's full of fish.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.960
 What the fuck's it done?

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.520
 I mean, it hasn't walked, because we've discussed that they are quite bad at walking,

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.720
 even if they can do it a bit.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.240
 Mental.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.160
 You get a tarn up in the lake district.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:14.640
 I guess.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.840
 But lakes which don't have a, you know,

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.080
 lakes which don't have any waterways moving into them.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.320
 Yeah.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.680
 Maybe it's the National Corse Fish Rearing Unit.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.480
 That's what it is.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.600
 Could be God.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:30.480
 Although, you know, like, what is God if it's not really, in some ways,

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.720
 the Fish God is the National Corse River lake fish thing.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.720
 Well, we've really, we've built up this government body.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.880
 Not only is it cool, but it's also God-like.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.160
 Salmon and trout, very good at swimming upstream,

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.840
 kind of as discussed, but they have to be, right?

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.360
 This is why this is so useful,

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.440
 this fact that they can even do it when they're dead,

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.680
 because they swim all the way back upstream to spawn in their place of birth,

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.280
 and they actually do that by smelling.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.960
 So they have stored in their brain the smell of their home.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.680
 So where they're born, they swim all the way down the street,

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.640
 and they retain it.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.720
 And then when they get to breeding stage,

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.080
 something is triggered in their brain,

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.560
 which makes them desperately want to return to that smell.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.200
 Oh my God.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:14.320
 So does that mean it's like as if you could smell where you were conceived,

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.440
 and you go back to the place where you were conceived?

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.320
 Is that what that means?

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.040
 Yeah.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.600
 And one day you'll start lusting after that, James,

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.160
 crawling your way back to the hospital in Bolton, or...

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.160
 What was James conceived in a hospital?

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:31.360
 Yeah, that was it.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.080
 Yeah, it was inappropriate that they were doing that there.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.120
 Sorry.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.800
 They do it by, they sort of, if they go too far upstream,

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.920
 they lose the smell, and they have to go back downstream,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.360
 pick up the smell again, and then try and...

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.080
 It's like that game, sort of warmer, warmer, colder, colder, you know,

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.480
 and then eventually the smell is strong enough

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.680
 that you find exactly the tributary off the main river.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.800
 But they also need, this is one of the big arguments

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.480
 against reintroduction of beavers, you know,

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.120
 that's the latest great controversy in this country,

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:03.760
 and beavers obviously make dams.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.680
 That's the main one, actually, at the moment.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.160
 That's the main one.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.520
 I would say beavers first, Covid second, Brexit third.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.320
 Yeah.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.240
 How much oxygen's apart in the water, far?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.360
 Got to bump that up.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.760
 So beavers make dams,

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.320
 and so then salmon have to jump over those dams,

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.840
 and I didn't realise there's an exact equation

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.880
 for how deep the plunge pool in front of a dam has to be

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.920
 for a salmon to make it over the height of it.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.480
 So you need sort of a run-up, just like you do with anything.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.080
 They need a run-up from a great depth

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.000
 to propel themselves out of the water and over it,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.200
 and it needs to be exactly 1.25 or more,

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.000
 1.25 times the height of the dam.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.200
 That's how deep it has to be.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.040
 And yeah, at the moment,

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.800
 they're sort of thinking of reintroducing beavers

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.760
 in chalk streams where the plunge pools won't be that deep,

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.880
 and we'll just have lots of sort of dead salmon, I suppose.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.080
 Caught in the dams, yeah, yeah.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:54.880
 Caught in the dam.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.120
 How will we know that they're dead because they're still swimming?

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.120
 That's no way to tell.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.480
 I think salmon's might be as good at flying as ducks are at swimming.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.080
 Well, what's that sport at the Olympics,

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.960
 where you have to jump over the bars as you go down the 100 metres?

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.920
 The hurdles.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.400
 Hurdles.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.160
 If they've got this dam jumping all sorted.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.480
 Yeah, really good at hurdles in water.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.880
 Are they going along a dry track, then,

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.720
 or are they in water with hurdles?

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.440
 In the steeple chase, they have one water jump,

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.960
 which they would absolutely nail,

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.520
 all of the other ones they would really struggle.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.960
 My team's going to suck at this a little bit.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.960
 He's entered the salmon into the hurdles?

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.760
 Dan's team of the Hannibal Kingdom walking round,

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.320
 after all of the different countries of gone past.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.720
 Dan's there with the Hannibal Kingdom flag,

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.200
 with a trout mopping along behind him.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.880
 Well, at least they can train on all those treadmills before they get there.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.440
 That's true.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:33:00.560
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.160
 OK, my fact this week is that when the Berlin Wall fell,

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.840
 one of the results was an 18 million car traffic jam.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.160
 That's crazy.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.240
 18 million? Oh, my days.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.000
 That is a lot.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.440
 How many cars were there in Germany?

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.680
 Well, did everyone in Germany get in their cars and say,

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.800
 we've got to go and see this no longer existing wall?

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.680
 Everyone in East Germany pretty much did do that.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:31.200
 So I read an interview with some people who were in East Germany at the time,

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.640
 and they said that like everyone else, as soon as the wall fell,

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.240
 they got in their car and they decided that they were going to go to Berlin.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.800
 They said that the car radio traffic police told them,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:44.240
 whatever you are planning, do not try to drive to Berlin in the border.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.280
 There are a million cars on the road, you will never make it.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.480
 People did sort of, they just wanted to go and check it out, didn't they?

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.880
 So it wasn't just people in East Berlin just desperate to get to West Berlin.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.840
 Or vice versa, people were desperate to go with one exception,

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.080
 no, with lots of exceptions, but one famous exception.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.720
 So Angela Merkel was having a sauna when the wall came down.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.840
 Really?

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.720
 Yeah, she said, she knew it was going to happen.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.440
 She said, the atmosphere had been very tense for days.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.720
 I thought something was going to happen.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.040
 I heard the announcement, the borders were open,

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.280
 you know, wall was coming down, but it was Thursday,

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.000
 and Thursday's my sauna day, so that's where I went.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.440
 That is iron commitment to the sauna, that's incredible.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.440
 Wow, Dan, don't you own a bit of the Berlin wall?

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.880
 I do, yeah, I think.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.000
 I definitely have a bit of a Berlin wall.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.680
 I can't confirm it.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.520
 You own a small piece of concrete, yeah.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.280
 Yeah, yeah, James and I, when we were touring fish in Berlin,

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.480
 we went to see the wall.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.040
 So it's really interesting what is and isn't a bit of the wall,

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.760
 because it turns out there's one man who's basically cornered the market.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.960
 Really?

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.360
 He, yeah, he's called Volker Pavlovsky.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.600
 I think he was East German, and when the wall came down,

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.600
 he collected about 300 metres of it.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.160
 Well, mine's definitely fake then, Andy, because a woman sold me mine.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.800
 OK, he doesn't sell every end of his shoe to Pebble,

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.840
 but he, basically, you can tell.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.840
 So if it's fake, you can crumble it with your fingers,

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.960
 because of the particular concrete they used, I think.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.760
 But he does, he has admitted Pavlovsky,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.720
 he spray paints the bits he sells, which are authentic,

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.080
 and he has sold three tonnes of them.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.680
 And he says it matches the, he wants it to match the graffiti

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.960
 that was on the western side of the wall.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.400
 And he says packaging is everything Pavlovsky.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.920
 So he's patented his own method of attaching the Berlin wall

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.320
 a bit of it to a plastic globe and putting it in a postcard.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.840
 So, Dan, did you get that, was it?

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.840
 It's on a plastic hold, and mine is graffitied to sort of multiple colours.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.000
 So it sounds like you've got a sort of original bit of slightly retouched,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.120
 but basically, yeah.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.160
 Dan's actually says I love one direction in the graffiti.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.960
 When the Berlin wall fell, there was a lot of problems,

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.560
 like for the people in East Germany,

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.120
 because everyone kind of thinks of it as, OK,

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.920
 they were living in some, you know, terrible place,

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.120
 and it was opened up,

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.000
 and then suddenly they got all the advantages of the West,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.520
 which kind of was true.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.160
 But the problem is they weren't used to that.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.720
 And so all of their culture was suddenly taken over

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.600
 by this kind of European, Western European culture.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.800
 And a lot of the East Germans felt really overwhelmed,

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.000
 like massively overwhelmed.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.440
 So they didn't know how to pronounce the food in McDonald's.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.840
 They didn't know how supermarket trolleys worked.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.320
 They felt like this was their country,

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.160
 but they didn't know how to live in it.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.160
 I mean, no one knows how supermarket trolleys work.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.480
 Just spin round and round on the spot and then you crush it into someone.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.480
 It's physics can't explain it.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.680
 No one told them that you weren't supposed to know how they work, right?

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.520
 Oh, no, so sad.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.720
 I know. And so what happened was they kind of,

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.440
 they, the people in West Germany thought

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.440
 the East Germans were quite ungrateful

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.120
 because they were getting a lot of money

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.040
 and a lot of aid from the West,

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.560
 but they were kind of not really loving it very much.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.600
 And so the West Germans called the East Germans

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.000
 Yamarossis, meaning moaning Easterners.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.880
 So they just were like, "Oh, these guys are moaning."

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.440
 And the East Germans called the West Germans

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.000
 Bessavises, meaning know-it-all Westerners.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.840
 And so there was like,

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.800
 basically it took a lot of time for it all to become homogenized

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.120
 so that everyone was kind of knew what was going on.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.280
 I found that really interesting, really.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.240
 It is really interesting.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.320
 But yeah, traffic jams. They're fun, aren't they?

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.800
 Not really.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.760
 There's one in Indonesia that's quite famous.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.720
 It's kind of not so bad now because they fixed the road.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.360
 But it was on one of the main motorways

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.080
 and it was the exit for the city of Brebus.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.240
 And so locals called it the Brexit.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.280
 And apparently this is where they had the worst traffic

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.760
 in the whole of Indonesia over the last few years.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.200
 Wait, was it called the Brexit before we had a Brexit?

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.880
 I think it was named after that.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.040
 I think they saw that the English Brexit

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.680
 and thought, "Oh, we can name our massive traffic jam after that."

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.640
 Our catastrophic piler.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.520
 When no one knows where they're going or what they're doing.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.800
 "Oh, great. So nice to know we're still influencing global culture."

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.160
 There was a traffic jam in the Dartford Tunnel in 2006

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.760
 where a lorry driver hit a ventilation fan

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.400
 because he wasn't in the right part of the lane.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.640
 And that is known by motoring organizations as the Pratt.

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.240
 They always... What do you mean?

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.680
 It was like a really... The move.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.240
 No, it's like a really famous old traffic jam.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.120
 And whenever you're talking,

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.320
 whenever you're reminiscing about the olden days and the traffic jams,

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.120
 and one of the worst ones that they ever had in London was this one.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.480
 And it's known as the Pratt.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.760
 Why didn't they call it the shit?

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.440
 Because that would have been the shit hitting the fan.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.120
 Feels so right.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.640
 They needed you on branding.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.360
 It's all about branding.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.720
 I think my favorite traffic jam that I've read of,

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.320
 and it feels like this is...

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.240
 It feels potentially apocryphal,

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.480
 but in August of 1991,

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.760
 there was a two-mile traffic jam at the entrance of the Dartford Tunnel.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:59.600
 And it was caused because drivers weren't unable to go on due to laughter.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.920
 And what had happened was people were listening to the cricket that day.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.080
 People had heard Andy's joke about the shit

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.680
 hitting the fan in the Dartford Tunnel.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:12.080
 So August 1991, there was a cricket match on,

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.080
 and Ian Botham had leapt over the wickets,

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.360
 and he caught the bales and they went off and he was out.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.640
 And it led to Jonathan Agnew, Agra's,

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.000
 saying what has become one of the great cricket commentary moments

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.760
 of he couldn't get his leg over.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.920
 He didn't quite get his leg over was the line.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.480
 And to begin with, there's no laughter,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.320
 but the two of the commentators just start pissing themselves really hard.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.440
 I listened to it the other day,

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.880
 and you do laugh a lot when you listen to it as well.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.720
 So supposedly around the country,

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.760
 people were finding it so funny that they had to pull over in their cars,

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.480
 they had to stop.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.520
 And at the Dartford Tunnel,

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.360
 this guy was unable to pay the toll

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.120
 because he just couldn't stop laughing at this thing,

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.760
 and it ended up with a two-mile-long traffic jam.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:01.040
 Is that why they've now taken away the toll barriers in the Dartford Tunnel

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.640
 and replaced them with nothing,

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.640
 so you don't know there's any Dart Charge

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.640
 until you're hit with a fine two weeks later?

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.280
 Um, wow.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.720
 I think the podcast can be a bit personal.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.240
 Okay, sorry, I brought my personal line.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.840
 Allow us to do a legal history episode presented.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.280
 Just a funny cricket anecdote suddenly turned into a political…

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.480
 Look, it's a fucking outreach.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:23.200
 And I mean, there are lots of signs everywhere telling you how to pay it,

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:23.680
 but yeah.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.200
 Okay, we are going to have this debate later.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:25.920
 There are not.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.320
 Anyway, good story about cricket, Dan,

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.840
 because I've been waiting to get this complaint

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.080
 about the Dartford Tunnel in for like two years,

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.160
 and finally had the chance.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.840
 For international listeners, by the way,

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.360
 the Lego for thing is a sexual innuendo in Britain.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.320
 And cricket is a game between two teams of 11 players.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:49.200
 Yeah, and Dartford is a place where Anna shall not be visiting again.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.280
 Unless they sort themselves out.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:41:00.000
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.200
 and that is my fact.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.480
 My fact this week is that there's a stone marker in Wisconsin

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.800
 that commemorates the spot where Elvis Presley once successfully stopped a fight

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.760
 by jumping out of his limo, pulling some karate moves,

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.760
 and threatening to kick everyone's ass.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.920
 So it's this beautiful little marker.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.120
 It's on the corner of Highway 51 in East Washington Avenue,

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:25.680
 and this happened on June the 24th, 1977, at about 1 a.m.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.080
 He was riding in one of the two limousines

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:33.360
 that he and his posse travel in, and they saw these guys just fighting on the outside.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:40.720
 And Elvis is a, I believe he was 8th Dan Black Belt karate student who,

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.520
 so he knew his moves, he loved karate,

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.040
 and he thought, I want to stop this fight.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.160
 But he wanted to stop it by fighting them himself.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.760
 So he jumped out, and he engaged all the people in the fight

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.600
 with a sentence saying, "I'll take you on,"

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.840
 and then showed some karate moves.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.000
 They all recognized that it was him, and thought,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.440
 "Oh my God, it's such a chance to meet Elvis."

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.920
 So they stopped fighting, and came over and said, "Hi."

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.120
 And this was, you know, 52 days later, he died, Elvis, unfortunately.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.800
 -Not connected to this, though. -This is one of the last--

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.240
 -No. -Not connected to this, no.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:12.720
 He wasn't, yeah, he wasn't chased down 52 days later.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.680
 He didn't die after 52 days of constant fighting.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.000
 So it was really a toss-up, isn't it,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.760
 between whether the fight was stopped by him pulling his awesome karate moves,

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.520
 or the fact that he was Elvis Presley.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.760
 It's definitely that he was Elvis, it's definitely that he was Elvis.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.680
 But yeah, I mean, he was mad into karate.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.520
 A lot of people think that that side of Elvis was token, kind of,

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.800
 "Oh, let's give him Black Belt,"

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.760
 because he's shown up for one lesson, sort of honorary stuff.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.120
 He was really dedicated to it.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.920
 He started it when he was stationed in the war in Germany.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.760
 And that was 1958.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.440
 And it was his obsession all the way through to his death.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.720
 It got to the point where he was actually training kids

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.680
 to learn karate as well.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.160
 So he became a karate instructor himself.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.280
 Look, all you have to do, kids, is become Elvis Presley,

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.560
 and you will win any fight.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:11.200
 So this stone marker, it was put up on the 30-year anniversary

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.560
 of this historic event.

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.440
 And when they put it up, the local TV station re-enacted the fight

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.000
 as part of the ceremony, which sounds pretty cool.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.080
 And it was outside a gas station,

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.840
 which they hoped using this marker might bring some custom,

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.200
 but it closed and demolished about two years later.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.600
 So it didn't really work.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.400
 Yeah, not a perfect ending.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.080
 He loved defending himself with guns, though,

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.400
 we should say, as well as liking karate.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.240
 Elvis was also a gun maniac.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.200
 He would carry up to three guns on him at all times.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.480
 So there were one or two shows where a handgun

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.840
 would just fall out of his boot on stage.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.960
 And I think, because he was very worried about his safety,

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.400
 because a lot of guns in America,

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.560
 and he would have been a big target.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.400
 So I think he carried the gun on stage for that reason.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.640
 But obviously, the idea that he would ever

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.200
 get the chance to use it successfully during a show

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.680
 or to return fire if he was being shot at

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.000
 would have been a very foolish thing to do.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.720
 Although, is that why he sung "Don't Step on My Blue Suede Shoes"

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.280
 because that's a genuine warning, presumably.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.840
 I've got a life gun in there.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.480
 He turned up at the White House once,

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.080
 wanting to meet Richard Nixon, didn't he?

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.600
 And in fact, there's a famous photo of their meeting,

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.680
 because it was obviously a huge encounter.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.520
 I think the photo was something like the most requested

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.840
 from whichever institution is storing it.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.000
 It's something like the National Library of Congress,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.160
 which is Elvis and Nixon standing next to each other.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.520
 It's the most requested they've ever had in their archives.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.640
 But he wanted a drug enforcement badge

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.040
 from the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.160
 According to his daughter,

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.480
 it's because he believed that if he had the badge,

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.840
 he could turn up in any country,

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.720
 both wearing guns and carrying drugs, and that would be fine.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.320
 He turned up with a gun to give Richard Nixon,

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.480
 and he had to be kind of gently told,

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.360
 "We don't really let people just come along and say,

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.040
 "Even if they're Elvis, even if they're Elvis,

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.280
 "we don't let people with guns just walk up to the president

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.040
 "and say, 'I've got this for you.'"

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.800
 He, when he was in that fight,

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.600
 he was wearing a DEA kind of tracksuit.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.360
 That's how much he loved the Drug Enforcement Agency.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.680
 He cosplayed them all the time.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.320
 And so, yeah.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.040
 You're kidding.

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.240
 Yeah, no, honestly, yeah.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.480
 It's honestly like, I can't think of an equivalent.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.280
 It's like Stormzy wanting to work for the Home Office.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.960
 Just wearing like a suit and a briefcase.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.200
 Some stuff on plaques.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:37.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.760
 Yeah, me and stuff and markers.

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.720
 The blue plaque.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.640
 So, we have blue plaques all over London,

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.240
 and you get them all over the world, I think.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:49.520
 They were conceived in 1863 by a guy called William Ewert.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.520
 And he himself has a blue plaque, which is quite nice.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.720
 It's on Hanson Library, and it says,

00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:00.240
 "John Beard Singer and William Ewert's promoter of public..."

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:03.520
 Sorry, "John Beard Singer and William Ewert's promoter

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.040
 of public libraries lived here."

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.920
 So, he has to share it with another guy

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.040
 who lived in the place at the same time.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:09.680
 I read about that.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.720
 I thought that was rubbish for Paul William Ewert.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:16.960
 They should say, "William Ewert invented this thing."

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:17.520
 Yeah.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.000
 Or whatever.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:18.480
 Yeah.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.440
 Put it slightly better than that.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.400
 Maybe he'll get a second one.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.720
 They want to put it in the spot where he had the idea

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.480
 for the blue plaques, as they often do.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.000
 It was here that they had the idea.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.480
 Yeah, like, it's here where penicillin was first,

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.680
 you know, that kind of stuff.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.800
 Well, they've taken a long...

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.720
 If that's their plan, it has taken them a while.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.800
 They still haven't quite got around to it.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.800
 Have you heard of Sidney Lewis?

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.360
 He's got a blue plaque, and he is not very well known.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.880
 But I also read through just this big long list of people with plaques.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.960
 Sidney Lewis was the youngest British soldier

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.160
 in the First World War.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.680
 Guess how old he was when he signed up?

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.800
 Forty.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.640
 Twelve.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.000
 He was twelve.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.360
 He was four, Dan.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.240
 He was three four-year-olds in a large trench car.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:02.320
 They passed for twelve, which, happily,

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.840
 you could get into the war at twelve.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.320
 Four years old.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.600
 No, he signed up age twelve.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:08.000
 He fought for six weeks at the Somme.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.120
 Pretty serious stuff.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.880
 He got sent home after his mum sent a copy

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.280
 of his birth certificate to the war office and said,

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:18.240
 "That is my twelve-year-old son fighting in the war.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.000
 Please send him home."

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.520
 Pretty embarrassing for Sidney.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.240
 But anyway, he then rejoined in 1918,

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.440
 while the war was still going on.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.640
 As far as I can tell, he cannot have been older than fifteen

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.960
 the second time he signed up for the First World War.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.920
 Yeah, but at this stage, he has experience as well, though, doesn't he?

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.480
 You know?

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.360
 Yeah, that's true.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.560
 That's what he's doing.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:37.200
 Imagine.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.640
 Mind you, they all ripped into him.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.160
 They were like, "Well, you're the guy whose mum came

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.440
 and picked him up in the trenches."

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:47.600
 Anyway, he then was in the Second World War in bomb disposal,

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.480
 and then he owned a pub.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.760
 What a life.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.520
 What age did he own the pub?

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.640
 Fifteen.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:54.880
 Yeah.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.680
 Wow.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.200
 Are you guys familiar with the website Plaque to the Future?

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:01.520
 No.

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:06.480
 This is… There's a woman in Philadelphia who's set it up,

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.320
 and the essence behind it is that to get a blue plaque,

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.360
 it's actually quite difficult.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.880
 You have to jump through quite a lot of hoops

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.120
 to prove that it's necessary and you're famous enough.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.480
 And so she has designed these waterproof blue stickers,

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.960
 which look almost exactly like blue plaques.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.920
 But if you go to the website Plaque to the Future,

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:27.680
 you can just write your own memory and say where you want it put.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.600
 And you'll appear as a blue plaque.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.240
 And so in Philadelphia, there's, for instance,

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.680
 you've got a blue plaque on a telephone pole,

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.840
 and the inscription reads,

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.600
 "Derek B. was walking along Dickinson Street on July 2017

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.680
 when he saw a woman open her door,

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:46.400
 overhand throw a two-thirds eaten hot dog

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.760
 into this telephone pole, and close her door again."

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.280
 Derek has so many questions.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:52.880
 That's great.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.800
 That's really good.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.040
 There's another one.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.640
 I find this one really questionable.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.200
 So this one is in a park,

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.400
 and the headline is, "X girlfriend spotted.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.720
 PTM saw his ex-girlfriend here.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:07.840
 He felt weird about it.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.120
 She felt weird about it.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.720
 He asked her about her jewellery business,

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.640
 and it was obvious he didn't really care.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.080
 He now avoids this intersection."

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.520
 Now that's a slam because it's PT who's put the blue plaque there.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.040
 Do you know that for sure?

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.440
 Yes, because it says he avoids this intersection.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:24.000
 Did you know that she might hang around

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:24.880
 the intersection all the time?

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.320
 That's the only reason she knows

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.840
 that he avoids it these days.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:28.080
 That's a good point.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.840
 It might be written from her point of view,

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.560
 and she was saying,

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.040
 "He clearly didn't care about my jewellery business."

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.160
 Well, but then the headline is,

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.600
 "X girlfriend spotted."

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.080
 But you're right.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.640
 Maybe she was writing sort of from his perspective, but...

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.960
 It could have been one really nosy dog walker

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.040
 who was kind of walking past both of them

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.560
 and heard this story happening.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.600
 That's a really good point.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.040
 That's a really good point, yeah.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.720
 There's a cool one.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.960
 In the '70s, a plaque was laid down

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.600
 in a rail station in Kassel in Germany.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:57.920
 And it had on it on the 23rd of March, 1994,

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:01.600
 from 3 to 4 p.m., Dieter Meier will stand on this plaque.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.560
 And this was set down by this artist,

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.800
 and he was a Swiss musician and artist.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.200
 And so this was 1972.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.520
 And all those years later, 22 years later,

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.280
 there he was standing on the plaque from 3 to 4 p.m.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.360
 Just as part of this.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.120
 Yeah, in stylistic installation.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.720
 It was the artist who...

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.440
 Yeah, it was the guy who was the guy.

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.440
 It wasn't predicting someone else would turn up and stand on it.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.320
 No, no, no.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.840
 I mean, that would have been way cooler.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.480
 But so did a load of people kind of turn up?

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.400
 Like, probably hundreds of thousands of people

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.960
 were there to see this momentous thing happening,

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.880
 or did one or two losers kind of...

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.920
 I can't believe I missed it.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.680
 I know.

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.960
 You had to get tickets so fast.

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.320
 That would be a hard thing to just to remember to do,

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.240
 if I said I'll do something in 22 years.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.440
 Like, he must have felt...

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.000
 He must have had to buy a diary for 22 years from now.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.560
 I don't know how far in advance they print diaries.

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:56.080
 I think if you'd gone to the effort of printing a plaque,

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.920
 cementing it to the ground at a specific train station,

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.360
 it's probably going to stick in your head

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.040
 a bit more than just saying it out loud.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.960
 Do you reckon, like, whenever he was...

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.040
 Someone said, "Oh, I've got a party coming up soon."

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.760
 And he's like, "Oh, can I just check it's not in 21 years,

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.360
 six months and three days?

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.760
 Because I have this thing I really can't do."

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:17.120
 And then, what if, like, that week he got given jury duty

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.280
 or something like that, that was too awkward, wasn't it?

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.080
 Yeah.

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:20.720
 What do you do?

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.400
 Can you get out of jury duty with that excuse?

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.000
 Because there are some loopholes, you know,

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.280
 if you're a doctor or a lawyer,

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.800
 but I don't know if it can be

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.640
 I've got a stand on my own plaque thing.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.640
 I don't know if that passes.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.800
 I mean, there are lots of...

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.040
 Like, if you're building up to that for 22 years,

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.000
 which I imagine he was,

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.920
 because he probably didn't have much else on,

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.240
 then, like, the couple of weeks before that

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.680
 is quite high stakes, isn't it?

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.360
 Yeah, that is high stakes, yeah.

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.880
 Like, he must have just stayed in the house

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.960
 for that whole time in case something happened.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.320
 God, if you were his friend,

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.880
 wouldn't you sort of book your wedding or something

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:54.160
 for that day, or just really test him?

00:51:54.160 --> 00:52:01.040
 Speaking of famous people who do martial arts

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.080
 and commemorations, they're on the first...

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.560
 The first sentence.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.560
 The first ever statue of Bruce Lee

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.720
 was in Mostar in Bosnia,

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.160
 and he was chosen because he was the only person

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.360
 that all the country's Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks all liked.

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:21.760
 So they just couldn't decide on anyone else to putt,

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.720
 but they thought, Bruce Lee, we all like him.

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.560
 He can go in our place.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:29.600
 And it was put up on November 26th, 2005,

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.000
 one day before the famous statue in Hong Kong went up,

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:34.880
 which I don't know.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.600
 Really?

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.240
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.160
 They must have heard that this one in Hong Kong

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.480
 was happening on Bruce Lee's birthday

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.880
 and thought we'd better get in there one day earlier.

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.600
 And they said, "Oh, the one thing we all have in common

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.920
 "is Bruce Lee," and then they did that.

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.160
 But then both the Bosnians and the Croats

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.520
 complained about it because he was doing like a karate move,

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.760
 but he was doing it in the direction of the area

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.360
 where all those people lived,

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.120
 and they thought that it was an act of aggression

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.600
 by the Serbs that they were making Bruce Lee

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.120
 kind of fight in their direction.

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.000
 So they should put it on a rotating base.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 That's a really good idea.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.880
 That's a great idea.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.720
 I might put that forward, actually.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.960
 Was Bruce Lee alive to see that happen?

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.000
 No.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.440
 No, no, he was dead.

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.640
 I don't know when he died.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.480
 Yeah, it would have been his 65th birthday,

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.840
 but he died probably.

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:21.280
 He died in the 80s, I think.

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:21.760
 Oh, did he?

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:22.160
 Okay, okay.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.960
 1973, he died, sorry.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.520
 '73, so I was just out by about 30 years.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.080
 Okay, cool.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:31.840
 Richard Nixon has a plaque on the moon.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.200
 Let's see.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.080
 Does he?

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.840
 Yeah, in fact, it's also got Neil Armstrong

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.760
 Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.480
 Yeah.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:46.560
 But also it has Nixon because it was the first moonbanding.

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.840
 So there's a plaque which says,

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.480
 "Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon."

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.560
 And Nixon's signature is on there as well.

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.760
 And it's such a cheat.

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.440
 Wait a minute, that's a trick, isn't it?

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.240
 I mean, it's bad enough.

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.280
 If you say here are some people on Earth went on the moon,

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.880
 one of them is Michael Collins.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.240
 Well, first of all, it wasn't.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.360
 He was just in the kind of space capsule.

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.520
 But Nixon never even left the Earth.

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.120
 Nixon never went to the moon.

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.160
 I know, it's unfair.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.560
 And also, well, not only is it a cheat

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.760
 because he didn't go to the moon,

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.320
 but he had only been president for about six months.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.600
 I mean, it was complete.

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.560
 You know, he wasn't really a major move.

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.600
 What's the space program?

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.000
 He was still the president of the United States.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.520
 How long do you have to serve

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.040
 before he was eligible in your mind to be on the plaque?

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.880
 That was all set up by Kennedy.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.680
 Kennedy, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.920
 The more I hear about this Richard Nixon stuff.

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.520
 Yeah, it would be like if you sacked me from the podcast

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.160
 and got Richard Nixon on to this set,

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.080
 and then you won a major award.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.200
 I would feel pretty miffed

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.920
 because I feel like I'd done more of the spade work than Nixon.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.240
 Yeah, you have.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.080
 Thank you.

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.040
 Thank you, James.

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.920
 And shame on you, Dan and Anna, for not affecting us.

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.520
 I was trying to work out on what level that analogy function.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.080
 Although, actually, when we went to Washington,

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.760
 we stayed in the Watergate Hotel,

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.760
 which was made famous by Nixon.

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.960
 And that actually added quite a lot to my experience of that.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.680
 So he did do quite a lot of podcasts, I kind of feel.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:14.880
 It's 50/50 between Richard and Andy, isn't it?

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.840
 Yeah, OK, great.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.760
 I wonder what analogy Nixon would have come up with.

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:20.640
 Probably a better one.

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.520
 Can you imagine?

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.600
 If only.

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.800
 I've got a slightly weird one,

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.560
 but it's one of those weird ones

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.800
 where I don't know if it'll make it into the show.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:31.520
 I'll say it.

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.800
 Stop me if you think it's...

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.880
 There, I won't stop you, that would be rude.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.680
 So in 2002...

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.280
 No, 2002, no way.

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:39.600
 Stop.

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:42.400
 Bruce Lee wasn't even alive then.

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:49.760
 2002, James Earl Jones was invited to Lorde Hill, Florida

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.760
 to be the keynote speaker for Martin Luther King Day.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.000
 And in order to commemorate it, they made a plaque that said,

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.520
 "You know, James Earl Jones,

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.920
 "thank you for keeping the dream alive."

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:08.160
 Unfortunately, at the place where they were making the plaque,

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:08.960
 they got it wrong.

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.640
 And what the plaque ended up saying

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:12.720
 was not, "James Earl Jones,

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.160
 "thank you for keeping the dream alive,"

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.360
 but it instead said, "James Earl Ray,

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.320
 "the man who assassinated Martin Luther King."

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.080
 So they managed to catch this

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.360
 just before it was unveiled,

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.800
 but the story went around.

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.440
 And the company that designed the plaque

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.040
 tried to come up with all these excuses.

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.880
 They said that a lot of people working on it

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:31.840
 didn't speak English.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:34.800
 So there must have been a miscommunication.

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.640
 They also said that there was a plaque designed

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.520
 just before that one that was made out to Ray Johnson,

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:43.360
 and they think the Ray somehow made it onto the next template

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.280
 when they were doing the James Earl Jones one.

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.720
 But yeah, wow, what a mess up.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.640
 That's someone's typed into Google,

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.280
 "Martin Luther King, James Earl,"

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.640
 and they've seen Ray and they thought,

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.600
 "It must be this one, lads."

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.360
 Damn, you all told correct.

00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:01.280
 That's amazing.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:02.960
 Yeah.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.960
 Okay, that's it.

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.360
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.280

 We'll see you again next week, guys.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.800
 Have a good week.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.280
 Goodbye.

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:52.000
 Just one last thing, one tiny last thing.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:52.640
 Quick update.

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:57.360
 2017, scientists put an ant on a treadmill.

00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.080
 So sorry, Anna.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:08.800
 God damn it.
