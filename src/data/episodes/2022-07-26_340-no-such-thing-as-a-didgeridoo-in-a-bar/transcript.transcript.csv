00:00:14,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to"
00:00:19,00:00:25,"you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with"
00:00:25,00:00:31,"James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tachinsky, and once again we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:37,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go, starting"
00:00:37,00:00:43,"with you, Andy. My fact is that along with their drink New Yorkers in Bars used to be served a"
00:00:43,00:00:54,sandwich full of rubber. What? Yummy. Yummy. Why on earth would that be? Well this is a sort of
00:00:54,00:00:59,legal loophole that bars had to jump through in order to serve their customers. So it's
00:00:59,00:01:05,sort of something called the Reigns Law basically. People were trying to curb public drunkenness
00:01:05,00:01:10,in the 1890s in America and in particular in New York and this politician called John Reigns got
00:01:10,00:01:16,"this law passed which was designed to put nasty bars out of business. So there were various,"
00:01:16,00:01:21,"you know, the cost of a liquor license tripled and you had to keep your curtains open on a Sunday"
00:01:21,00:01:28,so that police officers could host all sorts of things. Wow. The law was partly designed to
00:01:28,00:01:31,shut down Sunday drinking and that was very annoying for people and for bars because it was
00:01:31,00:01:36,the most profitable day of the week and it was most people's only day off. But there was a loophole
00:01:36,00:01:42,in the law where if you were serving a meal you could serve a drink with it any day of the week
00:01:42,00:01:47,"as long as you were a lodging house with ten rooms or more, okay? So all these bar owners"
00:01:47,00:01:52,suddenly teamed up with lodging houses and they opened just one room on the ground floor in the
00:01:52,00:01:58,"basement. They said, ""Oh, this is a dining room for an establishment. This is not a bar at all."""
00:01:58,00:02:03,And they said they were serving meals to the guests at the lodging houses and what the meal
00:02:03,00:02:08,consisted of was the single sandwich which would sometimes have a little puck of rubber in the
00:02:08,00:02:14,middle or it would sometimes just be a weak old sandwich which you would get given with your drink
00:02:14,00:02:19,"and the barman said, ""There, there's your meal."" And then they take away the sandwich immediately."
00:02:19,00:02:22,Like they'd leave it there for two seconds and they'd take it away to the next table
00:02:22,00:02:26,and it would be served to whoever else had also ordered a meal with their drink.
00:02:26,00:02:31,And that was the loophole. I read that sometimes the sandwich was either a rock or a brick between
00:02:31,00:02:37,"two slices of bread. Yeah, that's taking the piss out of the loophole a bit, right? It is taking"
00:02:37,00:02:41,"the piss and yet they went to court over it and they said, ""Well, no, it looks like they are serving"
00:02:41,00:02:46,"a meal."" So I don't know who the judge was for that case but yeah. Yeah, there was actually,"
00:02:46,00:02:51,there was an incident I think where in about 1902 police were called to a bar because there was a
00:02:51,00:02:57,massive brawl two guys about to kill each other and one of the people was a customer who'd been
00:02:57,00:03:02,genuinely hungry so he'd ordered a sandwich and the innkeeper had brought him the sandwich and
00:03:02,00:03:06,"then tried to take it away and the customer started eating it and been like, ""I've ordered a sandwich,"
00:03:06,00:03:10,"mate."" And the innkeeper said, ""No, no, you don't understand. We don't really eat these."" And it"
00:03:10,00:03:16,"ended up in a huge fight and the law enforcement arrived and said, ""Look, there's been a misunderstanding."
00:03:16,00:03:21,It's just pretend sandwiches here. Give it back to the barman and we won't prosecute you for trying
00:03:21,00:03:28,"to eat your restaurant lunch."" Wow, so funny. That's brilliant. I love how much this backfired"
00:03:28,00:03:34,on John Reigns who put this law in place for the Sunday drinking for the fact that the sandwich
00:03:34,00:03:40,itself became known as the Reigns sandwich. Yeah. The fact that all these new establishments
00:03:40,00:03:45,that opened up in order to use that loophole to their advantage were called Reigns hotels.
00:03:45,00:03:49,"I mean, they really slapped this guy in the face with his own dickhead law."
00:03:49,00:03:55,"Yeah. And it was bad as well because not only did the number of hotels rock it,"
00:03:55,00:04:02,"so Brooklyn went from having 13 actual hotels to having 800 hotels in six months, which is insane,"
00:04:02,00:04:07,"but there were lots of beds nearby, obviously, so it led to lots of casual sex and prostitution"
00:04:07,00:04:11,"happening because you got really, really drunk not eating your sandwiches and then there was a"
00:04:11,00:04:16,"bedroom right upstairs. Yeah, they had to have a minimum of 10 rooms, didn't they? Yeah. But they"
00:04:16,00:04:20,tended to be just tiny little boxes with a bed in there. Yeah. I just want to say for the people
00:04:20,00:04:26,"at home because Andy is doing a really good job of saying it with his voice, but he is actually"
00:04:26,00:04:36,"doing the imaginary quote marks every time he does, like, say, ""hotel or sandwich."" I certainly am."
00:04:36,00:04:43,James. Do it again. Do you think the rubber sandwiches is the origin of all American cheese
00:04:43,00:04:50,"today? Oh, a sick burn on American cheese. Yeah. There is still a kind of Reigns sandwich today,"
00:04:50,00:04:55,and it's been brought in this year in New York. This is really exciting new stuff. So it's because
00:04:55,00:05:01,"of the coronavirus, New York introduced rules about serving alcohol when you can get a proper drink,"
00:05:01,00:05:08,"and it said you have to order food. There is a bar in Buffalo, New York, which has a food menu,"
00:05:08,00:05:15,"and, sorry, hang on, let me just say that again, a food menu. There we are. It includes items like"
00:05:15,00:05:22,"just a few grapes, nine French fries, and literally the smallest piece of cheesecake you'll ever see,"
00:05:22,00:05:27,"and they all cost a dollar, and they're all technically food, and they're designed to get"
00:05:27,00:05:31,"around safety legislation, which is really meant to be helping the situation."
00:05:31,00:05:38,"What's the idea, sorry, with the safety? Is that so no one can share your food?"
00:05:38,00:05:43,"I think it's because they don't want loads of people going to bars all the time,"
00:05:43,00:05:46,but they don't mind people going to restaurants a bit.
00:05:46,00:05:51,I think that's the design. It's not because people sharing food is leading to the spread of the virus.
00:05:51,00:05:57,It could be to stop the obesity crisis if everyone's only eating the smallest piece of cheesecake
00:05:57,00:06:02,"you've ever seen. Absolutely. Getting one grape for dessert, but no one else is going to finger that"
00:06:02,00:06:10,"one grape if that's all you've got, so it's good for the German folks. The bars in late 19th century,"
00:06:10,00:06:17,"New York, sound pretty amazing, these places. Apparently the earliest ones that were in the"
00:06:17,00:06:23,"Bowery area of New York, they didn't have glasses, they just had a barrel of beer or booze, some kind"
00:06:23,00:06:29,"of booze, and what you did is you would pay three cents, and they would give you a rubber tube,"
00:06:29,00:06:32,and for your three cents you were allowed to drink until you ran out of breath.
00:06:32,00:06:41,"And so what people learn how to do is, you know, like some musicians can do this circular breathing,"
00:06:41,00:06:46,"which means you can play notes for longer and longer. Some people learned how to do that,"
00:06:46,00:06:49,"so they didn't have to breathe through their mouths, they could just breathe through their"
00:06:49,00:06:55,"noses, and they could just drink more and more and more. That's so funny. You'd have to ban anyone"
00:06:55,00:07:00,who belonged to an orchestra from entering your bar. See a bunch of guys with didgeridoo's turning
00:07:00,00:07:08,"up. No, absolutely not. Out you go. Out. Yeah, the Bowery sound amazing, right? Like back in the"
00:07:08,00:07:14,"19th century, it was just packed with so many bars that went outdoor, and it was largely men playing"
00:07:14,00:07:19,cards and drinking and having little meals and so on. And I've actually been to…
00:07:19,00:07:25,"I remember that in Gangs of New York. There's a whole seat where someone has a little meal,"
00:07:25,00:07:30,isn't there? I remember that. I love the fight and the tap-ass joint in Gangs of New York.
00:07:30,00:07:38,"Lee and I, the Caprio, digs into a canapé. I've been to the Bowery. I don't know if you guys"
00:07:38,00:07:42,have that sort of area of New York. I've actually performed there. I did a performance as a drag
00:07:42,00:07:46,"queen. I had to create a drag queen character. I was called Danomite. Yeah, I was Danomite."
00:07:46,00:07:53,It came with that explosion sound. And there's still the remnants of this kind of awesome
00:07:53,00:07:58,"bohemianness about it, which I imagine what these 19th century bars must have been like,"
00:07:58,00:08:02,"you know, this kind of wild sort of outlawy kind of place."
00:08:02,00:08:07,Can we go back to your drag career briefly? Yeah. And you have to do it. It's quite
00:08:07,00:08:17,"cocketish that name. I think Danomite. Oh, yeah. I was interviewing a famous drag act in America,"
00:08:17,00:08:24,"in New York. And as part of the interview, she, as Linda, suggested that I experience it. So she"
00:08:24,00:08:28,made me come up with a character. She dressed me up. And then we did this big bingo night at the
00:08:28,00:08:36,"Bowery. And I was Danomite. Oh, was that part of the name, actually? Would that have been in your"
00:08:36,00:08:42,"passport? It would have said Danomite and then open brackets, head explodes. Close brackets."
00:08:42,00:08:47,"No, no, it's explosion. It's not head explodes. It's just the way you did for people at home."
00:08:47,00:08:53,"Dan did the head exploding gesture. Yes. Sorry, that is confusing for the listeners as well."
00:08:53,00:08:58,A lot of this show has so far relied on some visuals that we're going to mean nothing to anyone.
00:09:00,00:09:07,"You might have fit in quite nicely at Billy Mcglory's Armory Hall, Dan, which was the hardest"
00:09:07,00:09:13,"chorus of all the bars in New York in that time. So whenever you went there and got drunk, you"
00:09:13,00:09:20,would basically always get robbed. That was just known that that would happen. And it would be by
00:09:20,00:09:26,either the female regulars or Billy Mcglory used to hire men dressed as women to go and
00:09:26,00:09:32,"rob people in the bar. So you would get, basically, you would get robbed and then they would drag you"
00:09:32,00:09:36,from your table. A bouncer would drag you from the table. They would throw you out in the street.
00:09:36,00:09:40,"And then when you were outside, the bouncer would try and get anything else that was left on you."
00:09:40,00:09:44,"And then if there was anything left at all, the people walking past would get it. And then if"
00:09:44,00:09:48,"you didn't have anything, they would steal your clothes. So basically, you would just, oh, if"
00:09:48,00:09:53,"you got drunk there, you would end up naked outside without your phone, without your wallet,"
00:09:53,00:09:57,without anything. Why do people go to this pub? Why do they keep going to the pub?
00:09:57,00:10:03,It was well known as being an extremely kind of rough place that locals would go. And it was
00:10:03,00:10:08,the people from out of town that would get the treatment. But a lot of people would go because
00:10:08,00:10:13,there was like a balcony upstairs because it kicked off so often in this pub that people would pay to
00:10:13,00:10:18,sit in the balcony so they could watch the fights happening. Wow. Isn't that amazing?
00:10:19,00:10:23,"I was just looking at, I was looking a little bit at the Temperance Movement in Britain, which was"
00:10:23,00:10:27,also quite strong around these parts. So America didn't have a monopoly on it. And this is throughout
00:10:27,00:10:31,"the 19th century. And William Gladstone, who was obviously Prime Minister multiple times,"
00:10:31,00:10:37,tried to temper people's alcohol consumption and drunkenness by encouraging people to sell wine
00:10:37,00:10:42,"and encouraging the wider consumption of wine, in fact. And it was because everyone was drinking"
00:10:42,00:10:47,"spirits. And he thought that this would be encouraging, more sophisticated sort of drinking,"
00:10:47,00:10:54,which we all know is always successful. But he also made it so that food shops and grocers
00:10:54,00:10:58,"didn't need a license to sell alcohol. So they could all start selling alcohol. And again,"
00:10:58,00:11:04,this was to encourage people not to get so drunk because he wanted to end what he called the unnatural
00:11:04,00:11:10,divorce between food and alcohol. So the idea is that you either go to a bar or you go to a grocery
00:11:10,00:11:15,shop. So people just get really drunk without eating. But the controversial thing about the
00:11:15,00:11:21,"grocers was that it meant that women would be able to buy alcohol. So obviously, if you could only"
00:11:21,00:11:27,"buy alcohol in bars, a bit risque for a woman to go to a bar, definitely not on her own. But if"
00:11:27,00:11:31,"they were going on a food shop, they could buy a bottle of wine. And there's paper written on it,"
00:11:31,00:11:35,which said obtaining alcohol from a licensed grocer is regarded as perfectly acceptable
00:11:35,00:11:40,"if women are using it for dining, cooking and entertaining. However, there are concerns that"
00:11:40,00:11:47,some women are purchasing alcohol for their own personal use. So extremely controversial.
00:11:47,00:11:53,"Wow. Just while we're on the boundary, I did find one or two more good names of bars that were in"
00:11:53,00:11:59,"the bar in the late 19th century. There was the Burnt Rag, there was Chick Trickers Flea Bag,"
00:11:59,00:12:06,"and McGurk Suicide Hall. Now, I can't work out exactly why McGurk Suicide Hall was so named,"
00:12:06,00:12:13,"but it was the first ever bar to deploy an armed bouncer. And his name was Eat Him Up,"
00:12:13,00:12:19,"Jack McManus. It sounds like a wrestler, doesn't it? He does. He absolutely does. I think he basically"
00:12:19,00:12:24,"was. He was repeatedly arrested for assault. And yet, every time it came to do an actual police"
00:12:24,00:12:29,"lineup, people mysteriously had an attack of amnesia when they were asked to point out which"
00:12:29,00:12:34,absolutely thug is the one who beat you up. Some of the most famous bouncers around that time in
00:12:34,00:12:40,"New York were women. There was one called Gallus Meg, and I'll read you this quote about her."
00:12:40,00:12:46,"""It was her custom after she'd felt an obstreperous customer with her club to clutch his ear between"
00:12:46,00:12:52,her teeth and drag him to the door amid the frenzy cheers of onlookers. Though she would
00:12:52,00:12:57,knock you out with a club and they grab your ear with her teeth and drag you by the ear with her
00:12:57,00:13:02,"teeth. And then what would happen is if the victim tried to fight back, she would bite the ear off"
00:13:02,00:13:06,"and then they would put it in a jar and they would keep all the ears behind the bar."""
00:13:06,00:13:13,What? No! This didn't happen. I'm telling you this happened. This happened because she had an
00:13:13,00:13:19,enemy who was another female bouncer known as Sadie the Goat. Okay? And Sadie the Goat once had
00:13:19,00:13:25,her ear bitten off by Gallus Meg in 1869. And she had to leave the area in disgrace because she'd
00:13:25,00:13:30,been kicked out of this bar and she'd lost the fight to Gallus Meg. And she walked down to the
00:13:30,00:13:35,waterfront and she saw a few people trying to kind of rob a boat and they were failing quite
00:13:35,00:13:38,"badly and she was like, ""Okay, I'm going to help you guys out here."" And she helped them to rob this"
00:13:38,00:13:44,"boat and then they decided to take over the boat, put a Jolly Roger on the front of it,"
00:13:44,00:13:49,and sail up and down the river just stealing things from people and kidnapping people and
00:13:49,00:13:56,becoming like pirates. And they did this for quite a few weeks until eventually the locals decided
00:13:56,00:14:01,"to get guns and stop them from doing it. And so once she'd done all that and finished all that,"
00:14:01,00:14:07,she went back to the bar where Gallus Meg was and kind of made up with her. And Gallus Meg gave her
00:14:07,00:14:12,"her ear back, which she always wore in the lockets around the neck for the rest of her life. Wow!"
00:14:12,00:14:17,"Wow! So she labelled the jars of whose ear as well? I mean, because that's... If you're wearing an"
00:14:17,00:14:20,"earring, you would know which one was yours, wouldn't you? Awesome. There we go. I think I'd"
00:14:20,00:14:25,recognise my own ear in a jar of his. Do you think you'd have to go to the bar and show them your
00:14:25,00:14:31,"other ear and say, ""Have you got one that looks like this?"" Yeah, exactly. Have you got a size"
00:14:31,00:14:38,"8? And go into the back. I'd be like, ""I'm sorry, this is all we have left."" Twice the size. It was"
00:14:38,00:14:48,a really big dude. Did you know they used to flavour drinks with dead rats during temperance
00:14:48,00:14:53,"and prohibition? Yeah. Oh, during prohibition? What, to put people off? No, to put people,"
00:14:53,00:15:01,"to turn people on. Well, I don't know how to turn them. Well, there you go. Bars had to come up,"
00:15:01,00:15:05,or Speekies had to come up with such imaginative ways of simulating the taste of what had been
00:15:05,00:15:11,"legitimate alcohol, because they were getting all their alcohol from sort of petrol and,"
00:15:11,00:15:17,"you know, these cat-stove fuel and like ink-used alcohol to make it. So you had to try and make"
00:15:17,00:15:23,"that taste a bit like gin. And so apparently, to simulate the flavour of bourbon, you added"
00:15:23,00:15:29,dead rats or rotten meat to moonshine and you let it sit for a few days. That's true. Wow.
00:15:29,00:15:35,"Apparently so, then you take it out. And similarly, to simulate scotch, you wanted a smoky flavour,"
00:15:35,00:15:38,"and apparently there was creosote, which is like an antiseptic made from tar,"
00:15:38,00:15:43,and that would make it taste nice and smoky. Wow. But the temperance movement is still going
00:15:43,00:15:49,"strong in the US, in various states. I mean, like Utah, if you try and buy alcohol in Utah,"
00:15:49,00:15:54,"it's not pill slog sometimes. I didn't know that Utah, until 2017, every single bar had to have"
00:15:54,00:16:00,"not an iron curtain, but a Zion curtain. Are you familiar with this? I wasn't,"
00:16:00,00:16:05,"but I saw this as well. It's amazing, isn't it? It's incredible. It's crazy. So basically,"
00:16:05,00:16:10,"it's a barrier, has to be erected between customer and bartender, so that no customers can see any"
00:16:10,00:16:15,of the drinks being poured or mixed. And the idea is that it protects young people and innocent
00:16:15,00:16:21,"people from the glamour of bartending and drinking. Right. And so, you just sit at a bar and you've"
00:16:21,00:16:26,"got this big perspex shield in your face all the time. Yeah, it's always like frosty glass,"
00:16:26,00:16:30,"isn't it? So you can't see them. Are you like, it looks like they're holding a rat. What is that?"
00:16:30,00:16:35,All they need to do to stop the glamour of bartending is just introduce
00:16:35,00:16:40,weather spoons to Utah. No one will see the impossible glory of drinking there.
00:16:40,00:16:45,"Imagine if they filmed cocktail in Utah, and they had Tom Cruise doing all these dances,"
00:16:45,00:16:47,but you can't see it because there's a frosty screen in front of them.
00:16:47,00:16:52,"Do you think every time you order a Hendricks, they actually just chuck a Gordon's in?"
00:16:52,00:16:56,"Because you're not going to know, are you? No. Yeah, I bet they never say,"
00:16:56,00:16:58,"""It's Pepsi, okay."" But you are to go."
00:16:58,00:17:10,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:17:11,00:17:15,My fact this week is that dead fish can swim upstream.
00:17:15,00:17:23,"Absolutely insane. And this, I have to say thank you to someone called Robert Teeling,"
00:17:23,00:17:28,"who sent me a link to this ages ago, and I came across it again. And basically,"
00:17:28,00:17:34,this was sort of discovered by mistake a few years ago when scientists at MIT and Harvard
00:17:34,00:17:40,were looking at how trout cope when they're swimming upstream but behind an obstacle.
00:17:40,00:17:43,"So imagine if you're in the water and you've got a rounded obstacle in front of you,"
00:17:43,00:17:47,that deflects some of the current. So it goes around the sides of you. So it's a bit easier
00:17:47,00:17:52,"like a slipstream kind of thing. A bit like a slipstream. Yeah, exactly. And so they were"
00:17:52,00:17:56,looking at like putting live trout in the water and seeing how that worked. And then
00:17:56,00:18:00,"according to this article, they unintentionally, that's those quote marks again,"
00:18:00,00:18:06,they unintentionally put a dead trout in the water behind this rounded objects.
00:18:06,00:18:12,"And they were completely amazed to see it swam upstream. So it swam towards this obstacle,"
00:18:12,00:18:17,"but properly sort of like swimming, like you would see a fish swim. And then eventually,"
00:18:17,00:18:20,"it would get really, really close. And then you're in sort of a suction region,"
00:18:20,00:18:24,"which really is like a slipstream, where it got sucked into the obstacle,"
00:18:24,00:18:28,bounced back and landed back where it started and swam towards it again.
00:18:28,00:18:29,Yeah. And just kept doing this.
00:18:29,00:18:33,"There's a video online, you can see of it, right? It's pretty amazing."
00:18:33,00:18:36,"It's basically like a zombie fish, really."
00:18:36,00:18:38,It's pretty mad that that's actually dead.
00:18:38,00:18:44,"Isn't it the case though that so if you were, say, by a river bed and there was"
00:18:44,00:18:50,"fish swimming upstream, most likely it is alive because it's..."
00:18:50,00:18:52,"I think that is true, yeah. I read that as well."
00:18:52,00:18:55,"Most fish that you see swimming are alive, yeah."
00:18:55,00:19:00,It's important not to let this kind of misinformation get out without correcting...
00:19:00,00:19:04,"You don't want people going down to the river with their friends and family just going,"
00:19:04,00:19:08,"""See that fish that's swimming dead? Do that one? Probably dead as well."""
00:19:08,00:19:12,"No, something as alive fish turns out."
00:19:12,00:19:19,"Yeah. But also, the circumstances, like they were saying that when they put the dead trout in,"
00:19:19,00:19:24,"it happened to land in the sweetest of sweet spots that if it was in any other conditions,"
00:19:24,00:19:27,"that never would have happened. So again, it's sort of,"
00:19:27,00:19:30,"you just wouldn't probably see that in nature ever, really."
00:19:30,00:19:36,"Well, I think you might do a bit. So the way it works is some very complicated fluid dynamics,"
00:19:36,00:19:41,but I think very simplified. When you've got kind of a rounded object in water and you've got a
00:19:41,00:19:47,"current going past it, as the current goes past it, it generates these little vortexes of water."
00:19:47,00:19:53,And what seems to be happening is that this pattern of spiralling vortexes makes the fish
00:19:53,00:19:58,spine move in a specific way that sort of propels it. So fish are very flexible spines.
00:19:58,00:20:03,And these vortexes sort of give energy to the fish. The fish takes energy from the vortexes
00:20:03,00:20:08,"and then swims upstream. But yeah, you do have to be in a particular place and fish,"
00:20:08,00:20:13,"yeah, there aren't loads of dead fish jumping upstream to source."
00:20:13,00:20:15,"But it does mean that a fish could swim with no effort, doesn't it?"
00:20:15,00:20:18,"A fish could not use its muscles at all. And it would still,"
00:20:18,00:20:21,"if it was in this right spot, get upstream, which is pretty cool."
00:20:21,00:20:27,"And so it's incredibly useful to fish this phenomenon because, yeah, they're incredibly"
00:20:27,00:20:32,sensitive. So they can tell the movement of water behind certain rocks. So they'll sort of
00:20:32,00:20:36,sense the vortexes that are behind a rock and then they can swim towards that rock.
00:20:36,00:20:39,And that'll mean that they have to expend much less energy because the rock just sort of sucks
00:20:39,00:20:44,"them towards it. It's very useful. One thing in looking into this fact that I never realised,"
00:20:44,00:20:50,"and probably you three did know this, but so a fish swims, as we all know, I'm doing it with"
00:20:50,00:20:56,"my hands here, but in the sort of fishy motion, right? It's sort of... You've explained it perfectly,"
00:20:56,00:21:01,yeah. So its spine allows for it from its head to its tail. It's a sort of...
00:21:01,00:21:06,"It's a wave. It's a landscape. Yeah, it's like landscape mode. But for mammals..."
00:21:06,00:21:08,It's a landscape mode. It's not a portrait mode.
00:21:08,00:21:09,What?
00:21:09,00:21:14,"Sea horses are in portrait mode. Sea horses are portraits, especially in landscape."
00:21:14,00:21:21,"We're finding it very hard to describe this. The spines go along, whereas for mammals,"
00:21:21,00:21:26,"so dolphins and so on, the spines go like our spines. So they move up and down,"
00:21:26,00:21:31,"as opposed to left to right, as it were. So your spine on a dolphin goes along the very"
00:21:31,00:21:35,"top of the dolphin, right? Whereas in the fish, it goes right through the middle of the fish."
00:21:35,00:21:40,Is that what you're saying? Exactly. And that's the distinction between what is a fish and what is
00:21:40,00:21:44,"a mammal in the ocean. And I'd never realised that before, and that's why their fins are"
00:21:44,00:21:49,"positioned differently as well on their body. Yeah, that's very cool. So fish wouldn't be able"
00:21:49,00:21:53,"to do butterfly stroke, for instance, would they? Is butterfly the fastest or is it the slowest?"
00:21:53,00:21:56,I can't remember. It's got to be the slowest. It's not the breaststroke.
00:21:56,00:22:04,"I think it's in between. It's neither. It is fast. But it's not as fast as front crawl,"
00:22:04,00:22:10,"for instance. Okay. I was reading about Michael Phelps' top speed, is why there is method here."
00:22:10,00:22:15,You sort of said an incorrect fact that wouldn't have even been that interesting if it were correct.
00:22:15,00:22:21,It's going to bring him onto this very interesting fact that he's about saying about Michael Phelps.
00:22:21,00:22:25,Front-loading pressure onto my bad facts before I said that. Thank you.
00:22:25,00:22:27,"Sorry, please. Go on."
00:22:27,00:22:31,"It was just, I was just kind of amazed at how crap at swimming we are relative to fish,"
00:22:31,00:22:39,because the fastest fish swim at about 70 miles an hour. The fastest submarines don't even do
00:22:39,00:22:42,"that much, and some of them are nuclear power. They go at about 50 miles an hour, absolute top speed."
00:22:42,00:22:48,"Wow. Michael Phelps, maybe the greatest swimmer of all time, can do about 4.7 miles an hour,"
00:22:48,00:22:51,"and he can do that for 100 meters, and then he has to stop."
00:22:51,00:22:55,"Andy, you're saying top speed of a fish was what, through that?"
00:22:55,00:22:56,I said 70 miles an hour.
00:22:56,00:23:00,"70 miles an hour, and that's, yeah, so the very fastest ones, obviously."
00:23:00,00:23:05,"Yeah, exactly. There's a few amazing fast ones, so swordfish and sailfish and so on."
00:23:05,00:23:09,"I was looking at a list of the fastest fish. My favorite one, just for its name,"
00:23:09,00:23:14,"because of its speed, and I don't know if the name is tied in with the speed, but it's called the Wahoo."
00:23:17,00:23:26,"It has to be right. It has to be that it's just like, it's just having a great time."
00:23:26,00:23:27,And is it particularly fast?
00:23:27,00:23:33,"Yeah, yeah. It goes just under a few miles an hour under the fastest speed of fish."
00:23:33,00:23:35,Have you ever seen a fish treadmill?
00:23:35,00:23:40,"Oh, God. Almost every week, whenever an animal were discussing, they seem to go on a treadmill,"
00:23:40,00:23:45,"don't they? I'm starting to feel a little bit self-conscious that I don't go on treadmills,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,because every other animal that the animal kingdom seems to.
00:23:47,00:23:51,"I think whenever we discuss an animal on this podcast, we shouldn't mention if it's been"
00:23:51,00:23:56,"on a treadmill, but we should always mention if it hasn't. That's the interesting fact at this point."
00:23:56,00:23:59,Ants have never been on treadmills.
00:23:59,00:24:01,That's a good point.
00:24:01,00:24:03,Go on. What are they doing on treadmills?
00:24:03,00:24:07,"Well, obviously, it's not a rubber treadmill, as we would understand it,"
00:24:07,00:24:11,"but it's for scientists to experiment on how fish propel themselves, so they have to get a,"
00:24:11,00:24:15,"you know, a tank with a current flowing in one direction."
00:24:15,00:24:21,"And they then put plastic particles in the water, and they record where they go as the fish swims,"
00:24:21,00:24:25,"so you can kind of see how the fish is thrusting, so you can see the directions"
00:24:25,00:24:27,that all the water is moving as well.
00:24:27,00:24:30,"So it's like one of those things in a water park where you sit on a rubber ring,"
00:24:30,00:24:34,"and it just takes you slowly around the water park, like that kind of thing,"
00:24:34,00:24:35,like a lazy river.
00:24:35,00:24:41,"Yes, but except in this version of the water park, you are having to resist the flow of the current"
00:24:41,00:24:44,to keep yourself in the same place for hours on end.
00:24:44,00:24:46,"Okay, but that's when you're on those things."
00:24:46,00:24:50,"If you don't have a rubber ring, the best thing is to try and beat the currents,"
00:24:50,00:24:53,"isn't it? You're really trying to swim as fast as you can against the current,"
00:24:53,00:24:56,"and then normal people on the rubber rings are going, ""What the fuck are you doing?"
00:24:56,00:24:58,"This is a rubber ring thing."""
00:24:58,00:24:59,"They're like, ""No, that's fun."""
00:24:59,00:25:03,Aren't you being clocked by people in rubber rings coming past you and banging into you as you go?
00:25:03,00:25:04,"Yeah, that's the problem, actually."
00:25:04,00:25:06,"This is why you're not allowed to go to sliding splash anymore, James."
00:25:06,00:25:09,That's the reason.
00:25:09,00:25:10,So many reasons.
00:25:14,00:25:18,And so they've just found a load of new fish that can actually walk on land.
00:25:18,00:25:21,I think we've always known there were one or two of these.
00:25:21,00:25:26,"They've just looked at a bunch of fish and looked at the way their pelvic bones are,"
00:25:26,00:25:32,and they've worked out that there's at least 11 species of fish that definitely can walk on land.
00:25:32,00:25:32,So cool.
00:25:32,00:25:35,"They're not good at walking though, are they?"
00:25:35,00:25:36,They're not as good as us.
00:25:36,00:25:40,"Like when you see a seal on the sand, sort of flapping its fins around."
00:25:40,00:25:45,"Well, I think that's the thing, I think why Andy was a little bit unfair about Michael Phelps,"
00:25:45,00:25:50,because it's not like fish are able to run as quickly as us.
00:25:50,00:25:52,So why are we expected to be able to swim as fast as them?
00:25:52,00:25:57,"There should be a competition which is to work out the species on earth,"
00:25:57,00:25:58,which is least crap at everything.
00:25:58,00:26:01,The best all-rounder.
00:26:01,00:26:01,"The best all-rounder, exactly."
00:26:01,00:26:07,"It must be a kind of bird, right, because nothing else can fly."
00:26:07,00:26:09,So you're not actually a flying fish.
00:26:09,00:26:10,A flying fish.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"Oh, come on, it's not flying, it's just sort of jumping quite high."
00:26:14,00:26:16,Are they quite good?
00:26:16,00:26:23,"They put flying fish in a what they call the wind tunnel quite recently, some scientists."
00:26:23,00:26:28,"It was a dead one, but they filled it with stuff to make it like as sturdy as an alive one."
00:26:28,00:26:33,And they found out that the way that it collides is actually almost as good as some of the best
00:26:33,00:26:35,gliders in the avian kingdom.
00:26:35,00:26:35,There we go.
00:26:35,00:26:38,That's a strong contender.
00:26:38,00:26:40,"They can fly, they can swim when they're dead."
00:26:40,00:26:42,This is a very strong contender.
00:26:42,00:26:46,There must be a bird which can swim really pretty well.
00:26:46,00:26:47,I was thinking ducks.
00:26:47,00:26:50,"I mean, they're pretty shit at everything, aren't they?"
00:26:50,00:26:54,"They're shit at walking, they're shit at swimming, and they're not great at flying."
00:26:54,00:26:56,But they can do all of them.
00:26:56,00:27:01,"Yeah, I think actually the duck is a very strong contender for this incredibly boring."
00:27:05,00:27:08,"Well, it's felt, you know, that's probably where the sprinting actually."
00:27:08,00:27:11,"I don't know, Phelps is going to be the human rep for the thing."
00:27:11,00:27:12,I'm just sort of felling him in.
00:27:12,00:27:16,"Because if you think about it, the triathlon, which is swimming, running, and cycling,"
00:27:16,00:27:18,the cycling bit is a bit of a fake.
00:27:18,00:27:20,"I mean, it's a fake spot, isn't it?"
00:27:20,00:27:21,We invented the bicycle.
00:27:21,00:27:22,It's not natural.
00:27:22,00:27:26,"It should be swimming, running, and flying the triathlon."
00:27:26,00:27:34,Although it would be fun to put a trout on a bicycle and see how it fared in a triathlon.
00:27:35,00:27:38,"The British government has its own fish farm, which I didn't know."
00:27:38,00:27:43,"And it breeds tons and tons of fish every year, just to fill up ponds around the place."
00:27:43,00:27:44,It's really cool.
00:27:44,00:27:46,Why do they fill up?
00:27:46,00:27:50,"Well, there are all these sort of bodies of water, which, you know, I don't know."
00:27:50,00:27:51,Is it for fishers?
00:27:51,00:27:56,"It's partly for fishermen, but it's also partly, I think, for general health,"
00:27:56,00:27:58,and to keep species in good nick.
00:27:58,00:28:02,But it's called the National Corse Fish Farm.
00:28:02,00:28:07,"And last year, they produced 12.3 tons of fish to put in rivers and ponds."
00:28:07,00:28:09,They released 7.6 million fish.
00:28:09,00:28:13,And they're just sending bags around the country of fish and buckets of fish.
00:28:13,00:28:16,And then you get to release hundreds and hundreds of them into a river.
00:28:16,00:28:18,It looks really fun.
00:28:18,00:28:20,And they do fish rescue as well.
00:28:20,00:28:26,"Because sometimes the hot weather will cause rivers to flow very low,"
00:28:26,00:28:28,or oxygen levels will drop.
00:28:28,00:28:33,"And this can be fatal to fish, which needs certain levels of oxygen in the water."
00:28:33,00:28:35,"So they have to go, and they either relocate the fish,"
00:28:35,00:28:38,or they pump oxygen into the water in these places.
00:28:38,00:28:39,Really?
00:28:39,00:28:39,I know.
00:28:39,00:28:41,"I want to find out more about these people,"
00:28:41,00:28:45,because this sounds like a really cool government body to fish rescue.
00:28:45,00:28:47,"The government gets a lot of stick these days,"
00:28:47,00:28:51,but no one's saying about how they're pumping oxygen into water.
00:28:51,00:28:55,"Right. No one talks about the National Corse Fish Farm,"
00:28:55,00:28:57,and I think it's a damn shame.
00:28:58,00:28:59,Is that how fish get at lakes?
00:28:59,00:29:00,Because I've always wondered.
00:29:00,00:29:01,"Because, I mean, how do they get there?"
00:29:01,00:29:03,"You know, you see a lake, and it's a relatively new one."
00:29:03,00:29:05,It's only been around for a few hundred years.
00:29:05,00:29:06,It's full of fish.
00:29:06,00:29:06,What the fuck's it done?
00:29:06,00:29:09,"I mean, it hasn't walked, because we've discussed that they are quite bad at walking,"
00:29:09,00:29:10,even if they can do it a bit.
00:29:10,00:29:12,Mental.
00:29:12,00:29:14,You get a tarn up in the lake district.
00:29:14,00:29:14,I guess.
00:29:14,00:29:17,"But lakes which don't have a, you know,"
00:29:17,00:29:20,lakes which don't have any waterways moving into them.
00:29:20,00:29:20,Yeah.
00:29:20,00:29:23,Maybe it's the National Corse Fish Rearing Unit.
00:29:23,00:29:24,That's what it is.
00:29:24,00:29:25,Could be God.
00:29:25,00:29:30,"Although, you know, like, what is God if it's not really, in some ways,"
00:29:30,00:29:34,the Fish God is the National Corse River lake fish thing.
00:29:34,00:29:38,"Well, we've really, we've built up this government body."
00:29:38,00:29:40,"Not only is it cool, but it's also God-like."
00:29:40,00:29:44,"Salmon and trout, very good at swimming upstream,"
00:29:44,00:29:45,"kind of as discussed, but they have to be, right?"
00:29:45,00:29:47,"This is why this is so useful,"
00:29:47,00:29:49,"this fact that they can even do it when they're dead,"
00:29:49,00:29:53,"because they swim all the way back upstream to spawn in their place of birth,"
00:29:53,00:29:55,and they actually do that by smelling.
00:29:55,00:29:58,So they have stored in their brain the smell of their home.
00:29:58,00:30:01,"So where they're born, they swim all the way down the street,"
00:30:01,00:30:02,and they retain it.
00:30:02,00:30:04,"And then when they get to breeding stage,"
00:30:04,00:30:06,"something is triggered in their brain,"
00:30:06,00:30:08,which makes them desperately want to return to that smell.
00:30:08,00:30:09,Oh my God.
00:30:09,00:30:14,"So does that mean it's like as if you could smell where you were conceived,"
00:30:14,00:30:17,and you go back to the place where you were conceived?
00:30:17,00:30:18,Is that what that means?
00:30:18,00:30:19,Yeah.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"And one day you'll start lusting after that, James,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,"crawling your way back to the hospital in Bolton, or..."
00:30:24,00:30:26,What was James conceived in a hospital?
00:30:26,00:30:31,"Yeah, that was it."
00:30:31,00:30:34,"Yeah, it was inappropriate that they were doing that there."
00:30:34,00:30:37,Sorry.
00:30:37,00:30:40,"They do it by, they sort of, if they go too far upstream,"
00:30:40,00:30:43,"they lose the smell, and they have to go back downstream,"
00:30:43,00:30:47,"pick up the smell again, and then try and..."
00:30:47,00:30:50,"It's like that game, sort of warmer, warmer, colder, colder, you know,"
00:30:50,00:30:52,and then eventually the smell is strong enough
00:30:52,00:30:55,that you find exactly the tributary off the main river.
00:30:55,00:30:58,"But they also need, this is one of the big arguments"
00:30:58,00:31:00,"against reintroduction of beavers, you know,"
00:31:00,00:31:03,"that's the latest great controversy in this country,"
00:31:03,00:31:03,and beavers obviously make dams.
00:31:03,00:31:05,"That's the main one, actually, at the moment."
00:31:05,00:31:06,That's the main one.
00:31:06,00:31:09,"I would say beavers first, Covid second, Brexit third."
00:31:09,00:31:10,Yeah.
00:31:10,00:31:12,"How much oxygen's apart in the water, far?"
00:31:12,00:31:15,Got to bump that up.
00:31:15,00:31:17,"So beavers make dams,"
00:31:17,00:31:20,"and so then salmon have to jump over those dams,"
00:31:20,00:31:23,and I didn't realise there's an exact equation
00:31:23,00:31:26,for how deep the plunge pool in front of a dam has to be
00:31:26,00:31:29,for a salmon to make it over the height of it.
00:31:29,00:31:32,"So you need sort of a run-up, just like you do with anything."
00:31:32,00:31:34,They need a run-up from a great depth
00:31:34,00:31:36,"to propel themselves out of the water and over it,"
00:31:36,00:31:39,"and it needs to be exactly 1.25 or more,"
00:31:39,00:31:42,1.25 times the height of the dam.
00:31:42,00:31:43,That's how deep it has to be.
00:31:43,00:31:45,"And yeah, at the moment,"
00:31:45,00:31:46,they're sort of thinking of reintroducing beavers
00:31:46,00:31:49,"in chalk streams where the plunge pools won't be that deep,"
00:31:49,00:31:52,"and we'll just have lots of sort of dead salmon, I suppose."
00:31:52,00:31:54,"Caught in the dams, yeah, yeah."
00:31:54,00:31:54,Caught in the dam.
00:31:54,00:31:57,How will we know that they're dead because they're still swimming?
00:31:57,00:31:59,That's no way to tell.
00:31:59,00:32:02,I think salmon's might be as good at flying as ducks are at swimming.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"Well, what's that sport at the Olympics,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,where you have to jump over the bars as you go down the 100 metres?
00:32:06,00:32:07,The hurdles.
00:32:07,00:32:08,Hurdles.
00:32:08,00:32:12,If they've got this dam jumping all sorted.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"Yeah, really good at hurdles in water."
00:32:14,00:32:16,"Are they going along a dry track, then,"
00:32:16,00:32:18,or are they in water with hurdles?
00:32:18,00:32:21,"In the steeple chase, they have one water jump,"
00:32:21,00:32:22,"which they would absolutely nail,"
00:32:22,00:32:25,all of the other ones they would really struggle.
00:32:25,00:32:28,My team's going to suck at this a little bit.
00:32:28,00:32:32,He's entered the salmon into the hurdles?
00:32:32,00:32:35,"Dan's team of the Hannibal Kingdom walking round,"
00:32:35,00:32:38,after all of the different countries of gone past.
00:32:38,00:32:40,"Dan's there with the Hannibal Kingdom flag,"
00:32:40,00:32:43,with a trout mopping along behind him.
00:32:46,00:32:50,"Well, at least they can train on all those treadmills before they get there."
00:32:50,00:32:51,That's true.
00:32:51,00:33:00,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:33:00,00:33:04,"OK, my fact this week is that when the Berlin Wall fell,"
00:33:04,00:33:07,one of the results was an 18 million car traffic jam.
00:33:07,00:33:10,That's crazy.
00:33:10,00:33:12,"18 million? Oh, my days."
00:33:12,00:33:14,That is a lot.
00:33:14,00:33:17,How many cars were there in Germany?
00:33:17,00:33:19,"Well, did everyone in Germany get in their cars and say,"
00:33:19,00:33:22,we've got to go and see this no longer existing wall?
00:33:22,00:33:25,Everyone in East Germany pretty much did do that.
00:33:25,00:33:31,"So I read an interview with some people who were in East Germany at the time,"
00:33:31,00:33:34,"and they said that like everyone else, as soon as the wall fell,"
00:33:34,00:33:38,they got in their car and they decided that they were going to go to Berlin.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"They said that the car radio traffic police told them,"
00:33:40,00:33:44,"whatever you are planning, do not try to drive to Berlin in the border."
00:33:44,00:33:47,"There are a million cars on the road, you will never make it."
00:33:47,00:33:50,"People did sort of, they just wanted to go and check it out, didn't they?"
00:33:50,00:33:54,So it wasn't just people in East Berlin just desperate to get to West Berlin.
00:33:54,00:33:59,"Or vice versa, people were desperate to go with one exception,"
00:33:59,00:34:02,"no, with lots of exceptions, but one famous exception."
00:34:02,00:34:06,So Angela Merkel was having a sauna when the wall came down.
00:34:06,00:34:07,Really?
00:34:07,00:34:10,"Yeah, she said, she knew it was going to happen."
00:34:10,00:34:13,"She said, the atmosphere had been very tense for days."
00:34:13,00:34:14,I thought something was going to happen.
00:34:14,00:34:17,"I heard the announcement, the borders were open,"
00:34:17,00:34:19,"you know, wall was coming down, but it was Thursday,"
00:34:19,00:34:22,"and Thursday's my sauna day, so that's where I went."
00:34:22,00:34:25,"That is iron commitment to the sauna, that's incredible."
00:34:25,00:34:29,"Wow, Dan, don't you own a bit of the Berlin wall?"
00:34:29,00:34:30,"I do, yeah, I think."
00:34:30,00:34:34,I definitely have a bit of a Berlin wall.
00:34:34,00:34:35,I can't confirm it.
00:34:35,00:34:37,"You own a small piece of concrete, yeah."
00:34:37,00:34:41,"Yeah, yeah, James and I, when we were touring fish in Berlin,"
00:34:41,00:34:42,we went to see the wall.
00:34:42,00:34:45,"So it's really interesting what is and isn't a bit of the wall,"
00:34:45,00:34:47,because it turns out there's one man who's basically cornered the market.
00:34:47,00:34:48,Really?
00:34:48,00:34:51,"He, yeah, he's called Volker Pavlovsky."
00:34:51,00:34:55,"I think he was East German, and when the wall came down,"
00:34:55,00:34:59,he collected about 300 metres of it.
00:34:59,00:35:02,"Well, mine's definitely fake then, Andy, because a woman sold me mine."
00:35:02,00:35:06,"OK, he doesn't sell every end of his shoe to Pebble,"
00:35:06,00:35:09,"but he, basically, you can tell."
00:35:09,00:35:11,"So if it's fake, you can crumble it with your fingers,"
00:35:11,00:35:14,"because of the particular concrete they used, I think."
00:35:14,00:35:17,"But he does, he has admitted Pavlovsky,"
00:35:17,00:35:20,"he spray paints the bits he sells, which are authentic,"
00:35:20,00:35:22,and he has sold three tonnes of them.
00:35:22,00:35:25,"And he says it matches the, he wants it to match the graffiti"
00:35:25,00:35:26,that was on the western side of the wall.
00:35:26,00:35:30,And he says packaging is everything Pavlovsky.
00:35:30,00:35:33,So he's patented his own method of attaching the Berlin wall
00:35:33,00:35:36,a bit of it to a plastic globe and putting it in a postcard.
00:35:36,00:35:37,"So, Dan, did you get that, was it?"
00:35:37,00:35:41,"It's on a plastic hold, and mine is graffitied to sort of multiple colours."
00:35:41,00:35:46,"So it sounds like you've got a sort of original bit of slightly retouched,"
00:35:46,00:35:47,"but basically, yeah."
00:35:47,00:35:50,Dan's actually says I love one direction in the graffiti.
00:35:50,00:35:54,"When the Berlin wall fell, there was a lot of problems,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,"like for the people in East Germany,"
00:35:56,00:35:59,"because everyone kind of thinks of it as, OK,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,"they were living in some, you know, terrible place,"
00:36:01,00:36:03,"and it was opened up,"
00:36:03,00:36:06,"and then suddenly they got all the advantages of the West,"
00:36:06,00:36:07,which kind of was true.
00:36:07,00:36:10,But the problem is they weren't used to that.
00:36:10,00:36:12,And so all of their culture was suddenly taken over
00:36:12,00:36:15,"by this kind of European, Western European culture."
00:36:15,00:36:18,"And a lot of the East Germans felt really overwhelmed,"
00:36:18,00:36:20,like massively overwhelmed.
00:36:20,00:36:23,So they didn't know how to pronounce the food in McDonald's.
00:36:23,00:36:25,They didn't know how supermarket trolleys worked.
00:36:25,00:36:28,"They felt like this was their country,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,but they didn't know how to live in it.
00:36:30,00:36:32,"I mean, no one knows how supermarket trolleys work."
00:36:33,00:36:36,Just spin round and round on the spot and then you crush it into someone.
00:36:36,00:36:38,It's physics can't explain it.
00:36:38,00:36:41,"No one told them that you weren't supposed to know how they work, right?"
00:36:41,00:36:43,"Oh, no, so sad."
00:36:43,00:36:46,"I know. And so what happened was they kind of,"
00:36:46,00:36:49,"they, the people in West Germany thought"
00:36:49,00:36:51,the East Germans were quite ungrateful
00:36:51,00:36:53,because they were getting a lot of money
00:36:53,00:36:55,"and a lot of aid from the West,"
00:36:55,00:36:58,but they were kind of not really loving it very much.
00:36:58,00:37:01,And so the West Germans called the East Germans
00:37:01,00:37:04,"Yamarossis, meaning moaning Easterners."
00:37:04,00:37:06,"So they just were like, ""Oh, these guys are moaning."""
00:37:06,00:37:09,And the East Germans called the West Germans
00:37:09,00:37:12,"Bessavises, meaning know-it-all Westerners."
00:37:12,00:37:13,"And so there was like,"
00:37:13,00:37:16,basically it took a lot of time for it all to become homogenized
00:37:16,00:37:19,so that everyone was kind of knew what was going on.
00:37:19,00:37:21,"I found that really interesting, really."
00:37:21,00:37:22,It is really interesting.
00:37:22,00:37:24,"But yeah, traffic jams. They're fun, aren't they?"
00:37:24,00:37:26,Not really.
00:37:26,00:37:29,There's one in Indonesia that's quite famous.
00:37:30,00:37:32,It's kind of not so bad now because they fixed the road.
00:37:32,00:37:35,But it was on one of the main motorways
00:37:35,00:37:38,and it was the exit for the city of Brebus.
00:37:38,00:37:40,And so locals called it the Brexit.
00:37:40,00:37:43,And apparently this is where they had the worst traffic
00:37:43,00:37:45,in the whole of Indonesia over the last few years.
00:37:45,00:37:49,"Wait, was it called the Brexit before we had a Brexit?"
00:37:49,00:37:50,I think it was named after that.
00:37:50,00:37:53,I think they saw that the English Brexit
00:37:53,00:37:55,"and thought, ""Oh, we can name our massive traffic jam after that."""
00:37:55,00:37:58,Our catastrophic piler.
00:37:59,00:38:01,When no one knows where they're going or what they're doing.
00:38:01,00:38:04,"""Oh, great. So nice to know we're still influencing global culture."""
00:38:04,00:38:10,There was a traffic jam in the Dartford Tunnel in 2006
00:38:10,00:38:13,where a lorry driver hit a ventilation fan
00:38:13,00:38:16,because he wasn't in the right part of the lane.
00:38:16,00:38:20,And that is known by motoring organizations as the Pratt.
00:38:20,00:38:22,They always... What do you mean?
00:38:22,00:38:23,It was like a really... The move.
00:38:23,00:38:26,"No, it's like a really famous old traffic jam."
00:38:26,00:38:27,"And whenever you're talking,"
00:38:27,00:38:30,"whenever you're reminiscing about the olden days and the traffic jams,"
00:38:30,00:38:33,and one of the worst ones that they ever had in London was this one.
00:38:33,00:38:34,And it's known as the Pratt.
00:38:34,00:38:35,Why didn't they call it the shit?
00:38:35,00:38:37,Because that would have been the shit hitting the fan.
00:38:37,00:38:39,Feels so right.
00:38:39,00:38:40,They needed you on branding.
00:38:40,00:38:43,It's all about branding.
00:38:43,00:38:46,"I think my favorite traffic jam that I've read of,"
00:38:46,00:38:48,and it feels like this is...
00:38:48,00:38:50,"It feels potentially apocryphal,"
00:38:50,00:38:52,"but in August of 1991,"
00:38:52,00:38:55,there was a two-mile traffic jam at the entrance of the Dartford Tunnel.
00:38:55,00:38:59,And it was caused because drivers weren't unable to go on due to laughter.
00:38:59,00:39:03,And what had happened was people were listening to the cricket that day.
00:39:03,00:39:06,People had heard Andy's joke about the shit
00:39:06,00:39:07,hitting the fan in the Dartford Tunnel.
00:39:07,00:39:12,"So August 1991, there was a cricket match on,"
00:39:12,00:39:16,"and Ian Botham had leapt over the wickets,"
00:39:16,00:39:19,and he caught the bales and they went off and he was out.
00:39:19,00:39:22,"And it led to Jonathan Agnew, Agra's,"
00:39:22,00:39:26,saying what has become one of the great cricket commentary moments
00:39:26,00:39:27,of he couldn't get his leg over.
00:39:27,00:39:29,He didn't quite get his leg over was the line.
00:39:29,00:39:32,"And to begin with, there's no laughter,"
00:39:32,00:39:36,but the two of the commentators just start pissing themselves really hard.
00:39:36,00:39:37,"I listened to it the other day,"
00:39:37,00:39:40,and you do laugh a lot when you listen to it as well.
00:39:40,00:39:42,"So supposedly around the country,"
00:39:42,00:39:45,"people were finding it so funny that they had to pull over in their cars,"
00:39:45,00:39:46,they had to stop.
00:39:46,00:39:49,"And at the Dartford Tunnel,"
00:39:49,00:39:51,this guy was unable to pay the toll
00:39:51,00:39:53,"because he just couldn't stop laughing at this thing,"
00:39:53,00:39:55,and it ended up with a two-mile-long traffic jam.
00:39:55,00:40:01,Is that why they've now taken away the toll barriers in the Dartford Tunnel
00:40:01,00:40:02,"and replaced them with nothing,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,so you don't know there's any Dart Charge
00:40:04,00:40:06,until you're hit with a fine two weeks later?
00:40:06,00:40:07,"Um, wow."
00:40:07,00:40:08,I think the podcast can be a bit personal.
00:40:08,00:40:10,"Okay, sorry, I brought my personal line."
00:40:10,00:40:13,Allow us to do a legal history episode presented.
00:40:13,00:40:17,Just a funny cricket anecdote suddenly turned into a political…
00:40:17,00:40:18,"Look, it's a fucking outreach."
00:40:19,00:40:23,"And I mean, there are lots of signs everywhere telling you how to pay it,"
00:40:23,00:40:23,but yeah.
00:40:23,00:40:25,"Okay, we are going to have this debate later."
00:40:25,00:40:25,There are not.
00:40:25,00:40:28,"Anyway, good story about cricket, Dan,"
00:40:28,00:40:29,because I've been waiting to get this complaint
00:40:29,00:40:32,"about the Dartford Tunnel in for like two years,"
00:40:32,00:40:34,and finally had the chance.
00:40:34,00:40:37,"For international listeners, by the way,"
00:40:37,00:40:41,the Lego for thing is a sexual innuendo in Britain.
00:40:41,00:40:44,And cricket is a game between two teams of 11 players.
00:40:44,00:40:49,"Yeah, and Dartford is a place where Anna shall not be visiting again."
00:40:50,00:40:51,Unless they sort themselves out.
00:40:51,00:41:00,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:41:00,00:41:01,and that is my fact.
00:41:01,00:41:04,My fact this week is that there's a stone marker in Wisconsin
00:41:04,00:41:08,that commemorates the spot where Elvis Presley once successfully stopped a fight
00:41:08,00:41:11,"by jumping out of his limo, pulling some karate moves,"
00:41:11,00:41:13,and threatening to kick everyone's ass.
00:41:13,00:41:17,So it's this beautiful little marker.
00:41:17,00:41:21,"It's on the corner of Highway 51 in East Washington Avenue,"
00:41:21,00:41:25,"and this happened on June the 24th, 1977, at about 1 a.m."
00:41:25,00:41:28,He was riding in one of the two limousines
00:41:28,00:41:33,"that he and his posse travel in, and they saw these guys just fighting on the outside."
00:41:33,00:41:40,"And Elvis is a, I believe he was 8th Dan Black Belt karate student who,"
00:41:40,00:41:43,"so he knew his moves, he loved karate,"
00:41:43,00:41:45,"and he thought, I want to stop this fight."
00:41:45,00:41:48,But he wanted to stop it by fighting them himself.
00:41:48,00:41:51,"So he jumped out, and he engaged all the people in the fight"
00:41:51,00:41:53,"with a sentence saying, ""I'll take you on,"""
00:41:53,00:41:55,and then showed some karate moves.
00:41:55,00:41:58,"They all recognized that it was him, and thought,"
00:41:58,00:41:59,"""Oh my God, it's such a chance to meet Elvis."""
00:41:59,00:42:01,"So they stopped fighting, and came over and said, ""Hi."""
00:42:01,00:42:07,"And this was, you know, 52 days later, he died, Elvis, unfortunately."
00:42:07,00:42:08,"-Not connected to this, though. -This is one of the last--"
00:42:08,00:42:10,"-No. -Not connected to this, no."
00:42:10,00:42:12,"He wasn't, yeah, he wasn't chased down 52 days later."
00:42:12,00:42:15,He didn't die after 52 days of constant fighting.
00:42:15,00:42:20,"So it was really a toss-up, isn't it,"
00:42:20,00:42:23,"between whether the fight was stopped by him pulling his awesome karate moves,"
00:42:23,00:42:25,or the fact that he was Elvis Presley.
00:42:25,00:42:29,"It's definitely that he was Elvis, it's definitely that he was Elvis."
00:42:29,00:42:33,"But yeah, I mean, he was mad into karate."
00:42:33,00:42:37,"A lot of people think that that side of Elvis was token, kind of,"
00:42:37,00:42:38,"""Oh, let's give him Black Belt,"""
00:42:38,00:42:41,"because he's shown up for one lesson, sort of honorary stuff."
00:42:41,00:42:43,He was really dedicated to it.
00:42:43,00:42:45,He started it when he was stationed in the war in Germany.
00:42:45,00:42:47,And that was 1958.
00:42:47,00:42:51,And it was his obsession all the way through to his death.
00:42:51,00:42:54,It got to the point where he was actually training kids
00:42:54,00:42:55,to learn karate as well.
00:42:55,00:42:58,So he became a karate instructor himself.
00:42:58,00:43:01,"Look, all you have to do, kids, is become Elvis Presley,"
00:43:01,00:43:02,and you will win any fight.
00:43:05,00:43:11,"So this stone marker, it was put up on the 30-year anniversary"
00:43:11,00:43:12,of this historic event.
00:43:12,00:43:17,"And when they put it up, the local TV station re-enacted the fight"
00:43:17,00:43:22,"as part of the ceremony, which sounds pretty cool."
00:43:22,00:43:24,"And it was outside a gas station,"
00:43:24,00:43:27,"which they hoped using this marker might bring some custom,"
00:43:27,00:43:31,but it closed and demolished about two years later.
00:43:31,00:43:33,So it didn't really work.
00:43:33,00:43:36,"Yeah, not a perfect ending."
00:43:36,00:43:38,"He loved defending himself with guns, though,"
00:43:38,00:43:40,"we should say, as well as liking karate."
00:43:40,00:43:42,Elvis was also a gun maniac.
00:43:42,00:43:45,He would carry up to three guns on him at all times.
00:43:45,00:43:48,So there were one or two shows where a handgun
00:43:48,00:43:51,would just fall out of his boot on stage.
00:43:51,00:43:54,"And I think, because he was very worried about his safety,"
00:43:54,00:43:56,"because a lot of guns in America,"
00:43:56,00:43:58,and he would have been a big target.
00:43:58,00:44:02,So I think he carried the gun on stage for that reason.
00:44:02,00:44:04,"But obviously, the idea that he would ever"
00:44:04,00:44:07,get the chance to use it successfully during a show
00:44:07,00:44:09,or to return fire if he was being shot at
00:44:09,00:44:12,would have been a very foolish thing to do.
00:44:12,00:44:14,"Although, is that why he sung ""Don't Step on My Blue Suede Shoes"""
00:44:14,00:44:17,"because that's a genuine warning, presumably."
00:44:17,00:44:19,I've got a life gun in there.
00:44:19,00:44:22,"He turned up at the White House once,"
00:44:22,00:44:24,"wanting to meet Richard Nixon, didn't he?"
00:44:24,00:44:27,"And in fact, there's a famous photo of their meeting,"
00:44:27,00:44:29,because it was obviously a huge encounter.
00:44:30,00:44:33,I think the photo was something like the most requested
00:44:33,00:44:35,from whichever institution is storing it.
00:44:35,00:44:38,"It's something like the National Library of Congress,"
00:44:38,00:44:40,which is Elvis and Nixon standing next to each other.
00:44:40,00:44:43,It's the most requested they've ever had in their archives.
00:44:43,00:44:46,But he wanted a drug enforcement badge
00:44:46,00:44:49,from the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.
00:44:49,00:44:50,"According to his daughter,"
00:44:50,00:44:52,"it's because he believed that if he had the badge,"
00:44:52,00:44:53,"he could turn up in any country,"
00:44:53,00:44:56,"both wearing guns and carrying drugs, and that would be fine."
00:44:56,00:45:00,"He turned up with a gun to give Richard Nixon,"
00:45:00,00:45:02,"and he had to be kind of gently told,"
00:45:02,00:45:05,"""We don't really let people just come along and say,"
00:45:05,00:45:07,"""Even if they're Elvis, even if they're Elvis,"
00:45:07,00:45:09,"""we don't let people with guns just walk up to the president"
00:45:09,00:45:11,"""and say, 'I've got this for you.'"""
00:45:11,00:45:12,"He, when he was in that fight,"
00:45:12,00:45:15,he was wearing a DEA kind of tracksuit.
00:45:15,00:45:19,That's how much he loved the Drug Enforcement Agency.
00:45:19,00:45:21,He cosplayed them all the time.
00:45:21,00:45:22,"And so, yeah."
00:45:22,00:45:23,You're kidding.
00:45:23,00:45:24,"Yeah, no, honestly, yeah."
00:45:24,00:45:26,"It's honestly like, I can't think of an equivalent."
00:45:26,00:45:29,It's like Stormzy wanting to work for the Home Office.
00:45:30,00:45:32,Just wearing like a suit and a briefcase.
00:45:32,00:45:37,Some stuff on plaques.
00:45:37,00:45:37,"Oh, yeah."
00:45:37,00:45:39,"Yeah, me and stuff and markers."
00:45:39,00:45:40,The blue plaque.
00:45:40,00:45:42,"So, we have blue plaques all over London,"
00:45:42,00:45:44,"and you get them all over the world, I think."
00:45:44,00:45:49,They were conceived in 1863 by a guy called William Ewert.
00:45:49,00:45:53,"And he himself has a blue plaque, which is quite nice."
00:45:53,00:45:56,"It's on Hanson Library, and it says,"
00:45:56,00:46:00,"""John Beard Singer and William Ewert's promoter of public..."""
00:46:00,00:46:03,"Sorry, ""John Beard Singer and William Ewert's promoter"
00:46:03,00:46:05,"of public libraries lived here."""
00:46:05,00:46:07,"So, he has to share it with another guy"
00:46:07,00:46:09,who lived in the place at the same time.
00:46:09,00:46:09,I read about that.
00:46:09,00:46:12,I thought that was rubbish for Paul William Ewert.
00:46:12,00:46:16,"They should say, ""William Ewert invented this thing."""
00:46:16,00:46:17,Yeah.
00:46:17,00:46:18,Or whatever.
00:46:18,00:46:18,Yeah.
00:46:18,00:46:19,Put it slightly better than that.
00:46:19,00:46:20,Maybe he'll get a second one.
00:46:20,00:46:22,They want to put it in the spot where he had the idea
00:46:22,00:46:24,"for the blue plaques, as they often do."
00:46:24,00:46:26,It was here that they had the idea.
00:46:26,00:46:28,"Yeah, like, it's here where penicillin was first,"
00:46:28,00:46:29,"you know, that kind of stuff."
00:46:29,00:46:30,"Well, they've taken a long..."
00:46:30,00:46:32,"If that's their plan, it has taken them a while."
00:46:32,00:46:34,They still haven't quite got around to it.
00:46:34,00:46:36,Have you heard of Sidney Lewis?
00:46:36,00:46:39,"He's got a blue plaque, and he is not very well known."
00:46:39,00:46:42,But I also read through just this big long list of people with plaques.
00:46:42,00:46:44,Sidney Lewis was the youngest British soldier
00:46:44,00:46:46,in the First World War.
00:46:46,00:46:47,Guess how old he was when he signed up?
00:46:47,00:46:48,Forty.
00:46:48,00:46:50,Twelve.
00:46:50,00:46:52,He was twelve.
00:46:52,00:46:53,"He was four, Dan."
00:46:55,00:46:58,He was three four-year-olds in a large trench car.
00:46:58,00:47:02,"They passed for twelve, which, happily,"
00:47:02,00:47:03,you could get into the war at twelve.
00:47:03,00:47:04,Four years old.
00:47:04,00:47:05,"No, he signed up age twelve."
00:47:05,00:47:08,He fought for six weeks at the Somme.
00:47:08,00:47:09,Pretty serious stuff.
00:47:09,00:47:12,He got sent home after his mum sent a copy
00:47:12,00:47:15,"of his birth certificate to the war office and said,"
00:47:15,00:47:18,"""That is my twelve-year-old son fighting in the war."
00:47:18,00:47:20,"Please send him home."""
00:47:20,00:47:21,Pretty embarrassing for Sidney.
00:47:21,00:47:24,"But anyway, he then rejoined in 1918,"
00:47:24,00:47:25,while the war was still going on.
00:47:25,00:47:28,"As far as I can tell, he cannot have been older than fifteen"
00:47:28,00:47:30,the second time he signed up for the First World War.
00:47:30,00:47:33,"Yeah, but at this stage, he has experience as well, though, doesn't he?"
00:47:33,00:47:34,You know?
00:47:34,00:47:35,"Yeah, that's true."
00:47:35,00:47:36,That's what he's doing.
00:47:36,00:47:37,Imagine.
00:47:37,00:47:38,"Mind you, they all ripped into him."
00:47:38,00:47:40,"They were like, ""Well, you're the guy whose mum came"
00:47:40,00:47:41,"and picked him up in the trenches."""
00:47:41,00:47:47,"Anyway, he then was in the Second World War in bomb disposal,"
00:47:47,00:47:48,and then he owned a pub.
00:47:48,00:47:49,What a life.
00:47:49,00:47:51,What age did he own the pub?
00:47:51,00:47:54,Fifteen.
00:47:54,00:47:54,Yeah.
00:47:54,00:47:57,Wow.
00:47:57,00:48:01,Are you guys familiar with the website Plaque to the Future?
00:48:01,00:48:01,No.
00:48:01,00:48:06,"This is… There's a woman in Philadelphia who's set it up,"
00:48:06,00:48:10,"and the essence behind it is that to get a blue plaque,"
00:48:10,00:48:11,it's actually quite difficult.
00:48:11,00:48:12,You have to jump through quite a lot of hoops
00:48:12,00:48:15,to prove that it's necessary and you're famous enough.
00:48:15,00:48:18,"And so she has designed these waterproof blue stickers,"
00:48:18,00:48:20,which look almost exactly like blue plaques.
00:48:20,00:48:23,"But if you go to the website Plaque to the Future,"
00:48:23,00:48:27,you can just write your own memory and say where you want it put.
00:48:27,00:48:29,And you'll appear as a blue plaque.
00:48:29,00:48:32,"And so in Philadelphia, there's, for instance,"
00:48:32,00:48:35,"you've got a blue plaque on a telephone pole,"
00:48:35,00:48:37,"and the inscription reads,"
00:48:37,00:48:41,"""Derek B. was walking along Dickinson Street on July 2017"
00:48:41,00:48:43,"when he saw a woman open her door,"
00:48:43,00:48:46,overhand throw a two-thirds eaten hot dog
00:48:46,00:48:49,"into this telephone pole, and close her door again."""
00:48:49,00:48:51,Derek has so many questions.
00:48:51,00:48:52,That's great.
00:48:53,00:48:54,That's really good.
00:48:54,00:48:57,There's another one.
00:48:57,00:48:58,I find this one really questionable.
00:48:58,00:49:01,"So this one is in a park,"
00:49:01,00:49:04,"and the headline is, ""X girlfriend spotted."
00:49:04,00:49:06,PTM saw his ex-girlfriend here.
00:49:06,00:49:07,He felt weird about it.
00:49:07,00:49:09,She felt weird about it.
00:49:09,00:49:10,"He asked her about her jewellery business,"
00:49:10,00:49:12,and it was obvious he didn't really care.
00:49:12,00:49:14,"He now avoids this intersection."""
00:49:14,00:49:17,Now that's a slam because it's PT who's put the blue plaque there.
00:49:17,00:49:19,Do you know that for sure?
00:49:19,00:49:21,"Yes, because it says he avoids this intersection."
00:49:21,00:49:24,Did you know that she might hang around
00:49:24,00:49:24,the intersection all the time?
00:49:24,00:49:26,That's the only reason she knows
00:49:26,00:49:27,that he avoids it these days.
00:49:27,00:49:28,That's a good point.
00:49:28,00:49:29,"It might be written from her point of view,"
00:49:29,00:49:30,"and she was saying,"
00:49:30,00:49:33,"""He clearly didn't care about my jewellery business."""
00:49:33,00:49:34,"Well, but then the headline is,"
00:49:34,00:49:35,"""X girlfriend spotted."""
00:49:35,00:49:36,But you're right.
00:49:36,00:49:38,"Maybe she was writing sort of from his perspective, but..."
00:49:38,00:49:40,It could have been one really nosy dog walker
00:49:40,00:49:43,who was kind of walking past both of them
00:49:43,00:49:44,and heard this story happening.
00:49:44,00:49:45,That's a really good point.
00:49:45,00:49:47,"That's a really good point, yeah."
00:49:47,00:49:48,There's a cool one.
00:49:48,00:49:50,"In the '70s, a plaque was laid down"
00:49:50,00:49:53,in a rail station in Kassel in Germany.
00:49:53,00:49:57,"And it had on it on the 23rd of March, 1994,"
00:49:57,00:50:01,"from 3 to 4 p.m., Dieter Meier will stand on this plaque."
00:50:01,00:50:04,"And this was set down by this artist,"
00:50:04,00:50:06,and he was a Swiss musician and artist.
00:50:06,00:50:09,And so this was 1972.
00:50:09,00:50:11,"And all those years later, 22 years later,"
00:50:11,00:50:15,there he was standing on the plaque from 3 to 4 p.m.
00:50:15,00:50:17,Just as part of this.
00:50:17,00:50:19,"Yeah, in stylistic installation."
00:50:19,00:50:20,It was the artist who...
00:50:20,00:50:21,"Yeah, it was the guy who was the guy."
00:50:21,00:50:23,It wasn't predicting someone else would turn up and stand on it.
00:50:23,00:50:24,"No, no, no."
00:50:24,00:50:25,"I mean, that would have been way cooler."
00:50:25,00:50:28,But so did a load of people kind of turn up?
00:50:28,00:50:30,"Like, probably hundreds of thousands of people"
00:50:30,00:50:32,"were there to see this momentous thing happening,"
00:50:32,00:50:34,or did one or two losers kind of...
00:50:34,00:50:37,I can't believe I missed it.
00:50:37,00:50:39,I know.
00:50:39,00:50:40,You had to get tickets so fast.
00:50:40,00:50:44,"That would be a hard thing to just to remember to do,"
00:50:44,00:50:46,if I said I'll do something in 22 years.
00:50:46,00:50:47,"Like, he must have felt..."
00:50:47,00:50:50,He must have had to buy a diary for 22 years from now.
00:50:50,00:50:52,I don't know how far in advance they print diaries.
00:50:52,00:50:56,"I think if you'd gone to the effort of printing a plaque,"
00:50:56,00:50:59,"cementing it to the ground at a specific train station,"
00:50:59,00:51:01,it's probably going to stick in your head
00:51:01,00:51:03,a bit more than just saying it out loud.
00:51:03,00:51:04,"Do you reckon, like, whenever he was..."
00:51:04,00:51:07,"Someone said, ""Oh, I've got a party coming up soon."""
00:51:07,00:51:09,"And he's like, ""Oh, can I just check it's not in 21 years,"
00:51:09,00:51:11,six months and three days?
00:51:11,00:51:13,"Because I have this thing I really can't do."""
00:51:13,00:51:17,"And then, what if, like, that week he got given jury duty"
00:51:17,00:51:19,"or something like that, that was too awkward, wasn't it?"
00:51:19,00:51:20,Yeah.
00:51:20,00:51:20,What do you do?
00:51:20,00:51:22,Can you get out of jury duty with that excuse?
00:51:22,00:51:24,"Because there are some loopholes, you know,"
00:51:24,00:51:25,"if you're a doctor or a lawyer,"
00:51:25,00:51:26,but I don't know if it can be
00:51:26,00:51:28,I've got a stand on my own plaque thing.
00:51:28,00:51:30,I don't know if that passes.
00:51:30,00:51:32,"I mean, there are lots of..."
00:51:32,00:51:35,"Like, if you're building up to that for 22 years,"
00:51:35,00:51:36,"which I imagine he was,"
00:51:36,00:51:37,"because he probably didn't have much else on,"
00:51:37,00:51:40,"then, like, the couple of weeks before that"
00:51:40,00:51:41,"is quite high stakes, isn't it?"
00:51:41,00:51:43,"Yeah, that is high stakes, yeah."
00:51:43,00:51:44,"Like, he must have just stayed in the house"
00:51:44,00:51:46,for that whole time in case something happened.
00:51:46,00:51:48,"God, if you were his friend,"
00:51:48,00:51:50,wouldn't you sort of book your wedding or something
00:51:50,00:51:54,"for that day, or just really test him?"
00:51:54,00:52:01,Speaking of famous people who do martial arts
00:52:01,00:52:04,"and commemorations, they're on the first..."
00:52:04,00:52:06,The first sentence.
00:52:06,00:52:08,The first ever statue of Bruce Lee
00:52:08,00:52:10,"was in Mostar in Bosnia,"
00:52:11,00:52:14,and he was chosen because he was the only person
00:52:14,00:52:17,"that all the country's Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks all liked."
00:52:17,00:52:21,"So they just couldn't decide on anyone else to putt,"
00:52:21,00:52:24,"but they thought, Bruce Lee, we all like him."
00:52:24,00:52:26,He can go in our place.
00:52:26,00:52:29,"And it was put up on November 26th, 2005,"
00:52:29,00:52:34,"one day before the famous statue in Hong Kong went up,"
00:52:34,00:52:34,which I don't know.
00:52:34,00:52:35,Really?
00:52:35,00:52:36,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:52:36,00:52:38,They must have heard that this one in Hong Kong
00:52:38,00:52:40,was happening on Bruce Lee's birthday
00:52:40,00:52:42,and thought we'd better get in there one day earlier.
00:52:42,00:52:45,"And they said, ""Oh, the one thing we all have in common"
00:52:45,00:52:47,"""is Bruce Lee,"" and then they did that."
00:52:47,00:52:50,But then both the Bosnians and the Croats
00:52:50,00:52:53,"complained about it because he was doing like a karate move,"
00:52:53,00:52:55,but he was doing it in the direction of the area
00:52:55,00:52:57,"where all those people lived,"
00:52:57,00:52:59,and they thought that it was an act of aggression
00:52:59,00:53:01,by the Serbs that they were making Bruce Lee
00:53:01,00:53:03,kind of fight in their direction.
00:53:03,00:53:06,So they should put it on a rotating base.
00:53:06,00:53:08,That's a really good idea.
00:53:08,00:53:08,That's a great idea.
00:53:08,00:53:10,"I might put that forward, actually."
00:53:10,00:53:12,Was Bruce Lee alive to see that happen?
00:53:12,00:53:14,No.
00:53:14,00:53:15,"No, no, he was dead."
00:53:15,00:53:16,I don't know when he died.
00:53:16,00:53:18,"Yeah, it would have been his 65th birthday,"
00:53:18,00:53:19,but he died probably.
00:53:19,00:53:21,"He died in the 80s, I think."
00:53:21,00:53:21,"Oh, did he?"
00:53:21,00:53:22,"Okay, okay."
00:53:22,00:53:24,"1973, he died, sorry."
00:53:24,00:53:27,"'73, so I was just out by about 30 years."
00:53:27,00:53:28,"Okay, cool."
00:53:28,00:53:31,Richard Nixon has a plaque on the moon.
00:53:31,00:53:33,Let's see.
00:53:33,00:53:34,Does he?
00:53:34,00:53:37,"Yeah, in fact, it's also got Neil Armstrong"
00:53:38,00:53:41,Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.
00:53:41,00:53:42,Yeah.
00:53:42,00:53:43,"Yeah, yeah."
00:53:43,00:53:46,But also it has Nixon because it was the first moonbanding.
00:53:46,00:53:47,"So there's a plaque which says,"
00:53:47,00:53:50,"""Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon."""
00:53:50,00:53:52,And Nixon's signature is on there as well.
00:53:52,00:53:53,And it's such a cheat.
00:53:53,00:53:55,"Wait a minute, that's a trick, isn't it?"
00:53:55,00:53:56,"I mean, it's bad enough."
00:53:56,00:53:59,"If you say here are some people on Earth went on the moon,"
00:53:59,00:54:00,one of them is Michael Collins.
00:54:00,00:54:02,"Well, first of all, it wasn't."
00:54:02,00:54:05,He was just in the kind of space capsule.
00:54:05,00:54:07,But Nixon never even left the Earth.
00:54:07,00:54:09,Nixon never went to the moon.
00:54:09,00:54:10,"I know, it's unfair."
00:54:10,00:54:12,"And also, well, not only is it a cheat"
00:54:12,00:54:13,"because he didn't go to the moon,"
00:54:13,00:54:16,but he had only been president for about six months.
00:54:16,00:54:17,"I mean, it was complete."
00:54:17,00:54:20,"You know, he wasn't really a major move."
00:54:20,00:54:21,What's the space program?
00:54:21,00:54:24,He was still the president of the United States.
00:54:24,00:54:25,How long do you have to serve
00:54:25,00:54:29,before he was eligible in your mind to be on the plaque?
00:54:29,00:54:30,That was all set up by Kennedy.
00:54:30,00:54:33,"Kennedy, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:54:33,00:54:35,The more I hear about this Richard Nixon stuff.
00:54:36,00:54:39,"Yeah, it would be like if you sacked me from the podcast"
00:54:39,00:54:42,"and got Richard Nixon on to this set,"
00:54:42,00:54:44,and then you won a major award.
00:54:44,00:54:45,I would feel pretty miffed
00:54:45,00:54:47,because I feel like I'd done more of the spade work than Nixon.
00:54:47,00:54:50,"Yeah, you have."
00:54:50,00:54:52,Thank you.
00:54:52,00:54:53,"Thank you, James."
00:54:53,00:54:55,"And shame on you, Dan and Anna, for not affecting us."
00:54:55,00:54:59,I was trying to work out on what level that analogy function.
00:54:59,00:55:02,"Although, actually, when we went to Washington,"
00:55:02,00:55:03,"we stayed in the Watergate Hotel,"
00:55:03,00:55:05,which was made famous by Nixon.
00:55:05,00:55:08,And that actually added quite a lot to my experience of that.
00:55:08,00:55:11,"So he did do quite a lot of podcasts, I kind of feel."
00:55:11,00:55:14,"It's 50/50 between Richard and Andy, isn't it?"
00:55:14,00:55:15,"Yeah, OK, great."
00:55:15,00:55:17,I wonder what analogy Nixon would have come up with.
00:55:17,00:55:20,Probably a better one.
00:55:20,00:55:21,Can you imagine?
00:55:21,00:55:23,If only.
00:55:23,00:55:26,"I've got a slightly weird one,"
00:55:26,00:55:28,but it's one of those weird ones
00:55:28,00:55:30,where I don't know if it'll make it into the show.
00:55:30,00:55:31,I'll say it.
00:55:31,00:55:32,Stop me if you think it's...
00:55:32,00:55:34,"There, I won't stop you, that would be rude."
00:55:34,00:55:37,So in 2002...
00:55:37,00:55:39,"No, 2002, no way."
00:55:39,00:55:39,Stop.
00:55:39,00:55:42,Bruce Lee wasn't even alive then.
00:55:42,00:55:49,"2002, James Earl Jones was invited to Lorde Hill, Florida"
00:55:49,00:55:53,to be the keynote speaker for Martin Luther King Day.
00:55:53,00:55:58,"And in order to commemorate it, they made a plaque that said,"
00:55:58,00:56:01,"""You know, James Earl Jones,"
00:56:01,00:56:03,"""thank you for keeping the dream alive."""
00:56:03,00:56:08,"Unfortunately, at the place where they were making the plaque,"
00:56:08,00:56:08,they got it wrong.
00:56:08,00:56:10,And what the plaque ended up saying
00:56:10,00:56:12,"was not, ""James Earl Jones,"
00:56:12,00:56:14,"""thank you for keeping the dream alive,"""
00:56:14,00:56:17,"but it instead said, ""James Earl Ray,"
00:56:17,00:56:20,"""the man who assassinated Martin Luther King."""
00:56:20,00:56:22,So they managed to catch this
00:56:22,00:56:23,"just before it was unveiled,"
00:56:23,00:56:24,but the story went around.
00:56:24,00:56:27,And the company that designed the plaque
00:56:27,00:56:29,tried to come up with all these excuses.
00:56:29,00:56:30,They said that a lot of people working on it
00:56:30,00:56:31,didn't speak English.
00:56:32,00:56:34,So there must have been a miscommunication.
00:56:34,00:56:36,They also said that there was a plaque designed
00:56:36,00:56:39,"just before that one that was made out to Ray Johnson,"
00:56:39,00:56:43,and they think the Ray somehow made it onto the next template
00:56:43,00:56:45,when they were doing the James Earl Jones one.
00:56:45,00:56:48,"But yeah, wow, what a mess up."
00:56:48,00:56:50,"That's someone's typed into Google,"
00:56:50,00:56:53,"""Martin Luther King, James Earl,"""
00:56:53,00:56:54,"and they've seen Ray and they thought,"
00:56:54,00:56:55,"""It must be this one, lads."""
00:56:55,00:56:57,"Damn, you all told correct."
00:56:57,00:57:01,That's amazing.
00:57:02,00:57:02,Yeah.
00:57:02,00:57:04,"Okay, that's it."
00:57:04,00:57:06,That is all of our facts.
