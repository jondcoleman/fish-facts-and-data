 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,200
 you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,280
 James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tachinsky, and once again we have gathered round the microphones

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go, starting

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,840
 with you, Andy. My fact is that along with their drink New Yorkers in Bars used to be served a

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:54,720
 sandwich full of rubber. What? Yummy. Yummy. Why on earth would that be? Well this is a sort of

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,840
 legal loophole that bars had to jump through in order to serve their customers. So it's

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,200
 sort of something called the Reigns Law basically. People were trying to curb public drunkenness

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,400
 in the 1890s in America and in particular in New York and this politician called John Reigns got

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,400
 this law passed which was designed to put nasty bars out of business. So there were various,

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,760
 you know, the cost of a liquor license tripled and you had to keep your curtains open on a Sunday

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,080
 so that police officers could host all sorts of things. Wow. The law was partly designed to

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,600
 shut down Sunday drinking and that was very annoying for people and for bars because it was

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,640
 the most profitable day of the week and it was most people's only day off. But there was a loophole

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,080
 in the law where if you were serving a meal you could serve a drink with it any day of the week

17
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,520
 as long as you were a lodging house with ten rooms or more, okay? So all these bar owners

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,800
 suddenly teamed up with lodging houses and they opened just one room on the ground floor in the

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,480
 basement. They said, "Oh, this is a dining room for an establishment. This is not a bar at all."

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,520
 And they said they were serving meals to the guests at the lodging houses and what the meal

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,720
 consisted of was the single sandwich which would sometimes have a little puck of rubber in the

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,480
 middle or it would sometimes just be a weak old sandwich which you would get given with your drink

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,440
 and the barman said, "There, there's your meal." And then they take away the sandwich immediately.

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,560
 Like they'd leave it there for two seconds and they'd take it away to the next table

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
 and it would be served to whoever else had also ordered a meal with their drink.

26
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,200
 And that was the loophole. I read that sometimes the sandwich was either a rock or a brick between

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,760
 two slices of bread. Yeah, that's taking the piss out of the loophole a bit, right? It is taking

28
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,600
 the piss and yet they went to court over it and they said, "Well, no, it looks like they are serving

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,560
 a meal." So I don't know who the judge was for that case but yeah. Yeah, there was actually,

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,600
 there was an incident I think where in about 1902 police were called to a bar because there was a

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,200
 massive brawl two guys about to kill each other and one of the people was a customer who'd been

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,800
 genuinely hungry so he'd ordered a sandwich and the innkeeper had brought him the sandwich and

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,880
 then tried to take it away and the customer started eating it and been like, "I've ordered a sandwich,

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,560
 mate." And the innkeeper said, "No, no, you don't understand. We don't really eat these." And it

35
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,320
 ended up in a huge fight and the law enforcement arrived and said, "Look, there's been a misunderstanding.

36
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,840
 It's just pretend sandwiches here. Give it back to the barman and we won't prosecute you for trying

37
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,560
 to eat your restaurant lunch." Wow, so funny. That's brilliant. I love how much this backfired

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,560
 on John Reigns who put this law in place for the Sunday drinking for the fact that the sandwich

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,400
 itself became known as the Reigns sandwich. Yeah. The fact that all these new establishments

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,120
 that opened up in order to use that loophole to their advantage were called Reigns hotels.

41
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,120
 I mean, they really slapped this guy in the face with his own dickhead law.

42
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,280
 Yeah. And it was bad as well because not only did the number of hotels rock it,

43
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,560
 so Brooklyn went from having 13 actual hotels to having 800 hotels in six months, which is insane,

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,520
 but there were lots of beds nearby, obviously, so it led to lots of casual sex and prostitution

45
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,920
 happening because you got really, really drunk not eating your sandwiches and then there was a

46
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,160
 bedroom right upstairs. Yeah, they had to have a minimum of 10 rooms, didn't they? Yeah. But they

47
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,800
 tended to be just tiny little boxes with a bed in there. Yeah. I just want to say for the people

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,320
 at home because Andy is doing a really good job of saying it with his voice, but he is actually

49
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:36,800
 doing the imaginary quote marks every time he does, like, say, "hotel or sandwich." I certainly am.

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,600
 James. Do it again. Do you think the rubber sandwiches is the origin of all American cheese

51
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,480
 today? Oh, a sick burn on American cheese. Yeah. There is still a kind of Reigns sandwich today,

52
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,920
 and it's been brought in this year in New York. This is really exciting new stuff. So it's because

53
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,840
 of the coronavirus, New York introduced rules about serving alcohol when you can get a proper drink,

54
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,960
 and it said you have to order food. There is a bar in Buffalo, New York, which has a food menu,

55
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,840
 and, sorry, hang on, let me just say that again, a food menu. There we are. It includes items like

56
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,720
 just a few grapes, nine French fries, and literally the smallest piece of cheesecake you'll ever see,

57
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,920
 and they all cost a dollar, and they're all technically food, and they're designed to get

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,600
 around safety legislation, which is really meant to be helping the situation.

59
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,800
 What's the idea, sorry, with the safety? Is that so no one can share your food?

60
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,360
 I think it's because they don't want loads of people going to bars all the time,

61
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,800
 but they don't mind people going to restaurants a bit.

62
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,760
 I think that's the design. It's not because people sharing food is leading to the spread of the virus.

63
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,120
 It could be to stop the obesity crisis if everyone's only eating the smallest piece of cheesecake

64
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,720
 you've ever seen. Absolutely. Getting one grape for dessert, but no one else is going to finger that

65
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:10,080
 one grape if that's all you've got, so it's good for the German folks. The bars in late 19th century,

66
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,120
 New York, sound pretty amazing, these places. Apparently the earliest ones that were in the

67
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,840
 Bowery area of New York, they didn't have glasses, they just had a barrel of beer or booze, some kind

68
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,680
 of booze, and what you did is you would pay three cents, and they would give you a rubber tube,

69
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,880
 and for your three cents you were allowed to drink until you ran out of breath.

70
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:41,760
 And so what people learn how to do is, you know, like some musicians can do this circular breathing,

71
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,000
 which means you can play notes for longer and longer. Some people learned how to do that,

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
 so they didn't have to breathe through their mouths, they could just breathe through their

73
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,840
 noses, and they could just drink more and more and more. That's so funny. You'd have to ban anyone

74
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,080
 who belonged to an orchestra from entering your bar. See a bunch of guys with didgeridoo's turning

75
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:08,000
 up. No, absolutely not. Out you go. Out. Yeah, the Bowery sound amazing, right? Like back in the

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,160
 19th century, it was just packed with so many bars that went outdoor, and it was largely men playing

77
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,280
 cards and drinking and having little meals and so on. And I've actually been toâ€¦

78
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,600
 I remember that in Gangs of New York. There's a whole seat where someone has a little meal,

79
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,080
 isn't there? I remember that. I love the fight and the tap-ass joint in Gangs of New York.

80
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,160
 Lee and I, the Caprio, digs into a canapÃ©. I've been to the Bowery. I don't know if you guys

81
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,640
 have that sort of area of New York. I've actually performed there. I did a performance as a drag

82
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,960
 queen. I had to create a drag queen character. I was called Danomite. Yeah, I was Danomite.

83
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,440
 It came with that explosion sound. And there's still the remnants of this kind of awesome

84
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,400
 bohemianness about it, which I imagine what these 19th century bars must have been like,

85
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
 you know, this kind of wild sort of outlawy kind of place.

86
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,520
 Can we go back to your drag career briefly? Yeah. And you have to do it. It's quite

87
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:17,280
 cocketish that name. I think Danomite. Oh, yeah. I was interviewing a famous drag act in America,

88
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,480
 in New York. And as part of the interview, she, as Linda, suggested that I experience it. So she

89
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,720
 made me come up with a character. She dressed me up. And then we did this big bingo night at the

90
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:36,560
 Bowery. And I was Danomite. Oh, was that part of the name, actually? Would that have been in your

91
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,560
 passport? It would have said Danomite and then open brackets, head explodes. Close brackets.

92
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,440
 No, no, it's explosion. It's not head explodes. It's just the way you did for people at home.

93
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,440
 Dan did the head exploding gesture. Yes. Sorry, that is confusing for the listeners as well.

94
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,160
 A lot of this show has so far relied on some visuals that we're going to mean nothing to anyone.

95
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,040
 You might have fit in quite nicely at Billy Mcglory's Armory Hall, Dan, which was the hardest

96
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,920
 chorus of all the bars in New York in that time. So whenever you went there and got drunk, you

97
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,000
 would basically always get robbed. That was just known that that would happen. And it would be by

98
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,560
 either the female regulars or Billy Mcglory used to hire men dressed as women to go and

99
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,560
 rob people in the bar. So you would get, basically, you would get robbed and then they would drag you

100
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,160
 from your table. A bouncer would drag you from the table. They would throw you out in the street.

101
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,480
 And then when you were outside, the bouncer would try and get anything else that was left on you.

102
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,640
 And then if there was anything left at all, the people walking past would get it. And then if

103
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,880
 you didn't have anything, they would steal your clothes. So basically, you would just, oh, if

104
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,040
 you got drunk there, you would end up naked outside without your phone, without your wallet,

105
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,200
 without anything. Why do people go to this pub? Why do they keep going to the pub?

106
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,760
 It was well known as being an extremely kind of rough place that locals would go. And it was

107
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,240
 the people from out of town that would get the treatment. But a lot of people would go because

108
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,920
 there was like a balcony upstairs because it kicked off so often in this pub that people would pay to

109
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,720
 sit in the balcony so they could watch the fights happening. Wow. Isn't that amazing?

110
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,280
 I was just looking at, I was looking a little bit at the Temperance Movement in Britain, which was

111
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,920
 also quite strong around these parts. So America didn't have a monopoly on it. And this is throughout

112
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,840
 the 19th century. And William Gladstone, who was obviously Prime Minister multiple times,

113
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,920
 tried to temper people's alcohol consumption and drunkenness by encouraging people to sell wine

114
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,720
 and encouraging the wider consumption of wine, in fact. And it was because everyone was drinking

115
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,200
 spirits. And he thought that this would be encouraging, more sophisticated sort of drinking,

116
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:54,720
 which we all know is always successful. But he also made it so that food shops and grocers

117
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,960
 didn't need a license to sell alcohol. So they could all start selling alcohol. And again,

118
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,080
 this was to encourage people not to get so drunk because he wanted to end what he called the unnatural

119
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:10,640
 divorce between food and alcohol. So the idea is that you either go to a bar or you go to a grocery

120
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,680
 shop. So people just get really drunk without eating. But the controversial thing about the

121
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,840
 grocers was that it meant that women would be able to buy alcohol. So obviously, if you could only

122
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,360
 buy alcohol in bars, a bit risque for a woman to go to a bar, definitely not on her own. But if

123
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,360
 they were going on a food shop, they could buy a bottle of wine. And there's paper written on it,

124
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,520
 which said obtaining alcohol from a licensed grocer is regarded as perfectly acceptable

125
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,160
 if women are using it for dining, cooking and entertaining. However, there are concerns that

126
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,520
 some women are purchasing alcohol for their own personal use. So extremely controversial.

127
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,440
 Wow. Just while we're on the boundary, I did find one or two more good names of bars that were in

128
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,280
 the bar in the late 19th century. There was the Burnt Rag, there was Chick Trickers Flea Bag,

129
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:06,880
 and McGurk Suicide Hall. Now, I can't work out exactly why McGurk Suicide Hall was so named,

130
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,600
 but it was the first ever bar to deploy an armed bouncer. And his name was Eat Him Up,

131
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,360
 Jack McManus. It sounds like a wrestler, doesn't it? He does. He absolutely does. I think he basically

132
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,320
 was. He was repeatedly arrested for assault. And yet, every time it came to do an actual police

133
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,600
 lineup, people mysteriously had an attack of amnesia when they were asked to point out which

134
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,080
 absolutely thug is the one who beat you up. Some of the most famous bouncers around that time in

135
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:40,240
 New York were women. There was one called Gallus Meg, and I'll read you this quote about her.

136
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,320
 "It was her custom after she'd felt an obstreperous customer with her club to clutch his ear between

137
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,160
 her teeth and drag him to the door amid the frenzy cheers of onlookers. Though she would

138
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,280
 knock you out with a club and they grab your ear with her teeth and drag you by the ear with her

139
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,800
 teeth. And then what would happen is if the victim tried to fight back, she would bite the ear off

140
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,960
 and then they would put it in a jar and they would keep all the ears behind the bar."

141
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,520
 What? No! This didn't happen. I'm telling you this happened. This happened because she had an

142
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,440
 enemy who was another female bouncer known as Sadie the Goat. Okay? And Sadie the Goat once had

143
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,680
 her ear bitten off by Gallus Meg in 1869. And she had to leave the area in disgrace because she'd

144
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,080
 been kicked out of this bar and she'd lost the fight to Gallus Meg. And she walked down to the

145
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,040
 waterfront and she saw a few people trying to kind of rob a boat and they were failing quite

146
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,800
 badly and she was like, "Okay, I'm going to help you guys out here." And she helped them to rob this

147
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,400
 boat and then they decided to take over the boat, put a Jolly Roger on the front of it,

148
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,600
 and sail up and down the river just stealing things from people and kidnapping people and

149
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,320
 becoming like pirates. And they did this for quite a few weeks until eventually the locals decided

150
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,200
 to get guns and stop them from doing it. And so once she'd done all that and finished all that,

151
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,280
 she went back to the bar where Gallus Meg was and kind of made up with her. And Gallus Meg gave her

152
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,320
 her ear back, which she always wore in the lockets around the neck for the rest of her life. Wow!

153
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,120
 Wow! So she labelled the jars of whose ear as well? I mean, because that's... If you're wearing an

154
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,960
 earring, you would know which one was yours, wouldn't you? Awesome. There we go. I think I'd

155
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,200
 recognise my own ear in a jar of his. Do you think you'd have to go to the bar and show them your

156
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,440
 other ear and say, "Have you got one that looks like this?" Yeah, exactly. Have you got a size

157
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,480
 8? And go into the back. I'd be like, "I'm sorry, this is all we have left." Twice the size. It was

158
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:48,640
 a really big dude. Did you know they used to flavour drinks with dead rats during temperance

159
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,760
 and prohibition? Yeah. Oh, during prohibition? What, to put people off? No, to put people,

160
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:01,200
 to turn people on. Well, I don't know how to turn them. Well, there you go. Bars had to come up,

161
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,840
 or Speekies had to come up with such imaginative ways of simulating the taste of what had been

162
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,840
 legitimate alcohol, because they were getting all their alcohol from sort of petrol and,

163
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,680
 you know, these cat-stove fuel and like ink-used alcohol to make it. So you had to try and make

164
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,200
 that taste a bit like gin. And so apparently, to simulate the flavour of bourbon, you added

165
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,360
 dead rats or rotten meat to moonshine and you let it sit for a few days. That's true. Wow.

166
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,120
 Apparently so, then you take it out. And similarly, to simulate scotch, you wanted a smoky flavour,

167
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,960
 and apparently there was creosote, which is like an antiseptic made from tar,

168
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,760
 and that would make it taste nice and smoky. Wow. But the temperance movement is still going

169
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,200
 strong in the US, in various states. I mean, like Utah, if you try and buy alcohol in Utah,

170
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,720
 it's not pill slog sometimes. I didn't know that Utah, until 2017, every single bar had to have

171
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,320
 not an iron curtain, but a Zion curtain. Are you familiar with this? I wasn't,

172
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,040
 but I saw this as well. It's amazing, isn't it? It's incredible. It's crazy. So basically,

173
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,400
 it's a barrier, has to be erected between customer and bartender, so that no customers can see any

174
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,840
 of the drinks being poured or mixed. And the idea is that it protects young people and innocent

175
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,040
 people from the glamour of bartending and drinking. Right. And so, you just sit at a bar and you've

176
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,320
 got this big perspex shield in your face all the time. Yeah, it's always like frosty glass,

177
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,560
 isn't it? So you can't see them. Are you like, it looks like they're holding a rat. What is that?

178
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,680
 All they need to do to stop the glamour of bartending is just introduce

179
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,800
 weather spoons to Utah. No one will see the impossible glory of drinking there.

180
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,040
 Imagine if they filmed cocktail in Utah, and they had Tom Cruise doing all these dances,

181
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,520
 but you can't see it because there's a frosty screen in front of them.

182
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,480
 Do you think every time you order a Hendricks, they actually just chuck a Gordon's in?

183
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,080
 Because you're not going to know, are you? No. Yeah, I bet they never say,

184
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
 "It's Pepsi, okay." But you are to go.

185
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:10,800
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

186
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,760
 My fact this week is that dead fish can swim upstream.

187
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:23,760
 Absolutely insane. And this, I have to say thank you to someone called Robert Teeling,

188
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,880
 who sent me a link to this ages ago, and I came across it again. And basically,

189
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,320
 this was sort of discovered by mistake a few years ago when scientists at MIT and Harvard

190
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,160
 were looking at how trout cope when they're swimming upstream but behind an obstacle.

191
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,520
 So imagine if you're in the water and you've got a rounded obstacle in front of you,

192
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,760
 that deflects some of the current. So it goes around the sides of you. So it's a bit easier

193
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,560
 like a slipstream kind of thing. A bit like a slipstream. Yeah, exactly. And so they were

194
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,400
 looking at like putting live trout in the water and seeing how that worked. And then

195
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,400
 according to this article, they unintentionally, that's those quote marks again,

196
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,400
 they unintentionally put a dead trout in the water behind this rounded objects.

197
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,560
 And they were completely amazed to see it swam upstream. So it swam towards this obstacle,

198
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,680
 but properly sort of like swimming, like you would see a fish swim. And then eventually,

199
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,640
 it would get really, really close. And then you're in sort of a suction region,

200
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,560
 which really is like a slipstream, where it got sucked into the obstacle,

201
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,000
 bounced back and landed back where it started and swam towards it again.

202
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,920
 Yeah. And just kept doing this.

203
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,280
 There's a video online, you can see of it, right? It's pretty amazing.

204
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,480
 It's basically like a zombie fish, really.

205
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,800
 It's pretty mad that that's actually dead.

206
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,240
 Isn't it the case though that so if you were, say, by a river bed and there was

207
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,000
 fish swimming upstream, most likely it is alive because it's...

208
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,560
 I think that is true, yeah. I read that as well.

209
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,600
 Most fish that you see swimming are alive, yeah.

210
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,880
 It's important not to let this kind of misinformation get out without correcting...

211
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,960
 You don't want people going down to the river with their friends and family just going,

212
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,960
 "See that fish that's swimming dead? Do that one? Probably dead as well."

213
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,880
 No, something as alive fish turns out.

214
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,200
 Yeah. But also, the circumstances, like they were saying that when they put the dead trout in,

215
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,320
 it happened to land in the sweetest of sweet spots that if it was in any other conditions,

216
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,360
 that never would have happened. So again, it's sort of,

217
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,720
 you just wouldn't probably see that in nature ever, really.

218
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,240
 Well, I think you might do a bit. So the way it works is some very complicated fluid dynamics,

219
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,360
 but I think very simplified. When you've got kind of a rounded object in water and you've got a

220
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,360
 current going past it, as the current goes past it, it generates these little vortexes of water.

221
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,120
 And what seems to be happening is that this pattern of spiralling vortexes makes the fish

222
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,720
 spine move in a specific way that sort of propels it. So fish are very flexible spines.

223
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,840
 And these vortexes sort of give energy to the fish. The fish takes energy from the vortexes

224
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,400
 and then swims upstream. But yeah, you do have to be in a particular place and fish,

225
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,120
 yeah, there aren't loads of dead fish jumping upstream to source.

226
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
 But it does mean that a fish could swim with no effort, doesn't it?

227
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,960
 A fish could not use its muscles at all. And it would still,

228
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,760
 if it was in this right spot, get upstream, which is pretty cool.

229
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,680
 And so it's incredibly useful to fish this phenomenon because, yeah, they're incredibly

230
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,000
 sensitive. So they can tell the movement of water behind certain rocks. So they'll sort of

231
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,240
 sense the vortexes that are behind a rock and then they can swim towards that rock.

232
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,840
 And that'll mean that they have to expend much less energy because the rock just sort of sucks

233
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,880
 them towards it. It's very useful. One thing in looking into this fact that I never realised,

234
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,160
 and probably you three did know this, but so a fish swims, as we all know, I'm doing it with

235
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,800
 my hands here, but in the sort of fishy motion, right? It's sort of... You've explained it perfectly,

236
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,920
 yeah. So its spine allows for it from its head to its tail. It's a sort of...

237
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,720
 It's a wave. It's a landscape. Yeah, it's like landscape mode. But for mammals...

238
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,640
 It's a landscape mode. It's not a portrait mode.

239
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,120
 What?

240
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,000
 Sea horses are in portrait mode. Sea horses are portraits, especially in landscape.

241
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,120
 We're finding it very hard to describe this. The spines go along, whereas for mammals,

242
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,160
 so dolphins and so on, the spines go like our spines. So they move up and down,

243
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,440
 as opposed to left to right, as it were. So your spine on a dolphin goes along the very

244
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,520
 top of the dolphin, right? Whereas in the fish, it goes right through the middle of the fish.

245
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,400
 Is that what you're saying? Exactly. And that's the distinction between what is a fish and what is

246
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,320
 a mammal in the ocean. And I'd never realised that before, and that's why their fins are

247
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,040
 positioned differently as well on their body. Yeah, that's very cool. So fish wouldn't be able

248
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,120
 to do butterfly stroke, for instance, would they? Is butterfly the fastest or is it the slowest?

249
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,560
 I can't remember. It's got to be the slowest. It's not the breaststroke.

250
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:04,240
 I think it's in between. It's neither. It is fast. But it's not as fast as front crawl,

251
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,320
 for instance. Okay. I was reading about Michael Phelps' top speed, is why there is method here.

252
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,760
 You sort of said an incorrect fact that wouldn't have even been that interesting if it were correct.

253
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,120
 It's going to bring him onto this very interesting fact that he's about saying about Michael Phelps.

254
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,440
 Front-loading pressure onto my bad facts before I said that. Thank you.

255
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
 Sorry, please. Go on.

256
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,280
 It was just, I was just kind of amazed at how crap at swimming we are relative to fish,

257
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:39,040
 because the fastest fish swim at about 70 miles an hour. The fastest submarines don't even do

258
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,880
 that much, and some of them are nuclear power. They go at about 50 miles an hour, absolute top speed.

259
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,720
 Wow. Michael Phelps, maybe the greatest swimmer of all time, can do about 4.7 miles an hour,

260
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,040
 and he can do that for 100 meters, and then he has to stop.

261
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,280
 Andy, you're saying top speed of a fish was what, through that?

262
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,720
 I said 70 miles an hour.

263
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,880
 70 miles an hour, and that's, yeah, so the very fastest ones, obviously.

264
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,120
 Yeah, exactly. There's a few amazing fast ones, so swordfish and sailfish and so on.

265
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,440
 I was looking at a list of the fastest fish. My favorite one, just for its name,

266
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,480
 because of its speed, and I don't know if the name is tied in with the speed, but it's called the Wahoo.

267
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:26,000
 It has to be right. It has to be that it's just like, it's just having a great time.

268
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,760
 And is it particularly fast?

269
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,760
 Yeah, yeah. It goes just under a few miles an hour under the fastest speed of fish.

270
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
 Have you ever seen a fish treadmill?

271
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,720
 Oh, God. Almost every week, whenever an animal were discussing, they seem to go on a treadmill,

272
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,360
 don't they? I'm starting to feel a little bit self-conscious that I don't go on treadmills,

273
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,760
 because every other animal that the animal kingdom seems to.

274
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,680
 I think whenever we discuss an animal on this podcast, we shouldn't mention if it's been

275
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,160
 on a treadmill, but we should always mention if it hasn't. That's the interesting fact at this point.

276
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,280
 Ants have never been on treadmills.

277
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
 That's a good point.

278
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,760
 Go on. What are they doing on treadmills?

279
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,040
 Well, obviously, it's not a rubber treadmill, as we would understand it,

280
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,760
 but it's for scientists to experiment on how fish propel themselves, so they have to get a,

281
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,040
 you know, a tank with a current flowing in one direction.

282
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:21,440
 And they then put plastic particles in the water, and they record where they go as the fish swims,

283
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,920
 so you can kind of see how the fish is thrusting, so you can see the directions

284
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,440
 that all the water is moving as well.

285
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,800
 So it's like one of those things in a water park where you sit on a rubber ring,

286
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,080
 and it just takes you slowly around the water park, like that kind of thing,

287
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,760
 like a lazy river.

288
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,440
 Yes, but except in this version of the water park, you are having to resist the flow of the current

289
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,640
 to keep yourself in the same place for hours on end.

290
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
 Okay, but that's when you're on those things.

291
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,160
 If you don't have a rubber ring, the best thing is to try and beat the currents,

292
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,600
 isn't it? You're really trying to swim as fast as you can against the current,

293
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,400
 and then normal people on the rubber rings are going, "What the fuck are you doing?

294
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,240
 This is a rubber ring thing."

295
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,440
 They're like, "No, that's fun."

296
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,200
 Aren't you being clocked by people in rubber rings coming past you and banging into you as you go?

297
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,400
 Yeah, that's the problem, actually.

298
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,960
 This is why you're not allowed to go to sliding splash anymore, James.

299
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,600
 That's the reason.

300
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,400
 So many reasons.

301
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,800
 And so they've just found a load of new fish that can actually walk on land.

302
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,600
 I think we've always known there were one or two of these.

303
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,800
 They've just looked at a bunch of fish and looked at the way their pelvic bones are,

304
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,320
 and they've worked out that there's at least 11 species of fish that definitely can walk on land.

305
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,880
 So cool.

306
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,360
 They're not good at walking though, are they?

307
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,320
 They're not as good as us.

308
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,480
 Like when you see a seal on the sand, sort of flapping its fins around.

309
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,600
 Well, I think that's the thing, I think why Andy was a little bit unfair about Michael Phelps,

310
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,160
 because it's not like fish are able to run as quickly as us.

311
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,960
 So why are we expected to be able to swim as fast as them?

312
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,200
 There should be a competition which is to work out the species on earth,

313
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,960
 which is least crap at everything.

314
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,120
 The best all-rounder.

315
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,760
 The best all-rounder, exactly.

316
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,120
 It must be a kind of bird, right, because nothing else can fly.

317
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,600
 So you're not actually a flying fish.

318
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,560
 A flying fish.

319
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,720
 Oh, come on, it's not flying, it's just sort of jumping quite high.

320
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,480
 Are they quite good?

321
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:23,520
 They put flying fish in a what they call the wind tunnel quite recently, some scientists.

322
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,560
 It was a dead one, but they filled it with stuff to make it like as sturdy as an alive one.

323
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,600
 And they found out that the way that it collides is actually almost as good as some of the best

324
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,040
 gliders in the avian kingdom.

325
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,520
 There we go.

326
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,560
 That's a strong contender.

327
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
 They can fly, they can swim when they're dead.

328
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,480
 This is a very strong contender.

329
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,320
 There must be a bird which can swim really pretty well.

330
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,280
 I was thinking ducks.

331
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,000
 I mean, they're pretty shit at everything, aren't they?

332
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,160
 They're shit at walking, they're shit at swimming, and they're not great at flying.

333
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,560
 But they can do all of them.

334
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,840
 Yeah, I think actually the duck is a very strong contender for this incredibly boring.

335
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,960
 Well, it's felt, you know, that's probably where the sprinting actually.

336
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,120
 I don't know, Phelps is going to be the human rep for the thing.

337
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,080
 I'm just sort of felling him in.

338
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,720
 Because if you think about it, the triathlon, which is swimming, running, and cycling,

339
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,880
 the cycling bit is a bit of a fake.

340
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,080
 I mean, it's a fake spot, isn't it?

341
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,200
 We invented the bicycle.

342
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,400
 It's not natural.

343
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,640
 It should be swimming, running, and flying the triathlon.

344
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:34,400
 Although it would be fun to put a trout on a bicycle and see how it fared in a triathlon.

345
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,800
 The British government has its own fish farm, which I didn't know.

346
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,760
 And it breeds tons and tons of fish every year, just to fill up ponds around the place.

347
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,400
 It's really cool.

348
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,240
 Why do they fill up?

349
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,400
 Well, there are all these sort of bodies of water, which, you know, I don't know.

350
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,920
 Is it for fishers?

351
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,240
 It's partly for fishermen, but it's also partly, I think, for general health,

352
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,800
 and to keep species in good nick.

353
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,080
 But it's called the National Corse Fish Farm.

354
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,040
 And last year, they produced 12.3 tons of fish to put in rivers and ponds.

355
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,680
 They released 7.6 million fish.

356
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,760
 And they're just sending bags around the country of fish and buckets of fish.

357
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,880
 And then you get to release hundreds and hundreds of them into a river.

358
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,000
 It looks really fun.

359
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,880
 And they do fish rescue as well.

360
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,800
 Because sometimes the hot weather will cause rivers to flow very low,

361
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 or oxygen levels will drop.

362
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,040
 And this can be fatal to fish, which needs certain levels of oxygen in the water.

363
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,200
 So they have to go, and they either relocate the fish,

364
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,320
 or they pump oxygen into the water in these places.

365
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,120
 Really?

366
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,520
 I know.

367
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,200
 I want to find out more about these people,

368
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,920
 because this sounds like a really cool government body to fish rescue.

369
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,840
 The government gets a lot of stick these days,

370
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,840
 but no one's saying about how they're pumping oxygen into water.

371
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,600
 Right. No one talks about the National Corse Fish Farm,

372
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,120
 and I think it's a damn shame.

373
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,280
 Is that how fish get at lakes?

374
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,400
 Because I've always wondered.

375
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,760
 Because, I mean, how do they get there?

376
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,600
 You know, you see a lake, and it's a relatively new one.

377
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,200
 It's only been around for a few hundred years.

378
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,160
 It's full of fish.

379
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,960
 What the fuck's it done?

380
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,520
 I mean, it hasn't walked, because we've discussed that they are quite bad at walking,

381
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,720
 even if they can do it a bit.

382
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,240
 Mental.

383
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,160
 You get a tarn up in the lake district.

384
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,640
 I guess.

385
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,840
 But lakes which don't have a, you know,

386
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,080
 lakes which don't have any waterways moving into them.

387
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,320
 Yeah.

388
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,680
 Maybe it's the National Corse Fish Rearing Unit.

389
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,480
 That's what it is.

390
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,600
 Could be God.

391
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,480
 Although, you know, like, what is God if it's not really, in some ways,

392
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,720
 the Fish God is the National Corse River lake fish thing.

393
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,720
 Well, we've really, we've built up this government body.

394
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,880
 Not only is it cool, but it's also God-like.

395
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,160
 Salmon and trout, very good at swimming upstream,

396
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,840
 kind of as discussed, but they have to be, right?

397
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,360
 This is why this is so useful,

398
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,440
 this fact that they can even do it when they're dead,

399
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,680
 because they swim all the way back upstream to spawn in their place of birth,

400
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,280
 and they actually do that by smelling.

401
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,960
 So they have stored in their brain the smell of their home.

402
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,680
 So where they're born, they swim all the way down the street,

403
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,640
 and they retain it.

404
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,720
 And then when they get to breeding stage,

405
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,080
 something is triggered in their brain,

406
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,560
 which makes them desperately want to return to that smell.

407
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,200
 Oh my God.

408
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,320
 So does that mean it's like as if you could smell where you were conceived,

409
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,440
 and you go back to the place where you were conceived?

410
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,320
 Is that what that means?

411
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,040
 Yeah.

412
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,600
 And one day you'll start lusting after that, James,

413
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,160
 crawling your way back to the hospital in Bolton, or...

414
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,160
 What was James conceived in a hospital?

415
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,360
 Yeah, that was it.

416
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,080
 Yeah, it was inappropriate that they were doing that there.

417
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,120
 Sorry.

418
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,800
 They do it by, they sort of, if they go too far upstream,

419
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,920
 they lose the smell, and they have to go back downstream,

420
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,360
 pick up the smell again, and then try and...

421
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,080
 It's like that game, sort of warmer, warmer, colder, colder, you know,

422
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,480
 and then eventually the smell is strong enough

423
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,680
 that you find exactly the tributary off the main river.

424
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,800
 But they also need, this is one of the big arguments

425
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,480
 against reintroduction of beavers, you know,

426
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,120
 that's the latest great controversy in this country,

427
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,760
 and beavers obviously make dams.

428
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,680
 That's the main one, actually, at the moment.

429
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,160
 That's the main one.

430
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,520
 I would say beavers first, Covid second, Brexit third.

431
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,320
 Yeah.

432
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,240
 How much oxygen's apart in the water, far?

433
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,360
 Got to bump that up.

434
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,760
 So beavers make dams,

435
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
 and so then salmon have to jump over those dams,

436
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,840
 and I didn't realise there's an exact equation

437
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,880
 for how deep the plunge pool in front of a dam has to be

438
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,920
 for a salmon to make it over the height of it.

439
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,480
 So you need sort of a run-up, just like you do with anything.

440
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,080
 They need a run-up from a great depth

441
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,000
 to propel themselves out of the water and over it,

442
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,200
 and it needs to be exactly 1.25 or more,

443
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,000
 1.25 times the height of the dam.

444
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
 That's how deep it has to be.

445
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,040
 And yeah, at the moment,

446
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,800
 they're sort of thinking of reintroducing beavers

447
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,760
 in chalk streams where the plunge pools won't be that deep,

448
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,880
 and we'll just have lots of sort of dead salmon, I suppose.

449
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,080
 Caught in the dams, yeah, yeah.

450
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,880
 Caught in the dam.

451
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,120
 How will we know that they're dead because they're still swimming?

452
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
 That's no way to tell.

453
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,480
 I think salmon's might be as good at flying as ducks are at swimming.

454
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,080
 Well, what's that sport at the Olympics,

455
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,960
 where you have to jump over the bars as you go down the 100 metres?

456
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,920
 The hurdles.

457
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,400
 Hurdles.

458
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,160
 If they've got this dam jumping all sorted.

459
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,480
 Yeah, really good at hurdles in water.

460
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,880
 Are they going along a dry track, then,

461
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,720
 or are they in water with hurdles?

462
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,440
 In the steeple chase, they have one water jump,

463
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,960
 which they would absolutely nail,

464
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,520
 all of the other ones they would really struggle.

465
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,960
 My team's going to suck at this a little bit.

466
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,960
 He's entered the salmon into the hurdles?

467
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,760
 Dan's team of the Hannibal Kingdom walking round,

468
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,320
 after all of the different countries of gone past.

469
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,720
 Dan's there with the Hannibal Kingdom flag,

470
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,200
 with a trout mopping along behind him.

471
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,880
 Well, at least they can train on all those treadmills before they get there.

472
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,440
 That's true.

473
00:32:51,440 --> 00:33:00,560
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

474
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,160
 OK, my fact this week is that when the Berlin Wall fell,

475
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,840
 one of the results was an 18 million car traffic jam.

476
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,160
 That's crazy.

477
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,240
 18 million? Oh, my days.

478
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,000
 That is a lot.

479
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,440
 How many cars were there in Germany?

480
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,680
 Well, did everyone in Germany get in their cars and say,

481
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,800
 we've got to go and see this no longer existing wall?

482
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,680
 Everyone in East Germany pretty much did do that.

483
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:31,200
 So I read an interview with some people who were in East Germany at the time,

484
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,640
 and they said that like everyone else, as soon as the wall fell,

485
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,240
 they got in their car and they decided that they were going to go to Berlin.

486
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,800
 They said that the car radio traffic police told them,

487
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,240
 whatever you are planning, do not try to drive to Berlin in the border.

488
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,280
 There are a million cars on the road, you will never make it.

489
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,480
 People did sort of, they just wanted to go and check it out, didn't they?

490
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,880
 So it wasn't just people in East Berlin just desperate to get to West Berlin.

491
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,840
 Or vice versa, people were desperate to go with one exception,

492
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,080
 no, with lots of exceptions, but one famous exception.

493
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,720
 So Angela Merkel was having a sauna when the wall came down.

494
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,840
 Really?

495
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,720
 Yeah, she said, she knew it was going to happen.

496
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,440
 She said, the atmosphere had been very tense for days.

497
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,720
 I thought something was going to happen.

498
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,040
 I heard the announcement, the borders were open,

499
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,280
 you know, wall was coming down, but it was Thursday,

500
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,000
 and Thursday's my sauna day, so that's where I went.

501
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,440
 That is iron commitment to the sauna, that's incredible.

502
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,440
 Wow, Dan, don't you own a bit of the Berlin wall?

503
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,880
 I do, yeah, I think.

504
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,000
 I definitely have a bit of a Berlin wall.

505
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,680
 I can't confirm it.

506
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,520
 You own a small piece of concrete, yeah.

507
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,280
 Yeah, yeah, James and I, when we were touring fish in Berlin,

508
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,480
 we went to see the wall.

509
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,040
 So it's really interesting what is and isn't a bit of the wall,

510
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,760
 because it turns out there's one man who's basically cornered the market.

511
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,960
 Really?

512
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,360
 He, yeah, he's called Volker Pavlovsky.

513
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,600
 I think he was East German, and when the wall came down,

514
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,600
 he collected about 300 metres of it.

515
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,160
 Well, mine's definitely fake then, Andy, because a woman sold me mine.

516
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,800
 OK, he doesn't sell every end of his shoe to Pebble,

517
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,840
 but he, basically, you can tell.

518
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,840
 So if it's fake, you can crumble it with your fingers,

519
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,960
 because of the particular concrete they used, I think.

520
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,760
 But he does, he has admitted Pavlovsky,

521
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,720
 he spray paints the bits he sells, which are authentic,

522
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,080
 and he has sold three tonnes of them.

523
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,680
 And he says it matches the, he wants it to match the graffiti

524
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,960
 that was on the western side of the wall.

525
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,400
 And he says packaging is everything Pavlovsky.

526
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,920
 So he's patented his own method of attaching the Berlin wall

527
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,320
 a bit of it to a plastic globe and putting it in a postcard.

528
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,840
 So, Dan, did you get that, was it?

529
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,840
 It's on a plastic hold, and mine is graffitied to sort of multiple colours.

530
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,000
 So it sounds like you've got a sort of original bit of slightly retouched,

531
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,120
 but basically, yeah.

532
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,160
 Dan's actually says I love one direction in the graffiti.

533
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,960
 When the Berlin wall fell, there was a lot of problems,

534
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,560
 like for the people in East Germany,

535
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,120
 because everyone kind of thinks of it as, OK,

536
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,920
 they were living in some, you know, terrible place,

537
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,120
 and it was opened up,

538
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,000
 and then suddenly they got all the advantages of the West,

539
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,520
 which kind of was true.

540
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,160
 But the problem is they weren't used to that.

541
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,720
 And so all of their culture was suddenly taken over

542
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,600
 by this kind of European, Western European culture.

543
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,800
 And a lot of the East Germans felt really overwhelmed,

544
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,000
 like massively overwhelmed.

545
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,440
 So they didn't know how to pronounce the food in McDonald's.

546
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,840
 They didn't know how supermarket trolleys worked.

547
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,320
 They felt like this was their country,

548
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,160
 but they didn't know how to live in it.

549
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
 I mean, no one knows how supermarket trolleys work.

550
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,480
 Just spin round and round on the spot and then you crush it into someone.

551
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
 It's physics can't explain it.

552
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,680
 No one told them that you weren't supposed to know how they work, right?

553
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,520
 Oh, no, so sad.

554
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,720
 I know. And so what happened was they kind of,

555
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,440
 they, the people in West Germany thought

556
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
 the East Germans were quite ungrateful

557
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,120
 because they were getting a lot of money

558
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,040
 and a lot of aid from the West,

559
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,560
 but they were kind of not really loving it very much.

560
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,600
 And so the West Germans called the East Germans

561
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,000
 Yamarossis, meaning moaning Easterners.

562
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,880
 So they just were like, "Oh, these guys are moaning."

563
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,440
 And the East Germans called the West Germans

564
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,000
 Bessavises, meaning know-it-all Westerners.

565
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,840
 And so there was like,

566
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,800
 basically it took a lot of time for it all to become homogenized

567
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,120
 so that everyone was kind of knew what was going on.

568
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,280
 I found that really interesting, really.

569
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,240
 It is really interesting.

570
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,320
 But yeah, traffic jams. They're fun, aren't they?

571
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,800
 Not really.

572
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,760
 There's one in Indonesia that's quite famous.

573
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,720
 It's kind of not so bad now because they fixed the road.

574
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,360
 But it was on one of the main motorways

575
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,080
 and it was the exit for the city of Brebus.

576
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,240
 And so locals called it the Brexit.

577
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,280
 And apparently this is where they had the worst traffic

578
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,760
 in the whole of Indonesia over the last few years.

579
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,200
 Wait, was it called the Brexit before we had a Brexit?

580
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,880
 I think it was named after that.

581
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,040
 I think they saw that the English Brexit

582
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,680
 and thought, "Oh, we can name our massive traffic jam after that."

583
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,640
 Our catastrophic piler.

584
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,520
 When no one knows where they're going or what they're doing.

585
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,800
 "Oh, great. So nice to know we're still influencing global culture."

586
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,160
 There was a traffic jam in the Dartford Tunnel in 2006

587
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,760
 where a lorry driver hit a ventilation fan

588
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,400
 because he wasn't in the right part of the lane.

589
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,640
 And that is known by motoring organizations as the Pratt.

590
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,240
 They always... What do you mean?

591
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,680
 It was like a really... The move.

592
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,240
 No, it's like a really famous old traffic jam.

593
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,120
 And whenever you're talking,

594
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,320
 whenever you're reminiscing about the olden days and the traffic jams,

595
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,120
 and one of the worst ones that they ever had in London was this one.

596
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,480
 And it's known as the Pratt.

597
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,760
 Why didn't they call it the shit?

598
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,440
 Because that would have been the shit hitting the fan.

599
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,120
 Feels so right.

600
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,640
 They needed you on branding.

601
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,360
 It's all about branding.

602
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,720
 I think my favorite traffic jam that I've read of,

603
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,320
 and it feels like this is...

604
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,240
 It feels potentially apocryphal,

605
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,480
 but in August of 1991,

606
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,760
 there was a two-mile traffic jam at the entrance of the Dartford Tunnel.

607
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,600
 And it was caused because drivers weren't unable to go on due to laughter.

608
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,920
 And what had happened was people were listening to the cricket that day.

609
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,080
 People had heard Andy's joke about the shit

610
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,680
 hitting the fan in the Dartford Tunnel.

611
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,080
 So August 1991, there was a cricket match on,

612
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,080
 and Ian Botham had leapt over the wickets,

613
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,360
 and he caught the bales and they went off and he was out.

614
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,640
 And it led to Jonathan Agnew, Agra's,

615
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,000
 saying what has become one of the great cricket commentary moments

616
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,760
 of he couldn't get his leg over.

617
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,920
 He didn't quite get his leg over was the line.

618
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,480
 And to begin with, there's no laughter,

619
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,320
 but the two of the commentators just start pissing themselves really hard.

620
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,440
 I listened to it the other day,

621
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,880
 and you do laugh a lot when you listen to it as well.

622
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,720
 So supposedly around the country,

623
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,760
 people were finding it so funny that they had to pull over in their cars,

624
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,480
 they had to stop.

625
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,520
 And at the Dartford Tunnel,

626
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,360
 this guy was unable to pay the toll

627
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,120
 because he just couldn't stop laughing at this thing,

628
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,760
 and it ended up with a two-mile-long traffic jam.

629
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,040
 Is that why they've now taken away the toll barriers in the Dartford Tunnel

630
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,640
 and replaced them with nothing,

631
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
 so you don't know there's any Dart Charge

632
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,640
 until you're hit with a fine two weeks later?

633
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,280
 Um, wow.

634
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,720
 I think the podcast can be a bit personal.

635
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,240
 Okay, sorry, I brought my personal line.

636
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,840
 Allow us to do a legal history episode presented.

637
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,280
 Just a funny cricket anecdote suddenly turned into a politicalâ€¦

638
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,480
 Look, it's a fucking outreach.

639
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,200
 And I mean, there are lots of signs everywhere telling you how to pay it,

640
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,680
 but yeah.

641
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,200
 Okay, we are going to have this debate later.

642
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,920
 There are not.

643
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,320
 Anyway, good story about cricket, Dan,

644
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,840
 because I've been waiting to get this complaint

645
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,080
 about the Dartford Tunnel in for like two years,

646
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,160
 and finally had the chance.

647
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,840
 For international listeners, by the way,

648
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,360
 the Lego for thing is a sexual innuendo in Britain.

649
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,320
 And cricket is a game between two teams of 11 players.

650
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,200
 Yeah, and Dartford is a place where Anna shall not be visiting again.

651
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,280
 Unless they sort themselves out.

652
00:40:51,280 --> 00:41:00,000
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

653
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,200
 and that is my fact.

654
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,480
 My fact this week is that there's a stone marker in Wisconsin

655
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,800
 that commemorates the spot where Elvis Presley once successfully stopped a fight

656
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,760
 by jumping out of his limo, pulling some karate moves,

657
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
 and threatening to kick everyone's ass.

658
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,920
 So it's this beautiful little marker.

659
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,120
 It's on the corner of Highway 51 in East Washington Avenue,

660
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,680
 and this happened on June the 24th, 1977, at about 1 a.m.

661
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,080
 He was riding in one of the two limousines

662
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,360
 that he and his posse travel in, and they saw these guys just fighting on the outside.

663
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:40,720
 And Elvis is a, I believe he was 8th Dan Black Belt karate student who,

664
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,520
 so he knew his moves, he loved karate,

665
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,040
 and he thought, I want to stop this fight.

666
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,160
 But he wanted to stop it by fighting them himself.

667
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,760
 So he jumped out, and he engaged all the people in the fight

668
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,600
 with a sentence saying, "I'll take you on,"

669
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,840
 and then showed some karate moves.

670
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,000
 They all recognized that it was him, and thought,

671
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,440
 "Oh my God, it's such a chance to meet Elvis."

672
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,920
 So they stopped fighting, and came over and said, "Hi."

673
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,120
 And this was, you know, 52 days later, he died, Elvis, unfortunately.

674
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,800
 -Not connected to this, though. -This is one of the last--

675
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,240
 -No. -Not connected to this, no.

676
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,720
 He wasn't, yeah, he wasn't chased down 52 days later.

677
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,680
 He didn't die after 52 days of constant fighting.

678
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,000
 So it was really a toss-up, isn't it,

679
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,760
 between whether the fight was stopped by him pulling his awesome karate moves,

680
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,520
 or the fact that he was Elvis Presley.

681
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,760
 It's definitely that he was Elvis, it's definitely that he was Elvis.

682
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,680
 But yeah, I mean, he was mad into karate.

683
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,520
 A lot of people think that that side of Elvis was token, kind of,

684
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,800
 "Oh, let's give him Black Belt,"

685
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,760
 because he's shown up for one lesson, sort of honorary stuff.

686
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,120
 He was really dedicated to it.

687
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,920
 He started it when he was stationed in the war in Germany.

688
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,760
 And that was 1958.

689
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,440
 And it was his obsession all the way through to his death.

690
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,720
 It got to the point where he was actually training kids

691
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,680
 to learn karate as well.

692
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,160
 So he became a karate instructor himself.

693
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,280
 Look, all you have to do, kids, is become Elvis Presley,

694
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,560
 and you will win any fight.

695
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,200
 So this stone marker, it was put up on the 30-year anniversary

696
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,560
 of this historic event.

697
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,440
 And when they put it up, the local TV station re-enacted the fight

698
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,000
 as part of the ceremony, which sounds pretty cool.

699
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,080
 And it was outside a gas station,

700
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,840
 which they hoped using this marker might bring some custom,

701
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,200
 but it closed and demolished about two years later.

702
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,600
 So it didn't really work.

703
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,400
 Yeah, not a perfect ending.

704
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,080
 He loved defending himself with guns, though,

705
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,400
 we should say, as well as liking karate.

706
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,240
 Elvis was also a gun maniac.

707
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,200
 He would carry up to three guns on him at all times.

708
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,480
 So there were one or two shows where a handgun

709
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,840
 would just fall out of his boot on stage.

710
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,960
 And I think, because he was very worried about his safety,

711
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,400
 because a lot of guns in America,

712
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,560
 and he would have been a big target.

713
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,400
 So I think he carried the gun on stage for that reason.

714
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,640
 But obviously, the idea that he would ever

715
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,200
 get the chance to use it successfully during a show

716
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,680
 or to return fire if he was being shot at

717
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,000
 would have been a very foolish thing to do.

718
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,720
 Although, is that why he sung "Don't Step on My Blue Suede Shoes"

719
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,280
 because that's a genuine warning, presumably.

720
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,840
 I've got a life gun in there.

721
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,480
 He turned up at the White House once,

722
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,080
 wanting to meet Richard Nixon, didn't he?

723
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,600
 And in fact, there's a famous photo of their meeting,

724
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,680
 because it was obviously a huge encounter.

725
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,520
 I think the photo was something like the most requested

726
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,840
 from whichever institution is storing it.

727
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,000
 It's something like the National Library of Congress,

728
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,160
 which is Elvis and Nixon standing next to each other.

729
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,520
 It's the most requested they've ever had in their archives.

730
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,640
 But he wanted a drug enforcement badge

731
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,040
 from the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.

732
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,160
 According to his daughter,

733
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,480
 it's because he believed that if he had the badge,

734
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,840
 he could turn up in any country,

735
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,720
 both wearing guns and carrying drugs, and that would be fine.

736
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,320
 He turned up with a gun to give Richard Nixon,

737
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,480
 and he had to be kind of gently told,

738
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,360
 "We don't really let people just come along and say,

739
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,040
 "Even if they're Elvis, even if they're Elvis,

740
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,280
 "we don't let people with guns just walk up to the president

741
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,040
 "and say, 'I've got this for you.'"

742
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,800
 He, when he was in that fight,

743
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,600
 he was wearing a DEA kind of tracksuit.

744
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,360
 That's how much he loved the Drug Enforcement Agency.

745
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,680
 He cosplayed them all the time.

746
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,320
 And so, yeah.

747
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,040
 You're kidding.

748
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,240
 Yeah, no, honestly, yeah.

749
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,480
 It's honestly like, I can't think of an equivalent.

750
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,280
 It's like Stormzy wanting to work for the Home Office.

751
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,960
 Just wearing like a suit and a briefcase.

752
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,200
 Some stuff on plaques.

753
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:37,760
 Oh, yeah.

754
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,760
 Yeah, me and stuff and markers.

755
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,720
 The blue plaque.

756
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,640
 So, we have blue plaques all over London,

757
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,240
 and you get them all over the world, I think.

758
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,520
 They were conceived in 1863 by a guy called William Ewert.

759
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,520
 And he himself has a blue plaque, which is quite nice.

760
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,720
 It's on Hanson Library, and it says,

761
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,240
 "John Beard Singer and William Ewert's promoter of public..."

762
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,520
 Sorry, "John Beard Singer and William Ewert's promoter

763
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,040
 of public libraries lived here."

764
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,920
 So, he has to share it with another guy

765
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,040
 who lived in the place at the same time.

766
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,680
 I read about that.

767
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,720
 I thought that was rubbish for Paul William Ewert.

768
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,960
 They should say, "William Ewert invented this thing."

769
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,520
 Yeah.

770
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,000
 Or whatever.

771
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,480
 Yeah.

772
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,440
 Put it slightly better than that.

773
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,400
 Maybe he'll get a second one.

774
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,720
 They want to put it in the spot where he had the idea

775
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,480
 for the blue plaques, as they often do.

776
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,000
 It was here that they had the idea.

777
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,480
 Yeah, like, it's here where penicillin was first,

778
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,680
 you know, that kind of stuff.

779
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,800
 Well, they've taken a long...

780
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,720
 If that's their plan, it has taken them a while.

781
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,800
 They still haven't quite got around to it.

782
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,800
 Have you heard of Sidney Lewis?

783
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,360
 He's got a blue plaque, and he is not very well known.

784
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,880
 But I also read through just this big long list of people with plaques.

785
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,960
 Sidney Lewis was the youngest British soldier

786
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,160
 in the First World War.

787
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,680
 Guess how old he was when he signed up?

788
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,800
 Forty.

789
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,640
 Twelve.

790
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,000
 He was twelve.

791
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,360
 He was four, Dan.

792
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,240
 He was three four-year-olds in a large trench car.

793
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,320
 They passed for twelve, which, happily,

794
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,840
 you could get into the war at twelve.

795
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,320
 Four years old.

796
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,600
 No, he signed up age twelve.

797
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,000
 He fought for six weeks at the Somme.

798
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,120
 Pretty serious stuff.

799
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,880
 He got sent home after his mum sent a copy

800
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,280
 of his birth certificate to the war office and said,

801
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,240
 "That is my twelve-year-old son fighting in the war.

802
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,000
 Please send him home."

803
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,520
 Pretty embarrassing for Sidney.

804
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,240
 But anyway, he then rejoined in 1918,

805
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,440
 while the war was still going on.

806
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,640
 As far as I can tell, he cannot have been older than fifteen

807
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,960
 the second time he signed up for the First World War.

808
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,920
 Yeah, but at this stage, he has experience as well, though, doesn't he?

809
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,480
 You know?

810
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,360
 Yeah, that's true.

811
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,560
 That's what he's doing.

812
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,200
 Imagine.

813
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,640
 Mind you, they all ripped into him.

814
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,160
 They were like, "Well, you're the guy whose mum came

815
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,440
 and picked him up in the trenches."

816
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:47,600
 Anyway, he then was in the Second World War in bomb disposal,

817
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,480
 and then he owned a pub.

818
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,760
 What a life.

819
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,520
 What age did he own the pub?

820
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,640
 Fifteen.

821
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:54,880
 Yeah.

822
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,680
 Wow.

823
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,200
 Are you guys familiar with the website Plaque to the Future?

824
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:01,520
 No.

825
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,480
 This isâ€¦ There's a woman in Philadelphia who's set it up,

826
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,320
 and the essence behind it is that to get a blue plaque,

827
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,360
 it's actually quite difficult.

828
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,880
 You have to jump through quite a lot of hoops

829
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,120
 to prove that it's necessary and you're famous enough.

830
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,480
 And so she has designed these waterproof blue stickers,

831
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,960
 which look almost exactly like blue plaques.

832
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,920
 But if you go to the website Plaque to the Future,

833
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,680
 you can just write your own memory and say where you want it put.

834
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,600
 And you'll appear as a blue plaque.

835
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,240
 And so in Philadelphia, there's, for instance,

836
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,680
 you've got a blue plaque on a telephone pole,

837
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,840
 and the inscription reads,

838
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,600
 "Derek B. was walking along Dickinson Street on July 2017

839
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,680
 when he saw a woman open her door,

840
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,400
 overhand throw a two-thirds eaten hot dog

841
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,760
 into this telephone pole, and close her door again."

842
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,280
 Derek has so many questions.

843
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,880
 That's great.

844
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,800
 That's really good.

845
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,040
 There's another one.

846
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,640
 I find this one really questionable.

847
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,200
 So this one is in a park,

848
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,400
 and the headline is, "X girlfriend spotted.

849
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,720
 PTM saw his ex-girlfriend here.

850
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,840
 He felt weird about it.

851
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,120
 She felt weird about it.

852
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,720
 He asked her about her jewellery business,

853
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,640
 and it was obvious he didn't really care.

854
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,080
 He now avoids this intersection."

855
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,520
 Now that's a slam because it's PT who's put the blue plaque there.

856
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,040
 Do you know that for sure?

857
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,440
 Yes, because it says he avoids this intersection.

858
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,000
 Did you know that she might hang around

859
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,880
 the intersection all the time?

860
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,320
 That's the only reason she knows

861
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,840
 that he avoids it these days.

862
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,080
 That's a good point.

863
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,840
 It might be written from her point of view,

864
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,560
 and she was saying,

865
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,040
 "He clearly didn't care about my jewellery business."

866
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,160
 Well, but then the headline is,

867
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,600
 "X girlfriend spotted."

868
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,080
 But you're right.

869
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,640
 Maybe she was writing sort of from his perspective, but...

870
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,960
 It could have been one really nosy dog walker

871
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,040
 who was kind of walking past both of them

872
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,560
 and heard this story happening.

873
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,600
 That's a really good point.

874
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,040
 That's a really good point, yeah.

875
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,720
 There's a cool one.

876
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,960
 In the '70s, a plaque was laid down

877
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,600
 in a rail station in Kassel in Germany.

878
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,920
 And it had on it on the 23rd of March, 1994,

879
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,600
 from 3 to 4 p.m., Dieter Meier will stand on this plaque.

880
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,560
 And this was set down by this artist,

881
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,800
 and he was a Swiss musician and artist.

882
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,200
 And so this was 1972.

883
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,520
 And all those years later, 22 years later,

884
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,280
 there he was standing on the plaque from 3 to 4 p.m.

885
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,360
 Just as part of this.

886
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,120
 Yeah, in stylistic installation.

887
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,720
 It was the artist who...

888
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,440
 Yeah, it was the guy who was the guy.

889
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,440
 It wasn't predicting someone else would turn up and stand on it.

890
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,320
 No, no, no.

891
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,840
 I mean, that would have been way cooler.

892
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,480
 But so did a load of people kind of turn up?

893
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,400
 Like, probably hundreds of thousands of people

894
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,960
 were there to see this momentous thing happening,

895
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,880
 or did one or two losers kind of...

896
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,920
 I can't believe I missed it.

897
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,680
 I know.

898
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,960
 You had to get tickets so fast.

899
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,320
 That would be a hard thing to just to remember to do,

900
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,240
 if I said I'll do something in 22 years.

901
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,440
 Like, he must have felt...

902
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,000
 He must have had to buy a diary for 22 years from now.

903
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,560
 I don't know how far in advance they print diaries.

904
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,080
 I think if you'd gone to the effort of printing a plaque,

905
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,920
 cementing it to the ground at a specific train station,

906
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,360
 it's probably going to stick in your head

907
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,040
 a bit more than just saying it out loud.

908
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,960
 Do you reckon, like, whenever he was...

909
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,040
 Someone said, "Oh, I've got a party coming up soon."

910
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,760
 And he's like, "Oh, can I just check it's not in 21 years,

911
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,360
 six months and three days?

912
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,760
 Because I have this thing I really can't do."

913
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,120
 And then, what if, like, that week he got given jury duty

914
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,280
 or something like that, that was too awkward, wasn't it?

915
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,080
 Yeah.

916
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:20,720
 What do you do?

917
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,400
 Can you get out of jury duty with that excuse?

918
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,000
 Because there are some loopholes, you know,

919
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,280
 if you're a doctor or a lawyer,

920
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,800
 but I don't know if it can be

921
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,640
 I've got a stand on my own plaque thing.

922
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,640
 I don't know if that passes.

923
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,800
 I mean, there are lots of...

924
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,040
 Like, if you're building up to that for 22 years,

925
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,000
 which I imagine he was,

926
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,920
 because he probably didn't have much else on,

927
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,240
 then, like, the couple of weeks before that

928
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,680
 is quite high stakes, isn't it?

929
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,360
 Yeah, that is high stakes, yeah.

930
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,880
 Like, he must have just stayed in the house

931
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,960
 for that whole time in case something happened.

932
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,320
 God, if you were his friend,

933
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,880
 wouldn't you sort of book your wedding or something

934
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,160
 for that day, or just really test him?

935
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:01,040
 Speaking of famous people who do martial arts

936
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,080
 and commemorations, they're on the first...

937
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,560
 The first sentence.

938
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,560
 The first ever statue of Bruce Lee

939
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,720
 was in Mostar in Bosnia,

940
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,160
 and he was chosen because he was the only person

941
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,360
 that all the country's Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks all liked.

942
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,760
 So they just couldn't decide on anyone else to putt,

943
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,720
 but they thought, Bruce Lee, we all like him.

944
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,560
 He can go in our place.

945
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,600
 And it was put up on November 26th, 2005,

946
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,000
 one day before the famous statue in Hong Kong went up,

947
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,880
 which I don't know.

948
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,600
 Really?

949
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,240
 Yeah, I don't know.

950
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,160
 They must have heard that this one in Hong Kong

951
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,480
 was happening on Bruce Lee's birthday

952
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,880
 and thought we'd better get in there one day earlier.

953
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,600
 And they said, "Oh, the one thing we all have in common

954
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,920
 "is Bruce Lee," and then they did that.

955
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,160
 But then both the Bosnians and the Croats

956
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,520
 complained about it because he was doing like a karate move,

957
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,760
 but he was doing it in the direction of the area

958
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,360
 where all those people lived,

959
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,120
 and they thought that it was an act of aggression

960
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,600
 by the Serbs that they were making Bruce Lee

961
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,120
 kind of fight in their direction.

962
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,000
 So they should put it on a rotating base.

963
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 That's a really good idea.

964
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,880
 That's a great idea.

965
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,720
 I might put that forward, actually.

966
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,960
 Was Bruce Lee alive to see that happen?

967
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,000
 No.

968
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,440
 No, no, he was dead.

969
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,640
 I don't know when he died.

970
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,480
 Yeah, it would have been his 65th birthday,

971
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,840
 but he died probably.

972
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,280
 He died in the 80s, I think.

973
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,760
 Oh, did he?

974
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,160
 Okay, okay.

975
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,960
 1973, he died, sorry.

976
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,520
 '73, so I was just out by about 30 years.

977
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,080
 Okay, cool.

978
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,840
 Richard Nixon has a plaque on the moon.

979
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,200
 Let's see.

980
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,080
 Does he?

981
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,840
 Yeah, in fact, it's also got Neil Armstrong

982
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,760
 Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.

983
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,480
 Yeah.

984
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,040
 Yeah, yeah.

985
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,560
 But also it has Nixon because it was the first moonbanding.

986
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,840
 So there's a plaque which says,

987
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,480
 "Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon."

988
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,560
 And Nixon's signature is on there as well.

989
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,760
 And it's such a cheat.

990
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,440
 Wait a minute, that's a trick, isn't it?

991
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,240
 I mean, it's bad enough.

992
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,280
 If you say here are some people on Earth went on the moon,

993
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,880
 one of them is Michael Collins.

994
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,240
 Well, first of all, it wasn't.

995
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,360
 He was just in the kind of space capsule.

996
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,520
 But Nixon never even left the Earth.

997
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,120
 Nixon never went to the moon.

998
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,160
 I know, it's unfair.

999
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,560
 And also, well, not only is it a cheat

1000
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,760
 because he didn't go to the moon,

1001
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,320
 but he had only been president for about six months.

1002
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,600
 I mean, it was complete.

1003
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,560
 You know, he wasn't really a major move.

1004
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,600
 What's the space program?

1005
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,000
 He was still the president of the United States.

1006
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,520
 How long do you have to serve

1007
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,040
 before he was eligible in your mind to be on the plaque?

1008
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,880
 That was all set up by Kennedy.

1009
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,680
 Kennedy, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1010
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,920
 The more I hear about this Richard Nixon stuff.

1011
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,520
 Yeah, it would be like if you sacked me from the podcast

1012
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,160
 and got Richard Nixon on to this set,

1013
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,080
 and then you won a major award.

1014
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,200
 I would feel pretty miffed

1015
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,920
 because I feel like I'd done more of the spade work than Nixon.

1016
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,240
 Yeah, you have.

1017
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,080
 Thank you.

1018
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,040
 Thank you, James.

1019
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,920
 And shame on you, Dan and Anna, for not affecting us.

1020
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,520
 I was trying to work out on what level that analogy function.

1021
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,080
 Although, actually, when we went to Washington,

1022
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,760
 we stayed in the Watergate Hotel,

1023
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,760
 which was made famous by Nixon.

1024
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,960
 And that actually added quite a lot to my experience of that.

1025
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,680
 So he did do quite a lot of podcasts, I kind of feel.

1026
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,880
 It's 50/50 between Richard and Andy, isn't it?

1027
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,840
 Yeah, OK, great.

1028
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,760
 I wonder what analogy Nixon would have come up with.

1029
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,640
 Probably a better one.

1030
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,520
 Can you imagine?

1031
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,600
 If only.

1032
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,800
 I've got a slightly weird one,

1033
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,560
 but it's one of those weird ones

1034
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,800
 where I don't know if it'll make it into the show.

1035
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,520
 I'll say it.

1036
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,800
 Stop me if you think it's...

1037
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,880
 There, I won't stop you, that would be rude.

1038
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,680
 So in 2002...

1039
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,280
 No, 2002, no way.

1040
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:39,600
 Stop.

1041
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,400
 Bruce Lee wasn't even alive then.

1042
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:49,760
 2002, James Earl Jones was invited to Lorde Hill, Florida

1043
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,760
 to be the keynote speaker for Martin Luther King Day.

1044
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,000
 And in order to commemorate it, they made a plaque that said,

1045
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,520
 "You know, James Earl Jones,

1046
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,920
 "thank you for keeping the dream alive."

1047
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,160
 Unfortunately, at the place where they were making the plaque,

1048
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:08,960
 they got it wrong.

1049
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,640
 And what the plaque ended up saying

1050
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,720
 was not, "James Earl Jones,

1051
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,160
 "thank you for keeping the dream alive,"

1052
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,360
 but it instead said, "James Earl Ray,

1053
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,320
 "the man who assassinated Martin Luther King."

1054
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,080
 So they managed to catch this

1055
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,360
 just before it was unveiled,

1056
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,800
 but the story went around.

1057
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,440
 And the company that designed the plaque

1058
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,040
 tried to come up with all these excuses.

1059
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,880
 They said that a lot of people working on it

1060
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,840
 didn't speak English.

1061
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,800
 So there must have been a miscommunication.

1062
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,640
 They also said that there was a plaque designed

1063
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,520
 just before that one that was made out to Ray Johnson,

1064
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,360
 and they think the Ray somehow made it onto the next template

1065
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,280
 when they were doing the James Earl Jones one.

1066
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,720
 But yeah, wow, what a mess up.

1067
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,640
 That's someone's typed into Google,

1068
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,280
 "Martin Luther King, James Earl,"

1069
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,640
 and they've seen Ray and they thought,

1070
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,600
 "It must be this one, lads."

1071
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,360
 Damn, you all told correct.

1072
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,280
 That's amazing.

1073
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,960
 Yeah.

1074
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,960
 Okay, that's it.

1075
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,000
 That is all of our facts.

1076
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,360

 Goodbye.

1097
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:52,000
 Just one last thing, one tiny last thing.

1098
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,640
 Quick update.

1099
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,360
 2017, scientists put an ant on a treadmill.

1100
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,080
 So sorry, Anna.

1101
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:08,800
 God damn it.
