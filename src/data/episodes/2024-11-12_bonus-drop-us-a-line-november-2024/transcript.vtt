00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [music]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Hi everybody!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Hi Andy, sorry I'm a bit distracted.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 I got a pumpkin here

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 and I just took the top of the pumpkin

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 and it had loads of strands of what I think might be

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 fungi or moulds.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Wow, what a strong distraction.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Let me show you.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Yeah, let's have a look, we need to evaluate.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Uh, oh!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 That's so cool!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Honestly, there's more hair on that pumpkin

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 than there is on my actual head at the moment.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 That's really foul.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 It does have a quiff, yes.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Is this going to be a spooky special, Andy,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 because it's the day before Halloween?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Oh my goodness, yeah I suppose it is actually.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Let's try and make it all a bit spooky.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Okay, hello!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Welcome, when is it going out though?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 It's going out closer to bonfire night, isn't it?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 So it should really be an anti-parliamentarian special.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 All of mine actually, all of mine

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 are subtly imbued with Protestant radical philosophy.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 You know that.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Welcome to Drop Us Aligned, this is our audience feedback show.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 It's not just like James complaining about a pumpkin

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 and Anna, you know, wanting to thrash the Catholics.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 We've got some cracking stuff in the inbox,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 because it's been a while, it's very pent up the inbox.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 There is a lot of stuff in here.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Oh, Dan's not here, I don't know where Dan is.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 No one does.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Sunning himself, probably.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Send out a Dan signal if you're hearing this.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 But let's start with an email from Johann Scott.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 "I'm Johann," he says.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 He didn't really need to say that, because I already knew.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 "A fan of no such thing as a fish,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 and the current president of the St Andrews Whole Digging Society."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 I was really happy to hear you mention us on your recent podcast

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 and wanted to express my gratitude.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Isn't that nice?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Did he not invite you to dig some holes with him?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Do you know he didn't, actually.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 We don't wait every fortnight, unfortunately,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 but we arrange hole digs depending on university deadlines,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 the weather and the tide.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 We've dug some pretty deep holes ourselves,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 although not quite as deep as the Padstow Hole you referred to.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 We dug one that looked like a trench in September.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 I think if it looks like a trench, it is a trench.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 That was perhaps around six feet deep and 12 feet long.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 That's a trench.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 They did dig some fake trenches on the beaches, didn't they,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 during World War I think so, in the UK,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 so that soldiers could get an idea of what the trenches would be like.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Oh, that's good.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Oh, what to practice?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 I think so.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Really?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Yes, I think you're right. I think they did.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 There was a mining university, which had a fake mine in it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Yes, in Birmingham.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Loads of underground tunnels.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 I was reading the reminiscences of a World War II German soldier,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 actually, who was, oh no, it was an Australian guy who said

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 they spent all of their military training holding brimsticks instead of guns

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 because the guns didn't arrive until the day that they had to leave,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 which I don't think counts as machine, as gun training.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 That's amazing.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 So they were playing Quidditch.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Yes, exactly.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 All at war, putting the gun between their legs.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 That's funny.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Johann, I think, I don't want to speak on Andy's behalf,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 but I think he would be keen to come up and dig some holes.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Yeah, I think I would actually.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 It might be a big barrier to entry.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 No, no, no, there's no barrier to entry,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 and that brings me on to our next email from Charlie Mone,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 who says, "Hi, I'm the founder of the St Andrews Hole Digging Society."

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 So Johann is the president, Charlie is the founder.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Don't listen to this Johann guy who's probably emailing you.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 He said, "It's really cool that you mentioned us."

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 He said he wanted to clear up a misconception,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 contrary to popular belief, it isn't exclusively a men's club.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 I can't remember. I don't think, do we say that?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 No, but it's so commonly accepted worldwide

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 that the St Andrews Hole Digging Society is mostly male,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 but I think it's good that we've cleared that up for the public.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Well, Charlie says, in fact, in fact, we found

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 the majority of our attendees are usually women,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 and the activity of hole digging has strongly resonated

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 with the trans and non-binary members of the St Andrews student community.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 So there you go, they're very welcoming, all welcomed.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 You just have to like digging big holes.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 That really is the only criteria.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Yeah, I think we did imply that it might be middle-aged men

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 going out, leaving their wives and digging some holes.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 So that might be on us.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 I know you're right. Charlie says, "It's wonderful you mentioned us,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 but I want to clarify, it's important for everyone to feel

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 like they would be welcome to come to our digging sessions."

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 Excellent.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 So you just have to be a sad act.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 That's all that's the only criteria of entry

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 of any demographic at all.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Yeah. Oh, here's a thanks but no thanks.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 We've got a few of these this week, actually.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 I'm going to scatter them through.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Charlie Wolfe, great name, says,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 "I was wondering if you guys, Brackets James and Deanna Dan,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 yes, obviously, will be willing to do a podcast

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 or mini show called Small Inventions, Big Impact,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 where you discuss smaller inventions that change the world

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 like the license plate or traffic lights.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 I thought with how often you talk about interesting inventions,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 you might find this idea interesting."

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Yeah, I think it's the kind of thing that does come up just,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 you know, ad hoc, as in we will talk about something

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 and then explain why it's such a big deal.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 So things like ferns, do you remember?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 We talked about the fern craze and how that impacted the world

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 and barbed wire, how that impacted the world.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 I mean, we should say, we didn't claim that someone

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 invented the fern in the 19th century.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 No, but the Wardian case.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 The Wardian case.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Yeah, that allowed them to be transported

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 and revolutionized, basically, plant growing around the world,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 because suddenly you could get a plant from one place

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 to several thousand miles away.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Yeah.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Yeah.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Well, that's a great idea.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Doesn't a small invention become a big invention

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 when it has a big impact?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 I'm not sure how you'd set out the criteria in that show,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 because it would be like, well, it's not size-wise, is it?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 No, you're absolutely right.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 And as soon as it has a big impact, that's a big invention.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Yeah, so for that reason, Dylan, thanks, but no thanks.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Can I also have a voice, a quick bugbear I have about this?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And I've always thought this when people say something

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 changes the world.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Again, everything changes the world, doesn't it?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 What a fusspot point to make.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 I'm sorry, but so for instance, we just said the Wardian cage,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 and we'd be claiming it changed the world.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 It's sort of changed plant growing on the edges.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 So I think it's going to be so hard to put up that barrier.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 I mean, if I nudge this mug a little bit forward,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 like I have just done there, I've changed the world.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 Yeah, but it's not as interesting as inventing the license plate

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 by a long way.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Anna, honestly, given the stick you've got coming up from the audience,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 I would be trying to placate them at this point

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 rather than aggravate them further.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 That's a great idea.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Here's one from Joshua Davidson.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Normal name, so it must be a pretty good email.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Hi, guys.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Aussie listener since 2016.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 We're getting a lot from Australia and New Zealand

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 because we are about to go to Auss and NZ.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And I think the listenership there are getting excited for our visit.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 We're literally going, you're going in like two days.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 There's real buzz in the inbox.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 It's really cool.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Aussie listener since 2016, recent clubfish member.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 I'm sure I'm not the only person to message him with this,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 but on this week's episode of Meet the Elves,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 so this is an entirely in-clubfish transaction we're doing here,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 and he mentioned the phrase getting off at Gateshead,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 and he mentioned that Gateshead was close to Newcastle, UK,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 moments after Anna had mentioned that Newcastle, New South Wales

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 is the biggest coal exporter in the world.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 I live in Newcastle, New South Wales,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 and thought you would like to know there is also a suburb

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 in Newcastle, New South Wales called Gateshead.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Brilliant.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 There you go.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 That's fantastic information.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 They're the same place.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Yeah.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Oh, and we had another listener who was from Newcastle in the USA,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 which also has loads of coal.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Really?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 If it's called Newcastle, it's got coal.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Yeah, basically.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Is it the fact that probably they found there was loads of coal there

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 and what does that remind us of?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Yes.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 The US one is that.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 It was called something else, and then they found all this coal,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 and they said, "Oh, let's call it Newcastle."

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Oh, well, the Australian one is also that.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 So there you go.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Yeah.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Oh, great.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Okay.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Well, Josh Brits in a PS.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 "I would love to petition to get the four of you on Taskmaster.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 "I think it would be hilarious and expose many more personal secrets

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 "of Andy's life."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 I don't know what he means about that.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Well, they ask us every season, don't they?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And we always say no.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 So integrity.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Beggars, yeah.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 "Who would you choose from amongst the QI team

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 "to be the fifth contestant?"

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 James, you watched Taskmaster religiously.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Yeah, well, I did the Taskmaster live experience,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 which I did win, of course,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 but I was playing mostly against my nieces who were all teenagers,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 but I ground them into the floor.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 I actually smashed them.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 The thing is about Taskmaster is it's like QI.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 You're not really supposed to win QI.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 You're supposed to be amusing and whimsical and stuff.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 So you really want someone who's really got that whimsy about them.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 "Who was on the last meet the elves? Was it Rawson?"

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Yeah.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 He'd be good.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Rawson would be good.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Let's get it.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 It sounded just like he was the last person you could remember.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Like, "Who was that guy last week from the elves?"

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Yeah, let's take him.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 No, Rawson would be good.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 They all be good.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 You don't get to be a QI researcher without some kind of sideways thinking.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 That's true.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 I think Alex Bell would probably build the most weird machines

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 as part of the Taskmaster ring.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 I think the truth is that we would love to go on Taskmaster,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 but so would every single other comedian in the entire country.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Yeah.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 We're probably quite far down the list.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Yeah.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 So thanks for reminding us where we stand in the pecking order.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Let's have another email.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 This is quite a good one from Liz Harrison.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 I was just clatching up on some club fish.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 I'm listening to June 2024's Drop As A Line,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 where you ask for people who listen in unusual places to get in touch.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 I haven't heard this subsequently mentioned.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 I think because no one said anything interesting, unfortunately.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 But I wanted to drop in my two peneth and let you know

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 that between November and April each year,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 I listened from the second most remote island in the world,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 St Helena in the South Atlantic.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Wow.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 How interesting, St Helena.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 Yeah.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 I got some friends who just moved to St Helena.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 Have you?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Really?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Yeah.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 So I think perhaps they might be listening.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 What was she doing there?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Does she say?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 She doesn't say.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 And she says less interestingly for the rest of the year,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 I listened from Shrewsbury in Shropshire,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 which I think is actually both of those places

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 you can pronounce two different ways.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Is it St Helena or is it St Helena?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 And is it Shrewsbury or Shrewsbury?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 How interesting.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Yeah.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Thanks, guys.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 Sam Talbot writes,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 listening to episode 367,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 which Andy talks about his correspondence

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 with the crime-solving drug naming team of Schubert and Carrot.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 Do you remember this?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 They name drugs and they sort of,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 they rule out drug names that might be considered rude.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 You know, if you've got an idea for your drug name,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 but, you know, but it sounds obscene.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 You're not allowed.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 And they banned privy,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 the prefix privy because it sounded lavatorial.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 I wonder what they were doing in 2008

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 when a new drug with the trade name Brideon was introduced.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 I am an anaesthetist and I'm more familiar with this drug

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 used for reversing the muscle relaxing effects of anesthesia

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 by its generic name of Sugga Madex,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 often mispronounced Sugga Madex,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 and I don't like effects.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 How did they miss that?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 I don't know.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 That's very funny.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Yeah.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 It's how long, because I vaguely remember that,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 but I'd forgotten that it was medical drugs

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 and not illegal drugs.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 And your mind does go to illegal drugs.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 So I was like, what kind of weird prude is there

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 in the drug dealing community?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 You say that you're not allowed to be flogging heroin

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 if it's called, you know, penis ganj or whatever.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Bump cocaine.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Yeah.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 No, it's not that.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 No, no, no, no.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Penis ganj.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Penis ganj.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 I don't know where my head was going there.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 I like it.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Yeah.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 I like it.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 I think that because I know a lot of our listeners

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 on Drop As A Line are street hoodlums

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 who are creating new drugs.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 And so I reckon that could be,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 that could be the new slang.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Get it on the list.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 Yeah.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Sam post fixes his email by saying,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 "By the way, while patients often do talk

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 a lot of nonsense as they're going to sleep,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 I've never told anyone to shut up,"

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 or said, "I've shagged your mum,"

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 as was suggested on another episode by Anna.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 I don't remember that.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Yeah, I'm surprised I say that sort of thing out loud.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Whoops.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Well, I bet he has done it, though.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 It's just the person wouldn't remember.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 Superb.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Mystery email, mystery source.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 It's good.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 It's an anonymous one.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 It's someone who needs to protect their identity.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Oh, sorry.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 I thought you meant like, you know,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 brown and barbecue crossed or whatever.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 No.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 That's-- Anna, hold that thought.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Oh.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 I'm a few episodes behind,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 but I caught your conversation regarding barcodes.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 I work at Heinz.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 And a nerdy fact is that we try to buy barcodes

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 that have 57 in them,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 because Heinz has 57 varieties.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 You can buy a barcode?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 I know.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 That's amazing.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 It's got tricky due to the number of our products

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 and barcodes available,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 but on the core products we try for a 57.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 And it's like a long string of numbers.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 There's just a 57 somewhere in there.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 That's amazing.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 So, does this mean if we--

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Can we check a barcode on our Heinz products or not?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Yeah.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 And it should have 57 in it.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Yeah.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 Yeah.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 Let's see if I got some beans in the house.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 I'm going to do that.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Okay.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 I'll just fill time while these guys are off rifling.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 They're bin cupboards.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 They're bean cupboards.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 They've gone.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 So, it's just me and you.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 I've always felt underappreciated on this podcast.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 Oh, they're back.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 I'll wait for Anna to come back.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Hey.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 Oh, great.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 I'm really excited to find out what you've got.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Anna keeps her beans at the end of the garden.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Because she's suspicious of them.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 They're magic beans, aren't they?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 It's so excited, Anna.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 Well.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 Anna.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Anna, are you excited?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 I'm so excited.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Yeah.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Okay.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Let's hear what you've got.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Okay.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 Well, I've got--

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 First of all, I've got some Heinz vegetable soup.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 And I'm having a look at the barcode here.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 There is indeed a 57 right there.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Wow.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Bang in the middle.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Wow.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Okay, so that's a core product.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Okay.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 Mushroom soup.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Same, same.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 57.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Okay.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 James, what you got?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 Well, I've got the core product.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Proper thinner beans.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 He's got the beans.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Lovely.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 He's got the beans.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 And sure enough.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Triple zero, one, five, seven.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Amazing.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Amazing.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 And just as a quick fourth piece of evidence,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Heinz ketchup, the second core product.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 57 there, right at the end.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Incredible.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 That's so cool.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 There you go.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 That is really cool.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 It's the best bit of trivia I've ever heard.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 And our correspondent says, "If you discuss,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 please do not use my name."

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Why?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 You should be proud.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Anyway, thank you, Mr.--

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Do you see why I said mystery sauce at the start?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Yeah.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Great stuff.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Oh, yeah, I see.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Email here from Blaise Petrucci.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Mm-hmm, brilliant.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Nice.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 You don't get enough blazes around.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 We said on the podcast recently.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Well, did we?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 We said--

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Email, subject line, Blaise Pascal was not boring, Anna.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 Oh, gosh, I've been saying a lot of things, haven't I lately?

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Can't keep my mouth shut.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Yeah.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Blaise writes, "My late father was an Italian mathematician

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 who was obsessed with Blaise Pascal.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 So much so, he named his son Blaise.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 Me.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Growing up, I hated my name and I hated maths."

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 Aw.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Oh, you would have hated our 57 bit that we've just done.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 But my old man was persistent and eventually a love of maths

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 and of Monsieur Pascal developed in my little brain.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 So imagine my sadness when I heard Anna Tijinski describe my namesake as boring.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 Blaise Pascal was a true polymath to rival the likes of Da Vinci and Franklin,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 and I think his influence is far-reaching and eternal, just like no such thing as a fish.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 I think you can be a polymath and have a far-reaching and eternal influence

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 whilst also being as dull as dishwater.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 Like no such thing as a fish.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 OK.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 So there you go.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Lovely, lovely to hear from you Blaise.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Apologies.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 But I stand by everything I said.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 Yeah, that's good.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 I think that's good.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 I think it's nice to apologise but defy.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 It would be weird if you just caved.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Thank you.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 OK.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Oh, Meredith writes,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 "We did synchronised swimming recently on the podcast."

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 We should.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Sure did.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 Meredith sends some notes from someone who was a synchronised swimmer for five years.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Cool.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 He was not nearly good enough at it to continue in college.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 So that's Meredith's level.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 I feel that Synchro was given appropriate respect in this episode,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 which is a redemption from earlier podcast mentions.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Excellent job.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 No.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 I can't remember what we said.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 "We used to have to do laps of unders,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 swim underwater for 50 to 75 metres without a breath.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Bad."

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Yeah, that's too far.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 "In crazy training routines and techniques,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 you do your entire routine with ankle weights on to improve your skull."

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Which is the thing where you stay upside down.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 The weird stay upside down thing.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 She also says one thing about injuries.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 She has a lot of scarring from people who didn't cut their toenails

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 and went swimming with her.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 In water polo, they have a designated person who comes through

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 and checks all our nails to make sure they're regulation.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Cool.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 I wonder how many sports or pursuits there are

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 that require a certain nail length,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 because that reminds me of playing the piano.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 My teacher always used to get really pissed off

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 if I hadn't cut my nails.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 It's the same truth of guitar.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 Is it bad if you have long nails, James?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Yeah.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 Although for banjo, you wear fake nails.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Like you have like plastic picks that you wear on your fingers.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 I thought you needed one hand with long nails to do the picking.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 In sport, I'm not so sure.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 The thing is there are rules about how long your nails can be

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 in beach volleyball because people point adverts on them, I think.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Really?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 So you had to have them so short that you couldn't fit a full-sized ad?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Or you got paid more for longer nails?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 I think they weren't allowed to be the size of a billboard.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 That's fair.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 I can't remember.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Actually, I can't remember.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 I'm half remembering that idea.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Sorry, I just cut my nails.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Can you do the bottom half of the Coke bottle in this one?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 That's great.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Here's another.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Here's Mike Abdullah.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 This is a bollocking for me.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 I know.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 What's that called again?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Is it called Get Yourself Off The Hook?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Or is it just called The Abuse Section?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 I'm not sure.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Well, we've got Um, actually, which is a factual correction.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 We've got Spicy Meat, which is our behind-the-scenes stuff.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 We've got Old Fish.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Thanks for no thanks.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 We've got Riddle Roundabout.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 What about a right pollocking?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 That's good.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 That's brilliant.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Yeah.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Yeah, pollocking.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Brilliant.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Mike Abdullah writes, this is for me.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 After you confidently declared on last week's show that, quotes,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 "There's nobody alive in the world who puts the milk in the mug

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 and puts the bag in the milk."

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 I am writing to disprove this.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 I frequently make tea this way.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 I wonder how many other emails you will get.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 I started doing it after listening to an episode of Rutherford & Fry,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 the mass show with a friend of fish, Hannah Fry.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 And apparently, when milk is added to very hot tea,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 it will start to separate.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 Whereas if hot tea is added to milk,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 the temperature rises more gradually and the milk sticks together better.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Something like that, who knows.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 And he's been happy with the result ever since.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Did he find, I would like to know,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 that in the past, his milk was just getting all globulous and busy

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 when he put it in after tea, because I have to say it.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Globulous, it forms a separate layer at the top of the cup, Hannah.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 You must know that.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 You drink through the milk and then you just drink the tea.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Sounds like bollocks, though, basically.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Hannah Fry is the one I was talking about.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Hey, phone number for Heinz, 0800 528 5757.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Fantastic.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Yay.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 How are you?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 Are they calling you?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Yes, that's them.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 No, it's on the tin of beans.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Unless you're in the Republic of Ireland, in which case it's 1 800 995 311.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 So obviously the Republic of Ireland telephone companies refuse to bend over backwards.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 They stitched up.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 They won't bow to Big Bean.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Good on them.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 That's very funny.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 OK, here's a great one.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 Erin Thomas.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Canadian here.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 I'm listening to your August 29th show.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 And while I agree that slang will make you sound like another country.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 I don't understand that.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Canada is a vast country.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 In some parts of Canada, they may say a boot, but I've lived in the prairies all my life and no one here says a boot.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 In fact, I've never heard anyone say that.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 My English husband, born in England and moved to Canada in his 40s, tells me he's never heard anyone here say a boot.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 Well, if he wants to hear people say a boot, he should listen to lazy Canadian stereotypes because I had that all the time.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 So sorry, Erin.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Sorry to the people of the Canadian prairies as well.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Yeah.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 I think it might be one of those things that you can't hear it if you're that close to it.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 You know, like everyone thinks they don't have an accent.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 No, I do.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Because they can't hear their own accent.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 I've got an accent.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Well, of course, you've got a thick Jordy accent, but you're a bit of a villain.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 No, I know what you mean. That's a fair point.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 Oh my God, here's a great one.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Elizabeth Ruth Ross Ward.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Get this.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Email subject line.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 We're getting married because of fish.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 We've sparked a wedding.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 Brilliant. I hope she doesn't double barrel with someone with an equally long name.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Good point.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 She doesn't say her partner's surname.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 But listen to this.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 We actually have you to thank for our upcoming wedding.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 Six years ago, my partner Andrew saw me across a pool table at a bar and tried to chat with me.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 I wasn't having any of it, assuming he was another random at a bar that will be a bit boring/disappointing.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 Then he mentioned his favourite podcast was no such thing as a fish.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 And my ears perked right up. It was my favourite too.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 We started properly talking and we haven't shut up since.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 We're getting married in 2026.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 We just wanted to say a huge thank you for bringing us together.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Guys, that's so exciting.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 I'm so exciting.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 How are we going to do the wedding theming?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Are we going to...

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Sorry, what?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 They're not inviting us to be part of it.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 I'm sure we're going to be invited to be part of it, Anna.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 I'm just wondering how we can make the day more fish related.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 Well, all the tables will have to be named after characters from No Such Things as Fish.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Brilliant.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 And where our dick be table.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Or the lady who had an anal prolapse.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Just call that anal prolapse.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 I think just call that Oxrectum table.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 Who was the woman I used to love who used to spend her time making sure women didn't put mad stuff up their vaginas?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Oh, Jen Gunter.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Yeah, there's got to be a Jen Gunter table.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Yeah, the Gunter zone, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 For all the goop ladies.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 And when they say, you know, does anyone know any reason why?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 And Jen Gunter will pop up saying, why you shouldn't put the rings up your fanny?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 Don't do that.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 If anyone has any reason that this shouldn't happen, shout, stop the wedding.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 Yes.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 That's actually a good idea.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 You should incorporate that, guys.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 That's a really fun idea.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 Do save a date, send a save the date soon, because obviously our schedule will get quite booked up, didn't they?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Absolutely.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 Yeah.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 But how, that's the best news I've had all month.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 I know, it's really nice.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 What an amazing moment.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 Yeah.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 Also, what an amazing way to meet, just meeting across a pool table and starting to chat and realizing you like the same podcast.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 I think that's just a good one.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 Quite annoying for the people who were playing pool at the time, though, I imagine.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 What are these pair of nerds doing near a pool table anyway?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Yeah, famously a jock sport pool, isn't it?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 It's definitely not a thing of benefits from ours of lonely practice by yourself.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Yeah, fair enough.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Here we go.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Here is another thanks but no thanks from Tim Groves.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 Stop the podcast, he says.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Very good.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 I have an idea for a thanks but no thanks segment and drop us a line.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 I'm a long-time listener and have recently become a card-carrying member of Club Fish.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Congratulations, Tim.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 I'm very much enjoying the bonus material, but it suddenly struck me the other day that something is missing.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 The adverts.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 I know avoiding ads is part of my membership fee, but there was something lovely about the four of you recording charming little snippets for your sponsors.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Who could forget the time Dan left a Harry's advert desperate for more razors because his beard was growing so fast?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 Or Anna, quickly distancing herself from sharing a single mattress with Dan during a Lisa's sleep advert?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 I'm curious about what we Club Fishers may be missing, so perhaps it would be nice if you put out a little compilation so we know exactly what type of VPN razor or mattress is currently preferred by the QILs.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 That's so interesting that you say that because, and I'm basically saying this to cover our legal asses.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Because what's this person called?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 Tim.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Tim, don't want him suing us.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 When we first started the bonus material, we did say, didn't we, we should release a string of just the adverts.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 And I still think when we get a chance, we should do that.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 Or maybe some fake adverts for stuff that we would advertise.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Or maybe like we just sneakily put adverts in the droppers a line for baked beans or something like that.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 You've blown this can wide open.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Yeah, it would require us to put a lot more effort into the adverts again.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Exactly. You haven't heard the original versions now, mate, but they are, they're crap, aren't they?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 The adverts we do these days, they're so phoned in trying to drive people to pay.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Since all you guys left Club Fish, we were like, well, that's all the important people have gone now.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 They've all gone to Club Fish, so we might as well start phoning them in.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 It's a monotone, read it straight from the sheet, take the jokes out.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 Often we will pretend that it's a pre-recorded advert made by an actual company and dropped in.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 It's actually us doing all the voices in those.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 We try and make it indistinguishable from a pre-recorded radio advert.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 That takes a lot of work. We're putting all the effort into that.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 Why do they do it?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 I don't know, I don't know.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 Alexa Tonner writes, I am a recent fan of the podcast, welcome.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 And I especially appreciate just how prolific you all are.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 I've listened to dozens of episodes at this point and yet I find myself unable to remember most of the facts once the episode is over.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 The ones I do seem to retain are about World Wars One and Two, a topic that does not interest me at all.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 I'm so sorry.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 That's good, isn't it?

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 That's very funny.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 You're welcome, Alexa.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 Tough. They're not going to stop.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 No.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 Now, we've had a couple of emails from David Bergaman and I just wanted to share both of them with you.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 It's very, very rare for someone to get both.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 And it's not because his name is David Bergaman.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Okay, here's the first one.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Having listened to the main show for a long time and been through lots of the bonus content,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 I'm a new ClubVish member, welcome, David.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 I've gleaned quite a bit about what you all do in the fish industry.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 Dan is the host of the main show as well as plenty of other podcasts and projects.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 James edits the show and is also everyone's boss's head elf.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Andy is in charge of Drop as a Line and seems to run of a lot of the other ClubVish episodes.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Even other elves in the office will edit compilations or guest on the show,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 which leads me to my big question.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 What does Anna do?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Really looking forward to finding out the answer, David Bergaman.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 Listen, David.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 Andy, you've got to come up with better names if you're going to do an intervention.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Sometimes it's very hard to quantify what someone brings to the table

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 and to write it down on paper or indeed explain it in words.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 But yet, you know, they are the essential ingredient.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Don't put this out because if the boss is here, then I'm fired.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Hey, I thought David Bergaman said that I'm the boss.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Oh yes, everyone's boss has had elf, very dubious.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 I mean, James, this is clearly, this is, I did not write this.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 I would not.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Point taken, I'll make the tea next time I'm in.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 How will you make it?

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 What will you pour on first?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Great question.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 I pour the milk onto the counter and then I pour the tea onto that.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 But then I sweep it all into the mug with a little broom.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 That's how I do it.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 How would it work?

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Is it possible to put the milk in first and then the water?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 So you've got very hot, milky water.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 And then the bag.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Shit, why does no one do that?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 Anyway, look, we've got to get on to Bergaman 2, the burgering.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Second email from Bergaman.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Does that answer your question?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Did you say what you do, Anna? You do lots of stuff.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 You always work very hard.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 I'm about to make the tea.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 It's coming up.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Who is this burger? Who do you think he is? Or is she?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 Giving them the air of two emails. It's bullshit.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 I think he's related to Ingmar Bergaman, the very famous.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 I noticed, Anna, you haven't actually answered the question.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 You're constantly telling us how busy you are.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 So there must be something that you're doing.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 What is it, Anna?

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Anna works very hard on the TV series as one of James's underlings.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 But nonetheless, she's a key part of the team.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 I tried the shoelaces on QI, yeah.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Together.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Yeah.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 No, I don't do anything.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 Anna is a core part of the team, David.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 If you come for her, you come for all of us.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 David, second email.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 I know there has been a lot of upset about Dan being accused of being a wife guy.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 I think I may have some upsetting proof of his identity as such.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 It's exciting, isn't it?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 In the very first Clubfish compilation, August 2022,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 James brought out a phrenology head detailing what the different bumps on your head mean.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 James then invited you all to find the biggest bump to compare it to the phrenology head,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 and Dan found that his biggest bump was in the marriage section.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 This is obviously because he is such a wife guy that even pseudoscience can tell.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 Oh, so that was before the whole wife guy joke.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Exactly, that was pre-that. Isn't that amazing?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 Do you think pseudoscience maybe does work, but it only works on people who are into pseudoscience?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 That's quite good.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 I think that's true.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 That's it, isn't it?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Sophie Watson writes, "Did you know air fryers have been around since 1472?"

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Catchy.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 This is brilliant.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 I've told James this in advance, Hannah. You're the only one who's learning this new intel.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 It's stunning. It's absolutely stunning.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 Do I need to know exactly what an air fryer is before you explain this?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 It's a cooking device, isn't it, where you cook things dry.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 Oh, it's some kind of magic box. I don't know. I haven't got one.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Yeah, it's like a small oven that sits on the counter. Nobody knows.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 Look, can we get to Sophie's email?

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Air fryers have been around since 1472.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Cool.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 This fact works spoken aloud, but not so much written down as I am actually talking about air, AYR, the Scottish town.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 Friars, as in priests.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Here is a link to some info about the Franciscan monastery in air.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 Isn't that good?

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 I love it. I just think that's so funny.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 Beautiful.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 She says, "I had been listening to the podcast and was cooking a cheese toasty for my lunch."

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 And that's how she came up with it.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Thank you so much, Sophie.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 Perfect. This is my kind of fact as well, isn't it?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 She's come up with a joke and then she's done the googling to see if it's true or not.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 It's just correct. It's so good.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 Yeah, very strong.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 I actually feel like we should use that for the show, to be honest.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Oh, should we?

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Air fryers, maybe.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 We've never had a fact promoted from Drop As A Line to the main show.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Do you think it would matter that people had heard it before?

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 Would we have to cut it out of this?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 Or could that be a cool extra in-joke for the Drop As A Line clubfish crew?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 They could be sat there waiting for it to come up on the show one day.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 Yeah, I think let's do that.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 Okay, so we might use it on the show one day. We might not.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 There's an incentive to keep listening.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Absolutely. We need to find them at this point.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Oh, here's a boff fin. Do you remember that?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 The experts who write in with their knowledge.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 What's triple F?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 Four Fs, I think.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Four Fs, sorry. Yes, you're actually right.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 In episode 552, you discussed the Nile crocodiles burrows being the longest in the animal kingdom.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 However, there is a reason I'm reading out this particular correction as well.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 In South America, 10,000 years ago, there were much larger ones dug by giant sloths.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 Which I think is fair. We have mentioned that.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 But right now, I think crocodiles might dig the deepest.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 Also, while mentioning paleo burrows, I must also mention daemon elixies.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 Corkscrew shaped burrows created by beavers in North America.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Enjoy entering this rabbit hole, Sam. Very funny.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Sam is a technician in Earth Sciences, who works at a place called Megaforna Central.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Oh, cool. Amazing.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 In Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia. How cool is that?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 Megaforna Central.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 I know, it's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 It sounds like an alternative name for Jurassic Park, basically, doesn't it?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 It sounds like you go there and there's giant animals wandering around.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 Yeah.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Do you remember, Andy, you had a question once on QI about how big Megaforna has to be.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 And actually, there are some Megafornas that are smaller than a cat or something.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 I think Megaforna means visible to the naked eye.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 It's such bollocks.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 And ant is a Megaforna.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 It's just another example of science ruining normal language for the rest of us.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Whereas Megaforna should clearly be a bear or bigger.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 Oh, you've made me angry about that all over again now.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 That's funny, because I reckon that was like 15 years ago.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 Yeah, it was.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 This is just a funny story from Cameron McInnes.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 We did a hiccup cures about how you cure a hiccup with a finger in your bottom.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Sounds like us, yeah.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 It's in personal anecdote from Cameron, which he's been telling for some years now.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 But it's not podcast appropriate.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 Oh, is it dual appropriate?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 I think it might be.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 It's about a headmaster called Rick, and apparently was really a bad headmaster,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 was really incompetent and arrogant and, you know,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 talked about himself in third person assemblies.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 Okay, so it's a bit like bad headmaster of a school, basically.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 Our school was having a cross country race, annual cross country race.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 All the parents were lined up where the finish line was, right?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 My friend has a rescue dog called Calua, who gets a bit skittish.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 And there was another dog there making Calua agitated.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 My friend went to go and put him in the car.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Basically, the dog's got in a scrap.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Calua bit this dog on the ear and got locked jord.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Oh, no.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Enter the other dog's howling.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 The parents come to see what's going on.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Enter Rick the Dick, which is apparently this headmaster's name,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 who sees what's going on and declares,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 "You have to stick your finger up his bum to make him let go.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 I've done it before out of my way."

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 Okay, which is true.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 That is true, isn't it?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 Then in front of quite a large crowd,

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 quickly sucks his finger, grabs the dog and sticks his finger straight up its arse.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 - Do it in that order. - Absolutely.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 There's a second or two in shock silence before someone says,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 "Rick, that's the wrong dog."

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Rick quickly removes his finger from the other dog, grabs Calua,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 and sticks his fingers up his arse.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Then Calua doesn't let go.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 The three of them are scuffling around in a circle,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 trying to get away from each other until one of the other parents

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 throws a bottle of water on Calua and he lets go.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 His poor other dog has now got a jaw in the ear and a finger up the arse

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 and still no one's helping him out.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 His name has apparently now been changed to "Wrong Dog, Rick."

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Thanks for the podcast.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 - What a great story. - Thanks, Cameron.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Great story. He says, "I've sent this also to Chris and Rosie Ramsey."

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 - What? - What?

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Come on.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 But I figure the more I spread it, the more likely it is to filter back to him.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 Chris and Rosie Ramsey have high standards, though, right?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 They probably won't beat it up.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 They certainly won't have it as their sort of climactic little anecdote.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 Absolutely not. No way.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 So thanks, Cameron. Thanks to all of you for listening to this and getting in touch.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 And if you'd like to send us some stuff, go to email podcast@qi.com.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 I would just ask, we would prefer it to be exclusive to us, if possible.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 But we will read out any old shit as long as it is exclusive to us.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 I think that's the other thing we do need to say.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 - Great. Bye. - Bye.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 Bye-bye.
