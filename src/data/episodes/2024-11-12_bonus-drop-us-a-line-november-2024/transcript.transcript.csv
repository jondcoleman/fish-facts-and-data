00:00:02,00:00:04,[speaking Japanese]
00:00:04,00:00:10,[music]
00:00:10,00:00:12,Hi everybody!
00:00:12,00:00:14,"Hi Andy, sorry I'm a bit distracted."
00:00:14,00:00:16,I got a pumpkin here
00:00:16,00:00:18,and I just took the top of the pumpkin
00:00:18,00:00:21,and it had loads of strands of what I think might be
00:00:21,00:00:23,fungi or moulds.
00:00:23,00:00:25,"Wow, what a strong distraction."
00:00:25,00:00:27,Let me show you.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"Yeah, let's have a look, we need to evaluate."
00:00:29,00:00:31,"Uh, oh!"
00:00:31,00:00:33,That's so cool!
00:00:33,00:00:35,"Honestly, there's more hair on that pumpkin"
00:00:35,00:00:37,than there is on my actual head at the moment.
00:00:37,00:00:39,That's really foul.
00:00:39,00:00:41,"It does have a quiff, yes."
00:00:41,00:00:43,"Is this going to be a spooky special, Andy,"
00:00:43,00:00:45,because it's the day before Halloween?
00:00:45,00:00:47,"Oh my goodness, yeah I suppose it is actually."
00:00:47,00:00:49,Let's try and make it all a bit spooky.
00:00:49,00:00:51,"Okay, hello!"
00:00:51,00:00:53,"Welcome, when is it going out though?"
00:00:53,00:00:55,"It's going out closer to bonfire night, isn't it?"
00:00:55,00:00:57,So it should really be an anti-parliamentarian special.
00:00:57,00:00:59,"All of mine actually, all of mine"
00:00:59,00:01:02,are subtly imbued with Protestant radical philosophy.
00:01:02,00:01:04,You know that.
00:01:04,00:01:06,"Welcome to Drop Us Aligned, this is our audience feedback show."
00:01:06,00:01:08,It's not just like James complaining about a pumpkin
00:01:08,00:01:11,"and Anna, you know, wanting to thrash the Catholics."
00:01:11,00:01:13,"We've got some cracking stuff in the inbox,"
00:01:13,00:01:16,"because it's been a while, it's very pent up the inbox."
00:01:16,00:01:18,There is a lot of stuff in here.
00:01:18,00:01:20,"Oh, Dan's not here, I don't know where Dan is."
00:01:20,00:01:22,No one does.
00:01:22,00:01:24,"Sunning himself, probably."
00:01:24,00:01:27,Send out a Dan signal if you're hearing this.
00:01:27,00:01:33,But let's start with an email from Johann Scott.
00:01:33,00:01:37,"""I'm Johann,"" he says."
00:01:37,00:01:40,"He didn't really need to say that, because I already knew."
00:01:40,00:01:42,"""A fan of no such thing as a fish,"
00:01:42,00:01:46,"and the current president of the St Andrews Whole Digging Society."""
00:01:46,00:01:49,I was really happy to hear you mention us on your recent podcast
00:01:49,00:01:51,and wanted to express my gratitude.
00:01:51,00:01:53,Isn't that nice?
00:01:53,00:01:56,Did he not invite you to dig some holes with him?
00:01:56,00:01:58,"Do you know he didn't, actually."
00:01:58,00:02:00,"We don't wait every fortnight, unfortunately,"
00:02:00,00:02:03,"but we arrange hole digs depending on university deadlines,"
00:02:03,00:02:05,the weather and the tide.
00:02:05,00:02:07,"We've dug some pretty deep holes ourselves,"
00:02:07,00:02:10,although not quite as deep as the Padstow Hole you referred to.
00:02:10,00:02:12,We dug one that looked like a trench in September.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"I think if it looks like a trench, it is a trench."
00:02:14,00:02:18,That was perhaps around six feet deep and 12 feet long.
00:02:18,00:02:20,That's a trench.
00:02:20,00:02:24,"They did dig some fake trenches on the beaches, didn't they,"
00:02:24,00:02:27,"during World War I think so, in the UK,"
00:02:27,00:02:30,so that soldiers could get an idea of what the trenches would be like.
00:02:30,00:02:31,"Oh, that's good."
00:02:31,00:02:32,"Oh, what to practice?"
00:02:32,00:02:33,I think so.
00:02:33,00:02:34,Really?
00:02:34,00:02:36,"Yes, I think you're right. I think they did."
00:02:36,00:02:40,"There was a mining university, which had a fake mine in it."
00:02:40,00:02:41,"Yes, in Birmingham."
00:02:41,00:02:43,Loads of underground tunnels.
00:02:43,00:02:47,"I was reading the reminiscences of a World War II German soldier,"
00:02:47,00:02:50,"actually, who was, oh no, it was an Australian guy who said"
00:02:50,00:02:53,they spent all of their military training holding brimsticks instead of guns
00:02:53,00:02:56,"because the guns didn't arrive until the day that they had to leave,"
00:02:56,00:02:59,"which I don't think counts as machine, as gun training."
00:02:59,00:03:01,That's amazing.
00:03:01,00:03:03,So they were playing Quidditch.
00:03:03,00:03:05,"Yes, exactly."
00:03:05,00:03:08,"All at war, putting the gun between their legs."
00:03:08,00:03:10,That's funny.
00:03:10,00:03:14,"Johann, I think, I don't want to speak on Andy's behalf,"
00:03:14,00:03:17,but I think he would be keen to come up and dig some holes.
00:03:17,00:03:18,"Yeah, I think I would actually."
00:03:18,00:03:20,It might be a big barrier to entry.
00:03:20,00:03:21,"No, no, no, there's no barrier to entry,"
00:03:21,00:03:24,"and that brings me on to our next email from Charlie Mone,"
00:03:24,00:03:30,"who says, ""Hi, I'm the founder of the St Andrews Hole Digging Society."""
00:03:30,00:03:32,"So Johann is the president, Charlie is the founder."
00:03:32,00:03:36,Don't listen to this Johann guy who's probably emailing you.
00:03:36,00:03:38,"He said, ""It's really cool that you mentioned us."""
00:03:38,00:03:40,"He said he wanted to clear up a misconception,"
00:03:40,00:03:43,"contrary to popular belief, it isn't exclusively a men's club."
00:03:43,00:03:46,"I can't remember. I don't think, do we say that?"
00:03:46,00:03:49,"No, but it's so commonly accepted worldwide"
00:03:49,00:03:52,"that the St Andrews Hole Digging Society is mostly male,"
00:03:52,00:03:54,but I think it's good that we've cleared that up for the public.
00:03:54,00:03:56,"Well, Charlie says, in fact, in fact, we found"
00:03:56,00:03:58,"the majority of our attendees are usually women,"
00:03:58,00:04:01,and the activity of hole digging has strongly resonated
00:04:01,00:04:04,with the trans and non-binary members of the St Andrews student community.
00:04:04,00:04:07,"So there you go, they're very welcoming, all welcomed."
00:04:07,00:04:09,You just have to like digging big holes.
00:04:09,00:04:11,That really is the only criteria.
00:04:11,00:04:14,"Yeah, I think we did imply that it might be middle-aged men"
00:04:14,00:04:17,"going out, leaving their wives and digging some holes."
00:04:17,00:04:19,So that might be on us.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"I know you're right. Charlie says, ""It's wonderful you mentioned us,"
00:04:21,00:04:23,"but I want to clarify, it's important for everyone to feel"
00:04:23,00:04:26,"like they would be welcome to come to our digging sessions."""
00:04:26,00:04:27,Excellent.
00:04:27,00:04:29,So you just have to be a sad act.
00:04:29,00:04:31,That's all that's the only criteria of entry
00:04:31,00:04:34,of any demographic at all.
00:04:34,00:04:36,"Yeah. Oh, here's a thanks but no thanks."
00:04:36,00:04:38,"We've got a few of these this week, actually."
00:04:38,00:04:40,I'm going to scatter them through.
00:04:40,00:04:44,"Charlie Wolfe, great name, says,"
00:04:44,00:04:47,"""I was wondering if you guys, Brackets James and Deanna Dan,"
00:04:47,00:04:51,"yes, obviously, will be willing to do a podcast"
00:04:51,00:04:54,"or mini show called Small Inventions, Big Impact,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,where you discuss smaller inventions that change the world
00:04:56,00:04:58,like the license plate or traffic lights.
00:04:58,00:05:00,"I thought with how often you talk about interesting inventions,"
00:05:00,00:05:02,"you might find this idea interesting."""
00:05:02,00:05:06,"Yeah, I think it's the kind of thing that does come up just,"
00:05:06,00:05:09,"you know, ad hoc, as in we will talk about something"
00:05:09,00:05:12,and then explain why it's such a big deal.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"So things like ferns, do you remember?"
00:05:15,00:05:19,We talked about the fern craze and how that impacted the world
00:05:19,00:05:21,"and barbed wire, how that impacted the world."
00:05:21,00:05:23,"I mean, we should say, we didn't claim that someone"
00:05:23,00:05:26,invented the fern in the 19th century.
00:05:26,00:05:27,"No, but the Wardian case."
00:05:27,00:05:28,The Wardian case.
00:05:28,00:05:30,"Yeah, that allowed them to be transported"
00:05:30,00:05:32,"and revolutionized, basically, plant growing around the world,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,because suddenly you could get a plant from one place
00:05:34,00:05:35,to several thousand miles away.
00:05:35,00:05:36,Yeah.
00:05:36,00:05:37,Yeah.
00:05:37,00:05:38,"Well, that's a great idea."
00:05:38,00:05:40,Doesn't a small invention become a big invention
00:05:40,00:05:41,when it has a big impact?
00:05:41,00:05:44,"I'm not sure how you'd set out the criteria in that show,"
00:05:44,00:05:47,"because it would be like, well, it's not size-wise, is it?"
00:05:47,00:05:48,"No, you're absolutely right."
00:05:48,00:05:50,"And as soon as it has a big impact, that's a big invention."
00:05:50,00:05:54,"Yeah, so for that reason, Dylan, thanks, but no thanks."
00:05:54,00:05:57,"Can I also have a voice, a quick bugbear I have about this?"
00:05:57,00:05:59,And I've always thought this when people say something
00:05:59,00:06:00,changes the world.
00:06:00,00:06:03,"Again, everything changes the world, doesn't it?"
00:06:03,00:06:06,What a fusspot point to make.
00:06:06,00:06:09,"I'm sorry, but so for instance, we just said the Wardian cage,"
00:06:09,00:06:11,and we'd be claiming it changed the world.
00:06:11,00:06:14,It's sort of changed plant growing on the edges.
00:06:14,00:06:16,So I think it's going to be so hard to put up that barrier.
00:06:16,00:06:19,"I mean, if I nudge this mug a little bit forward,"
00:06:19,00:06:21,"like I have just done there, I've changed the world."
00:06:21,00:06:24,"Yeah, but it's not as interesting as inventing the license plate"
00:06:24,00:06:25,by a long way.
00:06:25,00:06:27,"Anna, honestly, given the stick you've got coming up from the audience,"
00:06:27,00:06:29,I would be trying to placate them at this point
00:06:29,00:06:31,rather than aggravate them further.
00:06:31,00:06:35,That's a great idea.
00:06:35,00:06:37,Here's one from Joshua Davidson.
00:06:37,00:06:40,"Normal name, so it must be a pretty good email."
00:06:40,00:06:41,"Hi, guys."
00:06:41,00:06:43,Aussie listener since 2016.
00:06:43,00:06:45,We're getting a lot from Australia and New Zealand
00:06:45,00:06:47,because we are about to go to Auss and NZ.
00:06:47,00:06:51,And I think the listenership there are getting excited for our visit.
00:06:51,00:06:55,"We're literally going, you're going in like two days."
00:06:55,00:06:56,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:56,00:06:58,There's real buzz in the inbox.
00:06:58,00:07:00,It's really cool.
00:07:00,00:07:03,"Aussie listener since 2016, recent clubfish member."
00:07:03,00:07:05,"I'm sure I'm not the only person to message him with this,"
00:07:05,00:07:08,"but on this week's episode of Meet the Elves,"
00:07:08,00:07:11,"so this is an entirely in-clubfish transaction we're doing here,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,"and he mentioned the phrase getting off at Gateshead,"
00:07:13,00:07:17,"and he mentioned that Gateshead was close to Newcastle, UK,"
00:07:17,00:07:21,"moments after Anna had mentioned that Newcastle, New South Wales"
00:07:21,00:07:23,is the biggest coal exporter in the world.
00:07:23,00:07:25,"I live in Newcastle, New South Wales,"
00:07:25,00:07:27,and thought you would like to know there is also a suburb
00:07:27,00:07:30,"in Newcastle, New South Wales called Gateshead."
00:07:30,00:07:31,Brilliant.
00:07:31,00:07:32,There you go.
00:07:32,00:07:34,That's fantastic information.
00:07:34,00:07:35,They're the same place.
00:07:35,00:07:36,Yeah.
00:07:36,00:07:39,"Oh, and we had another listener who was from Newcastle in the USA,"
00:07:39,00:07:40,which also has loads of coal.
00:07:40,00:07:41,Really?
00:07:41,00:07:42,"If it's called Newcastle, it's got coal."
00:07:42,00:07:43,"Yeah, basically."
00:07:43,00:07:46,Is it the fact that probably they found there was loads of coal there
00:07:46,00:07:48,and what does that remind us of?
00:07:48,00:07:49,Yes.
00:07:49,00:07:50,The US one is that.
00:07:50,00:07:52,"It was called something else, and then they found all this coal,"
00:07:52,00:07:54,"and they said, ""Oh, let's call it Newcastle."""
00:07:54,00:07:56,"Oh, well, the Australian one is also that."
00:07:56,00:07:57,So there you go.
00:07:57,00:07:58,Yeah.
00:07:58,00:07:59,"Oh, great."
00:07:59,00:08:00,Okay.
00:08:00,00:08:02,"Well, Josh Brits in a PS."
00:08:02,00:08:05,"""I would love to petition to get the four of you on Taskmaster."
00:08:05,00:08:08,"""I think it would be hilarious and expose many more personal secrets"
00:08:08,00:08:09,"""of Andy's life."""
00:08:09,00:08:11,I don't know what he means about that.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"Well, they ask us every season, don't they?"
00:08:13,00:08:15,And we always say no.
00:08:15,00:08:16,So integrity.
00:08:16,00:08:17,"Beggars, yeah."
00:08:17,00:08:19,"""Who would you choose from amongst the QI team"
00:08:19,00:08:21,"""to be the fifth contestant?"""
00:08:21,00:08:23,"James, you watched Taskmaster religiously."
00:08:23,00:08:26,"Yeah, well, I did the Taskmaster live experience,"
00:08:26,00:08:28,"which I did win, of course,"
00:08:28,00:08:32,"but I was playing mostly against my nieces who were all teenagers,"
00:08:32,00:08:34,but I ground them into the floor.
00:08:34,00:08:36,I actually smashed them.
00:08:36,00:08:39,The thing is about Taskmaster is it's like QI.
00:08:39,00:08:41,You're not really supposed to win QI.
00:08:41,00:08:45,You're supposed to be amusing and whimsical and stuff.
00:08:45,00:08:49,So you really want someone who's really got that whimsy about them.
00:08:49,00:08:51,"""Who was on the last meet the elves? Was it Rawson?"""
00:08:51,00:08:52,Yeah.
00:08:52,00:08:53,He'd be good.
00:08:53,00:08:54,Rawson would be good.
00:08:54,00:08:55,Let's get it.
00:08:55,00:08:58,It sounded just like he was the last person you could remember.
00:08:58,00:09:01,"Like, ""Who was that guy last week from the elves?"""
00:09:01,00:09:03,"Yeah, let's take him."
00:09:03,00:09:05,"No, Rawson would be good."
00:09:05,00:09:06,They all be good.
00:09:06,00:09:10,You don't get to be a QI researcher without some kind of sideways thinking.
00:09:10,00:09:11,That's true.
00:09:11,00:09:14,I think Alex Bell would probably build the most weird machines
00:09:14,00:09:17,as part of the Taskmaster ring.
00:09:17,00:09:19,"I think the truth is that we would love to go on Taskmaster,"
00:09:19,00:09:22,but so would every single other comedian in the entire country.
00:09:22,00:09:23,Yeah.
00:09:23,00:09:25,We're probably quite far down the list.
00:09:25,00:09:26,Yeah.
00:09:26,00:09:29,So thanks for reminding us where we stand in the pecking order.
00:09:29,00:09:32,Let's have another email.
00:09:32,00:09:34,This is quite a good one from Liz Harrison.
00:09:34,00:09:36,I was just clatching up on some club fish.
00:09:36,00:09:39,"I'm listening to June 2024's Drop As A Line,"
00:09:39,00:09:43,where you ask for people who listen in unusual places to get in touch.
00:09:43,00:09:45,I haven't heard this subsequently mentioned.
00:09:45,00:09:48,"I think because no one said anything interesting, unfortunately."
00:09:48,00:09:52,But I wanted to drop in my two peneth and let you know
00:09:52,00:09:54,"that between November and April each year,"
00:09:54,00:09:56,"I listened from the second most remote island in the world,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,St Helena in the South Atlantic.
00:09:58,00:09:59,Wow.
00:09:59,00:10:00,"How interesting, St Helena."
00:10:00,00:10:01,Yeah.
00:10:01,00:10:03,I got some friends who just moved to St Helena.
00:10:03,00:10:04,Have you?
00:10:04,00:10:05,Really?
00:10:05,00:10:06,Yeah.
00:10:06,00:10:08,So I think perhaps they might be listening.
00:10:08,00:10:09,What was she doing there?
00:10:09,00:10:10,Does she say?
00:10:10,00:10:11,She doesn't say.
00:10:11,00:10:13,"And she says less interestingly for the rest of the year,"
00:10:13,00:10:16,"I listened from Shrewsbury in Shropshire,"
00:10:16,00:10:19,which I think is actually both of those places
00:10:19,00:10:21,you can pronounce two different ways.
00:10:21,00:10:23,Is it St Helena or is it St Helena?
00:10:23,00:10:25,And is it Shrewsbury or Shrewsbury?
00:10:25,00:10:26,How interesting.
00:10:26,00:10:27,Yeah.
00:10:27,00:10:29,"Thanks, guys."
00:10:29,00:10:31,"Sam Talbot writes,"
00:10:31,00:10:33,"listening to episode 367,"
00:10:33,00:10:35,which Andy talks about his correspondence
00:10:35,00:10:38,with the crime-solving drug naming team of Schubert and Carrot.
00:10:38,00:10:39,Do you remember this?
00:10:39,00:10:41,"They name drugs and they sort of,"
00:10:41,00:10:44,they rule out drug names that might be considered rude.
00:10:44,00:10:46,"You know, if you've got an idea for your drug name,"
00:10:46,00:10:48,"but, you know, but it sounds obscene."
00:10:48,00:10:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:49,00:10:50,You're not allowed.
00:10:50,00:10:52,"And they banned privy,"
00:10:52,00:10:55,the prefix privy because it sounded lavatorial.
00:10:55,00:10:58,I wonder what they were doing in 2008
00:10:58,00:11:01,when a new drug with the trade name Brideon was introduced.
00:11:01,00:11:04,I am an anaesthetist and I'm more familiar with this drug
00:11:04,00:11:07,used for reversing the muscle relaxing effects of anesthesia
00:11:07,00:11:09,"by its generic name of Sugga Madex,"
00:11:09,00:11:12,"often mispronounced Sugga Madex,"
00:11:12,00:11:15,and I don't like effects.
00:11:15,00:11:17,How did they miss that?
00:11:17,00:11:18,I don't know.
00:11:18,00:11:19,That's very funny.
00:11:19,00:11:20,Yeah.
00:11:20,00:11:22,"It's how long, because I vaguely remember that,"
00:11:22,00:11:24,but I'd forgotten that it was medical drugs
00:11:24,00:11:25,and not illegal drugs.
00:11:25,00:11:27,And your mind does go to illegal drugs.
00:11:27,00:11:29,"So I was like, what kind of weird prude is there"
00:11:29,00:11:30,in the drug dealing community?
00:11:30,00:11:33,You say that you're not allowed to be flogging heroin
00:11:33,00:11:35,"if it's called, you know, penis ganj or whatever."
00:11:35,00:11:36,Bump cocaine.
00:11:36,00:11:37,Yeah.
00:11:37,00:11:38,"No, it's not that."
00:11:38,00:11:39,"No, no, no, no."
00:11:39,00:11:41,"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
00:11:41,00:11:42,Penis ganj.
00:11:42,00:11:43,Penis ganj.
00:11:43,00:11:45,I don't know where my head was going there.
00:11:45,00:11:46,I like it.
00:11:46,00:11:47,Yeah.
00:11:47,00:11:48,I like it.
00:11:48,00:11:50,I think that because I know a lot of our listeners
00:11:50,00:11:53,on Drop As A Line are street hoodlums
00:11:53,00:11:55,who are creating new drugs.
00:11:55,00:11:57,"And so I reckon that could be,"
00:11:57,00:11:59,that could be the new slang.
00:11:59,00:12:00,Get it on the list.
00:12:00,00:12:01,Yeah.
00:12:01,00:12:04,"Sam post fixes his email by saying,"
00:12:04,00:12:06,"""By the way, while patients often do talk"
00:12:06,00:12:08,"a lot of nonsense as they're going to sleep,"
00:12:08,00:12:10,"I've never told anyone to shut up,"""
00:12:10,00:12:12,"or said, ""I've shagged your mum,"""
00:12:12,00:12:15,as was suggested on another episode by Anna.
00:12:15,00:12:17,I don't remember that.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"Yeah, I'm surprised I say that sort of thing out loud."
00:12:19,00:12:20,Whoops.
00:12:20,00:12:22,"Well, I bet he has done it, though."
00:12:22,00:12:24,It's just the person wouldn't remember.
00:12:24,00:12:26,Superb.
00:12:26,00:12:29,"Mystery email, mystery source."
00:12:29,00:12:30,It's good.
00:12:30,00:12:31,It's an anonymous one.
00:12:31,00:12:33,It's someone who needs to protect their identity.
00:12:33,00:12:34,"Oh, sorry."
00:12:34,00:12:35,"I thought you meant like, you know,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,brown and barbecue crossed or whatever.
00:12:37,00:12:38,No.
00:12:38,00:12:40,"That's-- Anna, hold that thought."
00:12:40,00:12:41,Oh.
00:12:41,00:12:42,"I'm a few episodes behind,"
00:12:42,00:12:44,but I caught your conversation regarding barcodes.
00:12:44,00:12:46,I work at Heinz.
00:12:46,00:12:50,And a nerdy fact is that we try to buy barcodes
00:12:50,00:12:52,"that have 57 in them,"
00:12:52,00:12:54,because Heinz has 57 varieties.
00:12:54,00:12:56,You can buy a barcode?
00:12:56,00:12:57,I know.
00:12:57,00:12:58,That's amazing.
00:12:58,00:12:59,It's got tricky due to the number of our products
00:12:59,00:13:00,"and barcodes available,"
00:13:00,00:13:02,but on the core products we try for a 57.
00:13:02,00:13:03,And it's like a long string of numbers.
00:13:03,00:13:04,There's just a 57 somewhere in there.
00:13:04,00:13:06,That's amazing.
00:13:06,00:13:07,"So, does this mean if we--"
00:13:07,00:13:11,Can we check a barcode on our Heinz products or not?
00:13:11,00:13:12,Yeah.
00:13:12,00:13:13,And it should have 57 in it.
00:13:13,00:13:14,Yeah.
00:13:14,00:13:15,Yeah.
00:13:15,00:13:16,Let's see if I got some beans in the house.
00:13:16,00:13:17,I'm going to do that.
00:13:17,00:13:18,Okay.
00:13:18,00:13:22,I'll just fill time while these guys are off rifling.
00:13:22,00:13:24,They're bin cupboards.
00:13:24,00:13:26,They're bean cupboards.
00:13:26,00:13:27,They've gone.
00:13:27,00:13:32,"So, it's just me and you."
00:13:32,00:13:35,I've always felt underappreciated on this podcast.
00:13:35,00:13:36,"Oh, they're back."
00:13:36,00:13:38,I'll wait for Anna to come back.
00:13:38,00:13:39,Hey.
00:13:39,00:13:40,"Oh, great."
00:13:40,00:13:41,I'm really excited to find out what you've got.
00:13:41,00:13:44,Anna keeps her beans at the end of the garden.
00:13:44,00:13:46,Because she's suspicious of them.
00:13:46,00:13:49,"They're magic beans, aren't they?"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"It's so excited, Anna."
00:13:51,00:13:52,Well.
00:13:52,00:13:53,Anna.
00:13:53,00:13:54,"Anna, are you excited?"
00:13:54,00:13:55,I'm so excited.
00:13:55,00:13:56,Yeah.
00:13:56,00:13:57,Okay.
00:13:57,00:13:58,Let's hear what you've got.
00:13:58,00:13:59,Okay.
00:13:59,00:14:00,"Well, I've got--"
00:14:00,00:14:01,"First of all, I've got some Heinz vegetable soup."
00:14:01,00:14:03,And I'm having a look at the barcode here.
00:14:03,00:14:05,There is indeed a 57 right there.
00:14:05,00:14:06,Wow.
00:14:06,00:14:07,Bang in the middle.
00:14:07,00:14:08,Wow.
00:14:08,00:14:09,"Okay, so that's a core product."
00:14:09,00:14:10,Okay.
00:14:10,00:14:11,Mushroom soup.
00:14:11,00:14:12,"Same, same."
00:14:12,00:14:13,57.
00:14:13,00:14:14,Okay.
00:14:14,00:14:15,"James, what you got?"
00:14:15,00:14:17,"Well, I've got the core product."
00:14:17,00:14:18,Proper thinner beans.
00:14:18,00:14:19,He's got the beans.
00:14:19,00:14:20,Lovely.
00:14:20,00:14:21,He's got the beans.
00:14:21,00:14:22,And sure enough.
00:14:22,00:14:24,"Triple zero, one, five, seven."
00:14:24,00:14:25,Amazing.
00:14:25,00:14:26,Amazing.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"And just as a quick fourth piece of evidence,"
00:14:28,00:14:30,"Heinz ketchup, the second core product."
00:14:30,00:14:32,"57 there, right at the end."
00:14:32,00:14:33,Incredible.
00:14:33,00:14:34,That's so cool.
00:14:34,00:14:35,There you go.
00:14:35,00:14:36,That is really cool.
00:14:36,00:14:37,It's the best bit of trivia I've ever heard.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"And our correspondent says, ""If you discuss,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,"please do not use my name."""
00:14:41,00:14:42,Why?
00:14:42,00:14:43,You should be proud.
00:14:43,00:14:45,"Anyway, thank you, Mr.--"
00:14:45,00:14:47,Do you see why I said mystery sauce at the start?
00:14:47,00:14:48,Yeah.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Great stuff.
00:14:49,00:14:51,"Oh, yeah, I see."
00:14:51,00:14:53,Email here from Blaise Petrucci.
00:14:53,00:14:54,"Mm-hmm, brilliant."
00:14:54,00:14:55,Nice.
00:14:55,00:14:56,You don't get enough blazes around.
00:14:56,00:14:58,We said on the podcast recently.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"Well, did we?"
00:15:00,00:15:01,We said--
00:15:01,00:15:04,"Email, subject line, Blaise Pascal was not boring, Anna."
00:15:04,00:15:08,"Oh, gosh, I've been saying a lot of things, haven't I lately?"
00:15:08,00:15:09,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:09,00:15:10,Can't keep my mouth shut.
00:15:10,00:15:11,Yeah.
00:15:11,00:15:14,"Blaise writes, ""My late father was an Italian mathematician"
00:15:14,00:15:16,who was obsessed with Blaise Pascal.
00:15:16,00:15:18,"So much so, he named his son Blaise."
00:15:18,00:15:19,Me.
00:15:19,00:15:23,"Growing up, I hated my name and I hated maths."""
00:15:23,00:15:24,Aw.
00:15:24,00:15:29,"Oh, you would have hated our 57 bit that we've just done."
00:15:29,00:15:32,But my old man was persistent and eventually a love of maths
00:15:32,00:15:34,and of Monsieur Pascal developed in my little brain.
00:15:34,00:15:38,So imagine my sadness when I heard Anna Tijinski describe my namesake as boring.
00:15:38,00:15:41,"Blaise Pascal was a true polymath to rival the likes of Da Vinci and Franklin,"
00:15:41,00:15:45,"and I think his influence is far-reaching and eternal, just like no such thing as a fish."
00:15:45,00:15:48,I think you can be a polymath and have a far-reaching and eternal influence
00:15:48,00:15:51,whilst also being as dull as dishwater.
00:15:51,00:15:55,Like no such thing as a fish.
00:15:55,00:15:56,OK.
00:15:56,00:15:57,So there you go.
00:15:57,00:16:00,"Lovely, lovely to hear from you Blaise."
00:16:00,00:16:01,Apologies.
00:16:01,00:16:02,But I stand by everything I said.
00:16:02,00:16:03,"Yeah, that's good."
00:16:03,00:16:04,I think that's good.
00:16:04,00:16:07,I think it's nice to apologise but defy.
00:16:07,00:16:10,It would be weird if you just caved.
00:16:10,00:16:11,Thank you.
00:16:11,00:16:12,OK.
00:16:12,00:16:15,"Oh, Meredith writes,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,"""We did synchronised swimming recently on the podcast."""
00:16:18,00:16:19,We should.
00:16:19,00:16:20,Sure did.
00:16:20,00:16:23,Meredith sends some notes from someone who was a synchronised swimmer for five years.
00:16:23,00:16:24,Cool.
00:16:24,00:16:27,He was not nearly good enough at it to continue in college.
00:16:27,00:16:30,So that's Meredith's level.
00:16:30,00:16:34,"I feel that Synchro was given appropriate respect in this episode,"
00:16:34,00:16:37,which is a redemption from earlier podcast mentions.
00:16:37,00:16:38,Excellent job.
00:16:38,00:16:39,No.
00:16:39,00:16:42,I can't remember what we said.
00:16:42,00:16:45,"""We used to have to do laps of unders,"
00:16:45,00:16:49,swim underwater for 50 to 75 metres without a breath.
00:16:49,00:16:50,"Bad."""
00:16:50,00:16:52,"Yeah, that's too far."
00:16:52,00:16:54,"""In crazy training routines and techniques,"
00:16:54,00:16:58,"you do your entire routine with ankle weights on to improve your skull."""
00:16:58,00:17:01,Which is the thing where you stay upside down.
00:17:01,00:17:04,The weird stay upside down thing.
00:17:04,00:17:06,She also says one thing about injuries.
00:17:06,00:17:10,She has a lot of scarring from people who didn't cut their toenails
00:17:10,00:17:12,and went swimming with her.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"In water polo, they have a designated person who comes through"
00:17:14,00:17:17,and checks all our nails to make sure they're regulation.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Cool.
00:17:18,00:17:20,I wonder how many sports or pursuits there are
00:17:20,00:17:22,"that require a certain nail length,"
00:17:22,00:17:24,because that reminds me of playing the piano.
00:17:24,00:17:26,My teacher always used to get really pissed off
00:17:26,00:17:28,if I hadn't cut my nails.
00:17:28,00:17:30,It's the same truth of guitar.
00:17:30,00:17:32,"Is it bad if you have long nails, James?"
00:17:32,00:17:33,Yeah.
00:17:33,00:17:36,"Although for banjo, you wear fake nails."
00:17:36,00:17:40,Like you have like plastic picks that you wear on your fingers.
00:17:40,00:17:44,I thought you needed one hand with long nails to do the picking.
00:17:44,00:17:48,"In sport, I'm not so sure."
00:17:48,00:17:51,The thing is there are rules about how long your nails can be
00:17:51,00:17:55,"in beach volleyball because people point adverts on them, I think."
00:17:55,00:17:56,Really?
00:17:56,00:18:00,So you had to have them so short that you couldn't fit a full-sized ad?
00:18:00,00:18:03,Or you got paid more for longer nails?
00:18:03,00:18:06,I think they weren't allowed to be the size of a billboard.
00:18:06,00:18:07,That's fair.
00:18:07,00:18:08,I can't remember.
00:18:08,00:18:09,"Actually, I can't remember."
00:18:09,00:18:11,I'm half remembering that idea.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"Sorry, I just cut my nails."
00:18:13,00:18:18,Can you do the bottom half of the Coke bottle in this one?
00:18:18,00:18:20,That's great.
00:18:20,00:18:21,Here's another.
00:18:21,00:18:23,Here's Mike Abdullah.
00:18:23,00:18:25,This is a bollocking for me.
00:18:25,00:18:26,I know.
00:18:26,00:18:27,What's that called again?
00:18:27,00:18:29,Is it called Get Yourself Off The Hook?
00:18:29,00:18:33,Or is it just called The Abuse Section?
00:18:33,00:18:35,I'm not sure.
00:18:35,00:18:38,"Well, we've got Um, actually, which is a factual correction."
00:18:38,00:18:42,"We've got Spicy Meat, which is our behind-the-scenes stuff."
00:18:42,00:18:44,We've got Old Fish.
00:18:44,00:18:46,Thanks for no thanks.
00:18:46,00:18:48,We've got Riddle Roundabout.
00:18:48,00:18:51,What about a right pollocking?
00:18:51,00:18:52,That's good.
00:18:52,00:18:53,That's brilliant.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Yeah.
00:18:54,00:18:55,"Yeah, pollocking."
00:18:55,00:18:56,Brilliant.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"Mike Abdullah writes, this is for me."
00:18:59,00:19:03,"After you confidently declared on last week's show that, quotes,"
00:19:03,00:19:06,"""There's nobody alive in the world who puts the milk in the mug"
00:19:06,00:19:09,"and puts the bag in the milk."""
00:19:09,00:19:11,I am writing to disprove this.
00:19:11,00:19:14,I frequently make tea this way.
00:19:14,00:19:17,I wonder how many other emails you will get.
00:19:17,00:19:20,"I started doing it after listening to an episode of Rutherford & Fry,"
00:19:20,00:19:24,"the mass show with a friend of fish, Hannah Fry."
00:19:24,00:19:27,"And apparently, when milk is added to very hot tea,"
00:19:27,00:19:28,it will start to separate.
00:19:28,00:19:30,"Whereas if hot tea is added to milk,"
00:19:30,00:19:32,the temperature rises more gradually and the milk sticks together better.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"Something like that, who knows."
00:19:34,00:19:37,And he's been happy with the result ever since.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"Did he find, I would like to know,"
00:19:39,00:19:42,"that in the past, his milk was just getting all globulous and busy"
00:19:42,00:19:45,"when he put it in after tea, because I have to say it."
00:19:45,00:19:47,"Globulous, it forms a separate layer at the top of the cup, Hannah."
00:19:47,00:19:48,You must know that.
00:19:48,00:19:50,You drink through the milk and then you just drink the tea.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"Sounds like bollocks, though, basically."
00:19:52,00:19:53,Hannah Fry is the one I was talking about.
00:19:53,00:19:58,"Hey, phone number for Heinz, 0800 528 5757."
00:19:58,00:19:59,Fantastic.
00:19:59,00:20:00,Yay.
00:20:00,00:20:01,How are you?
00:20:01,00:20:02,Are they calling you?
00:20:02,00:20:04,"Yes, that's them."
00:20:04,00:20:06,"No, it's on the tin of beans."
00:20:06,00:20:12,"Unless you're in the Republic of Ireland, in which case it's 1 800 995 311."
00:20:12,00:20:17,So obviously the Republic of Ireland telephone companies refuse to bend over backwards.
00:20:17,00:20:18,They stitched up.
00:20:18,00:20:20,They won't bow to Big Bean.
00:20:20,00:20:22,Good on them.
00:20:22,00:20:24,That's very funny.
00:20:24,00:20:26,"OK, here's a great one."
00:20:26,00:20:28,Erin Thomas.
00:20:28,00:20:30,Canadian here.
00:20:30,00:20:32,I'm listening to your August 29th show.
00:20:32,00:20:35,And while I agree that slang will make you sound like another country.
00:20:35,00:20:36,I don't understand that.
00:20:36,00:20:38,Canada is a vast country.
00:20:38,00:20:44,"In some parts of Canada, they may say a boot, but I've lived in the prairies all my life and no one here says a boot."
00:20:44,00:20:46,"In fact, I've never heard anyone say that."
00:20:46,00:20:52,"My English husband, born in England and moved to Canada in his 40s, tells me he's never heard anyone here say a boot."
00:20:52,00:21:01,"Well, if he wants to hear people say a boot, he should listen to lazy Canadian stereotypes because I had that all the time."
00:21:01,00:21:02,"So sorry, Erin."
00:21:02,00:21:04,Sorry to the people of the Canadian prairies as well.
00:21:04,00:21:05,Yeah.
00:21:05,00:21:08,I think it might be one of those things that you can't hear it if you're that close to it.
00:21:08,00:21:11,"You know, like everyone thinks they don't have an accent."
00:21:11,00:21:12,"No, I do."
00:21:12,00:21:13,Because they can't hear their own accent.
00:21:13,00:21:14,I've got an accent.
00:21:14,00:21:17,"Well, of course, you've got a thick Jordy accent, but you're a bit of a villain."
00:21:17,00:21:22,"No, I know what you mean. That's a fair point."
00:21:22,00:21:25,"Oh my God, here's a great one."
00:21:25,00:21:27,Elizabeth Ruth Ross Ward.
00:21:27,00:21:29,Get this.
00:21:31,00:21:33,Email subject line.
00:21:33,00:21:35,We're getting married because of fish.
00:21:35,00:21:37,We've sparked a wedding.
00:21:37,00:21:41,Brilliant. I hope she doesn't double barrel with someone with an equally long name.
00:21:41,00:21:43,Good point.
00:21:43,00:21:45,She doesn't say her partner's surname.
00:21:45,00:21:46,But listen to this.
00:21:46,00:21:49,We actually have you to thank for our upcoming wedding.
00:21:49,00:21:53,"Six years ago, my partner Andrew saw me across a pool table at a bar and tried to chat with me."
00:21:53,00:21:59,"I wasn't having any of it, assuming he was another random at a bar that will be a bit boring/disappointing."
00:21:59,00:22:02,Then he mentioned his favourite podcast was no such thing as a fish.
00:22:02,00:22:05,And my ears perked right up. It was my favourite too.
00:22:05,00:22:08,We started properly talking and we haven't shut up since.
00:22:08,00:22:10,We're getting married in 2026.
00:22:10,00:22:13,We just wanted to say a huge thank you for bringing us together.
00:22:13,00:22:15,"Guys, that's so exciting."
00:22:15,00:22:17,I'm so exciting.
00:22:17,00:22:19,How are we going to do the wedding theming?
00:22:19,00:22:20,Are we going to...
00:22:20,00:22:21,"Sorry, what?"
00:22:21,00:22:23,They're not inviting us to be part of it.
00:22:23,00:22:25,"I'm sure we're going to be invited to be part of it, Anna."
00:22:25,00:22:27,I'm just wondering how we can make the day more fish related.
00:22:27,00:22:31,"Well, all the tables will have to be named after characters from No Such Things as Fish."
00:22:31,00:22:32,Brilliant.
00:22:32,00:22:34,And where our dick be table.
00:22:34,00:22:38,Or the lady who had an anal prolapse.
00:22:38,00:22:40,Just call that anal prolapse.
00:22:40,00:22:43,I think just call that Oxrectum table.
00:22:43,00:22:50,Who was the woman I used to love who used to spend her time making sure women didn't put mad stuff up their vaginas?
00:22:50,00:22:52,"Oh, Jen Gunter."
00:22:52,00:22:54,"Yeah, there's got to be a Jen Gunter table."
00:22:54,00:22:56,"Yeah, the Gunter zone, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:56,00:22:58,For all the goop ladies.
00:22:58,00:23:00,"And when they say, you know, does anyone know any reason why?"
00:23:00,00:23:05,"And Jen Gunter will pop up saying, why you shouldn't put the rings up your fanny?"
00:23:05,00:23:06,Don't do that.
00:23:06,00:23:07,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:07,00:23:12,"If anyone has any reason that this shouldn't happen, shout, stop the wedding."
00:23:12,00:23:13,Yes.
00:23:13,00:23:15,That's actually a good idea.
00:23:15,00:23:17,"You should incorporate that, guys."
00:23:17,00:23:19,That's a really fun idea.
00:23:19,00:23:24,"Do save a date, send a save the date soon, because obviously our schedule will get quite booked up, didn't they?"
00:23:24,00:23:25,Absolutely.
00:23:25,00:23:26,Yeah.
00:23:26,00:23:29,"But how, that's the best news I've had all month."
00:23:29,00:23:30,"I know, it's really nice."
00:23:30,00:23:31,What an amazing moment.
00:23:31,00:23:32,Yeah.
00:23:32,00:23:37,"Also, what an amazing way to meet, just meeting across a pool table and starting to chat and realizing you like the same podcast."
00:23:37,00:23:38,I think that's just a good one.
00:23:38,00:23:41,"Quite annoying for the people who were playing pool at the time, though, I imagine."
00:23:41,00:23:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:42,00:23:45,What are these pair of nerds doing near a pool table anyway?
00:23:45,00:23:48,"Yeah, famously a jock sport pool, isn't it?"
00:23:48,00:23:52,It's definitely not a thing of benefits from ours of lonely practice by yourself.
00:23:52,00:23:55,"Yeah, fair enough."
00:23:55,00:23:57,Here we go.
00:23:57,00:24:01,Here is another thanks but no thanks from Tim Groves.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"Stop the podcast, he says."
00:24:03,00:24:04,Very good.
00:24:04,00:24:07,I have an idea for a thanks but no thanks segment and drop us a line.
00:24:07,00:24:10,I'm a long-time listener and have recently become a card-carrying member of Club Fish.
00:24:10,00:24:12,"Congratulations, Tim."
00:24:12,00:24:16,"I'm very much enjoying the bonus material, but it suddenly struck me the other day that something is missing."
00:24:16,00:24:18,The adverts.
00:24:18,00:24:25,"I know avoiding ads is part of my membership fee, but there was something lovely about the four of you recording charming little snippets for your sponsors."
00:24:25,00:24:30,Who could forget the time Dan left a Harry's advert desperate for more razors because his beard was growing so fast?
00:24:30,00:24:35,"Or Anna, quickly distancing herself from sharing a single mattress with Dan during a Lisa's sleep advert?"
00:24:35,00:24:45,"I'm curious about what we Club Fishers may be missing, so perhaps it would be nice if you put out a little compilation so we know exactly what type of VPN razor or mattress is currently preferred by the QILs."
00:24:45,00:24:50,"That's so interesting that you say that because, and I'm basically saying this to cover our legal asses."
00:24:50,00:24:52,Because what's this person called?
00:24:52,00:24:53,Tim.
00:24:53,00:24:54,"Tim, don't want him suing us."
00:24:54,00:24:59,"When we first started the bonus material, we did say, didn't we, we should release a string of just the adverts."
00:24:59,00:25:02,"And I still think when we get a chance, we should do that."
00:25:02,00:25:06,Or maybe some fake adverts for stuff that we would advertise.
00:25:06,00:25:12,Or maybe like we just sneakily put adverts in the droppers a line for baked beans or something like that.
00:25:12,00:25:17,You've blown this can wide open.
00:25:17,00:25:22,"Yeah, it would require us to put a lot more effort into the adverts again."
00:25:22,00:25:28,"Exactly. You haven't heard the original versions now, mate, but they are, they're crap, aren't they?"
00:25:28,00:25:32,"The adverts we do these days, they're so phoned in trying to drive people to pay."
00:25:32,00:25:36,"Since all you guys left Club Fish, we were like, well, that's all the important people have gone now."
00:25:36,00:25:39,"They've all gone to Club Fish, so we might as well start phoning them in."
00:25:39,00:25:43,"It's a monotone, read it straight from the sheet, take the jokes out."
00:25:43,00:25:49,Often we will pretend that it's a pre-recorded advert made by an actual company and dropped in.
00:25:49,00:25:51,It's actually us doing all the voices in those.
00:25:51,00:25:54,We try and make it indistinguishable from a pre-recorded radio advert.
00:25:54,00:25:57,That takes a lot of work. We're putting all the effort into that.
00:25:57,00:25:58,Why do they do it?
00:25:58,00:26:00,"I don't know, I don't know."
00:26:00,00:26:04,"Alexa Tonner writes, I am a recent fan of the podcast, welcome."
00:26:04,00:26:07,And I especially appreciate just how prolific you all are.
00:26:07,00:26:13,I've listened to dozens of episodes at this point and yet I find myself unable to remember most of the facts once the episode is over.
00:26:13,00:26:18,"The ones I do seem to retain are about World Wars One and Two, a topic that does not interest me at all."
00:26:18,00:26:23,I'm so sorry.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"That's good, isn't it?"
00:26:24,00:26:25,That's very funny.
00:26:25,00:26:27,"You're welcome, Alexa."
00:26:27,00:26:30,Tough. They're not going to stop.
00:26:30,00:26:31,No.
00:26:31,00:26:39,"Now, we've had a couple of emails from David Bergaman and I just wanted to share both of them with you."
00:26:39,00:26:41,"It's very, very rare for someone to get both."
00:26:41,00:26:44,And it's not because his name is David Bergaman.
00:26:44,00:26:48,"Okay, here's the first one."
00:26:48,00:26:52,"Having listened to the main show for a long time and been through lots of the bonus content,"
00:26:52,00:26:54,"I'm a new ClubVish member, welcome, David."
00:26:54,00:26:57,I've gleaned quite a bit about what you all do in the fish industry.
00:26:57,00:27:00,Dan is the host of the main show as well as plenty of other podcasts and projects.
00:27:00,00:27:03,James edits the show and is also everyone's boss's head elf.
00:27:03,00:27:07,Andy is in charge of Drop as a Line and seems to run of a lot of the other ClubVish episodes.
00:27:07,00:27:10,"Even other elves in the office will edit compilations or guest on the show,"
00:27:10,00:27:12,which leads me to my big question.
00:27:12,00:27:14,What does Anna do?
00:27:14,00:27:18,"Really looking forward to finding out the answer, David Bergaman."
00:27:18,00:27:20,"Listen, David."
00:27:20,00:27:24,"Andy, you've got to come up with better names if you're going to do an intervention."
00:27:27,00:27:31,Sometimes it's very hard to quantify what someone brings to the table
00:27:31,00:27:35,and to write it down on paper or indeed explain it in words.
00:27:35,00:27:38,"But yet, you know, they are the essential ingredient."
00:27:38,00:27:42,"Don't put this out because if the boss is here, then I'm fired."
00:27:42,00:27:46,"Hey, I thought David Bergaman said that I'm the boss."
00:27:46,00:27:49,"Oh yes, everyone's boss has had elf, very dubious."
00:27:49,00:27:52,"I mean, James, this is clearly, this is, I did not write this."
00:27:52,00:27:54,I would not.
00:27:54,00:27:57,"Point taken, I'll make the tea next time I'm in."
00:27:57,00:27:59,How will you make it?
00:27:59,00:28:01,What will you pour on first?
00:28:01,00:28:03,Great question.
00:28:03,00:28:06,I pour the milk onto the counter and then I pour the tea onto that.
00:28:06,00:28:09,But then I sweep it all into the mug with a little broom.
00:28:09,00:28:11,That's how I do it.
00:28:11,00:28:13,How would it work?
00:28:13,00:28:17,Is it possible to put the milk in first and then the water?
00:28:17,00:28:20,"So you've got very hot, milky water."
00:28:20,00:28:22,And then the bag.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"Shit, why does no one do that?"
00:28:24,00:28:28,"Anyway, look, we've got to get on to Bergaman 2, the burgering."
00:28:28,00:28:30,Second email from Bergaman.
00:28:30,00:28:32,Does that answer your question?
00:28:32,00:28:34,"Did you say what you do, Anna? You do lots of stuff."
00:28:34,00:28:36,You always work very hard.
00:28:36,00:28:38,I'm about to make the tea.
00:28:38,00:28:40,It's coming up.
00:28:40,00:28:43,Who is this burger? Who do you think he is? Or is she?
00:28:43,00:28:45,Giving them the air of two emails. It's bullshit.
00:28:45,00:28:49,"I think he's related to Ingmar Bergaman, the very famous."
00:28:49,00:28:53,"I noticed, Anna, you haven't actually answered the question."
00:28:53,00:28:57,You're constantly telling us how busy you are.
00:28:57,00:28:59,So there must be something that you're doing.
00:28:59,00:29:01,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:01,00:29:03,"What is it, Anna?"
00:29:03,00:29:07,Anna works very hard on the TV series as one of James's underlings.
00:29:07,00:29:09,"But nonetheless, she's a key part of the team."
00:29:09,00:29:12,"I tried the shoelaces on QI, yeah."
00:29:12,00:29:14,Together.
00:29:14,00:29:16,Yeah.
00:29:16,00:29:18,"No, I don't do anything."
00:29:18,00:29:20,"Anna is a core part of the team, David."
00:29:20,00:29:22,"If you come for her, you come for all of us."
00:29:22,00:29:24,"David, second email."
00:29:24,00:29:28,I know there has been a lot of upset about Dan being accused of being a wife guy.
00:29:28,00:29:32,I think I may have some upsetting proof of his identity as such.
00:29:32,00:29:34,"It's exciting, isn't it?"
00:29:34,00:29:38,"In the very first Clubfish compilation, August 2022,"
00:29:38,00:29:42,James brought out a phrenology head detailing what the different bumps on your head mean.
00:29:42,00:29:47,"James then invited you all to find the biggest bump to compare it to the phrenology head,"
00:29:47,00:29:51,and Dan found that his biggest bump was in the marriage section.
00:29:51,00:29:56,This is obviously because he is such a wife guy that even pseudoscience can tell.
00:29:56,00:30:00,"Oh, so that was before the whole wife guy joke."
00:30:00,00:30:03,"Exactly, that was pre-that. Isn't that amazing?"
00:30:03,00:30:07,"Do you think pseudoscience maybe does work, but it only works on people who are into pseudoscience?"
00:30:07,00:30:09,That's quite good.
00:30:09,00:30:11,I think that's true.
00:30:11,00:30:13,"That's it, isn't it?"
00:30:13,00:30:18,"Sophie Watson writes, ""Did you know air fryers have been around since 1472?"""
00:30:18,00:30:20,Catchy.
00:30:20,00:30:21,This is brilliant.
00:30:21,00:30:24,"I've told James this in advance, Hannah. You're the only one who's learning this new intel."
00:30:24,00:30:26,It's stunning. It's absolutely stunning.
00:30:26,00:30:30,Do I need to know exactly what an air fryer is before you explain this?
00:30:30,00:30:34,"It's a cooking device, isn't it, where you cook things dry."
00:30:34,00:30:37,"Oh, it's some kind of magic box. I don't know. I haven't got one."
00:30:37,00:30:40,"Yeah, it's like a small oven that sits on the counter. Nobody knows."
00:30:40,00:30:42,"Look, can we get to Sophie's email?"
00:30:42,00:30:44,Air fryers have been around since 1472.
00:30:44,00:30:45,Cool.
00:30:45,00:30:53,"This fact works spoken aloud, but not so much written down as I am actually talking about air, AYR, the Scottish town."
00:30:53,00:30:56,"Friars, as in priests."
00:30:56,00:31:01,Here is a link to some info about the Franciscan monastery in air.
00:31:01,00:31:03,Isn't that good?
00:31:03,00:31:05,I love it. I just think that's so funny.
00:31:05,00:31:06,Beautiful.
00:31:06,00:31:09,"She says, ""I had been listening to the podcast and was cooking a cheese toasty for my lunch."""
00:31:09,00:31:11,And that's how she came up with it.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"Thank you so much, Sophie."
00:31:13,00:31:15,"Perfect. This is my kind of fact as well, isn't it?"
00:31:15,00:31:20,She's come up with a joke and then she's done the googling to see if it's true or not.
00:31:20,00:31:24,It's just correct. It's so good.
00:31:24,00:31:26,"Yeah, very strong."
00:31:26,00:31:29,"I actually feel like we should use that for the show, to be honest."
00:31:29,00:31:30,"Oh, should we?"
00:31:30,00:31:31,"Air fryers, maybe."
00:31:31,00:31:34,We've never had a fact promoted from Drop As A Line to the main show.
00:31:34,00:31:36,Do you think it would matter that people had heard it before?
00:31:36,00:31:38,Would we have to cut it out of this?
00:31:38,00:31:43,Or could that be a cool extra in-joke for the Drop As A Line clubfish crew?
00:31:43,00:31:46,They could be sat there waiting for it to come up on the show one day.
00:31:46,00:31:49,"Yeah, I think let's do that."
00:31:49,00:31:51,"Okay, so we might use it on the show one day. We might not."
00:31:51,00:31:53,There's an incentive to keep listening.
00:31:53,00:31:56,Absolutely. We need to find them at this point.
00:31:56,00:31:59,"Oh, here's a boff fin. Do you remember that?"
00:31:59,00:32:05,The experts who write in with their knowledge.
00:32:05,00:32:07,What's triple F?
00:32:07,00:32:08,"Four Fs, I think."
00:32:08,00:32:10,"Four Fs, sorry. Yes, you're actually right."
00:32:10,00:32:14,"In episode 552, you discussed the Nile crocodiles burrows being the longest in the animal kingdom."
00:32:14,00:32:19,"However, there is a reason I'm reading out this particular correction as well."
00:32:19,00:32:23,"In South America, 10,000 years ago, there were much larger ones dug by giant sloths."
00:32:23,00:32:25,Which I think is fair. We have mentioned that.
00:32:25,00:32:28,"But right now, I think crocodiles might dig the deepest."
00:32:28,00:32:33,"Also, while mentioning paleo burrows, I must also mention daemon elixies."
00:32:33,00:32:36,Corkscrew shaped burrows created by beavers in North America.
00:32:36,00:32:40,"Enjoy entering this rabbit hole, Sam. Very funny."
00:32:40,00:32:46,"Sam is a technician in Earth Sciences, who works at a place called Megaforna Central."
00:32:46,00:32:48,"Oh, cool. Amazing."
00:32:48,00:32:51,In Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia. How cool is that?
00:32:51,00:32:53,Megaforna Central.
00:32:53,00:32:55,"I know, it's pretty cool, isn't it?"
00:32:55,00:32:59,"It sounds like an alternative name for Jurassic Park, basically, doesn't it?"
00:32:59,00:33:03,It sounds like you go there and there's giant animals wandering around.
00:33:03,00:33:04,Yeah.
00:33:04,00:33:09,"Do you remember, Andy, you had a question once on QI about how big Megaforna has to be."
00:33:09,00:33:15,"And actually, there are some Megafornas that are smaller than a cat or something."
00:33:15,00:33:18,I think Megaforna means visible to the naked eye.
00:33:18,00:33:20,It's such bollocks.
00:33:20,00:33:22,And ant is a Megaforna.
00:33:22,00:33:28,It's just another example of science ruining normal language for the rest of us.
00:33:28,00:33:32,Whereas Megaforna should clearly be a bear or bigger.
00:33:32,00:33:35,"Oh, you've made me angry about that all over again now."
00:33:35,00:33:38,"That's funny, because I reckon that was like 15 years ago."
00:33:38,00:33:40,"Yeah, it was."
00:33:40,00:33:47,This is just a funny story from Cameron McInnes.
00:33:47,00:33:53,We did a hiccup cures about how you cure a hiccup with a finger in your bottom.
00:33:53,00:33:55,"Sounds like us, yeah."
00:33:55,00:33:59,"It's in personal anecdote from Cameron, which he's been telling for some years now."
00:33:59,00:34:01,But it's not podcast appropriate.
00:34:01,00:34:03,"Oh, is it dual appropriate?"
00:34:03,00:34:04,I think it might be.
00:34:04,00:34:09,"It's about a headmaster called Rick, and apparently was really a bad headmaster,"
00:34:09,00:34:13,"was really incompetent and arrogant and, you know,"
00:34:13,00:34:16,talked about himself in third person assemblies.
00:34:16,00:34:19,"Okay, so it's a bit like bad headmaster of a school, basically."
00:34:19,00:34:23,"Our school was having a cross country race, annual cross country race."
00:34:23,00:34:26,"All the parents were lined up where the finish line was, right?"
00:34:26,00:34:30,"My friend has a rescue dog called Calua, who gets a bit skittish."
00:34:30,00:34:33,And there was another dog there making Calua agitated.
00:34:33,00:34:35,My friend went to go and put him in the car.
00:34:35,00:34:38,"Basically, the dog's got in a scrap."
00:34:38,00:34:41,Calua bit this dog on the ear and got locked jord.
00:34:41,00:34:43,"Oh, no."
00:34:43,00:34:45,Enter the other dog's howling.
00:34:45,00:34:48,The parents come to see what's going on.
00:34:48,00:34:51,"Enter Rick the Dick, which is apparently this headmaster's name,"
00:34:51,00:34:53,"who sees what's going on and declares,"
00:34:53,00:34:56,"""You have to stick your finger up his bum to make him let go."
00:34:56,00:34:58,"I've done it before out of my way."""
00:34:58,00:35:00,"Okay, which is true."
00:35:00,00:35:02,"That is true, isn't it?"
00:35:02,00:35:05,"Then in front of quite a large crowd,"
00:35:05,00:35:09,"quickly sucks his finger, grabs the dog and sticks his finger straight up its arse."
00:35:09,00:35:11,- Do it in that order. - Absolutely.
00:35:11,00:35:14,"There's a second or two in shock silence before someone says,"
00:35:14,00:35:17,"""Rick, that's the wrong dog."""
00:35:17,00:35:25,"Rick quickly removes his finger from the other dog, grabs Calua,"
00:35:25,00:35:28,and sticks his fingers up his arse.
00:35:28,00:35:30,Then Calua doesn't let go.
00:35:30,00:35:32,"The three of them are scuffling around in a circle,"
00:35:32,00:35:34,trying to get away from each other until one of the other parents
00:35:34,00:35:37,throws a bottle of water on Calua and he lets go.
00:35:37,00:35:42,His poor other dog has now got a jaw in the ear and a finger up the arse
00:35:42,00:35:45,and still no one's helping him out.
00:35:45,00:35:49,"His name has apparently now been changed to ""Wrong Dog, Rick."""
00:35:49,00:35:53,Thanks for the podcast.
00:35:53,00:35:56,"- What a great story. - Thanks, Cameron."
00:35:56,00:35:59,"Great story. He says, ""I've sent this also to Chris and Rosie Ramsey."""
00:35:59,00:36:01,- What? - What?
00:36:01,00:36:02,Come on.
00:36:02,00:36:05,"But I figure the more I spread it, the more likely it is to filter back to him."
00:36:05,00:36:08,"Chris and Rosie Ramsey have high standards, though, right?"
00:36:08,00:36:10,They probably won't beat it up.
00:36:10,00:36:14,They certainly won't have it as their sort of climactic little anecdote.
00:36:14,00:36:17,Absolutely not. No way.
00:36:17,00:36:20,"So thanks, Cameron. Thanks to all of you for listening to this and getting in touch."
00:36:20,00:36:25,"And if you'd like to send us some stuff, go to email podcast@qi.com."
00:36:25,00:36:29,"I would just ask, we would prefer it to be exclusive to us, if possible."
00:36:29,00:36:34,Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.
00:36:34,00:36:37,But we will read out any old shit as long as it is exclusive to us.
00:36:37,00:36:40,I think that's the other thing we do need to say.
00:36:40,00:36:43,- Great. Bye. - Bye.
00:36:43,00:36:45,Bye-bye.
