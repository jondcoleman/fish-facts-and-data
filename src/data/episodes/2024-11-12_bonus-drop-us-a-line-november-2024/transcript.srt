 [music]

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Hi everybody!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Hi Andy, sorry I'm a bit distracted.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 I got a pumpkin here

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 and I just took the top of the pumpkin

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 and it had loads of strands of what I think might be

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 fungi or moulds.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Wow, what a strong distraction.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Let me show you.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Yeah, let's have a look, we need to evaluate.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Uh, oh!

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 That's so cool!

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Honestly, there's more hair on that pumpkin

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 than there is on my actual head at the moment.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 That's really foul.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 It does have a quiff, yes.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Is this going to be a spooky special, Andy,

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 because it's the day before Halloween?

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Oh my goodness, yeah I suppose it is actually.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Let's try and make it all a bit spooky.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Okay, hello!

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Welcome, when is it going out though?

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 It's going out closer to bonfire night, isn't it?

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 So it should really be an anti-parliamentarian special.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 All of mine actually, all of mine

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 are subtly imbued with Protestant radical philosophy.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 You know that.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Welcome to Drop Us Aligned, this is our audience feedback show.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 It's not just like James complaining about a pumpkin

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 and Anna, you know, wanting to thrash the Catholics.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 We've got some cracking stuff in the inbox,

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 because it's been a while, it's very pent up the inbox.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 There is a lot of stuff in here.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Oh, Dan's not here, I don't know where Dan is.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 No one does.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Sunning himself, probably.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Send out a Dan signal if you're hearing this.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 But let's start with an email from Johann Scott.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 "I'm Johann," he says.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 He didn't really need to say that, because I already knew.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 "A fan of no such thing as a fish,

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 and the current president of the St Andrews Whole Digging Society."

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I was really happy to hear you mention us on your recent podcast

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 and wanted to express my gratitude.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Isn't that nice?

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Did he not invite you to dig some holes with him?

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Do you know he didn't, actually.

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 We don't wait every fortnight, unfortunately,

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 but we arrange hole digs depending on university deadlines,

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 the weather and the tide.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 We've dug some pretty deep holes ourselves,

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 although not quite as deep as the Padstow Hole you referred to.

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 We dug one that looked like a trench in September.

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I think if it looks like a trench, it is a trench.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 That was perhaps around six feet deep and 12 feet long.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 That's a trench.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 They did dig some fake trenches on the beaches, didn't they,

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 during World War I think so, in the UK,

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 so that soldiers could get an idea of what the trenches would be like.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Oh, that's good.

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Oh, what to practice?

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I think so.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Really?

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Yes, I think you're right. I think they did.

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 There was a mining university, which had a fake mine in it.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Yes, in Birmingham.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Loads of underground tunnels.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I was reading the reminiscences of a World War II German soldier,

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 actually, who was, oh no, it was an Australian guy who said

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 they spent all of their military training holding brimsticks instead of guns

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 because the guns didn't arrive until the day that they had to leave,

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 which I don't think counts as machine, as gun training.

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 That's amazing.

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 So they were playing Quidditch.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Yes, exactly.

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 All at war, putting the gun between their legs.

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 That's funny.

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Johann, I think, I don't want to speak on Andy's behalf,

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 but I think he would be keen to come up and dig some holes.

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Yeah, I think I would actually.

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 It might be a big barrier to entry.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 No, no, no, there's no barrier to entry,

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 and that brings me on to our next email from Charlie Mone,

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 who says, "Hi, I'm the founder of the St Andrews Hole Digging Society."

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 So Johann is the president, Charlie is the founder.

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Don't listen to this Johann guy who's probably emailing you.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 He said, "It's really cool that you mentioned us."

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 He said he wanted to clear up a misconception,

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 contrary to popular belief, it isn't exclusively a men's club.

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I can't remember. I don't think, do we say that?

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 No, but it's so commonly accepted worldwide

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 that the St Andrews Hole Digging Society is mostly male,

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 but I think it's good that we've cleared that up for the public.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Well, Charlie says, in fact, in fact, we found

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 the majority of our attendees are usually women,

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 and the activity of hole digging has strongly resonated

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 with the trans and non-binary members of the St Andrews student community.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So there you go, they're very welcoming, all welcomed.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 You just have to like digging big holes.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 That really is the only criteria.

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Yeah, I think we did imply that it might be middle-aged men

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 going out, leaving their wives and digging some holes.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So that might be on us.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I know you're right. Charlie says, "It's wonderful you mentioned us,

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 but I want to clarify, it's important for everyone to feel

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 like they would be welcome to come to our digging sessions."

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Excellent.

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 So you just have to be a sad act.

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 That's all that's the only criteria of entry

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 of any demographic at all.

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Yeah. Oh, here's a thanks but no thanks.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 We've got a few of these this week, actually.

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I'm going to scatter them through.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Charlie Wolfe, great name, says,

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 "I was wondering if you guys, Brackets James and Deanna Dan,

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 yes, obviously, will be willing to do a podcast

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 or mini show called Small Inventions, Big Impact,

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 where you discuss smaller inventions that change the world

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 like the license plate or traffic lights.

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I thought with how often you talk about interesting inventions,

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 you might find this idea interesting."

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Yeah, I think it's the kind of thing that does come up just,

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 you know, ad hoc, as in we will talk about something

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 and then explain why it's such a big deal.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 So things like ferns, do you remember?

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 We talked about the fern craze and how that impacted the world

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 and barbed wire, how that impacted the world.

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I mean, we should say, we didn't claim that someone

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 invented the fern in the 19th century.

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 No, but the Wardian case.

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 The Wardian case.

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Yeah, that allowed them to be transported

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 and revolutionized, basically, plant growing around the world,

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 because suddenly you could get a plant from one place

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 to several thousand miles away.

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Yeah.

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Yeah.

140
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Well, that's a great idea.

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Doesn't a small invention become a big invention

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 when it has a big impact?

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I'm not sure how you'd set out the criteria in that show,

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 because it would be like, well, it's not size-wise, is it?

145
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 No, you're absolutely right.

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And as soon as it has a big impact, that's a big invention.

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Yeah, so for that reason, Dylan, thanks, but no thanks.

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Can I also have a voice, a quick bugbear I have about this?

149
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And I've always thought this when people say something

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 changes the world.

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Again, everything changes the world, doesn't it?

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 What a fusspot point to make.

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 I'm sorry, but so for instance, we just said the Wardian cage,

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 and we'd be claiming it changed the world.

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 It's sort of changed plant growing on the edges.

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 So I think it's going to be so hard to put up that barrier.

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I mean, if I nudge this mug a little bit forward,

158
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 like I have just done there, I've changed the world.

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Yeah, but it's not as interesting as inventing the license plate

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 by a long way.

161
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Anna, honestly, given the stick you've got coming up from the audience,

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I would be trying to placate them at this point

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 rather than aggravate them further.

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 That's a great idea.

165
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Here's one from Joshua Davidson.

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Normal name, so it must be a pretty good email.

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Hi, guys.

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Aussie listener since 2016.

169
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 We're getting a lot from Australia and New Zealand

170
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 because we are about to go to Auss and NZ.

171
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And I think the listenership there are getting excited for our visit.

172
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 We're literally going, you're going in like two days.

173
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 There's real buzz in the inbox.

175
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 It's really cool.

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Aussie listener since 2016, recent clubfish member.

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 I'm sure I'm not the only person to message him with this,

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 but on this week's episode of Meet the Elves,

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 so this is an entirely in-clubfish transaction we're doing here,

180
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 and he mentioned the phrase getting off at Gateshead,

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 and he mentioned that Gateshead was close to Newcastle, UK,

182
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 moments after Anna had mentioned that Newcastle, New South Wales

183
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 is the biggest coal exporter in the world.

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I live in Newcastle, New South Wales,

185
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 and thought you would like to know there is also a suburb

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 in Newcastle, New South Wales called Gateshead.

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Brilliant.

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 There you go.

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 That's fantastic information.

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 They're the same place.

191
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Yeah.

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Oh, and we had another listener who was from Newcastle in the USA,

193
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 which also has loads of coal.

194
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Really?

195
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 If it's called Newcastle, it's got coal.

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Yeah, basically.

197
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Is it the fact that probably they found there was loads of coal there

198
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 and what does that remind us of?

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Yes.

200
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 The US one is that.

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 It was called something else, and then they found all this coal,

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 and they said, "Oh, let's call it Newcastle."

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Oh, well, the Australian one is also that.

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So there you go.

205
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Yeah.

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Oh, great.

207
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Okay.

208
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Well, Josh Brits in a PS.

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 "I would love to petition to get the four of you on Taskmaster.

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 "I think it would be hilarious and expose many more personal secrets

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 "of Andy's life."

212
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I don't know what he means about that.

213
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Well, they ask us every season, don't they?

214
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And we always say no.

215
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So integrity.

216
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Beggars, yeah.

217
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 "Who would you choose from amongst the QI team

218
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 "to be the fifth contestant?"

219
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 James, you watched Taskmaster religiously.

220
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Yeah, well, I did the Taskmaster live experience,

221
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 which I did win, of course,

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 but I was playing mostly against my nieces who were all teenagers,

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 but I ground them into the floor.

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I actually smashed them.

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 The thing is about Taskmaster is it's like QI.

226
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 You're not really supposed to win QI.

227
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 You're supposed to be amusing and whimsical and stuff.

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 So you really want someone who's really got that whimsy about them.

229
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 "Who was on the last meet the elves? Was it Rawson?"

230
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Yeah.

231
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 He'd be good.

232
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Rawson would be good.

233
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Let's get it.

234
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 It sounded just like he was the last person you could remember.

235
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Like, "Who was that guy last week from the elves?"

236
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Yeah, let's take him.

237
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 No, Rawson would be good.

238
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 They all be good.

239
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 You don't get to be a QI researcher without some kind of sideways thinking.

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 That's true.

241
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 I think Alex Bell would probably build the most weird machines

242
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 as part of the Taskmaster ring.

243
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 I think the truth is that we would love to go on Taskmaster,

244
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 but so would every single other comedian in the entire country.

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Yeah.

246
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 We're probably quite far down the list.

247
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Yeah.

248
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 So thanks for reminding us where we stand in the pecking order.

249
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Let's have another email.

250
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 This is quite a good one from Liz Harrison.

251
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I was just clatching up on some club fish.

252
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I'm listening to June 2024's Drop As A Line,

253
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 where you ask for people who listen in unusual places to get in touch.

254
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I haven't heard this subsequently mentioned.

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I think because no one said anything interesting, unfortunately.

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 But I wanted to drop in my two peneth and let you know

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 that between November and April each year,

258
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I listened from the second most remote island in the world,

259
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 St Helena in the South Atlantic.

260
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Wow.

261
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 How interesting, St Helena.

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Yeah.

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I got some friends who just moved to St Helena.

264
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Have you?

265
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Really?

266
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Yeah.

267
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 So I think perhaps they might be listening.

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 What was she doing there?

269
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Does she say?

270
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 She doesn't say.

271
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And she says less interestingly for the rest of the year,

272
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I listened from Shrewsbury in Shropshire,

273
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 which I think is actually both of those places

274
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 you can pronounce two different ways.

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Is it St Helena or is it St Helena?

276
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And is it Shrewsbury or Shrewsbury?

277
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 How interesting.

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Yeah.

279
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Thanks, guys.

280
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Sam Talbot writes,

281
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 listening to episode 367,

282
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 which Andy talks about his correspondence

283
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 with the crime-solving drug naming team of Schubert and Carrot.

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Do you remember this?

285
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 They name drugs and they sort of,

286
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 they rule out drug names that might be considered rude.

287
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 You know, if you've got an idea for your drug name,

288
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 but, you know, but it sounds obscene.

289
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Oh, yeah.

290
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 You're not allowed.

291
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And they banned privy,

292
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 the prefix privy because it sounded lavatorial.

293
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 I wonder what they were doing in 2008

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 when a new drug with the trade name Brideon was introduced.

295
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I am an anaesthetist and I'm more familiar with this drug

296
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 used for reversing the muscle relaxing effects of anesthesia

297
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 by its generic name of Sugga Madex,

298
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 often mispronounced Sugga Madex,

299
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 and I don't like effects.

300
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 How did they miss that?

301
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I don't know.

302
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 That's very funny.

303
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Yeah.

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 It's how long, because I vaguely remember that,

305
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 but I'd forgotten that it was medical drugs

306
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 and not illegal drugs.

307
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And your mind does go to illegal drugs.

308
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 So I was like, what kind of weird prude is there

309
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 in the drug dealing community?

310
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 You say that you're not allowed to be flogging heroin

311
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 if it's called, you know, penis ganj or whatever.

312
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Bump cocaine.

313
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Yeah.

314
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 No, it's not that.

315
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 No, no, no, no.

316
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.

317
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Penis ganj.

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Penis ganj.

319
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I don't know where my head was going there.

320
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I like it.

321
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Yeah.

322
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I like it.

323
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I think that because I know a lot of our listeners

324
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 on Drop As A Line are street hoodlums

325
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 who are creating new drugs.

326
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And so I reckon that could be,

327
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 that could be the new slang.

328
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Get it on the list.

329
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Yeah.

330
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Sam post fixes his email by saying,

331
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 "By the way, while patients often do talk

332
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 a lot of nonsense as they're going to sleep,

333
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I've never told anyone to shut up,"

334
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 or said, "I've shagged your mum,"

335
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 as was suggested on another episode by Anna.

336
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I don't remember that.

337
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Yeah, I'm surprised I say that sort of thing out loud.

338
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Whoops.

339
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Well, I bet he has done it, though.

340
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 It's just the person wouldn't remember.

341
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Superb.

342
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Mystery email, mystery source.

343
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 It's good.

344
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 It's an anonymous one.

345
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 It's someone who needs to protect their identity.

346
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Oh, sorry.

347
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I thought you meant like, you know,

348
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 brown and barbecue crossed or whatever.

349
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 No.

350
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 That's-- Anna, hold that thought.

351
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Oh.

352
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 I'm a few episodes behind,

353
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 but I caught your conversation regarding barcodes.

354
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 I work at Heinz.

355
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And a nerdy fact is that we try to buy barcodes

356
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 that have 57 in them,

357
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 because Heinz has 57 varieties.

358
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 You can buy a barcode?

359
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 I know.

360
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 That's amazing.

361
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 It's got tricky due to the number of our products

362
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 and barcodes available,

363
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 but on the core products we try for a 57.

364
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And it's like a long string of numbers.

365
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 There's just a 57 somewhere in there.

366
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 That's amazing.

367
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 So, does this mean if we--

368
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Can we check a barcode on our Heinz products or not?

369
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Yeah.

370
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And it should have 57 in it.

371
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Yeah.

372
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Yeah.

373
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Let's see if I got some beans in the house.

374
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 I'm going to do that.

375
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Okay.

376
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 I'll just fill time while these guys are off rifling.

377
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 They're bin cupboards.

378
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 They're bean cupboards.

379
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 They've gone.

380
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 So, it's just me and you.

381
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I've always felt underappreciated on this podcast.

382
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Oh, they're back.

383
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I'll wait for Anna to come back.

384
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Hey.

385
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Oh, great.

386
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I'm really excited to find out what you've got.

387
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Anna keeps her beans at the end of the garden.

388
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Because she's suspicious of them.

389
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 They're magic beans, aren't they?

390
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 It's so excited, Anna.

391
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Well.

392
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Anna.

393
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Anna, are you excited?

394
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 I'm so excited.

395
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Yeah.

396
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Okay.

397
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Let's hear what you've got.

398
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Okay.

399
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Well, I've got--

400
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 First of all, I've got some Heinz vegetable soup.

401
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And I'm having a look at the barcode here.

402
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 There is indeed a 57 right there.

403
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Wow.

404
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Bang in the middle.

405
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Wow.

406
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Okay, so that's a core product.

407
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Okay.

408
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Mushroom soup.

409
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Same, same.

410
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 57.

411
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Okay.

412
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 James, what you got?

413
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Well, I've got the core product.

414
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Proper thinner beans.

415
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 He's got the beans.

416
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Lovely.

417
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 He's got the beans.

418
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And sure enough.

419
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Triple zero, one, five, seven.

420
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Amazing.

421
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Amazing.

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 And just as a quick fourth piece of evidence,

423
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Heinz ketchup, the second core product.

424
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 57 there, right at the end.

425
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Incredible.

426
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 That's so cool.

427
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 There you go.

428
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 That is really cool.

429
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 It's the best bit of trivia I've ever heard.

430
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And our correspondent says, "If you discuss,

431
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 please do not use my name."

432
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Why?

433
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 You should be proud.

434
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Anyway, thank you, Mr.--

435
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Do you see why I said mystery sauce at the start?

436
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Yeah.

437
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Great stuff.

438
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Oh, yeah, I see.

439
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Email here from Blaise Petrucci.

440
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Mm-hmm, brilliant.

441
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Nice.

442
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 You don't get enough blazes around.

443
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 We said on the podcast recently.

444
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Well, did we?

445
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 We said--

446
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Email, subject line, Blaise Pascal was not boring, Anna.

447
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Oh, gosh, I've been saying a lot of things, haven't I lately?

448
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Oh, yeah.

449
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Can't keep my mouth shut.

450
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Yeah.

451
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Blaise writes, "My late father was an Italian mathematician

452
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 who was obsessed with Blaise Pascal.

453
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 So much so, he named his son Blaise.

454
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Me.

455
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Growing up, I hated my name and I hated maths."

456
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Aw.

457
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Oh, you would have hated our 57 bit that we've just done.

458
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 But my old man was persistent and eventually a love of maths

459
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 and of Monsieur Pascal developed in my little brain.

460
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 So imagine my sadness when I heard Anna Tijinski describe my namesake as boring.

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Blaise Pascal was a true polymath to rival the likes of Da Vinci and Franklin,

462
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 and I think his influence is far-reaching and eternal, just like no such thing as a fish.

463
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 I think you can be a polymath and have a far-reaching and eternal influence

464
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 whilst also being as dull as dishwater.

465
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Like no such thing as a fish.

466
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 OK.

467
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 So there you go.

468
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Lovely, lovely to hear from you Blaise.

469
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Apologies.

470
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 But I stand by everything I said.

471
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Yeah, that's good.

472
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 I think that's good.

473
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 I think it's nice to apologise but defy.

474
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 It would be weird if you just caved.

475
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Thank you.

476
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 OK.

477
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Oh, Meredith writes,

478
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 "We did synchronised swimming recently on the podcast."

479
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 We should.

480
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Sure did.

481
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Meredith sends some notes from someone who was a synchronised swimmer for five years.

482
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Cool.

483
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 He was not nearly good enough at it to continue in college.

484
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So that's Meredith's level.

485
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 I feel that Synchro was given appropriate respect in this episode,

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 which is a redemption from earlier podcast mentions.

487
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Excellent job.

488
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 No.

489
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 I can't remember what we said.

490
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 "We used to have to do laps of unders,

491
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 swim underwater for 50 to 75 metres without a breath.

492
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Bad."

493
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Yeah, that's too far.

494
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 "In crazy training routines and techniques,

495
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 you do your entire routine with ankle weights on to improve your skull."

496
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Which is the thing where you stay upside down.

497
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 The weird stay upside down thing.

498
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 She also says one thing about injuries.

499
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 She has a lot of scarring from people who didn't cut their toenails

500
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 and went swimming with her.

501
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 In water polo, they have a designated person who comes through

502
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 and checks all our nails to make sure they're regulation.

503
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Cool.

504
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 I wonder how many sports or pursuits there are

505
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 that require a certain nail length,

506
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 because that reminds me of playing the piano.

507
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 My teacher always used to get really pissed off

508
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 if I hadn't cut my nails.

509
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 It's the same truth of guitar.

510
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Is it bad if you have long nails, James?

511
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Yeah.

512
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Although for banjo, you wear fake nails.

513
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Like you have like plastic picks that you wear on your fingers.

514
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I thought you needed one hand with long nails to do the picking.

515
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 In sport, I'm not so sure.

516
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 The thing is there are rules about how long your nails can be

517
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 in beach volleyball because people point adverts on them, I think.

518
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Really?

519
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 So you had to have them so short that you couldn't fit a full-sized ad?

520
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Or you got paid more for longer nails?

521
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I think they weren't allowed to be the size of a billboard.

522
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 That's fair.

523
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I can't remember.

524
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Actually, I can't remember.

525
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 I'm half remembering that idea.

526
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Sorry, I just cut my nails.

527
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Can you do the bottom half of the Coke bottle in this one?

528
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 That's great.

529
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Here's another.

530
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Here's Mike Abdullah.

531
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 This is a bollocking for me.

532
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I know.

533
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 What's that called again?

534
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Is it called Get Yourself Off The Hook?

535
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Or is it just called The Abuse Section?

536
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 I'm not sure.

537
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Well, we've got Um, actually, which is a factual correction.

538
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 We've got Spicy Meat, which is our behind-the-scenes stuff.

539
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 We've got Old Fish.

540
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Thanks for no thanks.

541
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 We've got Riddle Roundabout.

542
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 What about a right pollocking?

543
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 That's good.

544
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 That's brilliant.

545
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Yeah.

546
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Yeah, pollocking.

547
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 Brilliant.

548
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Mike Abdullah writes, this is for me.

549
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 After you confidently declared on last week's show that, quotes,

550
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 "There's nobody alive in the world who puts the milk in the mug

551
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 and puts the bag in the milk."

552
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I am writing to disprove this.

553
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I frequently make tea this way.

554
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I wonder how many other emails you will get.

555
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I started doing it after listening to an episode of Rutherford & Fry,

556
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 the mass show with a friend of fish, Hannah Fry.

557
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 And apparently, when milk is added to very hot tea,

558
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 it will start to separate.

559
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Whereas if hot tea is added to milk,

560
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 the temperature rises more gradually and the milk sticks together better.

561
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Something like that, who knows.

562
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And he's been happy with the result ever since.

563
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Did he find, I would like to know,

564
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 that in the past, his milk was just getting all globulous and busy

565
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 when he put it in after tea, because I have to say it.

566
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Globulous, it forms a separate layer at the top of the cup, Hannah.

567
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 You must know that.

568
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 You drink through the milk and then you just drink the tea.

569
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Sounds like bollocks, though, basically.

570
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Hannah Fry is the one I was talking about.

571
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Hey, phone number for Heinz, 0800 528 5757.

572
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Fantastic.

573
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Yay.

574
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 How are you?

575
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Are they calling you?

576
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Yes, that's them.

577
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 No, it's on the tin of beans.

578
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Unless you're in the Republic of Ireland, in which case it's 1 800 995 311.

579
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 So obviously the Republic of Ireland telephone companies refuse to bend over backwards.

580
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 They stitched up.

581
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 They won't bow to Big Bean.

582
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Good on them.

583
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 That's very funny.

584
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 OK, here's a great one.

585
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Erin Thomas.

586
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Canadian here.

587
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I'm listening to your August 29th show.

588
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And while I agree that slang will make you sound like another country.

589
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 I don't understand that.

590
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Canada is a vast country.

591
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 In some parts of Canada, they may say a boot, but I've lived in the prairies all my life and no one here says a boot.

592
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 In fact, I've never heard anyone say that.

593
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 My English husband, born in England and moved to Canada in his 40s, tells me he's never heard anyone here say a boot.

594
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Well, if he wants to hear people say a boot, he should listen to lazy Canadian stereotypes because I had that all the time.

595
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 So sorry, Erin.

596
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Sorry to the people of the Canadian prairies as well.

597
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Yeah.

598
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I think it might be one of those things that you can't hear it if you're that close to it.

599
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 You know, like everyone thinks they don't have an accent.

600
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 No, I do.

601
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Because they can't hear their own accent.

602
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I've got an accent.

603
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Well, of course, you've got a thick Jordy accent, but you're a bit of a villain.

604
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 No, I know what you mean. That's a fair point.

605
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Oh my God, here's a great one.

606
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Elizabeth Ruth Ross Ward.

607
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Get this.

608
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Email subject line.

609
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 We're getting married because of fish.

610
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 We've sparked a wedding.

611
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Brilliant. I hope she doesn't double barrel with someone with an equally long name.

612
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Good point.

613
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 She doesn't say her partner's surname.

614
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 But listen to this.

615
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 We actually have you to thank for our upcoming wedding.

616
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Six years ago, my partner Andrew saw me across a pool table at a bar and tried to chat with me.

617
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I wasn't having any of it, assuming he was another random at a bar that will be a bit boring/disappointing.

618
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Then he mentioned his favourite podcast was no such thing as a fish.

619
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And my ears perked right up. It was my favourite too.

620
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 We started properly talking and we haven't shut up since.

621
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 We're getting married in 2026.

622
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 We just wanted to say a huge thank you for bringing us together.

623
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Guys, that's so exciting.

624
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 I'm so exciting.

625
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 How are we going to do the wedding theming?

626
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Are we going to...

627
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Sorry, what?

628
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 They're not inviting us to be part of it.

629
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I'm sure we're going to be invited to be part of it, Anna.

630
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 I'm just wondering how we can make the day more fish related.

631
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Well, all the tables will have to be named after characters from No Such Things as Fish.

632
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Brilliant.

633
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 And where our dick be table.

634
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Or the lady who had an anal prolapse.

635
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Just call that anal prolapse.

636
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 I think just call that Oxrectum table.

637
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Who was the woman I used to love who used to spend her time making sure women didn't put mad stuff up their vaginas?

638
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Oh, Jen Gunter.

639
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Yeah, there's got to be a Jen Gunter table.

640
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Yeah, the Gunter zone, yeah, yeah, yeah.

641
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 For all the goop ladies.

642
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And when they say, you know, does anyone know any reason why?

643
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And Jen Gunter will pop up saying, why you shouldn't put the rings up your fanny?

644
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Don't do that.

645
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

646
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 If anyone has any reason that this shouldn't happen, shout, stop the wedding.

647
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Yes.

648
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 That's actually a good idea.

649
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 You should incorporate that, guys.

650
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 That's a really fun idea.

651
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Do save a date, send a save the date soon, because obviously our schedule will get quite booked up, didn't they?

652
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Absolutely.

653
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Yeah.

654
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 But how, that's the best news I've had all month.

655
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 I know, it's really nice.

656
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 What an amazing moment.

657
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Yeah.

658
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Also, what an amazing way to meet, just meeting across a pool table and starting to chat and realizing you like the same podcast.

659
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I think that's just a good one.

660
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Quite annoying for the people who were playing pool at the time, though, I imagine.

661
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Oh, yeah.

662
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 What are these pair of nerds doing near a pool table anyway?

663
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Yeah, famously a jock sport pool, isn't it?

664
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 It's definitely not a thing of benefits from ours of lonely practice by yourself.

665
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Yeah, fair enough.

666
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Here we go.

667
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Here is another thanks but no thanks from Tim Groves.

668
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Stop the podcast, he says.

669
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Very good.

670
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 I have an idea for a thanks but no thanks segment and drop us a line.

671
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I'm a long-time listener and have recently become a card-carrying member of Club Fish.

672
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Congratulations, Tim.

673
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 I'm very much enjoying the bonus material, but it suddenly struck me the other day that something is missing.

674
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 The adverts.

675
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I know avoiding ads is part of my membership fee, but there was something lovely about the four of you recording charming little snippets for your sponsors.

676
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Who could forget the time Dan left a Harry's advert desperate for more razors because his beard was growing so fast?

677
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Or Anna, quickly distancing herself from sharing a single mattress with Dan during a Lisa's sleep advert?

678
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 I'm curious about what we Club Fishers may be missing, so perhaps it would be nice if you put out a little compilation so we know exactly what type of VPN razor or mattress is currently preferred by the QILs.

679
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 That's so interesting that you say that because, and I'm basically saying this to cover our legal asses.

680
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Because what's this person called?

681
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Tim.

682
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Tim, don't want him suing us.

683
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 When we first started the bonus material, we did say, didn't we, we should release a string of just the adverts.

684
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 And I still think when we get a chance, we should do that.

685
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Or maybe some fake adverts for stuff that we would advertise.

686
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Or maybe like we just sneakily put adverts in the droppers a line for baked beans or something like that.

687
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 You've blown this can wide open.

688
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Yeah, it would require us to put a lot more effort into the adverts again.

689
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Exactly. You haven't heard the original versions now, mate, but they are, they're crap, aren't they?

690
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 The adverts we do these days, they're so phoned in trying to drive people to pay.

691
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Since all you guys left Club Fish, we were like, well, that's all the important people have gone now.

692
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 They've all gone to Club Fish, so we might as well start phoning them in.

693
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 It's a monotone, read it straight from the sheet, take the jokes out.

694
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Often we will pretend that it's a pre-recorded advert made by an actual company and dropped in.

695
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 It's actually us doing all the voices in those.

696
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 We try and make it indistinguishable from a pre-recorded radio advert.

697
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 That takes a lot of work. We're putting all the effort into that.

698
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Why do they do it?

699
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 I don't know, I don't know.

700
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Alexa Tonner writes, I am a recent fan of the podcast, welcome.

701
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And I especially appreciate just how prolific you all are.

702
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I've listened to dozens of episodes at this point and yet I find myself unable to remember most of the facts once the episode is over.

703
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 The ones I do seem to retain are about World Wars One and Two, a topic that does not interest me at all.

704
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I'm so sorry.

705
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 That's good, isn't it?

706
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 That's very funny.

707
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 You're welcome, Alexa.

708
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Tough. They're not going to stop.

709
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 No.

710
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Now, we've had a couple of emails from David Bergaman and I just wanted to share both of them with you.

711
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 It's very, very rare for someone to get both.

712
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And it's not because his name is David Bergaman.

713
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Okay, here's the first one.

714
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Having listened to the main show for a long time and been through lots of the bonus content,

715
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 I'm a new ClubVish member, welcome, David.

716
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I've gleaned quite a bit about what you all do in the fish industry.

717
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Dan is the host of the main show as well as plenty of other podcasts and projects.

718
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 James edits the show and is also everyone's boss's head elf.

719
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Andy is in charge of Drop as a Line and seems to run of a lot of the other ClubVish episodes.

720
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Even other elves in the office will edit compilations or guest on the show,

721
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 which leads me to my big question.

722
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 What does Anna do?

723
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Really looking forward to finding out the answer, David Bergaman.

724
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Listen, David.

725
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Andy, you've got to come up with better names if you're going to do an intervention.

726
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Sometimes it's very hard to quantify what someone brings to the table

727
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 and to write it down on paper or indeed explain it in words.

728
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 But yet, you know, they are the essential ingredient.

729
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Don't put this out because if the boss is here, then I'm fired.

730
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Hey, I thought David Bergaman said that I'm the boss.

731
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Oh yes, everyone's boss has had elf, very dubious.

732
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 I mean, James, this is clearly, this is, I did not write this.

733
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 I would not.

734
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Point taken, I'll make the tea next time I'm in.

735
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 How will you make it?

736
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 What will you pour on first?

737
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Great question.

738
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 I pour the milk onto the counter and then I pour the tea onto that.

739
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 But then I sweep it all into the mug with a little broom.

740
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 That's how I do it.

741
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 How would it work?

742
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Is it possible to put the milk in first and then the water?

743
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 So you've got very hot, milky water.

744
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 And then the bag.

745
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Shit, why does no one do that?

746
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Anyway, look, we've got to get on to Bergaman 2, the burgering.

747
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Second email from Bergaman.

748
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Does that answer your question?

749
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Did you say what you do, Anna? You do lots of stuff.

750
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 You always work very hard.

751
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 I'm about to make the tea.

752
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 It's coming up.

753
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Who is this burger? Who do you think he is? Or is she?

754
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Giving them the air of two emails. It's bullshit.

755
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 I think he's related to Ingmar Bergaman, the very famous.

756
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 I noticed, Anna, you haven't actually answered the question.

757
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 You're constantly telling us how busy you are.

758
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 So there must be something that you're doing.

759
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Yeah, yeah.

760
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 What is it, Anna?

761
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Anna works very hard on the TV series as one of James's underlings.

762
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 But nonetheless, she's a key part of the team.

763
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 I tried the shoelaces on QI, yeah.

764
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Together.

765
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Yeah.

766
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 No, I don't do anything.

767
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Anna is a core part of the team, David.

768
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 If you come for her, you come for all of us.

769
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 David, second email.

770
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 I know there has been a lot of upset about Dan being accused of being a wife guy.

771
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 I think I may have some upsetting proof of his identity as such.

772
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 It's exciting, isn't it?

773
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 In the very first Clubfish compilation, August 2022,

774
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 James brought out a phrenology head detailing what the different bumps on your head mean.

775
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 James then invited you all to find the biggest bump to compare it to the phrenology head,

776
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 and Dan found that his biggest bump was in the marriage section.

777
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 This is obviously because he is such a wife guy that even pseudoscience can tell.

778
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Oh, so that was before the whole wife guy joke.

779
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Exactly, that was pre-that. Isn't that amazing?

780
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Do you think pseudoscience maybe does work, but it only works on people who are into pseudoscience?

781
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 That's quite good.

782
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 I think that's true.

783
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 That's it, isn't it?

784
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Sophie Watson writes, "Did you know air fryers have been around since 1472?"

785
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Catchy.

786
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 This is brilliant.

787
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 I've told James this in advance, Hannah. You're the only one who's learning this new intel.

788
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 It's stunning. It's absolutely stunning.

789
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Do I need to know exactly what an air fryer is before you explain this?

790
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 It's a cooking device, isn't it, where you cook things dry.

791
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Oh, it's some kind of magic box. I don't know. I haven't got one.

792
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Yeah, it's like a small oven that sits on the counter. Nobody knows.

793
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Look, can we get to Sophie's email?

794
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Air fryers have been around since 1472.

795
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Cool.

796
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 This fact works spoken aloud, but not so much written down as I am actually talking about air, AYR, the Scottish town.

797
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Friars, as in priests.

798
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Here is a link to some info about the Franciscan monastery in air.

799
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Isn't that good?

800
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 I love it. I just think that's so funny.

801
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Beautiful.

802
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 She says, "I had been listening to the podcast and was cooking a cheese toasty for my lunch."

803
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And that's how she came up with it.

804
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Thank you so much, Sophie.

805
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Perfect. This is my kind of fact as well, isn't it?

806
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 She's come up with a joke and then she's done the googling to see if it's true or not.

807
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 It's just correct. It's so good.

808
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Yeah, very strong.

809
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 I actually feel like we should use that for the show, to be honest.

810
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Oh, should we?

811
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Air fryers, maybe.

812
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 We've never had a fact promoted from Drop As A Line to the main show.

813
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Do you think it would matter that people had heard it before?

814
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Would we have to cut it out of this?

815
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Or could that be a cool extra in-joke for the Drop As A Line clubfish crew?

816
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 They could be sat there waiting for it to come up on the show one day.

817
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Yeah, I think let's do that.

818
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Okay, so we might use it on the show one day. We might not.

819
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 There's an incentive to keep listening.

820
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Absolutely. We need to find them at this point.

821
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Oh, here's a boff fin. Do you remember that?

822
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 The experts who write in with their knowledge.

823
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 What's triple F?

824
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Four Fs, I think.

825
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Four Fs, sorry. Yes, you're actually right.

826
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 In episode 552, you discussed the Nile crocodiles burrows being the longest in the animal kingdom.

827
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 However, there is a reason I'm reading out this particular correction as well.

828
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 In South America, 10,000 years ago, there were much larger ones dug by giant sloths.

829
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Which I think is fair. We have mentioned that.

830
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 But right now, I think crocodiles might dig the deepest.

831
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Also, while mentioning paleo burrows, I must also mention daemon elixies.

832
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Corkscrew shaped burrows created by beavers in North America.

833
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Enjoy entering this rabbit hole, Sam. Very funny.

834
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Sam is a technician in Earth Sciences, who works at a place called Megaforna Central.

835
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Oh, cool. Amazing.

836
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 In Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia. How cool is that?

837
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Megaforna Central.

838
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 I know, it's pretty cool, isn't it?

839
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 It sounds like an alternative name for Jurassic Park, basically, doesn't it?

840
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 It sounds like you go there and there's giant animals wandering around.

841
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Yeah.

842
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Do you remember, Andy, you had a question once on QI about how big Megaforna has to be.

843
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 And actually, there are some Megafornas that are smaller than a cat or something.

844
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 I think Megaforna means visible to the naked eye.

845
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 It's such bollocks.

846
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And ant is a Megaforna.

847
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 It's just another example of science ruining normal language for the rest of us.

848
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Whereas Megaforna should clearly be a bear or bigger.

849
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Oh, you've made me angry about that all over again now.

850
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 That's funny, because I reckon that was like 15 years ago.

851
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Yeah, it was.

852
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 This is just a funny story from Cameron McInnes.

853
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 We did a hiccup cures about how you cure a hiccup with a finger in your bottom.

854
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Sounds like us, yeah.

855
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 It's in personal anecdote from Cameron, which he's been telling for some years now.

856
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 But it's not podcast appropriate.

857
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Oh, is it dual appropriate?

858
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 I think it might be.

859
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 It's about a headmaster called Rick, and apparently was really a bad headmaster,

860
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 was really incompetent and arrogant and, you know,

861
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 talked about himself in third person assemblies.

862
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Okay, so it's a bit like bad headmaster of a school, basically.

863
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Our school was having a cross country race, annual cross country race.

864
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 All the parents were lined up where the finish line was, right?

865
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 My friend has a rescue dog called Calua, who gets a bit skittish.

866
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 And there was another dog there making Calua agitated.

867
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 My friend went to go and put him in the car.

868
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Basically, the dog's got in a scrap.

869
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Calua bit this dog on the ear and got locked jord.

870
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Oh, no.

871
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Enter the other dog's howling.

872
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 The parents come to see what's going on.

873
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Enter Rick the Dick, which is apparently this headmaster's name,

874
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 who sees what's going on and declares,

875
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 "You have to stick your finger up his bum to make him let go.

876
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 I've done it before out of my way."

877
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Okay, which is true.

878
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 That is true, isn't it?

879
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Then in front of quite a large crowd,

880
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 quickly sucks his finger, grabs the dog and sticks his finger straight up its arse.

881
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 - Do it in that order. - Absolutely.

882
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 There's a second or two in shock silence before someone says,

883
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 "Rick, that's the wrong dog."

884
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Rick quickly removes his finger from the other dog, grabs Calua,

885
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 and sticks his fingers up his arse.

886
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Then Calua doesn't let go.

887
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 The three of them are scuffling around in a circle,

888
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 trying to get away from each other until one of the other parents

889
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 throws a bottle of water on Calua and he lets go.

890
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 His poor other dog has now got a jaw in the ear and a finger up the arse

891
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 and still no one's helping him out.

892
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 His name has apparently now been changed to "Wrong Dog, Rick."

893
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Thanks for the podcast.

894
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 - What a great story. - Thanks, Cameron.

895
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Great story. He says, "I've sent this also to Chris and Rosie Ramsey."

896
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 - What? - What?

897
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Come on.

898
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 But I figure the more I spread it, the more likely it is to filter back to him.

899
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Chris and Rosie Ramsey have high standards, though, right?

900
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 They probably won't beat it up.

901
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 They certainly won't have it as their sort of climactic little anecdote.

902
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Absolutely not. No way.

903
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 So thanks, Cameron. Thanks to all of you for listening to this and getting in touch.

904
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And if you'd like to send us some stuff, go to email podcast@qi.com.

905
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 I would just ask, we would prefer it to be exclusive to us, if possible.

906
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely.

907
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 But we will read out any old shit as long as it is exclusive to us.

908
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 I think that's the other thing we do need to say.

909
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 - Great. Bye. - Bye.

910
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 Bye-bye.
