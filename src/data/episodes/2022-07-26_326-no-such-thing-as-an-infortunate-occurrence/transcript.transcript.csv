00:00:00,00:00:06,We're going to go to the U.K.
00:00:06,00:00:19,Hello and welcome to another working from home episode of no such thing as a fish
00:00:19,00:00:24,a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the U.K.
00:00:24,00:00:29,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin with Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:29,00:00:33,and Anna Tajinsky and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:33,00:00:38,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:38,00:00:41,Starting with fact number one and that's my fact this week.
00:00:41,00:00:47,My fact is two days after receiving his latest book the author of annals of gullibility
00:00:47,00:00:53,why we get juped and how to avoid it lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in a Ponzi scheme.
00:00:53,00:00:59,He did admit that it was embarrassing he kind of thinks it's funny now you know with the
00:00:59,00:01:05,distance of time to look back at it but this is a guy called Stephen Greenspan and he'd written
00:01:05,00:01:11,this book and and it was meant to sort of help you to understand how not to be jubed by exactly
00:01:11,00:01:16,the thing that caught him off guard so he got caught off guard by the greatest Ponzi scheme
00:01:16,00:01:24,of them all which was the Bernie Madoff which set so many people around the world losing thousands
00:01:24,00:01:29,and millions in some cases it's the biggest of its kind and yeah it was recommendation via his sister
00:01:29,00:01:33,"and two days after receiving his latest book he lost 400,000."
00:01:33,00:01:40,Wow in his advice as to how to avoid it did it include things like you know don't take advice
00:01:40,00:01:45,from ill-informed siblings and don't invest with people who have surnames that sounds especially
00:01:45,00:01:52,like the phrase made off. I think a revised edition was hastily issued with all this in there.
00:01:52,00:01:59,Don't come at his check is the Ponzi scheme basically a pyramid scheme where it's what it is
00:01:59,00:02:04,is you get in early investors and you get their money and when you bring in new investors you give
00:02:04,00:02:08,the money of the new investors a bit of it to the early investors so it seems as if they're
00:02:08,00:02:12,getting returned on their money and then you kind of thought that was a pyramid scheme basically.
00:02:12,00:02:18,A pyramid scheme is where you bring in new investors and they have to bring in new investors
00:02:18,00:02:22,and that money comes up to the people higher up in the pyramid it's slightly different.
00:02:22,00:02:29,Oh yeah see. So the Ponzi scheme is more flat it's more like a large plane on the deserts of Egypt
00:02:29,00:02:35,compared to the pyramid. A Ponzi scheme is the thing that we used to do as kids which I found
00:02:35,00:02:40,so thrilling do you remember where you'd get a letter that had a chocolate bar in it and you said
00:02:40,00:02:48,and it said send this on with no wait how would it work. I tell you no you're right you're doing
00:02:48,00:02:52,all right someone sends you a letter saying send me a chocolate bar but then you send the letter
00:02:52,00:02:57,to six people and then ask you ask each of them to send you a chocolate bar and then you get six
00:02:57,00:03:01,chocolate bars. It was amazing. That's a pyramid scheme. That's a pyramid scheme not a Ponzi
00:03:01,00:03:08,scheme but Anna if you've been investing. No a Ponzi scheme. It's pretty similar. It's similar
00:03:08,00:03:14,but it is there's quite a distinctive difference. So in a Ponzi scheme you would get a load of
00:03:14,00:03:19,Mars bars from loads of different people and then you would cut some of the Mars bars up and they give
00:03:19,00:03:24,the Mars bar back with another half of a Mars bar to someone who said you want Mars bar as they think
00:03:24,00:03:28,they're getting one and a half back but actually what you're doing is you're using other people's
00:03:28,00:03:33,Mars bars to do it and eventually you're going to run out of Mars bars. Do you have to re-wrap the
00:03:33,00:03:37,Mars bars once you cut them out? I feel like it's more different with Mars bars than it is with
00:03:37,00:03:45,money. It is when you get a monkey half a Mars bar through the bus. Is it different? They get in a nice
00:03:45,00:03:50,crisp 50 pound note. We're rich. We're rich. You know it's weird just in order to get ready for this
00:03:50,00:03:54,fact. I looked up what a Ponzi scheme was so I knew what it was. I now have no idea what it is off
00:03:54,00:04:01,the back of all these models. It's literally all it is is a pyramid scheme has one person at the
00:04:01,00:04:05,"top ten people next, a hundred people next, a thousand people next whereas a Ponzi scheme has one"
00:04:05,00:04:09,person at the top and then everyone else is flat. You actually did explain it completely correctly
00:04:09,00:04:16,Dan. We just started throwing Mars bars around. The first Ponzi scheme was basically invented by
00:04:16,00:04:21,"accident, wasn't it by Charles Ponzi? He didn't quite mean to do it. He sort of meant it to be legit"
00:04:21,00:04:27,so it was in the 1920s and he had the scheme where he was buying stamps or actually these things
00:04:27,00:04:33,called reply coupons and that was when if you wrote to a friend internationally you included a reply
00:04:33,00:04:37,coupon which I think essentially meant it was like doing a reverse charge call but on a letter and
00:04:37,00:04:42,it meant that they could write back to you for free. Anyway he bought them overseas for much cheaper
00:04:42,00:04:46,because they were cheaper overseas and then sold them for more in the US and he said to people I've
00:04:46,00:04:51,got this amazing scheme. Well I can make a massive profit on these reply coupons and he got people
00:04:51,00:04:56,to invest and they did and he hadn't factored in the fact that he'd have to pay for all the
00:04:56,00:05:00,ridiculous international travel to these places to go and buy these stamps in the first place so he
00:05:00,00:05:05,realized the scheme couldn't make any money at all but these people were investing loads of money
00:05:05,00:05:11,and you can see the reasoning where he started to think oh I still I'm receiving all this money.
00:05:11,00:05:15,Should I just keep keep going with this and not mention that it doesn't work? It's kind of working
00:05:15,00:05:20,well for a shot period of time isn't it I guess. It is until he so I think someone did the mass and
00:05:20,00:05:28,"worked out that he was claiming to be buying and selling 160 million reply coupons and only 27,000"
00:05:28,00:05:34,existed in the world. The Boston Post did an article in 1920 didn't they demonstration that
00:05:34,00:05:40,was completely impossible and when they did an audit afterwards they found only 61 dollars worth
00:05:40,00:05:44,of these stamps even though he'd said that he'd bought millions and millions of dollars worth.
00:05:44,00:05:50,So he did try he got a few. He got a few but when the Boston Post came up with
00:05:50,00:05:57,this expose everyone thought oh my god I've given him all my money I need my money back and so they
00:05:57,00:06:03,did a run on him to try and get all of their money back and he just completely fronted it out and
00:06:03,00:06:07,he just said yeah no worries you guys just queue up and I'll give you your money back and they
00:06:07,00:06:12,stood in the queue and he bought them sandwiches and coffee and people weren't sure whether he was
00:06:12,00:06:17,real or not still at that stage and so half the time they were cheering him and half the time they
00:06:17,00:06:22,were booing him no one really knew what was happening and then eventually the government got involved
00:06:22,00:06:26,and looked at his accounts and found he was three million dollars in the red and they later advised
00:06:26,00:06:31,it to seven million dollars in the red and he got arrested and when he got arrested everyone lost
00:06:31,00:06:37,her money. Oh wow. What was his long term plan that that queue outside his house? I just think
00:06:37,00:06:42,sometimes it's like maybe tomorrow it'll be fine. Yeah. If you're calm enough with the beginning of
00:06:42,00:06:46,the queue then the end will probably get bored and go away. Well that's what happened like because
00:06:46,00:06:51,loads of people started running on it but some people still trusted him so they became a secondary
00:06:51,00:06:57,speculation market where people would buy the Ponzi coupons on a cheaper price so that the people
00:06:57,00:07:01,in the queue would at least get something back and the people who bought it thought well this is
00:07:01,00:07:06,actually real it's for real so I'm going to get the full amount back so they became speculation
00:07:06,00:07:11,on the speculation. That's clever. That's crazy. And while we're on scammers have you guys heard of
00:07:11,00:07:15,Victor Lustig? I don't think we have ever mentioned him before. Is he the guy who sold the Eiffel Tower?
00:07:15,00:07:23,He's the guy who sold it twice. Oh wow. So he knew that Paris was broke. He was living in Paris and
00:07:23,00:07:27,he thought maybe the city would want to sell the Eiffel Tower off because it's been up for 30 years
00:07:27,00:07:34,it's a bit rusty and so he decided to forge some government stationery and he wrote to a load of
00:07:34,00:07:39,scrap metal dealers and he invited them all to an expensive suite at a hotel and he said hello
00:07:39,00:07:44,I am the deputy minister of posts and he said well we're looking for buyers but we've got to keep it
00:07:44,00:07:49,quiet from public opinion because there might be controversy and then one of the guys was tempted
00:07:49,00:07:56,and especially stupid dealer called Andre Poisson and Drew Fish and he said I'd really like to buy
00:07:56,00:08:01,the Eiffel Tower scrap and he paid a massive bribe to secure the ownership and unsurprisingly
00:08:01,00:08:05,the Eiffel Tower was not the sale but he got away with it. He was so successful Victor Lustig.
00:08:05,00:08:11,Was he never busted? He was busted later on for his Romanian box.
00:08:11,00:08:22,It was a box which would duplicate any bank note that you put in it. Obviously it wouldn't.
00:08:22,00:08:25,Okay well James Nanner I'm not going to try and sell you one but Dan you're looking interesting.
00:08:25,00:08:32,He had concealed genuine notes within the device and then as long as you only put in a selector
00:08:32,00:08:37,and I had all these buttons and levers that you press and pull and then another bank note would come
00:08:37,00:08:40,out and they'd think oh my god this is amazing. What's he inside making the noises?
00:08:40,00:08:47,He just made a complicated looking box basically and he sold the box for a lot of money to
00:08:47,00:08:54,various different people and then once there was a sheriff in Texas who realized that the scam
00:08:54,00:08:59,caught up with him in another state and then Lustig said oh you're just not using it right don't
00:08:59,00:09:02,worry it's okay completely persuaded him it was fine and then said look let me give you all this
00:09:02,00:09:08,cash to compensate you which was counterfeit money so you managed to pay his way out of it yeah
00:09:08,00:09:12,you're very cool. Like you were saying about how he said oh I'm not really supposed to talk about
00:09:12,00:09:18,this and so people trusted him Ponzi did that as well so when they said to him how are you making
00:09:18,00:09:23,this work because it doesn't seem like at work all these stamps he said oh yeah I've got a system
00:09:23,00:09:27,which I don't want to tell you because then the government will shut it down and then when
00:09:27,00:09:31,everyone did the run on him and started queuing up for money he said oh guys guess what I've come
00:09:31,00:09:36,up with a new system it's completely different it's not to do a stamps at all it's just really really
00:09:36,00:09:40,awesome and so this one will get you even more money so why don't you give me more money but he kept
00:09:40,00:09:45,saying I can't tell anyone what it is because if I tell you then everyone will be doing it and that's
00:09:45,00:09:49,what kind of suckers people in. Yes. Got to be adaptable. Do you know how you find out if someone is
00:09:49,00:09:59,gullible? Oh no. Oh well let me tell you my magic function. I don't know is it like a questionnaire
00:09:59,00:10:02,or something? It's exactly that there's a questionnaire but basically it is just asking are you
00:10:02,00:10:06,gullible? It's amazing it's a 12-question questionnaire some Australian authors came up with it
00:10:06,00:10:12,and it measures persuadability and insensitivity to untrustworthiness and but the questions are
00:10:12,00:10:17,really they're all things like my friends think I'm easily fooled do you disagree agree strong
00:10:17,00:10:22,you agree and basically if you answer yes to those questions or that you agree with them you're
00:10:22,00:10:26,gullible. Really? Which is weird because I would have thought gullible people wouldn't automatically
00:10:26,00:10:30,know it. No because as soon as you know that you're gullible surely you can start correcting your
00:10:30,00:10:37,gullipidacy. No I know I'm gullible and I can't stop it. If you guys decide to tell me some
00:10:37,00:10:42,bullshit on this show I will believe it until I see you the smile on your face. What do you think
00:10:42,00:10:49,about this? We are in the midst of a high frequency blossoming of interconnectedness that will give us
00:10:49,00:10:55,access to the quantum soup itself. What do you think of that sentence? I don't fully what's the quantum
00:10:55,00:11:01,soup is that like primary? Maybe you're not that gullible because apparently people who take that
00:11:01,00:11:06,kind of bullshit aphorism and think that it's quite deep are people who rate more highly on this
00:11:06,00:11:13,gullibility scale. Okay so I'm still gullible I'd be like the leader of the gullibles I'd be going
00:11:13,00:11:20,whoa whoa whoa whoa I know how that sounds guys but I don't think that's right. I've not had that soup.
00:11:20,00:11:26,You know that do you remember that old joke at school which was the gullible you know the world
00:11:26,00:11:30,gullible isn't in the dictionary? Did you know that OED published a special edition where they
00:11:30,00:11:40,took it out of the dictionary? No they didn't. Wait think of the labor involved in printing an entire
00:11:40,00:11:46,new edition of the dictionary just for one joke it doesn't stack up. I just want to point out that
00:11:46,00:11:51,Dan was the first one who spotted that and so I think well done you're not as gullible as we all
00:11:51,00:11:56,think well they're actually apparently humans aren't too gullible we all have this conception that
00:11:56,00:12:00,we're really gullible and more is falling for stuff but studies seem to show that we're actually
00:12:00,00:12:06,too skeptical and so there's been a bunch of things that so fake news is often used as an example
00:12:06,00:12:11,of how we're too gullible we believe this stuff we change our voting habits but all the studies
00:12:11,00:12:16,that have really been done on fake news over the last few years have showed that it didn't impact
00:12:16,00:12:21,elections at all because people only ever consumed the sort of fake news that already accorded with
00:12:21,00:12:25,what they believed so it wasn't like they were reading stuff and going oh my god Hillary Clinton
00:12:25,00:12:32,really is a lizard it was like they already thought she was probably a lizard it's just confirmed it
00:12:32,00:12:38,but actually we're too skeptical so there's a very famous psychologist called Julian Rotter
00:12:38,00:12:44,who died quite recently but he said that the more trustful you are the more successful you are in life
00:12:44,00:12:49,and the better you are at determining if someone is trustworthy or if something's worth supporting
00:12:49,00:12:53,because you've practiced it so people who are more trusting generally they practice it through
00:12:53,00:12:58,life and then you learn who to trust and who not to trust whereas the cynics who just think oh god
00:12:58,00:13:03,everyone's a liar everyone's trying to jeep me they actually have no idea and they lose out
00:13:03,00:13:07,because of that so Anna are you saying that me and Nandi are really great because we fell for your
00:13:07,00:13:13,dictionary prank sounds like it really smart and let me talk to you afterwards about a scheme I've
00:13:13,00:13:18,got up and running but Dan is the cynic and he's just like he's living in his barrel
00:13:19,00:13:29,yeah I'm like don't know oh god it always comes back to diogenesis isn't it um there was a dictionary
00:13:29,00:13:36,scam back in the day where uh Huxters would go around a pubs getting into uh getting money off
00:13:36,00:13:40,people with a dictionary based bet okay so the idea is three of you go into the pub you all pretend
00:13:40,00:13:44,you don't know each other you just start you know sit at different places it's quite easy for us
00:13:44,00:13:52,yeah three of us I've gone home um and then one of one of you guys will start repeatedly using the
00:13:52,00:13:58,word unfortunate okay let's say Dan keep saying it's really unfortunate about this and then James
00:13:58,00:14:05,or Anna will lean over and say excuse me I think it's unfortunate bingo exactly and then Dan will
00:14:05,00:14:09,say it's pretty unfortunate that you're such an idiot or whatever and you get into this
00:14:09,00:14:17,big argument I can only afford James I've also been quite drunk when I said that you get this huge
00:14:17,00:14:22,route and obviously you get everyone else involved and you start putting money on it and then Dan
00:14:22,00:14:27,pulls out his dictionary which does have the word unfortunate in it because it's an old version
00:14:27,00:14:30,of the word and then you get the money in it and then it works as other comments of this story
00:14:30,00:14:35,shall he she's the one with a dictionary I've been at the bar this whole time I got really bored
00:14:35,00:14:40,very early on in this chat and I went to talk to some people at the bar it must be the case that she
00:14:40,00:14:46,happens to be a dictionary salesman who has a dictionary for the wise what's about to be in there
00:14:46,00:14:51,that's even better yeah yeah that's the first one and that's the third person is just for audience
00:14:51,00:14:55,purposes to cheer people on it's sort of to get more people involved in the bed hey come and look
00:14:55,00:15:05,at the argument these guys are having and is there a whole history of that like is that a
00:15:05,00:15:11,gang that went round the dictionary gang yeah yeah this is a what-off incident no I think some people
00:15:11,00:15:16,have used it repeatedly but I don't think it was a massive because if it's the trend only lasts
00:15:16,00:15:20,until everyone has heard of it because there are hundreds of gangs going around the pubs
00:15:20,00:15:27,doing the unfortunate play oh man that's it during gang wars I wouldn't want to be in that gang
00:15:27,00:15:33,have you not watched gangs have blended recently there's one episode where the dictionary
00:15:33,00:15:40,gang comes along it's it's the least violent of all the episodes I have to say hey you could get
00:15:40,00:15:44,some pretty big dictionaries you could do some serious damage with the full edition of the OED
00:15:44,00:15:54,yeah kill someone yeah sticks and stones maybe yeah um I found um a gullible person who fell
00:15:54,00:16:00,for a scam have you guys heard of this guy in New York a few years ago sued a psychic for fraud
00:16:01,00:16:07,it's I mean it is sad but in 2015 he sued the psychic because over the years he'd given her over
00:16:07,00:16:15,"$700,000 because he wanted her to make the woman that he fancied fall in love with him it's an old"
00:16:15,00:16:19,"classic Shakespearean tale he should have just given the 700,000 to the girl"
00:16:19,00:16:27,she James women can't be bought I agree but it's worth a try rather than giving it to a psychic
00:16:29,00:16:34,that should have been his for at least the person you like has got a lot of dash yeah he was actually he's
00:16:34,00:16:37,walking down the street to New York thing this is really sad I've told the woman I really love her
00:16:37,00:16:41,and she said she has no interest in me whatsoever and he passed a sign saying psychic with a flashing
00:16:41,00:16:46,arrow and so you already know he's a bit gullible he walked in and this psychic just managed to convince
00:16:46,00:16:53,"him for instance to fork out um $40,000 so she could do him a fake funeral to convince the bad"
00:16:53,00:16:57,spirits that he had died so that they stopped plaguing him and let the woman fall in love with him
00:16:57,00:17:02,why don't invite the woman he fancied to the fake funeral and see if she was sad that he died
00:17:02,00:17:06,and then he bursts out of the coffin come on and then that is the woman he fancied I don't think I've
00:17:06,00:17:11,got another that is never gonna work is it in a romance that's how my wife and I got together
00:17:11,00:17:18,true story yeah I think you might risk the woman thinking you're a widow which this guy definitely
00:17:18,00:17:25,"wasn't to be clear um he also paid $80,000 for an 80 mile long bridge made of gold to lure the"
00:17:25,00:17:30,spirits into the other realm and then say that sounds like quite a good deal for a bridge made of
00:17:30,00:17:35,gold an incredible bargain yeah that's so cheap it is I think I the thing is the bridge made of gold
00:17:35,00:17:39,didn't really exist in this realm so you can never get the evidence that it has been built
00:17:39,00:17:49,a bridge yeah much cheaper than bridge much less did the guy did he not see the psychic
00:17:49,00:17:55,increasingly turning up in fur coats in matterities and all of this stuff and she's like I bought them
00:17:55,00:18:02,in the other realm it's much cheaper over there eventually I've been fucked up another 90 grand
00:18:02,00:18:06,for a longer bridge because the spirits weren't going over this one um halfway through this the
00:18:06,00:18:13,woman he was in love with very sadly died and the psychic thought quickly on her feet and said
00:18:13,00:18:18,oh well don't worry we'll just have to pay a bit extra for my reincarnation machine to be built
00:18:18,00:18:25,and so creepy no this is a terrible story it it it is awful and it was only when she said she built
00:18:25,00:18:29,this reincarnation machine and Michelle this woman you're in love with is now inside this new
00:18:29,00:18:35,woman you've just met and he said I met the new woman and I thought she doesn't seem like Michelle
00:18:35,00:18:39,at all and that was when I started to think the psychic wasn't who she was purporting to be
00:18:39,00:18:44,right god how did this guy have access to seven hundred thousand dollars in the first
00:18:44,00:18:53,nutman is now the president of the United States okay it is time for fact number two and that is
00:18:53,00:19:01,Anna my fact this week is that in 2011 former Paralympian Josh Sundquist who's missing his left leg
00:19:01,00:19:08,announced that he'd found his soulmate i.e someone missing a right leg with whom he can split pairs
00:19:08,00:19:14,of shoes I don't know how I sort of came across this but I was watching his YouTube channel so Josh
00:19:14,00:19:21,is a he was a Paralympian skier and now an author and a comedian and public speaker and he sort of
00:19:21,00:19:25,posted a video saying he's got these piles of shoes he's been saving up for years because obviously
00:19:25,00:19:30,you can't buy one shoe but he only needs one so he's got loads of right shoes and he'd been looking
00:19:30,00:19:35,for someone who could wear them and then he found living in the same city as him a chap called
00:19:35,00:19:43,Stephen missing a right leg same shoe size and crucially same taste in shoes so they had a lovely
00:19:43,00:19:48,meet-up well they did some swapsies that's great that's great it's a beautiful story although it was
00:19:48,00:19:53,quite I mean I think he might have been conned to be fair because he'd obviously been saving up his
00:19:53,00:19:58,right shoes over the years Josh and so he came with this giant mountain whereas Stephen wasn't
00:19:58,00:20:04,expecting the soulmate reunion so he'd presumably chopped away all his left shoes so he only gave
00:20:04,00:20:10,Joshua one shoe so it was sort of a one shoe and exchange for about 50 shoes there are charities out
00:20:10,00:20:16,there where you can so if you have lost a leg or lost a foot but also if you have a pair of
00:20:16,00:20:20,feet that are different sizes like we all do but some people much bigger than others
00:20:20,00:20:26,there are some places where you can you can match up with people with the opposite-sized feet to
00:20:26,00:20:32,you oh really yeah in a moment there's something called the national odd shoe exchange which is
00:20:32,00:20:39,nose NOSE and they put people together with mismatch feet and in the UK there's something called Joe's
00:20:39,00:20:45,odd shoes which is on Facebook where all you have to do is pay postage and packaging and they'll
00:20:45,00:20:50,send you a single shoe very cool it's a bit weird isn't it usually when you do those acronyms
00:20:50,00:20:57,it usually works out of something like foot it's a bit odd to get it for nose yeah absolutely right
00:20:57,00:21:04,they should well maybe they have this conversation footwear odd one out trading and it's
00:21:04,00:21:10,foot except foot is also the beginning of footwear so it's achieved apart from odd one out has got
00:21:10,00:21:20,three oz in a row so it'll be food so that's that's Josh great guy but I was I was sort of looking
00:21:20,00:21:26,into prosthetics and there's some really cool prosthetics out there that you can get so if you
00:21:26,00:21:33,guys heard of this woman called Sophie de Oliveira Berrata no she's got this thing called the alternative
00:21:33,00:21:38,limb project and she's basically an artist is in North London and she makes these bespoke limbs
00:21:38,00:21:43,and she was she was inspired to do it she had this client who was a little girl who had one leg
00:21:43,00:21:48,and every year she'd come for an upgraded leg because she was growing and she started asking for
00:21:48,00:21:53,she asked at first for pepper pigs at the top of her leg pictures of pepper pig eating ice cream
00:21:53,00:21:57,and so Sophie was like yeah sure whatever and then she came back the next year and asked for
00:21:57,00:22:01,a Christmas scene at the top which I think is very short termist and she's going to regret that
00:22:01,00:22:07,in February but whatever um and this woman Sophie thought well this is great what a good idea and
00:22:07,00:22:13,so she was inspired by Inspector Gadget because you know he makes yeah he makes gadgets yeah um and so
00:22:13,00:22:20,legs doesn't he sometimes exactly so she makes long arms and legs and special arms and legs
00:22:20,00:22:25,and so for one guy she made a hyper realistic foot that look really like his own foot and she got
00:22:25,00:22:30,hairs off the back of his neck and put them on the toes not many people in history have ever
00:22:30,00:22:34,looked at their toes and gone that isn't hairy enough can we put my hairs on that please
00:22:34,00:22:42,so the the I guess one of the next front is in prosthetic bone development is is how to incorporate
00:22:42,00:22:48,feeling and how to incorporate automatic responses so there's one recent development
00:22:48,00:22:54,research at Newcastle University came up with this it's got an AI camera inside it it's a hand
00:22:54,00:23:02,or an arm fitting and it can recognize hundreds of objects using the camera and when you move to
00:23:02,00:23:07,grab something with your prosthetic arm it automatically moves into the right position to grasp it
00:23:07,00:23:11,so if you're reaching for a pair of tweezers it'll move into a pinch position or if you're reaching
00:23:11,00:23:15,for a volleyball it'll move into a sort of spread hand position so you can pick it up like that
00:23:15,00:23:20,sounds unbelievable and it can be trained to you know develop more and more positions can you
00:23:20,00:23:25,can you sort of code it so that if it's reaching for your 10th toffee crisp of the night it will
00:23:25,00:23:31,be used to clap down on it or something and we don't have time for your toffee crisp problem
00:23:31,00:23:34,maybe if you had to send that letter to so many people you wouldn't have so many to get through
00:23:38,00:23:45,a toffee crisp no one mentions toffee crisp chocolate I agree they're the best they I'm not sure
00:23:45,00:23:52,I've ever had one what oh my god that's like me not what you'd eat Jesus Christ we we definitely
00:23:52,00:23:56,don't have time for the fact that you've never eaten toffee crisp they're the they are one of the one
00:23:56,00:24:02,of the very best are they I reckon even asthma would agree with that I was reading up about Aaron
00:24:02,00:24:09,Ralston you guys remember Aaron Ralston a 127 hours yeah I remember that oh yeah yeah so he was the
00:24:09,00:24:15,the mountaineer slash adventurer who fell down a little gap between some boulders a boulders
00:24:15,00:24:21,a boulder collapsed on his arm and he had to cut himself free and so he now when you see pictures
00:24:21,00:24:26,of him if he goes mountaineering he has a prosthetic that has a little pick on the end oh wow
00:24:26,00:24:31,they went back and they actually recovered his arm so it was stuck under this boulder they managed
00:24:31,00:24:36,to winch it out winch the boulder up and get his arm back and they cremated it there on the spot
00:24:36,00:24:42,and he scattered the ashes symbolically all over the area so that's really nice but the the little
00:24:42,00:24:46,fact that I really like that I've discovered about him is his current place of residence he lives
00:24:46,00:24:55,in a place called boulder cholera no one lasting on prosthetics I was I was amazed to learn about
00:24:55,00:25:00,there's a big comedian back in the early days of American comedy during the silent era called
00:25:00,00:25:06,Harold Lloyd and Harold Lloyd was at the time more famous than Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin he
00:25:06,00:25:11,was he was the one who was pulling in most money at the box office and what I didn't know is that
00:25:11,00:25:16,he lost two of his fingers he lost his thumb and his index finger when he was doing publicity for
00:25:16,00:25:23,a film of his called haunted spooks he stood in the photo with a prop bomb in his hand which
00:25:23,00:25:29,turned out to be a real bomb no yes for the fuse later minutes what kind of what kind of prop
00:25:29,00:25:34,department has two boxes one with prop bombs and one with real bombs and accidentally takes out
00:25:34,00:25:40,the wrong one how do you how do you end up in that situation now what we've done is we've labeled
00:25:40,00:25:47,the prop bombs with a key and we've labeled the real bombs with a lower case don't put them upside
00:25:47,00:25:55,down next to each other was that someone simultaneously in the middle of a battle somewhere throwing the
00:25:55,00:26:05,prop bomb yeah so it it's wet on his hand yeah it took off his thumb it took off his index finger
00:26:05,00:26:09,temporarily blinded him he took eight months to recover and then they built a glove for him which
00:26:09,00:26:17,had the thumb and the finger and the most famous surviving sequence or even image that will
00:26:17,00:26:24,know of Harold Lloyd as him hanging off a clock yeah face he did that with a prosthetic thumb and
00:26:24,00:26:34,and finger it was after that that is a public saying I'd never heard that yeah okay it is time for
00:26:34,00:26:39,fact number three and that is Andy my fact is that you can now diagnose a urinary
00:26:39,00:26:46,tract infection using a fidget spinner finally I can get all my old fidget spinners out
00:26:46,00:26:51,oh yeah that is worth a customized right customized fidget spinner don't go pissing on your
00:26:51,00:26:55,children's match of spinners oh what what do you mean children
00:26:55,00:27:01,adults as well where they don't piss on any fidget spinners whether they're the children's
00:27:01,00:27:07,addition to all the special adult fidget spinners that James owns the erotic fidget spinners
00:27:07,00:27:15,you can't I saw sorry to interrupt when you haven't even told us a fact yet but because I didn't
00:27:15,00:27:19,write this down because I didn't think it would come up but did you see that there was a you know
00:27:19,00:27:25,like they call pasties or pasties that erotic dancers put on their nipples and spin them around
00:27:25,00:27:33,pasties yeah cornered pasties yeah it happens mostly in Cornwall yeah the strippers do this but they
00:27:33,00:27:38,made one with fidget spinners didn't they which liked fidget spinned around when they twelped their
00:27:38,00:27:45,breasts gosh yeah so you can get adult fidget spinners is what you say yeah they're not the ones I have
00:27:45,00:27:54,though Andy what is the how does this work well this is a new scientific development basically it's
00:27:54,00:28:00,it's a it's a pain diagnosing urinary tract infections it can take sometimes days to get the
00:28:00,00:28:06,results back and scientists are always looking for ways to improve the process so this is a way
00:28:06,00:28:11,of detecting pathogens in someone's urine which might reveal if they've got an infection um so
00:28:11,00:28:15,and what you need is detectors that are cheap and simple and accurate and that's what this
00:28:15,00:28:23,new one is they custom made this team a fidget spinner um where you you pee in the spinner uh
00:28:23,00:28:32,no no yeah yeah unless your aim is phenomenal you pee in a jug uh and then the jug is yeah a bit of
00:28:32,00:28:39,it's poured into the fidget spinner and it it spins uh it spins around obviously and the the
00:28:39,00:28:45,centrifugal force pushes the urine sample outwards and it pushes it through a little internal membrane
00:28:45,00:28:52,inside the spinner and the membrane is is fine enough to stop bacteria which can tell you whether
00:28:52,00:28:56,you've got one of these infections and then all you need to do is add a little bit of a die which turns
00:28:56,00:29:00,the bacteria orange you look at the membrane a little bit later if there's orange on the membrane
00:29:00,00:29:04,you have these bacteria and you know that you've got the infection i would have that day to die which
00:29:04,00:29:11,is a colour that's less similar to the colour of urine yeah how orange is people's urine these days
00:29:11,00:29:18,more orange than it is purple James I know you're a sunny D for that too much look it's for adults as
00:29:18,00:29:26,well as children so do you know I mean yeah that would make sense to you I do I imagine that other
00:29:26,00:29:32,other dies are also available but the the good news is that it cuts the test times to under an
00:29:32,00:29:38,hour and it does also mean that people don't get diagnosed antibiotics unnecessarily maybe in the
00:29:38,00:29:42,interim while they're waiting for the results so doctors might say oh just take something's anyway
00:29:42,00:29:46,which is a bad thing because it leads to antibiotic resistance so yeah this is a good finally we've
00:29:46,00:29:52,found a use for the fidget spinner three years later is it commercially available can we all buy one
00:29:52,00:29:57,no no you can't it's just been invented sorry no and also I think you probably want a medical
00:29:57,00:30:03,professional to do your diagnosis of UTIs rather than just pissing on your own fidget spinner
00:30:03,00:30:08,oh yeah it's something I do that you could get it like a pregnancy test you know and you'd be
00:30:08,00:30:13,able to buy one and then piss on it and then maybe you could lay with it yeah I guess you could
00:30:14,00:30:19,I guess yeah or just they're issued to doctors who know how to administer the tests but either way
00:30:19,00:30:25,I think everyone should be their own doctor oh god it sounds really simple give it a spin pour the
00:30:25,00:30:30,dye in what are we what am I missing wow you've already got the slogan yeah one thing that they
00:30:30,00:30:35,think it might work for in the future is also viral infections so hopefully this technology in
00:30:35,00:30:41,the future you'll be able to use with saliva instead of urine and you'll be able to detect viruses
00:30:41,00:30:46,if you get your mesh fine enough your membrane fine enough then it will be able to find viruses so
00:30:46,00:30:50,it might be that if there's a viral infection going around then you'll be able to use something
00:30:50,00:30:56,like this to tell whether you have that that's great because fidget spinners have had a bad
00:30:56,00:31:01,rep and a lot of corners over the years haven't they they've been sort of banned quite a lot of
00:31:01,00:31:05,places quite love schools in America went through a phase of banning them for big really distracting
00:31:05,00:31:10,for kids there were lots of warnings that some of them were dangerous do you remember there were
00:31:10,00:31:16,various fidget spinners came out that were a bit like ninja stars that had sort of pointed ends
00:31:16,00:31:23,and there was actually this woman who was employed to test them a test a blade expert
00:31:23,00:31:28,apparently called Sarah Haynesworth who BBC Watchdog made her test these things to see if they could
00:31:28,00:31:34,penetrate skin or eyeballs and her job and only Xbox to attempt this was to get a fidget spinner
00:31:34,00:31:39,and stab a tomato with it which apparently represents an eyeball and then stab some pork skin
00:31:39,00:31:44,with it the represents human skin so interesting because I have some fidget spinners in my house
00:31:44,00:31:50,and I've also been trained how to throw ninja stars so I can actually try and I have some tomatoes
00:31:50,00:31:54,you're qualified do you say that anyone can do this Sarah well again I think everyone should be
00:31:54,00:31:59,their own blade tester as well as their own doctor so yes you should start stabbing tomatoes
00:31:59,00:32:04,awesome wow the trick is in the flick of the wrist at the end just in case you hold it like
00:32:04,00:32:08,between your thumb and your first finger and then you throw it and then you flick your wrist at
00:32:08,00:32:13,the last second and then it helps it to spin and hence it stick into things that's like flooring a knife
00:32:13,00:32:18,that's why Harold Lloyd could never have become a ninja after his terrible publicity accident
00:32:18,00:32:25,you did have two hands good point that's why Harold Lloyd would have had to be ambidextrous if he
00:32:25,00:32:31,was to realise his ambition of becoming a ninja it's ironic that the one famous thing about him
00:32:31,00:32:37,is he's on a clock which does have two hands wow that is such a slap in the face isn't it
00:32:38,00:32:44,we we wrote about fidget spinners at the height of their of their craves back in 2017 in our first
00:32:44,00:32:49,book of the year in james you found out this thing which is that of all the top 25 toys on amazon
00:32:49,00:32:57,dot code dot uk all of them were fidget spinners yeah and I went to check up amazon today just to see
00:32:57,00:33:04,where they sit in the top 100 and not a single fidget spinner has stayed in the top 100 really
00:33:04,00:33:10,but yeah and the top toy at the moment is a black balloon that's in the shape of a zero I think you
00:33:10,00:33:14,can get it multicolored but that's the image that you're met with that's quite a nihilist thing to
00:33:14,00:33:23,give to a child is black zero happy birthday but it did last longer than everyone thought so that was
00:33:23,00:33:30,2017 where it was at its peak but in 2019 fidget spinners still accounted for a fifth of all toy sales
00:33:30,00:33:36,what wow really it's amazing I was looking at other toys that can be used for medical uses
00:33:36,00:33:43,and I found a paper called a novel method for the removal of ear ceremony so that's ear wax
00:33:43,00:33:50,okay what time might be used to remove the wax okay yes yes yes I'm a yo-yo but a very small
00:33:50,00:33:58,yo-yo that you just got a dip in the ear it's a good first guess um okay quite right now um um so
00:33:58,00:34:02,something oh something absorbent or something with little scraping edge yeah you mean scraping
00:34:02,00:34:08,like a Lego man's hand you know you can go in with that pincer grip it's got a pincer grip on it
00:34:08,00:34:13,doesn't it that's good yeah oh oh silly putty just putting so much silly putty that the ear wax is
00:34:13,00:34:18,forced out so have you guys never had any issues with ear wax I think you haven't because you don't
00:34:18,00:34:23,seem to know what they actually use in real life you suck it out but I'm trying to think it's
00:34:23,00:34:30,something that you suck and that's a toy a straw one of those really fun straws they don't suck it out
00:34:30,00:34:35,my doctor's all have massive mouths and they just put their entire mouth around your ear
00:34:35,00:34:39,and it's a heavy hoover and they just stick it to your head and they have to stop before the
00:34:39,00:34:44,brain comes out um no it's going to be it's going to be a it's going to be a fake doctor's syringe
00:34:44,00:34:52,maybe exactly they syringe it out normally yeah and what it is is a super-sulka max D5000
00:34:52,00:34:59,wow um this is a guy who um he was living on an island and the child had real problems with ear wax
00:34:59,00:35:06,and he couldn't get to the um doctors to get a syringe quickly enough so he said the owner of a
00:35:06,00:35:11,super-sulka max D5000 was sought out after hearing an explanation of its intended application
00:35:11,00:35:18,he granted permission for its use verbal consent was obtained from the patient he then changed
00:35:18,00:35:24,into swimming shorts located himself on an ideal location on the deck and held a Tupperware container
00:35:24,00:35:31,product number 1611 slash 16 to the side of his neck the super-sulka max D5000 was filled with
00:35:31,00:35:37,body temperature water and then mildly pressurized using the blue hand pump the trigger was depressed
00:35:37,00:35:42,releasing a gentle narrow jet of water which was aimed along the posterior wall of the ear canal
00:35:42,00:35:47,and then after 15 seconds bits of wax started coming out and it worked I might do that that's great
00:35:47,00:35:53,I think don't do that this was a medically trained professional uh-huh and this is a thing that
00:35:53,00:35:58,happened then it is in a medical paper but I think if you do have ear wax problems maybe you should
00:35:58,00:36:03,consult a profession you guys are so boring don't piss in my fidgets videos don't
00:36:03,00:36:10,get the circus in my head um do you know what the best selling doll of 1976 was you'll be
00:36:10,00:36:19,surprised oh 1976 was it a rich Nixon doll was oh that was very that I was about to say very close
00:36:19,00:36:26,it's not very close was it a um when was star was 77 so maybe it wasn't yeah it wasn't
00:36:26,00:36:32,the blue skywalker oh I don't oh oh the exorcist didn't that come out in 70 oh nice okay well
00:36:32,00:36:38,you're all kind of getting closer it is it is a pop culture thing it was share oh what's it really
00:36:38,00:36:43,yeah there were sunny and shareholders and um the share one was very customizable had different
00:36:43,00:36:48,outfits and things and it was hugely popular really the best selling doll of the entire year was
00:36:48,00:36:56,share that makes sense yeah I am surprised Andy I just don't have I don't have any references that
00:36:56,00:37:01,I can make jokes about share no I'm just trying to think of a single share song shoot shoot song
00:37:01,00:37:05,is the only one I could think yeah the famous one with Sonny Bono what was that the duet I got you
00:37:05,00:37:11,babe I got you babe yeah yeah I was just imagining being a parent and having two kids and I own
00:37:11,00:37:15,one share doll and convincing them it was called share because they had to share it I'm sorry I
00:37:15,00:37:27,switched off and went there okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James okay my
00:37:27,00:37:34,fact this week is that Al Capone ran a soup kitchen during the Great Depression he served beef on
00:37:34,00:37:40,Thanksgiving in 1930 because there had just been a theft of 1000 turkeys nearby and he didn't want
00:37:40,00:37:49,the authorities to think it was him makes sense yeah and he had to do something with the 50 cows
00:37:49,00:37:57,even it didn't he that's probably more like it um so yeah um Al Capone Chicago gangster
00:37:57,00:38:05,public enemy number one um bad guy killed lots of his enemies uh especially in the St Valentine's
00:38:05,00:38:11,Day massacre in 1929 but like a lot of these people who were bad guys he had this kind of Robin Hood
00:38:11,00:38:18,reputation where he would give to charity in the local area and the idea I think sometimes is that
00:38:18,00:38:23,he's less likely to get ratted out if people like him although it has to be said that this soup
00:38:23,00:38:27,kitchen although it definitely existed he might have not paid any money for it because he could have
00:38:27,00:38:35,like leaned on some local businesses to donate their beef and whatever uh because obviously that
00:38:35,00:38:41,extortion was a lot of his a lot of his stick so he might have said to you guys you better give me
00:38:41,00:38:46,some stuff for my charity or else so that's a negative portrayal of Al Capone
00:38:46,00:38:52,on the other hand it was a soup kitchen it was a soup kitchen yeah and yeah they gave breakfast
00:38:52,00:38:59,"lunch and dinner to um over 2,000 people in Chicago every single day uh and the newspapers kind of were"
00:38:59,00:39:03,not sure about it because on one hand they thought obviously this is a good thing that people
00:39:03,00:39:09,are being fed but on the bad hand they could see him becoming like the mayor of Chicago if people
00:39:09,00:39:13,liked him too much and they thought if a gangster becomes the mayor of our city then we could be
00:39:13,00:39:17,in real trouble yeah he was sort of Dave facto mayor for quite a while wasn't he in the he ran
00:39:17,00:39:22,the city essentially well yeah he didn't really need to become there because he had a guy called
00:39:22,00:39:28,William H Thompson who was known as Big Bell and basically Al Capone funded him and made sure that
00:39:28,00:39:34,he stayed in place and Big Bell was um sometimes known as Kaiser Bell because he was very pro German
00:39:34,00:39:40,during World War One and in the 1920s he threatened to punch the British king in the snoot
00:39:42,00:39:48,mind you it's not the worst war in which to be pro German to be fair to him no there'd been
00:39:48,00:39:55,worse one since yeah I just I find Al Capone so amazing how it's like he conforms to all the gangster
00:39:55,00:40:01,cliches and the fact that he could just commit multiple murders and everyone know and no one be
00:40:01,00:40:06,able to do anything about it I mean he he's shot people in you know open public there was one of his
00:40:06,00:40:12,rivals he just went down into a bar and shot him in the head and everyone saw everyone knew he'd
00:40:12,00:40:17,done it but no one's going to say anything they were all distracted by an argument about dictionary
00:40:17,00:40:22,going on in the other car the newspapers reported it as an unfortunate
00:40:22,00:40:28,Anna I wonder though if you've got that right you're probably right but I wonder if you've got
00:40:28,00:40:33,that wrong in when you say he conformed to the cliches I wonder if Al Capone invented the cliches
00:40:33,00:40:38,yeah you're right yeah all the movies born off the back of his life and of all the gangsters of
00:40:38,00:40:44,that time or what inform us about the mafia yeah so he kind of invented cliché yeah I didn't know
00:40:44,00:40:49,that he was called Scarface I mean I'm sure anyone who you know has read a bit about it didn't
00:40:49,00:40:53,know that but yeah I didn't know that he had the big scars and the first film called Scarface was
00:40:53,00:40:59,about him I don't know either he hated the name well so yeah yes he did yeah and he got he got the
00:40:59,00:41:05,scars on his face from insulting a lady the the brother of a lady was taken aback and slashed his face
00:41:05,00:41:10,but he used to claim that he got it as a result of some service time in the army because he didn't
00:41:10,00:41:18,want to just admit that he was you know lost a battle in the fight where he got scarred Al Capone
00:41:18,00:41:24,his brother James Capone kind of got in involved in it and pushed the guy who who scarred him through
00:41:24,00:41:31,a glass window because obviously he just cut his brother and he was so worried that this guy was
00:41:31,00:41:36,going to come back and get him that he fled the city and joined the circus and then he served in
00:41:36,00:41:43,World War One and then after the war he changed his name after his favourite cowboy and became a
00:41:43,00:41:49,prohibition agent and basically spent his whole time stopping people from moving alcohol around
00:41:49,00:41:53,which is where Al Capone got most of his money but he didn't realise that that happened because of
00:41:53,00:41:59,that time Al Capone wasn't really famous for that kind of thing and so he only later found out that
00:41:59,00:42:04,his brother who he'd left after that fight when he was 16 years old had become the greatest mobster
00:42:04,00:42:10,and he had become one of the big prohibition agents there needs to be a film that imagines the
00:42:10,00:42:16,meeting between them where he knows he's arresting this huge prohibition breaker and suddenly they
00:42:16,00:42:22,meet face to face he was called Vincenzo Capone wasn't he this guy originally and then he
00:42:22,00:42:29,he became Richard Hart but there were so many Capones I think eight or nine Capone siblings in all
00:42:29,00:42:33,and the last member of the family alive or she was alive in 2012 and no she is still alive because
00:42:33,00:42:42,she's on Twitter is Deirdre Capone wow the most harmless name Deirdre why no she defends Al Capone's
00:42:42,00:42:47,reputation which I think is an uphill battle and she's written a book saying he was a mobster not a
00:42:47,00:42:52,monster and she's written a book all about him which includes recipes like meatballs alacapone
00:42:53,00:42:59,wow but and and these days she's just retweeting you know like dogs and meditation she has a
00:42:59,00:43:05,Twitter account so weird that a Capone family member should be judged by your by your grandparents should
00:43:05,00:43:12,you really oh or your Twitter account I'd just like to make very clear he was quite a family man
00:43:12,00:43:18,though again as the cliches then played out he had that typical I've got a wife who theoretically
00:43:18,00:43:23,doesn't know anything that's going on but maybe she knows everything he was he really loved his son
00:43:23,00:43:30,so his son had hearing damage probably because it was congenital syphilus contracted from Al Capone
00:43:30,00:43:35,which he famously had and he spent a hundred thousand dollars fixing his sons hearing in 1925
00:43:35,00:43:39,when he didn't he bet didn't even really have huge amounts per se he was a family guy but his
00:43:39,00:43:45,syphilus was a much bigger part of his life than his gang time wasn't it I could can we say that for
00:43:45,00:43:54,short time wise total time okay my sorry it was a longer part of his life you're right okay say
00:43:54,00:43:58,biographers are always complaining why do they always focus on the gangster years it's more about
00:43:58,00:44:03,his rancid penis I think of myself as a syphilus patient who happens to be in the
00:44:03,00:44:13,well I think by the end he basically couldn't think of himself as anything he was it was so awful
00:44:13,00:44:19,I didn't sort of realize the symptoms of untreated syphilus but by the time he went to prison in 1930
00:44:19,00:44:24,he was starting to really suffer from it there's a theory that one of the reasons he was moved from
00:44:24,00:44:28,Atlanta prison to Alcatraz where he was famously sent it's actually that he was being bullied
00:44:28,00:44:33,in Atlanta the Atlanta prison because he was very weak and he was starting to lose his faculties
00:44:33,00:44:38,because of this syphilus and his cellmate had to protect him because you know everyone else
00:44:38,00:44:41,was bullying him and so he was accused of a special treatment because this cellmate was protecting him
00:44:41,00:44:47,so he was shifted but yeah by by the time he got to Alcatraz he was having problems he was one of
00:44:47,00:44:52,the first people ever to be treated with penicillin in 1940s for it yeah have you heard of his lawyer
00:44:52,00:44:57,or one of his lawyers I'm sure you know it's a cool time if it's Charlie Chaplin yes
00:44:57,00:45:08,he was called Hiram Mendo no no okay um so he defended him in a trial I think in 1930 which was when
00:45:08,00:45:11,they first nabbed him you know they eventually got him for tax evasion but they first got him for
00:45:11,00:45:19,unlicensed ownership of a gun or something anyway this is the earlier trial that was in about 1930
00:45:19,00:45:26,guess when Hiram Mendo retired okay so he must have been at least 30 then and he retire when he's
00:45:26,00:45:40,65 so he retired in 1965 he retired in 1994 yes he he died in 2001 aged 107 but he kept practicing
00:45:40,00:45:46,law until he was a hundred years old oh my gosh I know was he Donald Trump's lawyer he just feels
00:45:46,00:45:51,at the kind of guy he definitely must have been Donald Trump's lawyer at some point he wasn't he
00:45:51,00:45:57,was just amazing his working life he started working when he was six at the age of in 1900 and he
00:45:57,00:46:04,kept working for 94 years he wasn't working as a lawyer when he was six did clarify who would you
00:46:04,00:46:11,rather have the six-year-old liar rather one hundred year old liar there was he had another lawyer
00:46:11,00:46:17,who was called Edward O'Hare who testified against him in court not a good lawyer oh wow that's not
00:46:17,00:46:22,the kind of lawyer what and he's slightly a notable character not just for his connection to
00:46:22,00:46:28,Capone but his son is called Edward but show hair junior off which O'Hare airport in Chicago is
00:46:28,00:46:36,named after he was a yeah he was a Medal of Honor fighter pilot who single-handedly shot down
00:46:36,00:46:42,eight Japanese bombers so he was a hero for Chicago why did his lawyer testify against him though
00:46:42,00:46:45,that does seem like a bit of a rookie mistake I'm sure he wasn't representing him anymore at that
00:46:45,00:46:57,point I call to the stand me I'll capone the only time he got shot
00:46:57,00:47:04,was when he shot himself wasn't it he shot himself by accident 1928 it had a golf game
00:47:04,00:47:08,so James golf dangerous game you've got to be careful and playing on Saturday
00:47:08,00:47:15,well try not to put your gun to near your golf clubs in the bag because that's how he did it he
00:47:15,00:47:20,it's the details are slightly unclear but we think that after a round of golf he got into his car
00:47:20,00:47:24,and he opened his golf bag and fiddled around and he was keeping his gun in there as well
00:47:24,00:47:28,and he shot himself and he shot himself sort of multiple times I think through the groin and through
00:47:28,00:47:36,the why why why did he keep shooting off the first that doesn't stack up Anna it really doesn't
00:47:36,00:47:42,I think he had multiple wounds maybe the bullet went in and out and in and out kind of like a
00:47:42,00:47:47,sewing needle or if you press your finger on a trigger accidentally can it deploy multiple bullets
00:47:47,00:47:52,it's a machine gun it can yeah I wouldn't keep a machine gun in the golf bag if afterwards someone
00:47:52,00:48:01,said did you get a hole in one and he said a hole in one of my testicles yeah he wasn't he wasn't a
00:48:01,00:48:08,funny guy he I read it one coupon biography this thing that gang habit that gangsters had in the
00:48:08,00:48:14,20s that Brooklyn gangsters had which apparently they devoted huge amounts of time to so and this
00:48:14,00:48:20,is also in a book about Brooklyn gangs but I couldn't find first hand evidence apparently gangsters
00:48:20,00:48:26,devoted huge amounts of time to the look and the look is a threatening stare that you give someone
00:48:26,00:48:32,it was a deadly gaze designed to strike mortal fear into the heart of an enemy and it was more
00:48:32,00:48:37,frightening than any kind of violence or anything like that and so they they practiced it apparently
00:48:37,00:48:42,alcohol is very good at it it's the source of all is yeah so Andy's doing it sort of trying to do
00:48:42,00:48:49,it now you know you can't shake your fist James that is cheating probably that young gangsters have
00:48:49,00:48:55,it's just a stand in front of the mirror for hours on end each day practicing yeah Capone used to
00:48:55,00:49:00,think that he was very a well-dressed guy as well they had a look in the other way didn't he he had
00:49:00,00:49:07,the nickname snorkey which he much preferred to to Scarface so he's quite embarrassed by Scarface
00:49:07,00:49:11,and like if there were cameras on he would try and move the scars to the so they couldn't see them
00:49:11,00:49:18,on the camera but he wouldn't he wouldn't move the scars obviously he would move the scars but only
00:49:18,00:49:23,because they were attached to his head and he was moving his head but yeah he liked to be called snorkey
00:49:23,00:49:29,which in those days meant someone who was well dressed he looks a bit snorkey snorkey snorkey
00:49:29,00:49:36,something like a cartoon dog is much less threatening Al snorkey Capone yeah I read a thing in gentleman's
00:49:36,00:49:41,Gazette recently which was about Al Capone it said Al Capone was known as much for his sense of
00:49:41,00:49:47,style as he was for his psychopathic tendencies which I would dispute I think you're right I think it's
00:49:47,00:49:54,number one syphilis number two psychopathic tendencies number three style yeah I think that's
00:49:54,00:50:04,okay that's it that is all of our facts thank you so much for listening if you'd like to get in
