1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 We're going to go to the U.K.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:19,560
 Hello and welcome to another working from home episode of no such thing as a fish

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,880
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the U.K.

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin with Andrew Hunter Murray

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,800
 and Anna Tajinsky and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,520
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,160
 Starting with fact number one and that's my fact this week.

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,240
 My fact is two days after receiving his latest book the author of annals of gullibility

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,960
 why we get juped and how to avoid it lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in a Ponzi scheme.

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,800
 He did admit that it was embarrassing he kind of thinks it's funny now you know with the

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,560
 distance of time to look back at it but this is a guy called Stephen Greenspan and he'd written

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,560
 this book and and it was meant to sort of help you to understand how not to be jubed by exactly

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,440
 the thing that caught him off guard so he got caught off guard by the greatest Ponzi scheme

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:24,120
 of them all which was the Bernie Madoff which set so many people around the world losing thousands

15
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,880
 and millions in some cases it's the biggest of its kind and yeah it was recommendation via his sister

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,880
 and two days after receiving his latest book he lost 400,000.

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,040
 Wow in his advice as to how to avoid it did it include things like you know don't take advice

18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,480
 from ill-informed siblings and don't invest with people who have surnames that sounds especially

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:52,840
 like the phrase made off. I think a revised edition was hastily issued with all this in there.

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,000
 Don't come at his check is the Ponzi scheme basically a pyramid scheme where it's what it is

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,120
 is you get in early investors and you get their money and when you bring in new investors you give

22
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,280
 the money of the new investors a bit of it to the early investors so it seems as if they're

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,120
 getting returned on their money and then you kind of thought that was a pyramid scheme basically.

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,040
 A pyramid scheme is where you bring in new investors and they have to bring in new investors

25
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,200
 and that money comes up to the people higher up in the pyramid it's slightly different.

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,960
 Oh yeah see. So the Ponzi scheme is more flat it's more like a large plane on the deserts of Egypt

27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,800
 compared to the pyramid. A Ponzi scheme is the thing that we used to do as kids which I found

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,840
 so thrilling do you remember where you'd get a letter that had a chocolate bar in it and you said

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,040
 and it said send this on with no wait how would it work. I tell you no you're right you're doing

30
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,760
 all right someone sends you a letter saying send me a chocolate bar but then you send the letter

31
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,000
 to six people and then ask you ask each of them to send you a chocolate bar and then you get six

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,480
 chocolate bars. It was amazing. That's a pyramid scheme. That's a pyramid scheme not a Ponzi

33
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,680
 scheme but Anna if you've been investing. No a Ponzi scheme. It's pretty similar. It's similar

34
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,360
 but it is there's quite a distinctive difference. So in a Ponzi scheme you would get a load of

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,160
 Mars bars from loads of different people and then you would cut some of the Mars bars up and they give

36
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,760
 the Mars bar back with another half of a Mars bar to someone who said you want Mars bar as they think

37
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,760
 they're getting one and a half back but actually what you're doing is you're using other people's

38
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,240
 Mars bars to do it and eventually you're going to run out of Mars bars. Do you have to re-wrap the

39
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,800
 Mars bars once you cut them out? I feel like it's more different with Mars bars than it is with

40
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:45,320
 money. It is when you get a monkey half a Mars bar through the bus. Is it different? They get in a nice

41
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,040
 crisp 50 pound note. We're rich. We're rich. You know it's weird just in order to get ready for this

42
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,200
 fact. I looked up what a Ponzi scheme was so I knew what it was. I now have no idea what it is off

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,000
 the back of all these models. It's literally all it is is a pyramid scheme has one person at the

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,160
 top ten people next, a hundred people next, a thousand people next whereas a Ponzi scheme has one

45
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,560
 person at the top and then everyone else is flat. You actually did explain it completely correctly

46
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,120
 Dan. We just started throwing Mars bars around. The first Ponzi scheme was basically invented by

47
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,160
 accident, wasn't it by Charles Ponzi? He didn't quite mean to do it. He sort of meant it to be legit

48
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,880
 so it was in the 1920s and he had the scheme where he was buying stamps or actually these things

49
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,000
 called reply coupons and that was when if you wrote to a friend internationally you included a reply

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,720
 coupon which I think essentially meant it was like doing a reverse charge call but on a letter and

51
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,200
 it meant that they could write back to you for free. Anyway he bought them overseas for much cheaper

52
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,680
 because they were cheaper overseas and then sold them for more in the US and he said to people I've

53
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,560
 got this amazing scheme. Well I can make a massive profit on these reply coupons and he got people

54
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,440
 to invest and they did and he hadn't factored in the fact that he'd have to pay for all the

55
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,600
 ridiculous international travel to these places to go and buy these stamps in the first place so he

56
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,720
 realized the scheme couldn't make any money at all but these people were investing loads of money

57
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,160
 and you can see the reasoning where he started to think oh I still I'm receiving all this money.

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,240
 Should I just keep keep going with this and not mention that it doesn't work? It's kind of working

59
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,680
 well for a shot period of time isn't it I guess. It is until he so I think someone did the mass and

60
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:28,040
 worked out that he was claiming to be buying and selling 160 million reply coupons and only 27,000

61
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,360
 existed in the world. The Boston Post did an article in 1920 didn't they demonstration that

62
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,040
 was completely impossible and when they did an audit afterwards they found only 61 dollars worth

63
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,440
 of these stamps even though he'd said that he'd bought millions and millions of dollars worth.

64
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,600
 So he did try he got a few. He got a few but when the Boston Post came up with

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,080
 this expose everyone thought oh my god I've given him all my money I need my money back and so they

66
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,000
 did a run on him to try and get all of their money back and he just completely fronted it out and

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,800
 he just said yeah no worries you guys just queue up and I'll give you your money back and they

68
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,680
 stood in the queue and he bought them sandwiches and coffee and people weren't sure whether he was

69
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,080
 real or not still at that stage and so half the time they were cheering him and half the time they

70
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,280
 were booing him no one really knew what was happening and then eventually the government got involved

71
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,600
 and looked at his accounts and found he was three million dollars in the red and they later advised

72
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,080
 it to seven million dollars in the red and he got arrested and when he got arrested everyone lost

73
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,320
 her money. Oh wow. What was his long term plan that that queue outside his house? I just think

74
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,600
 sometimes it's like maybe tomorrow it'll be fine. Yeah. If you're calm enough with the beginning of

75
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,120
 the queue then the end will probably get bored and go away. Well that's what happened like because

76
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,000
 loads of people started running on it but some people still trusted him so they became a secondary

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,720
 speculation market where people would buy the Ponzi coupons on a cheaper price so that the people

78
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,480
 in the queue would at least get something back and the people who bought it thought well this is

79
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,040
 actually real it's for real so I'm going to get the full amount back so they became speculation

80
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,080
 on the speculation. That's clever. That's crazy. And while we're on scammers have you guys heard of

81
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,880
 Victor Lustig? I don't think we have ever mentioned him before. Is he the guy who sold the Eiffel Tower?

82
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:23,800
 He's the guy who sold it twice. Oh wow. So he knew that Paris was broke. He was living in Paris and

83
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,560
 he thought maybe the city would want to sell the Eiffel Tower off because it's been up for 30 years

84
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,600
 it's a bit rusty and so he decided to forge some government stationery and he wrote to a load of

85
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,160
 scrap metal dealers and he invited them all to an expensive suite at a hotel and he said hello

86
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,680
 I am the deputy minister of posts and he said well we're looking for buyers but we've got to keep it

87
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,880
 quiet from public opinion because there might be controversy and then one of the guys was tempted

88
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:56,120
 and especially stupid dealer called Andre Poisson and Drew Fish and he said I'd really like to buy

89
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,720
 the Eiffel Tower scrap and he paid a massive bribe to secure the ownership and unsurprisingly

90
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,880
 the Eiffel Tower was not the sale but he got away with it. He was so successful Victor Lustig.

91
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,240
 Was he never busted? He was busted later on for his Romanian box.

92
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:22,440
 It was a box which would duplicate any bank note that you put in it. Obviously it wouldn't.

93
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,800
 Okay well James Nanner I'm not going to try and sell you one but Dan you're looking interesting.

94
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,440
 He had concealed genuine notes within the device and then as long as you only put in a selector

95
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,080
 and I had all these buttons and levers that you press and pull and then another bank note would come

96
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,520
 out and they'd think oh my god this is amazing. What's he inside making the noises?

97
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:47,960
 He just made a complicated looking box basically and he sold the box for a lot of money to

98
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:54,600
 various different people and then once there was a sheriff in Texas who realized that the scam

99
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,400
 caught up with him in another state and then Lustig said oh you're just not using it right don't

100
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,920
 worry it's okay completely persuaded him it was fine and then said look let me give you all this

101
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,360
 cash to compensate you which was counterfeit money so you managed to pay his way out of it yeah

102
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,440
 you're very cool. Like you were saying about how he said oh I'm not really supposed to talk about

103
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,600
 this and so people trusted him Ponzi did that as well so when they said to him how are you making

104
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,240
 this work because it doesn't seem like at work all these stamps he said oh yeah I've got a system

105
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,480
 which I don't want to tell you because then the government will shut it down and then when

106
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,720
 everyone did the run on him and started queuing up for money he said oh guys guess what I've come

107
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,200
 up with a new system it's completely different it's not to do a stamps at all it's just really really

108
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,600
 awesome and so this one will get you even more money so why don't you give me more money but he kept

109
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,240
 saying I can't tell anyone what it is because if I tell you then everyone will be doing it and that's

110
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,480
 what kind of suckers people in. Yes. Got to be adaptable. Do you know how you find out if someone is

111
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:59,080
 gullible? Oh no. Oh well let me tell you my magic function. I don't know is it like a questionnaire

112
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,680
 or something? It's exactly that there's a questionnaire but basically it is just asking are you

113
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,840
 gullible? It's amazing it's a 12-question questionnaire some Australian authors came up with it

114
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:12,280
 and it measures persuadability and insensitivity to untrustworthiness and but the questions are

115
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,240
 really they're all things like my friends think I'm easily fooled do you disagree agree strong

116
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,680
 you agree and basically if you answer yes to those questions or that you agree with them you're

117
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,600
 gullible. Really? Which is weird because I would have thought gullible people wouldn't automatically

118
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,040
 know it. No because as soon as you know that you're gullible surely you can start correcting your

119
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:37,800
 gullipidacy. No I know I'm gullible and I can't stop it. If you guys decide to tell me some

120
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,760
 bullshit on this show I will believe it until I see you the smile on your face. What do you think

121
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:49,480
 about this? We are in the midst of a high frequency blossoming of interconnectedness that will give us

122
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,640
 access to the quantum soup itself. What do you think of that sentence? I don't fully what's the quantum

123
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,400
 soup is that like primary? Maybe you're not that gullible because apparently people who take that

124
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,680
 kind of bullshit aphorism and think that it's quite deep are people who rate more highly on this

125
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,320
 gullibility scale. Okay so I'm still gullible I'd be like the leader of the gullibles I'd be going

126
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:20,360
 whoa whoa whoa whoa I know how that sounds guys but I don't think that's right. I've not had that soup.

127
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,120
 You know that do you remember that old joke at school which was the gullible you know the world

128
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,840
 gullible isn't in the dictionary? Did you know that OED published a special edition where they

129
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:40,680
 took it out of the dictionary? No they didn't. Wait think of the labor involved in printing an entire

130
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,120
 new edition of the dictionary just for one joke it doesn't stack up. I just want to point out that

131
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,560
 Dan was the first one who spotted that and so I think well done you're not as gullible as we all

132
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,360
 think well they're actually apparently humans aren't too gullible we all have this conception that

133
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,120
 we're really gullible and more is falling for stuff but studies seem to show that we're actually

134
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,440
 too skeptical and so there's been a bunch of things that so fake news is often used as an example

135
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,640
 of how we're too gullible we believe this stuff we change our voting habits but all the studies

136
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,360
 that have really been done on fake news over the last few years have showed that it didn't impact

137
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,640
 elections at all because people only ever consumed the sort of fake news that already accorded with

138
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,640
 what they believed so it wasn't like they were reading stuff and going oh my god Hillary Clinton

139
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:32,200
 really is a lizard it was like they already thought she was probably a lizard it's just confirmed it

140
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,360
 but actually we're too skeptical so there's a very famous psychologist called Julian Rotter

141
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,760
 who died quite recently but he said that the more trustful you are the more successful you are in life

142
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,320
 and the better you are at determining if someone is trustworthy or if something's worth supporting

143
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,560
 because you've practiced it so people who are more trusting generally they practice it through

144
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,920
 life and then you learn who to trust and who not to trust whereas the cynics who just think oh god

145
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,640
 everyone's a liar everyone's trying to jeep me they actually have no idea and they lose out

146
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,640
 because of that so Anna are you saying that me and Nandi are really great because we fell for your

147
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,080
 dictionary prank sounds like it really smart and let me talk to you afterwards about a scheme I've

148
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,760
 got up and running but Dan is the cynic and he's just like he's living in his barrel

149
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:29,320
 yeah I'm like don't know oh god it always comes back to diogenesis isn't it um there was a dictionary

150
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:36,360
 scam back in the day where uh Huxters would go around a pubs getting into uh getting money off

151
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,760
 people with a dictionary based bet okay so the idea is three of you go into the pub you all pretend

152
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,840
 you don't know each other you just start you know sit at different places it's quite easy for us

153
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:52,600
 yeah three of us I've gone home um and then one of one of you guys will start repeatedly using the

154
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,520
 word unfortunate okay let's say Dan keep saying it's really unfortunate about this and then James

155
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,640
 or Anna will lean over and say excuse me I think it's unfortunate bingo exactly and then Dan will

156
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,480
 say it's pretty unfortunate that you're such an idiot or whatever and you get into this

157
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:17,160
 big argument I can only afford James I've also been quite drunk when I said that you get this huge

158
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,520
 route and obviously you get everyone else involved and you start putting money on it and then Dan

159
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,160
 pulls out his dictionary which does have the word unfortunate in it because it's an old version

160
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,840
 of the word and then you get the money in it and then it works as other comments of this story

161
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,640
 shall he she's the one with a dictionary I've been at the bar this whole time I got really bored

162
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,440
 very early on in this chat and I went to talk to some people at the bar it must be the case that she

163
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,120
 happens to be a dictionary salesman who has a dictionary for the wise what's about to be in there

164
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,800
 that's even better yeah yeah that's the first one and that's the third person is just for audience

165
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,800
 purposes to cheer people on it's sort of to get more people involved in the bed hey come and look

166
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:05,240
 at the argument these guys are having and is there a whole history of that like is that a

167
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,960
 gang that went round the dictionary gang yeah yeah this is a what-off incident no I think some people

168
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,920
 have used it repeatedly but I don't think it was a massive because if it's the trend only lasts

169
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,440
 until everyone has heard of it because there are hundreds of gangs going around the pubs

170
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:27,640
 doing the unfortunate play oh man that's it during gang wars I wouldn't want to be in that gang

171
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,000
 have you not watched gangs have blended recently there's one episode where the dictionary

172
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,360
 gang comes along it's it's the least violent of all the episodes I have to say hey you could get

173
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,600
 some pretty big dictionaries you could do some serious damage with the full edition of the OED

174
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:54,360
 yeah kill someone yeah sticks and stones maybe yeah um I found um a gullible person who fell

175
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,200
 for a scam have you guys heard of this guy in New York a few years ago sued a psychic for fraud

176
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,160
 it's I mean it is sad but in 2015 he sued the psychic because over the years he'd given her over

177
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:15,400
 $700,000 because he wanted her to make the woman that he fancied fall in love with him it's an old

178
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,160
 classic Shakespearean tale he should have just given the 700,000 to the girl

179
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:27,960
 she James women can't be bought I agree but it's worth a try rather than giving it to a psychic

180
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,120
 that should have been his for at least the person you like has got a lot of dash yeah he was actually he's

181
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,320
 walking down the street to New York thing this is really sad I've told the woman I really love her

182
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,560
 and she said she has no interest in me whatsoever and he passed a sign saying psychic with a flashing

183
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,680
 arrow and so you already know he's a bit gullible he walked in and this psychic just managed to convince

184
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:53,240
 him for instance to fork out um $40,000 so she could do him a fake funeral to convince the bad

185
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,880
 spirits that he had died so that they stopped plaguing him and let the woman fall in love with him

186
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,200
 why don't invite the woman he fancied to the fake funeral and see if she was sad that he died

187
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,520
 and then he bursts out of the coffin come on and then that is the woman he fancied I don't think I've

188
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,480
 got another that is never gonna work is it in a romance that's how my wife and I got together

189
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,040
 true story yeah I think you might risk the woman thinking you're a widow which this guy definitely

190
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:25,080
 wasn't to be clear um he also paid $80,000 for an 80 mile long bridge made of gold to lure the

191
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,840
 spirits into the other realm and then say that sounds like quite a good deal for a bridge made of

192
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,960
 gold an incredible bargain yeah that's so cheap it is I think I the thing is the bridge made of gold

193
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,720
 didn't really exist in this realm so you can never get the evidence that it has been built

194
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:49,400
 a bridge yeah much cheaper than bridge much less did the guy did he not see the psychic

195
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,240
 increasingly turning up in fur coats in matterities and all of this stuff and she's like I bought them

196
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:02,440
 in the other realm it's much cheaper over there eventually I've been fucked up another 90 grand

197
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,680
 for a longer bridge because the spirits weren't going over this one um halfway through this the

198
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:13,320
 woman he was in love with very sadly died and the psychic thought quickly on her feet and said

199
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,120
 oh well don't worry we'll just have to pay a bit extra for my reincarnation machine to be built

200
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:25,160
 and so creepy no this is a terrible story it it it is awful and it was only when she said she built

201
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,800
 this reincarnation machine and Michelle this woman you're in love with is now inside this new

202
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,240
 woman you've just met and he said I met the new woman and I thought she doesn't seem like Michelle

203
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,800
 at all and that was when I started to think the psychic wasn't who she was purporting to be

204
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,040
 right god how did this guy have access to seven hundred thousand dollars in the first

205
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:53,560
 nutman is now the president of the United States okay it is time for fact number two and that is

206
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:01,400
 Anna my fact this week is that in 2011 former Paralympian Josh Sundquist who's missing his left leg

207
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:08,200
 announced that he'd found his soulmate i.e someone missing a right leg with whom he can split pairs

208
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,920
 of shoes I don't know how I sort of came across this but I was watching his YouTube channel so Josh

209
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:21,400
 is a he was a Paralympian skier and now an author and a comedian and public speaker and he sort of

210
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,800
 posted a video saying he's got these piles of shoes he's been saving up for years because obviously

211
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,920
 you can't buy one shoe but he only needs one so he's got loads of right shoes and he'd been looking

212
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,480
 for someone who could wear them and then he found living in the same city as him a chap called

213
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:43,400
 Stephen missing a right leg same shoe size and crucially same taste in shoes so they had a lovely

214
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,600
 meet-up well they did some swapsies that's great that's great it's a beautiful story although it was

215
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,160
 quite I mean I think he might have been conned to be fair because he'd obviously been saving up his

216
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,840
 right shoes over the years Josh and so he came with this giant mountain whereas Stephen wasn't

217
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,280
 expecting the soulmate reunion so he'd presumably chopped away all his left shoes so he only gave

218
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,440
 Joshua one shoe so it was sort of a one shoe and exchange for about 50 shoes there are charities out

219
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,920
 there where you can so if you have lost a leg or lost a foot but also if you have a pair of

220
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,600
 feet that are different sizes like we all do but some people much bigger than others

221
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,840
 there are some places where you can you can match up with people with the opposite-sized feet to

222
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:32,840
 you oh really yeah in a moment there's something called the national odd shoe exchange which is

223
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:39,400
 nose NOSE and they put people together with mismatch feet and in the UK there's something called Joe's

224
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,240
 odd shoes which is on Facebook where all you have to do is pay postage and packaging and they'll

225
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,920
 send you a single shoe very cool it's a bit weird isn't it usually when you do those acronyms

226
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:57,960
 it usually works out of something like foot it's a bit odd to get it for nose yeah absolutely right

227
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,440
 they should well maybe they have this conversation footwear odd one out trading and it's

228
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,760
 foot except foot is also the beginning of footwear so it's achieved apart from odd one out has got

229
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:20,040
 three oz in a row so it'll be food so that's that's Josh great guy but I was I was sort of looking

230
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:26,120
 into prosthetics and there's some really cool prosthetics out there that you can get so if you

231
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:33,320
 guys heard of this woman called Sophie de Oliveira Berrata no she's got this thing called the alternative

232
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:38,280
 limb project and she's basically an artist is in North London and she makes these bespoke limbs

233
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,000
 and she was she was inspired to do it she had this client who was a little girl who had one leg

234
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,040
 and every year she'd come for an upgraded leg because she was growing and she started asking for

235
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,080
 she asked at first for pepper pigs at the top of her leg pictures of pepper pig eating ice cream

236
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,400
 and so Sophie was like yeah sure whatever and then she came back the next year and asked for

237
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,640
 a Christmas scene at the top which I think is very short termist and she's going to regret that

238
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,240
 in February but whatever um and this woman Sophie thought well this is great what a good idea and

239
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,480
 so she was inspired by Inspector Gadget because you know he makes yeah he makes gadgets yeah um and so

240
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,200
 legs doesn't he sometimes exactly so she makes long arms and legs and special arms and legs

241
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,560
 and so for one guy she made a hyper realistic foot that look really like his own foot and she got

242
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,680
 hairs off the back of his neck and put them on the toes not many people in history have ever

243
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,840
 looked at their toes and gone that isn't hairy enough can we put my hairs on that please

244
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:42,680
 so the the I guess one of the next front is in prosthetic bone development is is how to incorporate

245
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,360
 feeling and how to incorporate automatic responses so there's one recent development

246
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,600
 research at Newcastle University came up with this it's got an AI camera inside it it's a hand

247
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:02,440
 or an arm fitting and it can recognize hundreds of objects using the camera and when you move to

248
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,400
 grab something with your prosthetic arm it automatically moves into the right position to grasp it

249
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,720
 so if you're reaching for a pair of tweezers it'll move into a pinch position or if you're reaching

250
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,320
 for a volleyball it'll move into a sort of spread hand position so you can pick it up like that

251
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,280
 sounds unbelievable and it can be trained to you know develop more and more positions can you

252
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,880
 can you sort of code it so that if it's reaching for your 10th toffee crisp of the night it will

253
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,080
 be used to clap down on it or something and we don't have time for your toffee crisp problem

254
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,840
 maybe if you had to send that letter to so many people you wouldn't have so many to get through

255
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:45,640
 a toffee crisp no one mentions toffee crisp chocolate I agree they're the best they I'm not sure

256
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:52,600
 I've ever had one what oh my god that's like me not what you'd eat Jesus Christ we we definitely

257
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,920
 don't have time for the fact that you've never eaten toffee crisp they're the they are one of the one

258
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,520
 of the very best are they I reckon even asthma would agree with that I was reading up about Aaron

259
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:09,160
 Ralston you guys remember Aaron Ralston a 127 hours yeah I remember that oh yeah yeah so he was the

260
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:15,800
 the mountaineer slash adventurer who fell down a little gap between some boulders a boulders

261
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:21,240
 a boulder collapsed on his arm and he had to cut himself free and so he now when you see pictures

262
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,680
 of him if he goes mountaineering he has a prosthetic that has a little pick on the end oh wow

263
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,560
 they went back and they actually recovered his arm so it was stuck under this boulder they managed

264
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,440
 to winch it out winch the boulder up and get his arm back and they cremated it there on the spot

265
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,280
 and he scattered the ashes symbolically all over the area so that's really nice but the the little

266
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,280
 fact that I really like that I've discovered about him is his current place of residence he lives

267
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:55,080
 in a place called boulder cholera no one lasting on prosthetics I was I was amazed to learn about

268
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,200
 there's a big comedian back in the early days of American comedy during the silent era called

269
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,520
 Harold Lloyd and Harold Lloyd was at the time more famous than Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin he

270
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,160
 was he was the one who was pulling in most money at the box office and what I didn't know is that

271
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:16,920
 he lost two of his fingers he lost his thumb and his index finger when he was doing publicity for

272
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:23,640
 a film of his called haunted spooks he stood in the photo with a prop bomb in his hand which

273
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,560
 turned out to be a real bomb no yes for the fuse later minutes what kind of what kind of prop

274
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,680
 department has two boxes one with prop bombs and one with real bombs and accidentally takes out

275
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:40,200
 the wrong one how do you how do you end up in that situation now what we've done is we've labeled

276
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:47,320
 the prop bombs with a key and we've labeled the real bombs with a lower case don't put them upside

277
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:55,000
 down next to each other was that someone simultaneously in the middle of a battle somewhere throwing the

278
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:05,320
 prop bomb yeah so it it's wet on his hand yeah it took off his thumb it took off his index finger

279
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,880
 temporarily blinded him he took eight months to recover and then they built a glove for him which

280
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:17,800
 had the thumb and the finger and the most famous surviving sequence or even image that will

281
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:24,760
 know of Harold Lloyd as him hanging off a clock yeah face he did that with a prosthetic thumb and

282
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:34,360
 and finger it was after that that is a public saying I'd never heard that yeah okay it is time for

283
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,640
 fact number three and that is Andy my fact is that you can now diagnose a urinary

284
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:46,600
 tract infection using a fidget spinner finally I can get all my old fidget spinners out

285
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,560
 oh yeah that is worth a customized right customized fidget spinner don't go pissing on your

286
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,400
 children's match of spinners oh what what do you mean children

287
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,720
 adults as well where they don't piss on any fidget spinners whether they're the children's

288
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,480
 addition to all the special adult fidget spinners that James owns the erotic fidget spinners

289
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:15,720
 you can't I saw sorry to interrupt when you haven't even told us a fact yet but because I didn't

290
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,240
 write this down because I didn't think it would come up but did you see that there was a you know

291
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,640
 like they call pasties or pasties that erotic dancers put on their nipples and spin them around

292
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:33,480
 pasties yeah cornered pasties yeah it happens mostly in Cornwall yeah the strippers do this but they

293
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,520
 made one with fidget spinners didn't they which liked fidget spinned around when they twelped their

294
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:45,480
 breasts gosh yeah so you can get adult fidget spinners is what you say yeah they're not the ones I have

295
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:54,360
 though Andy what is the how does this work well this is a new scientific development basically it's

296
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:00,200
 it's a it's a pain diagnosing urinary tract infections it can take sometimes days to get the

297
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,680
 results back and scientists are always looking for ways to improve the process so this is a way

298
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,720
 of detecting pathogens in someone's urine which might reveal if they've got an infection um so

299
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,800
 and what you need is detectors that are cheap and simple and accurate and that's what this

300
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:23,160
 new one is they custom made this team a fidget spinner um where you you pee in the spinner uh

301
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:32,760
 no no yeah yeah unless your aim is phenomenal you pee in a jug uh and then the jug is yeah a bit of

302
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:39,480
 it's poured into the fidget spinner and it it spins uh it spins around obviously and the the

303
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,560
 centrifugal force pushes the urine sample outwards and it pushes it through a little internal membrane

304
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:52,440
 inside the spinner and the membrane is is fine enough to stop bacteria which can tell you whether

305
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,760
 you've got one of these infections and then all you need to do is add a little bit of a die which turns

306
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,920
 the bacteria orange you look at the membrane a little bit later if there's orange on the membrane

307
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,920
 you have these bacteria and you know that you've got the infection i would have that day to die which

308
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:11,320
 is a colour that's less similar to the colour of urine yeah how orange is people's urine these days

309
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:18,760
 more orange than it is purple James I know you're a sunny D for that too much look it's for adults as

310
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:26,600
 well as children so do you know I mean yeah that would make sense to you I do I imagine that other

311
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:32,520
 other dies are also available but the the good news is that it cuts the test times to under an

312
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,200
 hour and it does also mean that people don't get diagnosed antibiotics unnecessarily maybe in the

313
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,040
 interim while they're waiting for the results so doctors might say oh just take something's anyway

314
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,840
 which is a bad thing because it leads to antibiotic resistance so yeah this is a good finally we've

315
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,200
 found a use for the fidget spinner three years later is it commercially available can we all buy one

316
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,560
 no no you can't it's just been invented sorry no and also I think you probably want a medical

317
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,800
 professional to do your diagnosis of UTIs rather than just pissing on your own fidget spinner

318
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,600
 oh yeah it's something I do that you could get it like a pregnancy test you know and you'd be

319
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,560
 able to buy one and then piss on it and then maybe you could lay with it yeah I guess you could

320
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,240
 I guess yeah or just they're issued to doctors who know how to administer the tests but either way

321
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:25,320
 I think everyone should be their own doctor oh god it sounds really simple give it a spin pour the

322
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,280
 dye in what are we what am I missing wow you've already got the slogan yeah one thing that they

323
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,640
 think it might work for in the future is also viral infections so hopefully this technology in

324
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,320
 the future you'll be able to use with saliva instead of urine and you'll be able to detect viruses

325
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,920
 if you get your mesh fine enough your membrane fine enough then it will be able to find viruses so

326
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,760
 it might be that if there's a viral infection going around then you'll be able to use something

327
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,040
 like this to tell whether you have that that's great because fidget spinners have had a bad

328
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:01,880
 rep and a lot of corners over the years haven't they they've been sort of banned quite a lot of

329
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,720
 places quite love schools in America went through a phase of banning them for big really distracting

330
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,200
 for kids there were lots of warnings that some of them were dangerous do you remember there were

331
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:16,200
 various fidget spinners came out that were a bit like ninja stars that had sort of pointed ends

332
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:23,000
 and there was actually this woman who was employed to test them a test a blade expert

333
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,280
 apparently called Sarah Haynesworth who BBC Watchdog made her test these things to see if they could

334
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:34,520
 penetrate skin or eyeballs and her job and only Xbox to attempt this was to get a fidget spinner

335
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,560
 and stab a tomato with it which apparently represents an eyeball and then stab some pork skin

336
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,680
 with it the represents human skin so interesting because I have some fidget spinners in my house

337
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:50,680
 and I've also been trained how to throw ninja stars so I can actually try and I have some tomatoes

338
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,600
 you're qualified do you say that anyone can do this Sarah well again I think everyone should be

339
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,560
 their own blade tester as well as their own doctor so yes you should start stabbing tomatoes

340
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,120
 awesome wow the trick is in the flick of the wrist at the end just in case you hold it like

341
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,920
 between your thumb and your first finger and then you throw it and then you flick your wrist at

342
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,720
 the last second and then it helps it to spin and hence it stick into things that's like flooring a knife

343
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,600
 that's why Harold Lloyd could never have become a ninja after his terrible publicity accident

344
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:25,960
 you did have two hands good point that's why Harold Lloyd would have had to be ambidextrous if he

345
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,560
 was to realise his ambition of becoming a ninja it's ironic that the one famous thing about him

346
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,240
 is he's on a clock which does have two hands wow that is such a slap in the face isn't it

347
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:44,920
 we we wrote about fidget spinners at the height of their of their craves back in 2017 in our first

348
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,960
 book of the year in james you found out this thing which is that of all the top 25 toys on amazon

349
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:57,720
 dot code dot uk all of them were fidget spinners yeah and I went to check up amazon today just to see

350
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,520
 where they sit in the top 100 and not a single fidget spinner has stayed in the top 100 really

351
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:10,520
 but yeah and the top toy at the moment is a black balloon that's in the shape of a zero I think you

352
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,840
 can get it multicolored but that's the image that you're met with that's quite a nihilist thing to

353
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:23,880
 give to a child is black zero happy birthday but it did last longer than everyone thought so that was

354
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,440
 2017 where it was at its peak but in 2019 fidget spinners still accounted for a fifth of all toy sales

355
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,360
 what wow really it's amazing I was looking at other toys that can be used for medical uses

356
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:43,480
 and I found a paper called a novel method for the removal of ear ceremony so that's ear wax

357
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:50,120
 okay what time might be used to remove the wax okay yes yes yes I'm a yo-yo but a very small

358
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:58,680
 yo-yo that you just got a dip in the ear it's a good first guess um okay quite right now um um so

359
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,840
 something oh something absorbent or something with little scraping edge yeah you mean scraping

360
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,280
 like a Lego man's hand you know you can go in with that pincer grip it's got a pincer grip on it

361
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,480
 doesn't it that's good yeah oh oh silly putty just putting so much silly putty that the ear wax is

362
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,440
 forced out so have you guys never had any issues with ear wax I think you haven't because you don't

363
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,240
 seem to know what they actually use in real life you suck it out but I'm trying to think it's

364
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:30,200
 something that you suck and that's a toy a straw one of those really fun straws they don't suck it out

365
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,240
 my doctor's all have massive mouths and they just put their entire mouth around your ear

366
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,800
 and it's a heavy hoover and they just stick it to your head and they have to stop before the

367
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,760
 brain comes out um no it's going to be it's going to be a it's going to be a fake doctor's syringe

368
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:52,600
 maybe exactly they syringe it out normally yeah and what it is is a super-sulka max D5000

369
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:59,560
 wow um this is a guy who um he was living on an island and the child had real problems with ear wax

370
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:06,200
 and he couldn't get to the um doctors to get a syringe quickly enough so he said the owner of a

371
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,880
 super-sulka max D5000 was sought out after hearing an explanation of its intended application

372
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,280
 he granted permission for its use verbal consent was obtained from the patient he then changed

373
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:24,360
 into swimming shorts located himself on an ideal location on the deck and held a Tupperware container

374
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:31,720
 product number 1611 slash 16 to the side of his neck the super-sulka max D5000 was filled with

375
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,000
 body temperature water and then mildly pressurized using the blue hand pump the trigger was depressed

376
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,280
 releasing a gentle narrow jet of water which was aimed along the posterior wall of the ear canal

377
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,560
 and then after 15 seconds bits of wax started coming out and it worked I might do that that's great

378
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,240
 I think don't do that this was a medically trained professional uh-huh and this is a thing that

379
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,520
 happened then it is in a medical paper but I think if you do have ear wax problems maybe you should

380
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,160
 consult a profession you guys are so boring don't piss in my fidgets videos don't

381
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:10,120
 get the circus in my head um do you know what the best selling doll of 1976 was you'll be

382
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:19,800
 surprised oh 1976 was it a rich Nixon doll was oh that was very that I was about to say very close

383
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:26,120
 it's not very close was it a um when was star was 77 so maybe it wasn't yeah it wasn't

384
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,920
 the blue skywalker oh I don't oh oh the exorcist didn't that come out in 70 oh nice okay well

385
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,280
 you're all kind of getting closer it is it is a pop culture thing it was share oh what's it really

386
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,560
 yeah there were sunny and shareholders and um the share one was very customizable had different

387
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,920
 outfits and things and it was hugely popular really the best selling doll of the entire year was

388
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:56,040
 share that makes sense yeah I am surprised Andy I just don't have I don't have any references that

389
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,160
 I can make jokes about share no I'm just trying to think of a single share song shoot shoot song

390
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,960
 is the only one I could think yeah the famous one with Sonny Bono what was that the duet I got you

391
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,560
 babe I got you babe yeah yeah I was just imagining being a parent and having two kids and I own

392
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,880
 one share doll and convincing them it was called share because they had to share it I'm sorry I

393
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:27,480
 switched off and went there okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James okay my

394
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:34,280
 fact this week is that Al Capone ran a soup kitchen during the Great Depression he served beef on

395
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:40,840
 Thanksgiving in 1930 because there had just been a theft of 1000 turkeys nearby and he didn't want

396
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:49,320
 the authorities to think it was him makes sense yeah and he had to do something with the 50 cows

397
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:57,880
 even it didn't he that's probably more like it um so yeah um Al Capone Chicago gangster

398
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:05,080
 public enemy number one um bad guy killed lots of his enemies uh especially in the St Valentine's

399
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:11,960
 Day massacre in 1929 but like a lot of these people who were bad guys he had this kind of Robin Hood

400
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,520
 reputation where he would give to charity in the local area and the idea I think sometimes is that

401
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,000
 he's less likely to get ratted out if people like him although it has to be said that this soup

402
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,880
 kitchen although it definitely existed he might have not paid any money for it because he could have

403
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:35,640
 like leaned on some local businesses to donate their beef and whatever uh because obviously that

404
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:41,640
 extortion was a lot of his a lot of his stick so he might have said to you guys you better give me

405
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,520
 some stuff for my charity or else so that's a negative portrayal of Al Capone

406
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:52,440
 on the other hand it was a soup kitchen it was a soup kitchen yeah and yeah they gave breakfast

407
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:59,240
 lunch and dinner to um over 2,000 people in Chicago every single day uh and the newspapers kind of were

408
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,800
 not sure about it because on one hand they thought obviously this is a good thing that people

409
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,160
 are being fed but on the bad hand they could see him becoming like the mayor of Chicago if people

410
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,240
 liked him too much and they thought if a gangster becomes the mayor of our city then we could be

411
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,880
 in real trouble yeah he was sort of Dave facto mayor for quite a while wasn't he in the he ran

412
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,840
 the city essentially well yeah he didn't really need to become there because he had a guy called

413
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:28,440
 William H Thompson who was known as Big Bell and basically Al Capone funded him and made sure that

414
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,840
 he stayed in place and Big Bell was um sometimes known as Kaiser Bell because he was very pro German

415
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:40,680
 during World War One and in the 1920s he threatened to punch the British king in the snoot

416
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:48,040
 mind you it's not the worst war in which to be pro German to be fair to him no there'd been

417
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:55,640
 worse one since yeah I just I find Al Capone so amazing how it's like he conforms to all the gangster

418
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,480
 cliches and the fact that he could just commit multiple murders and everyone know and no one be

419
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,920
 able to do anything about it I mean he he's shot people in you know open public there was one of his

420
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:12,920
 rivals he just went down into a bar and shot him in the head and everyone saw everyone knew he'd

421
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,480
 done it but no one's going to say anything they were all distracted by an argument about dictionary

422
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,120
 going on in the other car the newspapers reported it as an unfortunate

423
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:28,520
 Anna I wonder though if you've got that right you're probably right but I wonder if you've got

424
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,960
 that wrong in when you say he conformed to the cliches I wonder if Al Capone invented the cliches

425
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,600
 yeah you're right yeah all the movies born off the back of his life and of all the gangsters of

426
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,520
 that time or what inform us about the mafia yeah so he kind of invented cliché yeah I didn't know

427
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,560
 that he was called Scarface I mean I'm sure anyone who you know has read a bit about it didn't

428
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,720
 know that but yeah I didn't know that he had the big scars and the first film called Scarface was

429
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:59,080
 about him I don't know either he hated the name well so yeah yes he did yeah and he got he got the

430
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:05,240
 scars on his face from insulting a lady the the brother of a lady was taken aback and slashed his face

431
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,920
 but he used to claim that he got it as a result of some service time in the army because he didn't

432
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:18,520
 want to just admit that he was you know lost a battle in the fight where he got scarred Al Capone

433
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:24,600
 his brother James Capone kind of got in involved in it and pushed the guy who who scarred him through

434
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:31,240
 a glass window because obviously he just cut his brother and he was so worried that this guy was

435
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,840
 going to come back and get him that he fled the city and joined the circus and then he served in

436
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:43,480
 World War One and then after the war he changed his name after his favourite cowboy and became a

437
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,320
 prohibition agent and basically spent his whole time stopping people from moving alcohol around

438
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,960
 which is where Al Capone got most of his money but he didn't realise that that happened because of

439
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,160
 that time Al Capone wasn't really famous for that kind of thing and so he only later found out that

440
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,840
 his brother who he'd left after that fight when he was 16 years old had become the greatest mobster

441
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:10,360
 and he had become one of the big prohibition agents there needs to be a film that imagines the

442
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:16,680
 meeting between them where he knows he's arresting this huge prohibition breaker and suddenly they

443
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:22,920
 meet face to face he was called Vincenzo Capone wasn't he this guy originally and then he

444
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:29,160
 he became Richard Hart but there were so many Capones I think eight or nine Capone siblings in all

445
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,480
 and the last member of the family alive or she was alive in 2012 and no she is still alive because

446
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:42,280
 she's on Twitter is Deirdre Capone wow the most harmless name Deirdre why no she defends Al Capone's

447
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,320
 reputation which I think is an uphill battle and she's written a book saying he was a mobster not a

448
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,680
 monster and she's written a book all about him which includes recipes like meatballs alacapone

449
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:59,800
 wow but and and these days she's just retweeting you know like dogs and meditation she has a

450
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:05,720
 Twitter account so weird that a Capone family member should be judged by your by your grandparents should

451
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:12,200
 you really oh or your Twitter account I'd just like to make very clear he was quite a family man

452
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:18,520
 though again as the cliches then played out he had that typical I've got a wife who theoretically

453
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,880
 doesn't know anything that's going on but maybe she knows everything he was he really loved his son

454
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:30,120
 so his son had hearing damage probably because it was congenital syphilus contracted from Al Capone

455
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,560
 which he famously had and he spent a hundred thousand dollars fixing his sons hearing in 1925

456
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,800
 when he didn't he bet didn't even really have huge amounts per se he was a family guy but his

457
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,880
 syphilus was a much bigger part of his life than his gang time wasn't it I could can we say that for

458
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:54,280
 short time wise total time okay my sorry it was a longer part of his life you're right okay say

459
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,600
 biographers are always complaining why do they always focus on the gangster years it's more about

460
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,880
 his rancid penis I think of myself as a syphilus patient who happens to be in the

461
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:13,480
 well I think by the end he basically couldn't think of himself as anything he was it was so awful

462
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,720
 I didn't sort of realize the symptoms of untreated syphilus but by the time he went to prison in 1930

463
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,280
 he was starting to really suffer from it there's a theory that one of the reasons he was moved from

464
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,680
 Atlanta prison to Alcatraz where he was famously sent it's actually that he was being bullied

465
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,720
 in Atlanta the Atlanta prison because he was very weak and he was starting to lose his faculties

466
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,040
 because of this syphilus and his cellmate had to protect him because you know everyone else

467
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,880
 was bullying him and so he was accused of a special treatment because this cellmate was protecting him

468
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,240
 so he was shifted but yeah by by the time he got to Alcatraz he was having problems he was one of

469
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:52,760
 the first people ever to be treated with penicillin in 1940s for it yeah have you heard of his lawyer

470
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,720
 or one of his lawyers I'm sure you know it's a cool time if it's Charlie Chaplin yes

471
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:08,120
 he was called Hiram Mendo no no okay um so he defended him in a trial I think in 1930 which was when

472
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,640
 they first nabbed him you know they eventually got him for tax evasion but they first got him for

473
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:19,160
 unlicensed ownership of a gun or something anyway this is the earlier trial that was in about 1930

474
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:26,760
 guess when Hiram Mendo retired okay so he must have been at least 30 then and he retire when he's

475
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:40,600
 65 so he retired in 1965 he retired in 1994 yes he he died in 2001 aged 107 but he kept practicing

476
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:46,760
 law until he was a hundred years old oh my gosh I know was he Donald Trump's lawyer he just feels

477
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,880
 at the kind of guy he definitely must have been Donald Trump's lawyer at some point he wasn't he

478
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,160
 was just amazing his working life he started working when he was six at the age of in 1900 and he

479
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:04,600
 kept working for 94 years he wasn't working as a lawyer when he was six did clarify who would you

480
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:11,480
 rather have the six-year-old liar rather one hundred year old liar there was he had another lawyer

481
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:17,960
 who was called Edward O'Hare who testified against him in court not a good lawyer oh wow that's not

482
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,200
 the kind of lawyer what and he's slightly a notable character not just for his connection to

483
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:28,840
 Capone but his son is called Edward but show hair junior off which O'Hare airport in Chicago is

484
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:36,280
 named after he was a yeah he was a Medal of Honor fighter pilot who single-handedly shot down

485
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:42,120
 eight Japanese bombers so he was a hero for Chicago why did his lawyer testify against him though

486
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,720
 that does seem like a bit of a rookie mistake I'm sure he wasn't representing him anymore at that

487
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:57,000
 point I call to the stand me I'll capone the only time he got shot

488
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,520
 was when he shot himself wasn't it he shot himself by accident 1928 it had a golf game

489
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,360
 so James golf dangerous game you've got to be careful and playing on Saturday

490
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:15,320
 well try not to put your gun to near your golf clubs in the bag because that's how he did it he

491
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,200
 it's the details are slightly unclear but we think that after a round of golf he got into his car

492
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,040
 and he opened his golf bag and fiddled around and he was keeping his gun in there as well

493
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,120
 and he shot himself and he shot himself sort of multiple times I think through the groin and through

494
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:36,760
 the why why why did he keep shooting off the first that doesn't stack up Anna it really doesn't

495
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:42,360
 I think he had multiple wounds maybe the bullet went in and out and in and out kind of like a

496
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,960
 sewing needle or if you press your finger on a trigger accidentally can it deploy multiple bullets

497
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,760
 it's a machine gun it can yeah I wouldn't keep a machine gun in the golf bag if afterwards someone

498
00:47:52,760 --> 00:48:01,400
 said did you get a hole in one and he said a hole in one of my testicles yeah he wasn't he wasn't a

499
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:08,120
 funny guy he I read it one coupon biography this thing that gang habit that gangsters had in the

500
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:14,520
 20s that Brooklyn gangsters had which apparently they devoted huge amounts of time to so and this

501
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,120
 is also in a book about Brooklyn gangs but I couldn't find first hand evidence apparently gangsters

502
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:26,840
 devoted huge amounts of time to the look and the look is a threatening stare that you give someone

503
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:32,040
 it was a deadly gaze designed to strike mortal fear into the heart of an enemy and it was more

504
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,480
 frightening than any kind of violence or anything like that and so they they practiced it apparently

505
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,280
 alcohol is very good at it it's the source of all is yeah so Andy's doing it sort of trying to do

506
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:49,160
 it now you know you can't shake your fist James that is cheating probably that young gangsters have

507
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:55,480
 it's just a stand in front of the mirror for hours on end each day practicing yeah Capone used to

508
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,280
 think that he was very a well-dressed guy as well they had a look in the other way didn't he he had

509
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:07,000
 the nickname snorkey which he much preferred to to Scarface so he's quite embarrassed by Scarface

510
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,320
 and like if there were cameras on he would try and move the scars to the so they couldn't see them

511
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:18,520
 on the camera but he wouldn't he wouldn't move the scars obviously he would move the scars but only

512
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,640
 because they were attached to his head and he was moving his head but yeah he liked to be called snorkey

513
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:29,160
 which in those days meant someone who was well dressed he looks a bit snorkey snorkey snorkey

514
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:36,040
 something like a cartoon dog is much less threatening Al snorkey Capone yeah I read a thing in gentleman's

515
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:41,880
 Gazette recently which was about Al Capone it said Al Capone was known as much for his sense of

516
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,320
 style as he was for his psychopathic tendencies which I would dispute I think you're right I think it's

517
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:54,280
 number one syphilis number two psychopathic tendencies number three style yeah I think that's

518

528
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,640
 it's funny or not she's actually Deirdre Marie Cap what I don't know why she put it Marie had left

529
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,800
 out Capone but there we go because Cap is a slang word for putting a cap in it for shooting
