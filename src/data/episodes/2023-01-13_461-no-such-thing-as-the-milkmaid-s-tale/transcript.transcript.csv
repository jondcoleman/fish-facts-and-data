00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish."
00:00:03,00:00:07,"Before we get going, I just want to let you know that we have a very exciting guest on"
00:00:07,00:00:12,"this week, Andy unfortunately was away and is actually furious he was away because he"
00:00:12,00:00:16,missed out on the absolute tornado of comedy that is Reese Darby.
00:00:16,00:00:21,You probably know Reese for his roles as Murray the manager on Flight of the Concords or as
00:00:21,00:00:26,Nigel Billingsley from the Jumanji movies or perhaps you listen to his absolutely brilliant
00:00:26,00:00:31,podcast about the mysteries of the universe called the cryptid factor which he hosts with
00:00:31,00:00:34,his buddies Buttons and a doofus called Dan.
00:00:34,00:00:39,But what you may not have seen if you live in the UK is Reese playing his greatest role
00:00:39,00:00:44,"yet, Steed Bonnet, Gentleman Pirate in the sitcom Our Flag Means Death."
00:00:44,00:00:48,"This is such a great series, it came out last year on HBO Max but it's only just come to"
00:00:48,00:00:55,the UK on BBC2 and it's all about the real life story of Steed Bonnet who decided to give
00:00:55,00:00:59,up his entire life and become a Gentleman Pirate of the Seas.
00:00:59,00:01:05,He befriends Blackbeard who's played by the absolute genius comedy director Tycho Waititi
00:01:05,00:01:11,and you can watch it now in the UK on BBC2 every Wednesday at 10pm or if you're impatient
00:01:11,00:01:17,like me just head straight to BBC iPlayer and you can watch the entire series in one bingy
00:01:17,00:01:18,go.
00:01:18,00:01:22,"Anyway, it was so great having Reese back on the show you can find the previous episode"
00:01:22,00:01:26,in the Fish Archives if you want to hear his first time here with us and he wasn't on
00:01:26,00:01:30,that show either poor guy can't get a break but we hope you enjoy it and then make sure
00:01:30,00:01:51,to watch Our Flag Means Death immediately afterwards.
00:01:51,00:01:56,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this"
00:01:56,00:02:00,week coming to you from four mysterious locations around the globe.
00:02:00,00:02:05,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and joining"
00:02:05,00:02:10,us once again it is the return of our very special guest Reese Darby and once again we
00:02:10,00:02:14,have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven
00:02:14,00:02:18,days and in no particular order here we go.
00:02:18,00:02:21,Starting with fact number one and that is Reese.
00:02:21,00:02:29,My fact is that pirate Steed Bonnet invented the idea of walking the plank.
00:02:29,00:02:38,"That's a pretty big invention, I would say in the world of pirating."
00:02:38,00:02:41,"I don't use it in my day to day life, it's pretty niche isn't it?"
00:02:41,00:02:45,"It's putting together two things that already exist, walking and planks, it doesn't come"
00:02:45,00:02:47,"up with anything new there, has he?"
00:02:47,00:02:51,I know but if you're even a child and you dress up as a pirate one of the first things
00:02:51,00:02:56,"you learn in your entire life is that they walk the plank, I mean he is, what a legacy."
00:02:56,00:02:57,That's right.
00:02:57,00:03:00,Is it true though?
00:03:00,00:03:05,"Let's put it this way, it's more of a myth really that he came up with it."
00:03:05,00:03:07,"That's fine, that's what we deal in."
00:03:07,00:03:12,"It's a Dan fact you know, you know the show."
00:03:12,00:03:20,"So well he might have done, some people say that he did, I actually believe he did because"
00:03:20,00:03:25,"even though it's out there as a myth, I believe knowing Steed as I do, playing the role of"
00:03:25,00:03:32,"Steed for two seasons now, that he would have come up with it in reality because the whole"
00:03:32,00:03:40,idea behind walking the plank is they blindfold the person and they make them walk it and
00:03:40,00:03:46,so then they get away with not being accused of murder because that person has killed themselves.
00:03:46,00:03:51,"The captain has said, alright walk along that plank will you, all the best and the guy's"
00:03:51,00:03:57,"like, hey what's happening, hey walk along here, you can imagine it as I'm describing"
00:03:57,00:03:58,it here.
00:03:58,00:04:10,"I've got to blindfold on, where's this plank going you know and then that's the shark."
00:04:10,00:04:14,"So he wouldn't want to stab someone or shoot someone, no he wants to do it, he wants to"
00:04:14,00:04:19,"be slightly away from the action right and say, you did it yourself."
00:04:19,00:04:22,Absolutely very uncomfortable with the idea of killing someone.
00:04:22,00:04:26,"Why are you hitting yourself, why are you punching yourself, why are you letting yourself"
00:04:26,00:04:28,get eaten by sharks.
00:04:28,00:04:29,Exactly that's it.
00:04:29,00:04:30,Is that getting you into heaven?
00:04:30,00:04:34,I was uncomfortable with killing people so I just let them kill themselves.
00:04:34,00:04:37,"He's still, he's walking a fine line isn't he already."
00:04:37,00:04:44,"He's walking a fine plank for sure but I think that's the point, it's a moral issue and so"
00:04:44,00:04:48,"he can think to himself, oh I didn't kill him, he killed himself, he walked off that"
00:04:48,00:04:52,plank that I designed and it's quite a ingenious idea really to think that especially back
00:04:52,00:04:56,in those days you could make someone kill themselves without you having to actually
00:04:56,00:04:58,get your hands dirty.
00:04:58,00:05:03,"Which was we should say like the golden age of piracy, 1718 was it, he died?"
00:05:03,00:05:04,Yes.
00:05:04,00:05:05,I think.
00:05:05,00:05:10,"So 1700, 17 to 1730 was the golden age, he was right in the middle of it."
00:05:10,00:05:15,"Wasn't he very short lived really as a pirate, for a pirate who is quite famous, it was quite"
00:05:15,00:05:16,a brief career wasn't it?
00:05:16,00:05:17,Two years.
00:05:17,00:05:19,"I live with the man, I think it was like a year and a half."
00:05:19,00:05:24,"I think we should just quickly praisey this guy in his entirety, this was someone who was"
00:05:24,00:05:28,"a really well to do character, he was living very rich, he had a wife, he had some kids"
00:05:28,00:05:33,and then he just decided as part of ultimately what was I guess a midlife crisis or he was
00:05:33,00:05:39,"dealing with trauma of a quite difficult childhood, just left his family, bought a ship and just"
00:05:39,00:05:45,"said I'm now a pirate, got a crew, named the ship The Revenge and just started sailing"
00:05:45,00:05:50,"and he paid his staff, you know he paid the pirates, he was as you say a gentleman pirate"
00:05:50,00:05:52,with zero abilities.
00:05:52,00:05:55,Didn't he not tell the pirates that they were going to be pirates?
00:05:55,00:06:00,"I read somewhere that he kind of brought them on, he got all of these guys to be his staff"
00:06:00,00:06:04,"and then only when they were at sea he said oh by the way you're pirates, this isn't just"
00:06:04,00:06:05,"a fun cruise, this is a."
00:06:05,00:06:11,"That sounds like him as well, knowing him being in his shoes, absolutely yeah, he definitely,"
00:06:11,00:06:16,"he bought the ship, it was already called The Revenge I believe and he liked the name"
00:06:16,00:06:22,"of it and it was actually quite a common name for ships back then and then yeah he installed,"
00:06:22,00:06:29,"this is the really fun stuff, he installed a library on the boat so he built a library"
00:06:29,00:06:36,"because he loved his books, he wanted to leave home and leave his wife and life but he didn't"
00:06:36,00:06:41,"want to leave his books, something you might do Dan, so he brought his entire collection"
00:06:41,00:06:43,of his books and put them on the ship.
00:06:43,00:06:47,"I reckon Dan, I reckon you would go being a pirate with your books of course but also"
00:06:47,00:06:49,probably your Ben Elton collection.
00:06:49,00:06:53,"Absolutely, well you're signed, everything signed you've got in your house would come"
00:06:53,00:06:54,with you.
00:06:54,00:07:01,"You'd need memorabilia to sort of wow blackbeard with you know, no actually Ben Elton did"
00:07:01,00:07:07,"I think actually hold this particular bit of tissue, really, wow, I was actually going"
00:07:07,00:07:11,"to say it was pretty hard on his wife with the book stealing, not only is she lost her"
00:07:11,00:07:16,husband but he's nicked all the bloody books but actually in your case Dan it would be
00:07:16,00:07:20,"quite a relief probably for Fenella, yeah it'd be like the ultimate Marie Kundo or whatever"
00:07:20,00:07:26,"that book was called, it's like yeah, you know, step four, make your husband a pirate,"
00:07:26,00:07:28,lose all.
00:07:28,00:07:29,Thank God.
00:07:29,00:07:34,"Yeah and so in the series as well there's the relationship, the fact that he in real"
00:07:34,00:07:39,"life meets blackbeard, the most famous of all the pirates and what's crazy as well is"
00:07:39,00:07:43,"I assume blackbeard must have existed for a long time but he had a two-year run as well,"
00:07:43,00:07:47,"that was it, blackbeard's pirating years were two years."
00:07:47,00:07:48,It's amazing.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"It was pretty fast and loose as a pirate, didn't you, it probably wasn't the safest"
00:07:51,00:07:53,line of work to go into for being honest.
00:07:53,00:07:54,No.
00:07:54,00:08:00,"They were like the Liz Truss of pirates, weren't they, those guys, that's the most fluttering"
00:08:00,00:08:05,"comparison Liz Truss has ever got but yeah, blackbeard and him had quite a weird relationship"
00:08:05,00:08:12,but it's kind of the relationship to a needy loser and the real cool guy of the open seas
00:08:12,00:08:15,"because Steve wasn't that good at pirating especially at first, was he?"
00:08:15,00:08:16,No.
00:08:16,00:08:20,You know there's the reality through the knowledge we have from various accounts and
00:08:20,00:08:26,history and then there's obviously the fictional version which my show is so without getting
00:08:26,00:08:31,too confused about which is real and which isn't because the real reports are sketchy
00:08:31,00:08:37,"at best as well but when you look at it, it kind of makes sense that something happened"
00:08:37,00:08:42,"between the two of them, even if it was just a friendship, blackbeard was fascinated by"
00:08:42,00:08:46,"this guy because he looked glorious in his outfits, he had these little winker picker"
00:08:46,00:08:53,"shoes and glorious coats and various things like that, he was a fancy man and blackbeard"
00:08:53,00:08:57,must have gone what the hell are you doing in this job because you know they were all
00:08:57,00:09:00,"desperate, they didn't want to become pirates, that was like the only life they had to go"
00:09:00,00:09:06,into because of their circumstance and so here's this guy who's like I want to be part
00:09:06,00:09:11,of this too and he's absolutely not supposed to be there and he was wounded and I think
00:09:11,00:09:15,"instead of just letting him like killing him or getting rid of him, I think there was a"
00:09:15,00:09:20,"massive fascination, I think maybe if you look at blackbeard wanting to see the other"
00:09:20,00:09:24,"side of how the other side lives, like probably a lot of people did back in those days, you're"
00:09:24,00:09:30,either ridiculously poor and haven't got anything going on or you're the aristocracy and never
00:09:30,00:09:34,"the twain shall meet and so when they do, I think that's when you've got this really"
00:09:34,00:09:39,interesting like oh how can I become you or how can I learn from you or how can I steal
00:09:39,00:09:41,your ideas to make me better.
00:09:41,00:09:49,"So you was like the Louis Theroux of the pirating world, spending a few weeks observing, getting"
00:09:49,00:09:50,all the accessories.
00:09:50,00:09:51,"Yeah, exactly."
00:09:51,00:09:53,"Perhaps because he could have just killed him, he could have just got rid of him and"
00:09:53,00:09:59,"this guy back in history was not, he's not as portrayed as capable as I am in the show,"
00:09:59,00:10:00,you know.
00:10:00,00:10:01,And that's saying something.
00:10:01,00:10:05,But I reckon this is a really interesting way of doing history right because we don't
00:10:05,00:10:10,"have much information about Steve Bonnet, we have little bits here and there, but Rhys,"
00:10:10,00:10:14,you've lived as him for two years in the show pretty much and I reckon you've got a really
00:10:14,00:10:19,good insight into what he might have been thinking and what he might have done and stuff.
00:10:19,00:10:20,Yeah.
00:10:20,00:10:21,Why the hell he did it?
00:10:21,00:10:22,"That's always the great mystery, isn't it?"
00:10:22,00:10:26,"It's always portrayed as this huge midlife crisis, which makes sense, it's the fantasy"
00:10:26,00:10:29,that every eight-year-old has that we grow out of by the time we're twelve.
00:10:29,00:10:31,"That's not midlife, is it?"
00:10:31,00:10:32,Eight years old?
00:10:32,00:10:36,"It's like when you have a midlife crisis, you revert back to those tragic fantasies"
00:10:36,00:10:41,"you had as a child that are unrealistic and it was portrayed in, you know, the famous"
00:10:41,00:10:46,"book of pirates, which is where we get basically all of our pirate knowledge by a mysterious"
00:10:46,00:10:50,"person called Captain Charles Johnson, who was written a few years later."
00:10:50,00:10:56,"And his portrayal, which is often what is repeated, is that he was trying to bear the"
00:10:56,00:11:01,"awful situation of having a nagging wife, but yeah, Rhys, you've been him, why did he"
00:11:01,00:11:02,do it?
00:11:02,00:11:06,"I really hope that you, James and Anna, are subtly trying to get Rhys to sort of channel"
00:11:06,00:11:11,Steve and he comes through now and Rhys is no longer here.
00:11:11,00:11:13,We're getting this dandy.
00:11:13,00:11:14,Steve is just on the show.
00:11:14,00:11:18,"Look, I definitely think there was a midlife crisis situation going on if you look back"
00:11:18,00:11:26,"at the accounts, but also he had this life that he didn't necessarily want."
00:11:26,00:11:32,He was born into aristocracy and at that time piracy had just kicked in and it was this
00:11:32,00:11:37,"ridiculous, adventurous, out at sea life that was pretty much the opposite of what"
00:11:37,00:11:38,he's doing.
00:11:38,00:11:40,"And he's never even been to sea, by the way, this guy."
00:11:40,00:11:43,"So he's imagining, oh, wow, what would that be like?"
00:11:43,00:11:47,"And of course, anyone who's really intensely into their book reading has a great imagination."
00:11:47,00:11:51,"And I think he just one day went, look, I've actually got the means to, to change this."
00:11:51,00:11:55,And he probably had one massive fight with the wife that he obviously wasn't really getting
00:11:55,00:11:56,"on with and went, right, that's it."
00:11:56,00:11:57,I'm out.
00:11:57,00:11:58,I'm out.
00:11:58,00:12:01,"And in the middle of the night, you know, he, he sorted this out and just took off on"
00:12:01,00:12:02,a whim.
00:12:02,00:12:09,"And I think that, you know, he probably thought that he had the means to, to get away with"
00:12:09,00:12:10,it because he was a chiefly person.
00:12:10,00:12:13,He was someone who was sort of high up there.
00:12:13,00:12:18,And so he probably didn't even imagine he was going to get into trouble.
00:12:18,00:12:20,It certainly seemed like he didn't.
00:12:20,00:12:22,"It's confidence, blind confidence."
00:12:22,00:12:28,I once walked a plank in a virtual reality video game and this is why I was thinking
00:12:28,00:12:30,about how these guys were blindfolded.
00:12:30,00:12:33,"So we weren't blindfolded when we did this, but you're walking the plank on the top of"
00:12:33,00:12:35,a massive building.
00:12:35,00:12:39,And then the idea is you got to the end and then you jumped off and then you were in virtual
00:12:39,00:12:42,reality and you thought you were dying.
00:12:42,00:12:46,"And then you kept falling, falling, falling, and then you hit the floor and you absolutely"
00:12:46,00:12:50,"shit yourself because you thought you were dead, but actually you're in virtual reality."
00:12:50,00:12:54,"But what I thought was it was more scary because I could see what was happening, whereas these"
00:12:54,00:12:56,guys were blindfolded.
00:12:56,00:12:59,So it's the idea that they wouldn't know when they're getting to the end of the plank.
00:12:59,00:13:01,They'll just keep walking and that's it.
00:13:01,00:13:02,Yes.
00:13:02,00:13:04,"Well, let's have a chat about that."
00:13:04,00:13:10,"I mean, I think why do they need to be blindfolded for a start?"
00:13:10,00:13:11,Because they know they're out at sea.
00:13:11,00:13:12,They're on a boat.
00:13:12,00:13:13,All right.
00:13:13,00:13:14,Step up.
00:13:14,00:13:15,Step up onto the edge here.
00:13:15,00:13:16,"Oh, this is..."
00:13:16,00:13:17,"Well, I can feel that this is the edge of the boat."
00:13:17,00:13:18,"No, no, no."
00:13:18,00:13:19,It's not.
00:13:19,00:13:20,No.
00:13:20,00:13:21,You're going into one of the rooms.
00:13:21,00:13:22,We're going to have a little party.
00:13:22,00:13:23,"No, no."
00:13:23,00:13:24,I can feel the wind in my face here.
00:13:24,00:13:25,"No, no, no."
00:13:25,00:13:26,It's fine.
00:13:26,00:13:27,Walk.
00:13:27,00:13:28,Just keep walking.
00:13:28,00:13:29,All right.
00:13:29,00:13:30,Yes.
00:13:30,00:13:31,Yes.
00:13:31,00:13:32,"Oh, well, this is going out into the sea, isn't it?"
00:13:32,00:13:33,"No, no."
00:13:33,00:13:34,"No, this is a little..."
00:13:34,00:13:35,It's actually a bridge towards the bar.
00:13:35,00:13:39,"I've got a cocktail here waiting for you, Larry."
00:13:39,00:13:40,Okay.
00:13:40,00:13:41,Okay.
00:13:41,00:13:42,It was very windy.
00:13:42,00:13:43,Yes.
00:13:43,00:13:44,"Well, we're all blowing."
00:13:44,00:13:45,Blow.
00:13:45,00:13:46,"Oh, that doesn't..."
00:13:46,00:13:47,It feels...
00:13:47,00:13:48,It feels like normal wind.
00:13:48,00:13:49,Not you.
00:13:49,00:13:50,You know what?
00:13:50,00:13:51,Your wind's like Larry.
00:13:51,00:13:52,"Ah, cheeky bugger."
00:13:52,00:13:56,"Just keep walking down there, mate."
00:13:56,00:13:59,"And I know I've really got into that, but, you know, I think..."
00:13:59,00:14:02,I've forgotten what we were asking.
00:14:02,00:14:05,"But I actually think that's true because it means you couldn't have, like, surprise parties"
00:14:05,00:14:06,"on a boat, could you?"
00:14:06,00:14:11,Because every time you put a blindfold on and you're walked into a room and they say
00:14:11,00:14:12,it's a party...
00:14:12,00:14:13,Yeah.
00:14:13,00:14:15,I think that's a good point we've got to.
00:14:15,00:14:19,"In history, there's been no surprise parties on pirate ships for that reason."
00:14:19,00:14:20,Happy birthday!
00:14:20,00:14:21,Whoa!
00:14:21,00:14:25,It's starting to real quick.
00:14:25,00:14:30,It actually doesn't make any sense that they would be able to walk a plank while out in
00:14:30,00:14:34,the rough seas blindfolded and shaking with nerves.
00:14:34,00:14:35,"Oh, yes."
00:14:35,00:14:36,"I mean, you fall off."
00:14:36,00:14:37,"You don't get to the end of that plank, do you?"
00:14:37,00:14:38,No.
00:14:38,00:14:39,Such a good point.
00:14:39,00:14:40,You're falling off straight away.
00:14:40,00:14:42,"Also, is this where we got the diving board from?"
00:14:42,00:14:43,Yeah.
00:14:43,00:14:44,"Ah, yes."
00:14:44,00:14:45,I was just thinking...
00:14:45,00:14:49,Imagine the cockiness of someone that you've sentenced to death who walks blindfolded to
00:14:49,00:14:53,"the end of the plank, jumps off and does a triple backwards up a salt."
00:14:53,00:14:54,That's amazing.
00:14:54,00:14:55,That's a legend.
00:14:55,00:14:56,What a death!
00:14:56,00:14:57,What a death!
00:14:57,00:14:58,Yeah.
00:14:58,00:15:08,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:15:08,00:15:13,"Okay, my fact this week is that goats like it when you smile at them, but only if you"
00:15:13,00:15:16,approach them from the right-hand side.
00:15:16,00:15:17,How can that possibly be true?
00:15:17,00:15:18,Why can it be true?
00:15:18,00:15:26,The findings of a study in 2018 at the Buttercup Sanctuary for Goats in Kent and what they
00:15:26,00:15:33,"did was they put photos of humans, men and women, black and white, and they put one on"
00:15:33,00:15:36,"the left and one on the right, and one of them was smiling and one of them wasn't, and"
00:15:36,00:15:41,"the goats always went to the smiling one, but only when it was on the right-hand side."
00:15:41,00:15:44,"When it was on the left-hand side, they couldn't give a shit."
00:15:44,00:15:48,"They would just randomly go to one or the other, but when it was on the right-hand side,"
00:15:48,00:15:53,"they always went to it, and two things here, one, not many animals care whether humans"
00:15:53,00:15:55,are smiling or not.
00:15:55,00:15:56,We know that dogs do.
00:15:56,00:15:58,We know that horses do.
00:15:58,00:16:02,"That's because they're domesticated animals, and this is one of the first other animals"
00:16:02,00:16:08,"that we found that actually cares if humans smile, and the other thing is that perhaps"
00:16:08,00:16:10,why are they only bothered about the right-hand side?
00:16:10,00:16:13,"Well, it could be the way that their brain processes things."
00:16:13,00:16:18,So maybe they're processing emotions on one side of the brain or visual things on one
00:16:18,00:16:19,side of the brain.
00:16:19,00:16:20,We're not really sure.
00:16:20,00:16:21,Why do they use black and white photo?
00:16:21,00:16:25,Can you not fork out in the budget for a colour photography?
00:16:25,00:16:26,Do they see colour?
00:16:26,00:16:27,Do they see colour?
00:16:27,00:16:29,That's a great question.
00:16:29,00:16:30,That's a great question.
00:16:30,00:16:36,"You know goats almost as well as, you know, Steve Bonnet, do you think they see colour?"
00:16:36,00:16:39,"I would like to think they do, especially my ones."
00:16:39,00:16:45,"When I turn up to feed them, I always come in from the left, and they're smiling."
00:16:45,00:16:51,"I'm smiling, but they can't."
00:16:51,00:16:52,You always make sure to smile?
00:16:52,00:16:54,That's part of it.
00:16:54,00:16:59,I'm just remenining that I must be smiling because I'm happy to see that.
00:16:59,00:17:03,"I don't see them a hell of a lot because they're in New Zealand, but I spend time with them"
00:17:03,00:17:05,"when I'm there, of course."
00:17:05,00:17:06,They are emotionally intelligent.
00:17:06,00:17:13,"I hadn't realised that they were to this extent, so they did a study where researchers"
00:17:13,00:17:18,"recorded goats making certain noises, noises when they were happy and noises when they"
00:17:18,00:17:19,were sad.
00:17:19,00:17:23,"So this did involve the researchers making the goats happy and sad, so they'd make them"
00:17:23,00:17:27,"happy by sort of giving them food, and then they'd make them sad, and this is sort of"
00:17:27,00:17:30,like really minimal level of sadness.
00:17:30,00:17:34,"They'd isolate them from their herd for five minutes, or they'd get a goat to watch another"
00:17:34,00:17:37,goat eat when that goat didn't have much food.
00:17:37,00:17:42,"But I know goats, and that is very sad for them."
00:17:42,00:17:43,That's tragic.
00:17:43,00:17:47,The two things they really care about are being together and eating.
00:17:47,00:17:48,"Oh, really?"
00:17:48,00:17:49,That's it.
00:17:49,00:17:50,"Oh, yeah, that's it."
00:17:50,00:17:54,"And to have fun, they climb, so they love to get on top of things, and they love running"
00:17:54,00:17:59,"around, but they much prefer to be doing all that sort of stuff to see it."
00:17:59,00:18:00,Right.
00:18:00,00:18:02,"OK, well, maybe this was like torture for them, perhaps."
00:18:02,00:18:03,It would have been.
00:18:03,00:18:06,"And also, Anna, I've been in a restaurant with you when one of us has got our food,"
00:18:06,00:18:09,and yours hasn't quite arrived yet.
00:18:09,00:18:10,The look on your face.
00:18:10,00:18:11,I make some pretty weird noises.
00:18:11,00:18:12,I can't deny that.
00:18:12,00:18:16,"OK, I make some weird goat-like, bleating sounds."
00:18:16,00:18:21,"Anyway, the noises that goats make are pretty much indistinguishable to us when they're"
00:18:21,00:18:24,"happy and sad in those situations, except probably reason for your own goats you pick"
00:18:24,00:18:25,up on it.
00:18:25,00:18:30,"But if you play those sounds to their fellow goats, just audio recordings, their heart"
00:18:30,00:18:34,"rates will stay normal, and they'll be all chilled out when they hear the happy sounds."
00:18:34,00:18:38,"But when they hear the almost identical sounding, anxious sounds, then their heart rates kind"
00:18:38,00:18:42,"of shoot up, so they're feeling this empathy on behalf of this other goat."
00:18:42,00:18:43,Wow.
00:18:43,00:18:47,"Rhys, have you ever, this is a leaning into a myth here, but I'd just be curious, have"
00:18:47,00:18:52,you ever dipped your feet into salt water and then let goats lick your feet?
00:18:52,00:18:53,No.
00:18:53,00:18:54,No?
00:18:54,00:18:55,OK.
00:18:55,00:19:00,"I've already, but I have taken the goats for a walk down on the beach and been through"
00:19:00,00:19:01,salt water.
00:19:01,00:19:04,"Yeah, so, OK, next time you're back in New Zealand, give it a go, because I'd be curious"
00:19:04,00:19:06,to hear whether or not this hurts.
00:19:06,00:19:11,"This was a sort of myth that's been in books for a long time, and possibly it was tried"
00:19:11,00:19:15,"once or twice, who knows, where the ancient Romans were said to have used a thing called"
00:19:15,00:19:19,"tickle torture, and the idea was that you would get someone, you would soak their feet"
00:19:19,00:19:25,"in salt water, and then the salt would then be licked by a thirsty ghost."
00:19:25,00:19:26,Ghost?
00:19:26,00:19:27,Ghost.
00:19:27,00:19:30,I took a turn.
00:19:30,00:19:33,Oh my God.
00:19:33,00:19:37,"I love salt, don't I?"
00:19:37,00:19:43,"Oh, no, I just checked my notes down and all this is actually about ghosts."
00:19:43,00:19:46,All this stuff I've been saying about goats.
00:19:46,00:19:49,It's ghosts like it if you smile at them.
00:19:49,00:19:52,"Always approach a ghost from the right-hand side, yeah."
00:19:52,00:19:54,Now it's making sense.
00:19:54,00:20:00,"So, apparently, if a goat licks your feet, because they have really rough tongues, that"
00:20:00,00:20:04,"the torture, and because they're so thirsty and the salt makes them thirstier, they keep"
00:20:04,00:20:08,"licking, and then they rip your feet off, and that would be a method of torture back"
00:20:08,00:20:09,in the...
00:20:09,00:20:10,Rip your feet off.
00:20:10,00:20:12,"Their tongues aren't made of teeth, are they?"
00:20:12,00:20:13,"No, sorry."
00:20:13,00:20:17,"They would slowly, like a lollipop, lick their way through your feet."
00:20:17,00:20:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:18,00:20:25,"Yeah, I tend to not let their mouths too close to my body bits, because they have teeth and"
00:20:25,00:20:31,"everything, you know, and they're always wanting to nibble, and so they nibble on my clothes,"
00:20:31,00:20:39,"they pull my garments, and I certainly can't see myself getting my naked feet out and dangling"
00:20:39,00:20:43,them in front of their faces with salt.
00:20:43,00:20:44,Do they then...
00:20:44,00:20:45,Another question about your goats.
00:20:45,00:20:48,"I mean, do they urinate on themselves and each other, or themselves?"
00:20:48,00:20:53,"So first of all, they'll wheel over themselves to attract a female, and it looks kind of"
00:20:53,00:20:54,cool.
00:20:54,00:20:56,"Billy Goats shove their heads right between their legs, because they want to wee in their"
00:20:56,00:21:03,"bids, because I guess that gathers up the smell better, and they wheel over them, and"
00:21:03,00:21:10,"then they will go to the lady who can tell that he's up for a shag, but then he tests"
00:21:10,00:21:14,"her urine as well to make sure that she's eligible, to make sure that she's actually"
00:21:14,00:21:21,"on heat, and so she will squat down, and he'll put his head between her legs, and then she'll"
00:21:21,00:21:27,"wheel over him, and then they curl up the lips, the flame and response, which is where if"
00:21:27,00:21:32,"you see a goat expose its lip, like curl up its top lip, it's got all these receptors"
00:21:32,00:21:33,in it.
00:21:33,00:21:37,"Yeah, James is doing it right now, it's very attractive look actually, it's got receptors"
00:21:37,00:21:42,in it that pick up whether the urine has the right hormones in it that says this woman is
00:21:42,00:21:49,"ready to be fertilised by you, and so it's very wee based courting process, sexy stuff."
00:21:49,00:21:53,"I know nothing of that, because I only have boy goats."
00:21:53,00:21:54,Oh really?
00:21:54,00:22:00,"Yeah, well when you have both, you know, you're intimating, and if you've got females, then"
00:22:00,00:22:06,"you're into milking, so I've only got male castoffs, which you know, the boy goats are"
00:22:06,00:22:09,only good for either meat or pets.
00:22:09,00:22:13,"Yeah, oh wow, so they're never aroused your goats, they never need to move themselves."
00:22:13,00:22:16,"They're never aroused, and I've never even seen them wee."
00:22:16,00:22:17,Oh they must?
00:22:17,00:22:23,"No, never, never seen them wee, mind you, mine are pedigree, so I don't think they do."
00:22:23,00:22:29,"Yeah good point, I've heard that about certain breeds, they just explode with urine at their"
00:22:29,00:22:30,"death, don't they?"
00:22:30,00:22:36,"Well sometimes I see them hiding, and I come to the pen and I think, oh what's going on,"
00:22:36,00:22:42,"you having a wee are you, and then I can hear, don't come in here, I'm in here, and that"
00:22:42,00:22:46,"kind of thing, and so I wonder, there's probably something happening there, and then they just"
00:22:46,00:22:49,"come through, oh hello dad, what's going on today?"
00:22:49,00:22:51,Do they call you dad?
00:22:51,00:22:53,Yeah they call me dad.
00:22:53,00:22:56,"I didn't see you coming dad, you came on the left hand side, did you?"
00:22:56,00:23:01,"Yeah yeah sorry, I was going to check on you guys, so you want to go for another walk down"
00:23:01,00:23:02,to the beach?
00:23:02,00:23:06,"Oh no, I'm fine, Alexander's just behind the pen there, don't go around there, he's"
00:23:06,00:23:07,"just doing something, don't worry about him."
00:23:07,00:23:14,"Are you sure you've got goats, not a sort of pantomime act as it goes across trees?"
00:23:14,00:23:18,"But here's an interesting thing about goats, so you said like pedigree goats, you can get"
00:23:18,00:23:24,"them, you can get really good goats, especially for milking and stuff, and in order to get"
00:23:24,00:23:29,"those you might need a stud, so you might need a really good male goat who's going to"
00:23:29,00:23:34,"have sex with lots of females, but the thing is that they can only have so many, they can"
00:23:34,00:23:38,"only have sex so many times, right, there's only so many hours in the day that you can"
00:23:38,00:23:44,"do that, and so recently they've come up with a new way of, basically what they do is they"
00:23:44,00:23:51,"put some genes into a goat which changes its testicles, so they're effectively the testicles"
00:23:51,00:23:57,"of another goat, and so this goat which isn't the normal stud can have sex with a female"
00:23:57,00:24:03,"and the offspring will be the offspring of the original stud, even though the stud's"
00:24:03,00:24:04,just at home having a coffee.
00:24:04,00:24:05,"Oh my god, really?"
00:24:05,00:24:06,Really?
00:24:06,00:24:11,"It's like the Handmaid's Tale kind of, where you think you're shagging one person but you're"
00:24:11,00:24:15,"actually shagging the more fertile person, it's like it's actually a less dark version"
00:24:15,00:24:20,of the Handmaid's Tale without the feminist dystopian undertones.
00:24:20,00:24:21,The Milkmaid's Tale.
00:24:21,00:24:22,Exactly.
00:24:22,00:24:29,I wonder if that's quite demoralising though for the goat who the person said your testes
00:24:29,00:24:32,"aren't good enough, we're just going to shove these other blokes on you, who you've always"
00:24:32,00:24:34,been intimidated by anyway.
00:24:34,00:24:36,I don't think they even know they're goats.
00:24:36,00:24:38,They're probably dreams.
00:24:38,00:24:39,Goats?
00:24:39,00:24:40,Of course they know they're goats.
00:24:40,00:24:41,Yeah.
00:24:41,00:24:42,Very good.
00:24:42,00:24:46,"Because I've tried to take them out, you know, we've gone into town and my guys have"
00:24:46,00:24:51,"got, no, no, we can't, we're goats, we can't go in there, we're not going to, we won't"
00:24:51,00:24:55,"be allowed in there, Dad."
00:24:55,00:24:57,"Can I, can I, can you take the blindfold off me?"
00:24:57,00:25:01,"No, just, just, you'll be fine, Alexander, we're just, we're going into town."
00:25:01,00:25:07,"I can sense there's someone coming up to me on the left hand side, I can sense it."
00:25:07,00:25:10,"He's asking me for ID, Dad, what do I do?"
00:25:10,00:25:15,"Dad, I don't have any ID, I'm a goat, I told him I was, I'm a goat."
00:25:15,00:25:20,"Look, I'm sorry, he doesn't know he's a goat, if you could just let him, I do know I'm a"
00:25:20,00:25:25,"goat, Dad, I told you, and get the blindfold off me."
00:25:25,00:25:31,I saw a photo earlier today of it was a tree which looked like it was growing goats.
00:25:31,00:25:35,"There was like an apple tree, there was like 30 goats."
00:25:35,00:25:36,They love climbing trees.
00:25:36,00:25:39,But they were just all sitting in this tree and I didn't think they had the dexterity
00:25:39,00:25:40,to do it.
00:25:40,00:25:42,"I don't know, yeah, they're big on, yeah."
00:25:42,00:25:47,"They do like climbing trees and they like climbing, but often if you see those photos,"
00:25:47,00:25:53,"some places will fake it, just fake it for tourists basically, they'll kind of tie the"
00:25:53,00:25:57,"goats into trees and then say, look, all these goats have climbed this tree and they're"
00:25:57,00:26:01,"all free will, because at the end of the day, they need the tourists to come and take the"
00:26:01,00:26:04,"photos, but the goats aren't going to do what they want."
00:26:04,00:26:08,"Sometimes they'll climb and sometimes they won't, so they, yeah, they kind of fake it"
00:26:08,00:26:09,sometimes.
00:26:09,00:26:13,That's the shocking reality of tourism in some of these places.
00:26:13,00:26:14,I'm afraid so.
00:26:14,00:26:19,"The other thing is, there's a theory that goats used to be birds and that's why they're"
00:26:19,00:26:24,"in the trees a lot, because they are reverting back to their previous life."
00:26:24,00:26:29,Is there scientific papers written supporting this theory or is this just some bloke in
00:26:29,00:26:30,your local pub?
00:26:30,00:26:32,"No, I'm just, I'm pulling it up now."
00:26:32,00:26:33,Okay.
00:26:33,00:26:34,Here it is.
00:26:34,00:26:35,Scientific theories.
00:26:35,00:26:36,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:36,00:26:37,Goats.
00:26:37,00:26:38,"Yeah, goats used to be birds."
00:26:38,00:26:39,There it is.
00:26:39,00:26:40,Involved letters.
00:26:40,00:26:41,Absolutely incredible.
00:26:41,00:26:44,"Well, that's two pages and it's signed at the bottom there."
00:26:44,00:26:45,Two pages.
00:26:45,00:26:46,That's your evidence.
00:26:46,00:26:47,They believe they're flying.
00:26:47,00:26:58,That's the closest thing they can get to going back to their old life as a bird by flying.
00:26:58,00:27:03,"And then they'll end up in the trees and you'll, you'll often hear them twerking."
00:27:03,00:27:04,Twerking.
00:27:04,00:27:05,"No, twerping."
00:27:05,00:27:08,You should see them twerk.
00:27:08,00:27:10,He's amazing.
00:27:10,00:27:12,What's the actual word that birds make?

00:27:35,00:27:41,"facts, which isn't as amazing as that but is true, is that we've never talked about myotonic"
00:27:41,00:27:49,goats and I think they always deserve a mention. The myotonic fainting goats. They're a breed
00:27:49,00:27:55,"in Tennessee that basically have an anomaly in their genes where when they panic, if they're"
00:27:55,00:28:00,"approached from the left for instance or not smiling or there's a loud noise, something"
00:28:00,00:28:05,"like that, then they try to escape. But what this does is contracts their muscles so they"
00:28:05,00:28:10,stiffen up completely and then just kind of fall over onto their side and it's quite comical
00:28:10,00:28:15,to see if you've never seen it. It's bizarre. I've seen videos of that. Yeah. It's very
00:28:15,00:28:19,interesting. Do we know why it happens Anna? Because it feels like it would die out quite
00:28:19,00:28:25,quickly. Well I think it was only dyed in as it were quite recently through breeding
00:28:25,00:28:29,"so I don't think it would have any evolutionary purpose and you're right, in the wild they"
00:28:29,00:28:34,probably wouldn't survive very long but they are now bred from the same batch that have
00:28:34,00:28:39,passed this. I think Steve Bonnet suffered from that same gene anomaly just sort of
00:28:39,00:28:45,stiffening up and fainting at the site of any sort of doubt. Oh yeah. Yeah. And he overcame
00:28:45,00:28:50,it. Did he? Well how did he overcome it? Well you know just really sort of you know getting
00:28:50,00:28:56,with a really tough pirate and learning how to proper be a pirate. You know I think goats
00:28:56,00:29:03,if you put those little feinty ones in with you know some real hardcore proper rustic goats
00:29:03,00:29:08,that probably learn the ways and would become more goaty. Yeah. Less feinty. Billy Goat Blackbeard
00:29:08,00:29:12,takes them under their wing. Yeah that's right. What you can also do is you can deprive them
00:29:12,00:29:17,of water which bizarrely cures this problem. There are other problems if you don't get
00:29:17,00:29:22,the water out now. So it's a very fine balance to strike but they're kind of useful now because
00:29:22,00:29:28,myotonia is also a thing in humans like sudden muscle seizures. Some people have that. The
00:29:28,00:29:33,jumping Frenchmen of Maine are they called or something like that. I remember. Really?
00:29:33,00:29:37,I didn't know. I don't know about them are they a group of myotonia. There was a group
00:29:37,00:29:42,of French immigrants in Maine I think and they had this kind of thing where as soon
00:29:42,00:29:47,as you shocked them they were just feinted. Oh really? Wow. Wow. Yeah. How long are they
00:29:47,00:29:52,stiff for? How long do they like does it just slowly wear off? Yeah I think so. It's the
00:29:52,00:29:56,goats. They just kind of wake up don't they the goats. It's like a feint. Yeah. Yeah I've
00:29:56,00:30:00,seen the videos. It's bizarre. I've seen the videos. It's bizarre. I imagine if people
00:30:00,00:30:07,did do that and it's a very bizarre trait isn't it? Yeah it would make the start of
00:30:07,00:30:12,the 100 meters not much good would it? As soon as the bang goes off everyone just fainted.
00:30:12,00:30:17,It would be a race to see who came round the quickest. Yeah. That's why the Goat Olympics
00:30:17,00:30:22,have never taken off. Yeah we call the best in the world the goats. What's going on?
00:30:22,00:30:33,Yeah. Okay it is time for fact number three and that is Anna. My fact this week is that
00:30:33,00:30:38,Tin Tin's hair originally lay flat on his head until it got blown upwards in an early
00:30:38,00:30:47,comic strip and it never came back down. Wow. And that's why he's got that famous stupid
00:30:47,00:30:55,"quiff. Stupid, brilliant quiff. How dare you. Yeah. What are you talking about? Your stupid."
00:30:55,00:31:02,Okay. Actually Reese is sporting it's sort of half Tin Tinian quiff at the moment so
00:31:02,00:31:07,should be careful. But yeah and it doesn't it was not mentioned anywhere in the comic.
00:31:07,00:31:12,It's just the very first Tin Tin comic that was released. This is in January 1929 and
00:31:12,00:31:19,it was a tantin au pied de soviete. Tin Tin in the land of the Soviets and about sort
00:31:19,00:31:25,"of 10 pages in in the version I was reading. He drops out of a tree, much like a goat and"
00:31:25,00:31:31,falls into a convertible car sitting underneath it deliberately and drives the car away and
00:31:31,00:31:35,in the next plate you see his hair pushed up and then you follow the story through and
00:31:35,00:31:41,it just never drops again. So weird. Did they do it on purpose? Was this a subconscious thing?
00:31:41,00:31:46,We'll never know. We'll never know. Well I actually have the book here of course because
00:31:46,00:31:54,oh wow you do. Big Tin Tin fan and and I looked at this and yeah you're right we can we can
00:31:54,00:32:08,have a look here. I think it's as you say around page 10. Yes. Yeah this is an audio format.
00:32:08,00:32:12,Yeah you've you've all got imaginations at home. We want you to imagine Tin Tin climbing up a tree.
00:32:12,00:32:20,So climbing up a tree. See his his quiff hair is forward. Uh-huh. Yep. Okay he climbs up the tree
00:32:20,00:32:27,and then there he is for those at home that are listening to this. You guys can hear him here
00:32:27,00:32:33,jumping. Now he's in the car and it's flipped to the back and it's because of the wind of the car
00:32:33,00:32:39,and you can all hear that in that panel there. Yeah. But that's that's that's pretty amazing that
00:32:39,00:32:44,it happens midway through a comic. It's not like the start of a new comic. It's like it's like
00:32:44,00:32:49,Herge the the creator and the illustrator of Tin Tin did that in one panel and went oh that looks
00:32:49,00:32:53,good. I think so. Well I'll just leave that. That's what I think happened. Yeah yeah. And do you know
00:32:53,00:32:58,what's amazing about what you just showed us? There's a little something in that comic which is
00:32:58,00:33:06,what absolutely exploded Tin Tin into the masses of Europe and it and it was a very specific thing
00:33:06,00:33:10,that you might not have noticed as we were all just looking at these cartoons. Well did you notice
00:33:10,00:33:18,at home anyone? Write in if you spotted the moment. The four of us is what I'm talking about and
00:33:18,00:33:24,what it was is that this is 1929. This is the same year that Popeye was invented by the way.
00:33:24,00:33:29,And so this is and you know it's years before Superman and Batman. This is really old school
00:33:29,00:33:36,comic books. What they have in these drawings are speech bubbles and Europe did not have
00:33:36,00:33:41,speech bubbles at this point in their comics. They were over in America but they were a completely
00:33:41,00:33:46,new idea to certainly Belgium and let's say surrounding countries. I don't know about the
00:33:46,00:33:55,UK specifically. Luxembourg. Possibly Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The Netherlands. Let's go there.
00:33:55,00:34:01,Yeah and I read a great biography or rather I read a few pages from a great biography by Harry
00:34:01,00:34:06,Thompson about Tin Tin saying that basically his words in these speech bubbles were treated as if
00:34:06,00:34:11,they were carved on tablets of stone. They became quotes and they became something you would remember
00:34:11,00:34:18,"as a result of these speech bubbles and that is why Tin Tin exploded. So sorry. Are we claiming,"
00:34:18,00:34:22,I would say at the moment for me the invention of the speech bubble is up there with the invention
00:34:22,00:34:27,of the concept of walking a plank. I don't know if it's getting kind of... He didn't invent it.
00:34:27,00:34:32,"Einstein. Exactly. He didn't even invent it and it's not... No. It didn't independently appear,"
00:34:32,00:34:36,did it? It wasn't like oh wow how weird they've got these in America. Presumably they just read
00:34:36,00:34:41,a comic in America and thought well let's start doing that. Is that right? No but do you remember
00:34:41,00:34:46,when OK Go did their first video on Treadmills and you barely even heard the music? You were so
00:34:46,00:34:51,busy watching this innovative video. That's what it was. Could tell you what the song is.
00:34:51,00:34:58,Exactly. Oh the Treadmill song. The Treadmill song exactly. What a relatable for future generations.
00:34:58,00:35:05,Well you know in like 300 years everyone will be talking about you know how we all do those
00:35:05,00:35:11,Treadmill dances now. Yeah. You know how everyone does them. Well guess who did them first? Yeah.
00:35:11,00:35:17,"It was exactly. Yeah. That book by the way, the Tintin in the Soviet countries or whatever it is,"
00:35:17,00:35:22,I have that as well but if you go to the Tintin shop in London they'll only sell it to you under
00:35:22,00:35:29,"the counter. No. Yeah so I went to, it was my tin anniversary and I thought I'd buy my wife some"
00:35:29,00:35:35,tin tin stuff and she's Russian so I thought I'd buy the Soviet Tintin book and I went
00:35:35,00:35:40,and it wasn't anywhere and I didn't really know enough about Tintin that I knew it existed but
00:35:40,00:35:45,I assumed that it was maybe really rare and I said oh do you have this book and they went yeah well
00:35:45,00:35:50,we keep it under here now and since the Russian invasion of Ukraine they don't put it on display
00:35:50,00:35:56,anymore in that shop. That's so weird. That's incredible. So you feel like you were buying
00:35:56,00:36:04,comic book porn? Is it quite exciting? They gave me an unmarked paper bag. Yeah.
00:36:04,00:36:10,Do you know what's crazy? So 1929 is when Tintin debuts. By 1930 the comic is so massive that
00:36:10,00:36:18,Herge was invited to meet the Empress who was the ex-Empress I guess Zeta of Austria-Hungary
00:36:18,00:36:25,at the time and when he arrived he arrived by train and there was just huge crowds of people there
00:36:25,00:36:30,to meet not Herge specifically but Tintin because they hired an actor to be Tintin
00:36:30,00:36:36,who was an unknown kid who didn't have the right color hair and he was mobbed and not only did he
00:36:36,00:36:42,not have the right color hair he also couldn't quite keep the quiff up so Herge had to keep this
00:36:42,00:36:50,little like little tin of oily grease hair grease. I thought you were gonna go something about Mary
00:36:50,00:36:58,about it there Dan for a second. Oh Jesus. Tintin had to ejaculate every 30 minutes.
00:36:58,00:37:03,Like those poor goats? Like the goats. He had to have someone else's testicles implanted into him.
00:37:03,00:37:10,Exactly. Yeah. Blistering particles Tintin. But yeah so they came off this train and Tintin the
00:37:10,00:37:15,kid was mobbed and he was he was ripped away and Herge had to go and chase him and bring him back
00:37:15,00:37:22,but it was like one direction. Yeah right. If you remember them. Poor guy. Yeah. Yeah it was and in
00:37:22,00:37:29,fact you said you gave a famous Tintin quote there James blistering barnacles. Blistering barnacles.
00:37:29,00:37:35,Indeed. It's Captain Haddock right who says that. Yes. Yes frequently and this these are quite
00:37:35,00:37:39,interesting thing about translating Tintin into English because obviously it was originally
00:37:39,00:37:46,written in French. I was reading an interview with Leslie Lonsdale Cooper and she was one of the two
00:37:46,00:37:51,main translators of Tintin from French into English and she was doing it for 30 years but
00:37:51,00:37:56,she said one of the great challenges is fitting the words exactly into the speech bubbles because
00:37:56,00:38:00,you get exactly the same images but I don't you know when you hear a French announcement on a
00:38:00,00:38:04,tannoy and then you hear the English one and the French one always goes on about five times longer
00:38:04,00:38:09,so I don't know how she was compressing that but blistering barnacles was one of the things that
00:38:09,00:38:17,she came up with as a translation of actually Mise Sabor. I think it was in French which means a
00:38:17,00:38:25,thousand portholes. He's from Belgium though isn't he so yeah speak French. Speak French in
00:38:25,00:38:31,half of Belgium they do. He's supposedly based on a Frenchman wasn't he Tintin. Robert Sexy.
00:38:31,00:38:39,Yes. That's a good name. It's a great name isn't it. Robert Sexy. He was a French journalist
00:38:39,00:38:45,and apparently he looked a bit like Tintin. He went on adventures to the Soviet Union to the
00:38:45,00:38:50,Democratic Republic of Congo and to the US in the same order that Tintin does those books
00:38:50,00:38:57,but Hergé always said Tintin c'est moi so he always claimed that Tintin was based on himself
00:38:57,00:39:01,but we think he might have been inspired by various different journalists. There was another
00:39:01,00:39:05,theory that Tintin and all the characters were based on the family members of Hergé
00:39:05,00:39:09,and he denied it later in life. He said no no no it's nothing to do with them
00:39:09,00:39:14,but let me just quickly tell you about his family. There was his younger brother Paul
00:39:14,00:39:21,who had a round face and a quiff. There was his dad Alexis who was a clumsy man who had a twin
00:39:21,00:39:27,brother called Leon who lived nearby and the two of them would go for walks and they would wear
00:39:27,00:39:34,identical bowler hats and carry identical canes singing in unison as they did. His dog Snowy
00:39:35,00:39:40,who originally had the name Milo in French. Who does have the name Milo.
00:39:40,00:39:46,Who sorry rather who does have the name Milo in French shares that name with Hergé's first
00:39:46,00:39:53,girlfriend. Yes but that's no yeah a lot of people a lot of people have suggested are you saying
00:39:53,00:39:58,something rude but Harry Thompson points out that at the time it was considered to be a great
00:39:58,00:40:04,crime if you were a young boy hanging out with the opposite sex certainly if you were depicting
00:40:04,00:40:08,that in comics and so the only way he could represent this person who was very fond of
00:40:08,00:40:12,was to put her as a dog in there otherwise he would have gotten a lot of trouble.
00:40:12,00:40:20,What what kind of weird excuse maker for the fact that Hergé put pretty much zero women
00:40:20,00:40:25,in all of his comics were you reading oh we weren't allowed to include women in comic books
00:40:25,00:40:32,they had to be dogs they had to come in disguise he just didn't put any women characters in it
00:40:32,00:40:37,it's a bit of a bit of a hard to draw hard to draw women. That's not true what about
00:40:37,00:40:44,Bianca Kesterfuhrer the opera singer she's a huge character in this you're right she's
00:40:44,00:40:50,she is a heroine as well yeah that's true no you're right he had one he had Bianca that is true
00:40:50,00:40:56,and he did have the dog who maybe was based on his girlfriend but also weirdly the person James
00:40:56,00:41:02,mentioned sex there he had a travel companion called Milou as well so it might have been no way yeah
00:41:02,00:41:07,have you guys read what is apparently the best tint in and I haven't read it I'm ashamed ashamed
00:41:07,00:41:14,to say but tinted in Tibet people seem to say I'm guessing have you read Therese yes so that's
00:41:14,00:41:20,that's that's my favorite I mean I've let people know that I yeah I think I remember back it might
00:41:20,00:41:25,still be there on used to be on one of the social medias you put down your favorite book and I just
00:41:25,00:41:31,always put tinted in Tibet oh you've got such good taste that was his favorite you probably know
00:41:31,00:41:36,this that was Erzges favorite as well oh really yeah I didn't know that that's awesome um I just
00:41:36,00:41:41,because it's got a Sasquatch in it as well that's why oh yeah of course that's why it's your favorite
00:41:41,00:41:45,I thought you liked it for the great philosophical undertones and the exploration of kind of
00:41:45,00:41:49,Buddhist theology but it's it's the Sasquatch no I've never read it I just I just flicked through
00:41:49,00:41:56,and go straight to the Sasquatch and look at the pictures every time well it makes tinted the only
00:41:56,00:42:01,fictional character to have received the light of truth award from the Dalai Lama so this is like
00:42:01,00:42:07,the best honor that the Dalai Lama can bestow and it's to anyone who improves public understanding
00:42:07,00:42:12,of Tibet which is questionable if they did chug a Sasquatch into the storyline but yeah the Dalai
00:42:12,00:42:19,Lama gave tinted this amazing light of truth what's a Yeti you know yeah it's a Yeti yeah it's
00:42:19,00:42:25,perfectly correct it is you're right it and he's a good guy like he saves them so really I love it
00:42:25,00:42:30,when that happens yeah there's there's it's a good it's a great book does the Dalai Lama believe in
00:42:30,00:42:38,Yeti's do you know if anyone knows I would say so yeah so he has alluded to a belief unfortunately
00:42:38,00:42:46,the person he alluded that belief to was Brian Blessed so I'm not sure if we can trust Brian's
00:42:46,00:42:53,reporting but he when Brian was looking to climb to Mount Everest and obviously looking for Yeti's
00:42:53,00:42:58,along the way he had a what's it called an audience with the Dalai Lama and he met him they they
00:42:58,00:43:04,apparently did some boxing together Brian took a walk with them in the wood he saw him revive a
00:43:04,00:43:09,headless dead snake back to life and then they talked about Yeti's and he suggested that yeah
00:43:09,00:43:16,that they are real so yeah headless dead snake back to life what did he do just pick it up and wobble
00:43:16,00:43:29,it oh my god hey you're just wobbling that it's a knife it's a knife again he's doing it like the
00:43:29,00:43:36,thumb trick where you make it go hey look at that well here's the other thing too I'll say about the
00:43:36,00:43:44,hair the haircut on Tintin think about when you do find your your do you know when you you you're
00:43:44,00:43:48,young or whatever you may be in your 20s you're playing whether you're sorting something out
00:43:48,00:43:55,and you go right that's me quite often not everybody but a lot of people will will keep that
00:43:55,00:44:00,hairdo for their entire life and so that kind of fits in when you think about that because yeah
00:44:00,00:44:05,even when you lose your hair or it goes gray or whatever you know you go into your your later
00:44:05,00:44:12,stages of life you still got that same hairdo you had when you're in your early 20s that's a really
00:44:12,00:44:18,good point there was a thing wasn't there there was a scientific paper written about Tintin which was
00:44:18,00:44:23,when the first book was written he was supposed to be 14 and by the time the last book was written
00:44:23,00:44:31,he must have been about 60 because Herge was writing them for so long but he was 60 years old
00:44:31,00:44:38,never had to shave none of his hair's fallen out yeah he's still got those boyish features
00:44:38,00:44:43,and according to these scientists they reckon he suffered from hypopetuitorism due to repeated
00:44:43,00:44:49,blows to the head and some of the early books and does that stop you aging properly yeah it means
00:44:49,00:44:57,you never go through puberty he's got sort of an inverse to what most middle-aged men have where
00:44:57,00:45:02,he's bald all around the middle of his head and then he's got just lots of hair in the middle
00:45:02,00:45:06,and i'm looking at james has actually brought a tintin doll you have a tintin yes yeah to this
00:45:06,00:45:11,episode another visual feature that will be lost on our audience but it looks like a mohawk for me
00:45:11,00:45:16,he really does doesn't it yeah i know that he does have hair sorry when you turn it around
00:45:16,00:45:20,yeah it does yeah it's just from the front he looks bald i just say one one final thing is that
00:45:20,00:45:26,that he he really didn't like tintin at the end much the way that arthur kohn and doil got sick
00:45:26,00:45:32,of his creation of sherlock and he threw him off a cliff and and killed him off a waterfall
00:45:32,00:45:39,uh arguably it's just a wet cliff right only because i went there a few weeks ago did you
00:45:39,00:45:44,so the right light falls yeah all right would you say wet cliff is an accurate description
00:45:44,00:45:51,so he um he really didn't like tintin at the end and he was quite sick of him and so the final
00:45:51,00:45:57,tintin book that herje was working on up until the point of his death was a book called tintin
00:45:57,00:46:03,and alfart and all we have is the sort of rough sketches of it but the final pain that he got
00:46:03,00:46:10,up to the final bit of the story was having tintin covered in liquid polyester and being
00:46:10,00:46:17,sold as a work of art and we that's the cliffhanger we don't know what happened does he die does he
00:46:17,00:46:25,survive tintin is like uh like woody from toy story left on a cliffhanger we'll never know so do you
00:46:25,00:46:30,mean he was put in like a work of art like a damian hearst kind of thing yes that's the idea
00:46:30,00:46:34,knowing tintin as i as i do i would say he'd probably escape from that
00:46:34,00:46:41,yeah but his his god might have turned him against that right like herje was who knows
00:46:41,00:46:46,what he was going to do there we just don't know we don't know reese it's it it's interesting isn't
00:46:46,00:46:52,yeah i well uh it's interesting isn't it they these people that play also when you think of actors
00:46:52,00:46:59,that play these um characters that are so loved and they get sick of them as well i was just thinking
00:46:59,00:47:06,of harrison ford with han solo does he not like did he not like hans by the way he he said he'll
00:47:06,00:47:12,come back to star wars but he wanted the characters to die which is a spoiler but at least that's if
00:47:12,00:47:18,you haven't seen that one it came out a few years ago now um but and then the whole james bond dying
00:47:18,00:47:25,in that last bond that that daniel craig that's a bit more fresh that's a bit more fresh it reminds
00:47:25,00:47:36,me of uh that character anna karellina yeah i don't know if you okay it is time for our final
00:47:36,00:47:43,fact of the show and that is my fact my fact this week is that for over 50 years now the author of
00:47:43,00:47:50,a nearly complete history of the moose in new zealand has been looking for moose in new zealand
00:47:50,00:48:00,despite there being no moose in new zealand or is there oh yeah exactly or is there is there no
00:48:00,00:48:05,there isn't well there could be there is could there be all right well talk to us about why would
00:48:05,00:48:10,he not be looking is it quite a short book it sounds like there's not much to put in this book
00:48:10,00:48:14,right now if there are no moose in new zealand are you kidding me though there's plenty in this
00:48:14,00:48:19,book and it's not his only book he's written a bunch of books he's written a wild moose chase
00:48:19,00:48:26,he's this guy is a legend of new zealand yeah i knew you'd like that chance um this is a man called
00:48:26,00:48:33,ken tustin and he has been in the national parks in new zealand in fiordland looking for moose
00:48:33,00:48:40,because there was moose back in the 1920s 30s when they were introduced and there's your clincher
00:48:40,00:48:46,there was moose so that it's not like oh he's going to look for theories and i hope there's some
00:48:46,00:48:53,there you know there there was moose put there that'll be dead bad now those ones it's 100 years ago
00:48:53,00:49:00,it's a little thing called mating oh is that yeah go down to the sea get your toes wet
00:49:00,00:49:03,come and meet me on a wet cliff mate
00:49:07,00:49:18,wow oh blindfold you is that someone blowing no it's not it's just the wind all right get your
00:49:18,00:49:31,idea out show us your twerks here we go and mating say this is okay so um i i got the uh the decade
00:49:31,00:49:37,slightly wrong this was in 1910 and what it was is that new zealanders basically in 1910 wanted
00:49:37,00:49:42,something to hunt and they had no natural land mammals of that size and so moose were introduced
00:49:42,00:49:47,basically to rectify that so initially the moose really adapted well to the surroundings
00:49:47,00:49:53,but then red deer were introduced into the area and that changed the whole food change so much
00:49:53,00:49:59,that by 1952 so there was a good you know 40 odd years that they were around the moose population
00:49:59,00:50:06,really dwindled and then basically by 1930 disappeared altogether but then in 1952 one was
00:50:06,00:50:11,called on camera so there's 20 there's a 20 odd year period where people thought they were extinct
00:50:11,00:50:18,and then suddenly boom here is a moose and that is why this guy says there may be more moose because
00:50:18,00:50:24,moose are really good at hiding yes they are no they're really they're really hard to see they're
00:50:24,00:50:32,huge i know big amla's i know i know but this is a huge national park you know it's really hard to
00:50:32,00:50:37,spot one um a moose could be standing in a in a field 100 yards away and you won't see it
00:50:37,00:50:44,wow they do get they get hit by cars a lot don't they moose like that is a big problem in canada
00:50:44,00:50:48,and is that because of their this invisibility that they can switch up and off well that must be right
00:50:48,00:50:54,yeah because they they've got this mystical ability they can stand still for a long time
00:50:54,00:50:59,and one of their i think one of their look if you can just take this seriously
00:50:59,00:51:07,one of their um you know like a a security measure uh defense mechanisms there you go there's the
00:51:07,00:51:13,terms i knew you'd get there uh is to you know like um quite a lot of animals use that with a
00:51:13,00:51:18,just freeze like the goat thinking and it's always yeah well no that's a different one that's you
00:51:18,00:51:23,know but that well kind of but that's there that's a gene anomaly yeah i'm just trying to think of
00:51:23,00:51:29,some other animals that do it do the old freeze um a few bugs in headlights they would rabbit headlights
00:51:29,00:51:34,mules mules do that definitely i think when they're they just freeze when they can't deal with
00:51:34,00:51:39,situation i think so yeah like a possum something they would kind of pretend to be dead no i think
00:51:39,00:51:45,all the examples you've given so far are incorrect okay but there are some bugs and things out there
00:51:45,00:51:51,that will just i think okay here's one the stick insect because i saw it yesterday okay and a frozen
00:51:51,00:51:57,stick insect so the thing is i used to have pet stick insects as a child and they never moved
00:51:57,00:52:02,ever it wasn't that as soon as they were in danger they stopped moving they just stayed
00:52:02,00:52:08,there's defense mechanism they were scared of me yeah absolutely so i've had one i had one on my
00:52:08,00:52:15,steering wheel the other day this is back in new zealand when i was in the in the rural property
00:52:15,00:52:21,and i went to grab my steering wheel to to to drive as you do and there's a there's a sticky
00:52:21,00:52:26,on there and i went oh come on mate because of my hands need to be there he was in the two position
00:52:26,00:52:32,because you know you go for 11 and two it's the worst place and i went i grabbed the 11 and i always
00:52:32,00:52:37,grabbed the left first grabbed the 11 going for the two oh there's a sticky there and i says to him
00:52:37,00:52:42,come on mate and i and he just honestly i see him looking at me i'm on the right hand side of him
00:52:42,00:52:48,no prob's there but he's not moving and i come in slowly i'm cut and i even told him coming in with
00:52:48,00:52:54,the hand buddy coming in because you're on my two position and nothing just absolutely frozen so in
00:52:54,00:53:02,the end i just picked him up and he made out like he was a stick the whole time i've come to think of
00:53:02,00:53:07,it it might have been a poor poor stupid stick insect because i see what you're saying now you're
00:53:07,00:53:12,saying animals that are camouflage to their environment freeze but he's not a steering
00:53:12,00:53:17,wheel insect so it would be good if you could know as an animal that the thing you're sitting on
00:53:17,00:53:23,yeah it's not like but you look nothing like it yeah i mean chameleons they're the other ones
00:53:23,00:53:28,that lizards in general will will freeze or or really dart away but lizards are the ones that will
00:53:28,00:53:34,will freeze as a mechanism so let's go back to what what what was your fact in what are we talking
00:53:34,00:53:40,about moose we were talking about mooses right that's right and so hey this is pretty cool we
00:53:40,00:53:46,wrote a book years ago risa where there was a new zealand professor called neil gemel who had
00:53:46,00:53:54,gone to loch nests and he had used a new form called e dna to try and sample the waters of
00:53:54,00:54:00,loch nests to see if the monster may exist and so e dna seems like quite an obvious thing that you
00:54:00,00:54:06,would use in order to try and find the moose because you could go there and if the moose had
00:54:06,00:54:10,been let's say around a little stream or a pond and if it had been sipping from it in the last
00:54:10,00:54:16,21 days neil would be able to use this device to then take extracts out and say ah there's moose
00:54:16,00:54:23,dna in there that means they're alive yeah so i actually dm'd him on twitter and i asked him you
00:54:23,00:54:28,know is this is this a thing would you be up for doing it and he said it's so weird i actually
00:54:28,00:54:35,met ken i met this guy who's been looking for moose yeah and he met him when he went back to
00:54:35,00:54:41,loch nests to deliver the results of his findings about the water that he took from loch nests
00:54:41,00:54:47,and ken happened to be there on holiday and they met at loch nests to then discuss looking for the
00:54:47,00:54:52,moose actually i might seem like it's a massive coincidence but where is ken gonna holiday it's
00:54:52,00:54:56,obviously gonna be loch nests isn't it where are these two nutters that you've happened to have
00:54:56,00:55:04,heard of gonna see each other how day so is he gonna do it well he he talks about it so he said
00:55:04,00:55:09,what did he say he said ken and i've kept in touch and the plan was to jump on board with him
00:55:09,00:55:13,next time he found some sign of moose but there's been little found in the past few years still
00:55:13,00:55:18,remains a possibility we've surveyed quite large sections of yordland and do reasonably
00:55:18,00:55:23,broad biodiversity surveys setting baselines and looking for various things endangered birds some
00:55:23,00:55:30,species that are presumed to be extinct and of course moose so far there is no evidence of those
00:55:30,00:55:38,however there's been a hugely exciting thing for ken that happened in 2020 which is that a kid
00:55:38,00:55:47,well i say kid he's a teenager and when i say teenager he's in his 20s and he was on a flight
00:55:47,00:55:51,he was a guy called ben young who was in a helicopter flying over fjordland doing some
00:55:51,00:55:57,surveying and he saw a moose he saw the moose now here's the thing here's the thing he's a
00:55:57,00:56:02,canadian who used to work with moose there you go he knows what a moose looks like we all know
00:56:02,00:56:10,what a moose looks like no but canadians really know he was really no he was specifically a former
00:56:10,00:56:16,moose hunting guide in canada i still go listen james he would really know reese you're the one
00:56:16,00:56:21,who just told us a canadian could be standing a hundred feet from a moose on in a plain meadow
00:56:21,00:56:32,and not see it so there you go yeah normally but this guy was a trained moose yeah looker
00:56:32,00:56:37,wasn't he he's a trained moose looker yeah yeah it's i have to say it's not it obviously is not
00:56:37,00:56:44,the maddest idea they were there like you say it is a big place and um sometimes these things
00:56:44,00:56:50,come to fruition so there's another really great kiwi animal uh animal in new zealand
00:56:50,00:56:54,the tarkahey which i think are pretty rare i doubt have you seen tarkahey i think they're
00:56:54,00:57:00,quite rare aren't they reese yes they're they're rare nice nice looking very nice looking birds
00:57:00,00:57:04,though what kind of birds yeah they're the largest bird in like the rail family so like
00:57:04,00:57:10,coots and mohens but much bigger very beautiful blue green feathers huge red beak that goes all
00:57:10,00:57:17,the way up over their foreheads they can't fly but anyway we thought the tarkahey was extinct
00:57:17,00:57:23,by about 1900 so i think the first sighting by europeans was 1849 obviously the europeans
00:57:23,00:57:28,captured it roasted it ate it they sort of went quite quickly extinct and then there's a guy called
00:57:28,00:57:34,jeffrey orbell who when he was a kid his mum just showed him a picture of one i think in a childhood
00:57:34,00:57:40,book and he got a hunch as a child i bet that's still out there and he spent his life kind of
00:57:40,00:57:45,reading up on them and he was he was a doctor i think he was a an eye doctor so he was a legit
00:57:45,00:57:50,had a job um he knew how eyes worked so he'd be perfect for looking for things he knows how they
00:57:50,00:57:59,really work he could he could really see yeah yeah so he took his expert eyes out on this 1948
00:57:59,00:58:06,expedition and he they went up this mountain and you know these things haven't been seen for 50 years
00:58:06,00:58:10,and they sat by a little bit of water and two of them just walked straight into their nets
00:58:10,00:58:14,these lovely little birds waddled in and we discovered and now they have them i think they're
00:58:14,00:58:22,only about 300 they're very unusual but yeah they're very endangered yeah uh but look there you go i mean
00:58:22,00:58:28,that's just one example of how animals and don't forget you know the more intelligent they are they
00:58:28,00:58:34,know we're around they know that they're endangered there's only a small group of them and they hide
00:58:34,00:58:41,and they worry and they at their their survival instinct is their main feature and so they are
00:58:41,00:58:45,doing whatever it can take because otherwise they could be caught they could be shot we only think
00:58:45,00:58:50,it from a human capacity of how how would we hide how would we stay alive but we're nowhere near as
00:58:50,00:58:56,good as animals in the natural environment of the forest at staying alive yeah you're right a moose
00:58:56,00:59:02,that's that's ingrained in its system isn't it get away um just back to the fjordlands very quickly
00:59:02,00:59:07,i just want to give a quick shout out to a legend of the world of ornithology um he was part of the
00:59:07,00:59:14,ornithological society of new zealand joined in 1957 a guy called ron jack nilson who very sadly
00:59:14,00:59:22,passed away october 26 2022 um he was a legend of his field and he spent much like ken many many
00:59:22,00:59:29,years looking for an elusive supposedly extinct species of bird which are called the south island
00:59:29,00:59:34,coca-coco have you heard of that reese the south island coca-coco um oh yeah we found those this year
00:59:34,00:59:40,in november wasn't it yeah it was the first of november last year yeah when did he die
00:59:40,00:59:54,october 26 oh no oh that is so close yeah but no seriously what what what how do you spell
00:59:54,01:00:03,the bird name ko with a line above the k b o sorry k a ko so coca-coco and it's a bird that hasn't
01:00:03,01:00:10,been seen for many many years um people occasionally have supposed sightings but no one has properly
01:00:10,01:00:15,confirmed it no one has a photo and if anyone in new zealand in that region is listening there is at
01:00:15,01:00:21,least there was when this paper was written a ten thousand dollar reward for any photographic proof
01:00:21,01:00:25,of the south island coca-coco there's quite a lot of quite a lot of money to be made isn't there if
01:00:25,01:00:31,you can find these things that don't exist oh it's not the easiest way probably to put in a decent
01:00:31,01:00:35,sell a reliable salary if you tell your partner you know i'm gonna quit my job because i've heard
01:00:35,01:00:41,lots of money to be made you're nagging me too much i'm gonna get my books and i'm gonna go and
01:00:41,01:00:54,find the coca-coco okay i'll see you dinner the age old story okay that is it that is all of our facts
01:00:54,01:00:58,thank you so much for listening if you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things
01:00:58,01:01:03,that we have said over the course of this podcast we can all be found on our twitter accounts i'm on
01:01:03,01:01:12,at shriverland james at james harkin reese please don't contact me uh i think i did this last time
