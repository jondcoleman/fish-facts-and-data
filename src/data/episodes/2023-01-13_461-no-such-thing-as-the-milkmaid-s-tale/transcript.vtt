00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.300
 Before we get going, I just want to let you know that we have a very exciting guest on

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.060
 this week, Andy unfortunately was away and is actually furious he was away because he

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.860
 missed out on the absolute tornado of comedy that is Reese Darby.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.300
 You probably know Reese for his roles as Murray the manager on Flight of the Concords or as

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.540
 Nigel Billingsley from the Jumanji movies or perhaps you listen to his absolutely brilliant

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.380
 podcast about the mysteries of the universe called the cryptid factor which he hosts with

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.420
 his buddies Buttons and a doofus called Dan.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.220
 But what you may not have seen if you live in the UK is Reese playing his greatest role

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.020
 yet, Steed Bonnet, Gentleman Pirate in the sitcom Our Flag Means Death.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.860
 This is such a great series, it came out last year on HBO Max but it's only just come to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.340
 the UK on BBC2 and it's all about the real life story of Steed Bonnet who decided to give

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.220
 up his entire life and become a Gentleman Pirate of the Seas.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.380
 He befriends Blackbeard who's played by the absolute genius comedy director Tycho Waititi

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.380
 and you can watch it now in the UK on BBC2 every Wednesday at 10pm or if you're impatient

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.380
 like me just head straight to BBC iPlayer and you can watch the entire series in one bingy

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.380
 go.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.420
 Anyway, it was so great having Reese back on the show you can find the previous episode

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.580
 in the Fish Archives if you want to hear his first time here with us and he wasn't on

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.340
 that show either poor guy can't get a break but we hope you enjoy it and then make sure

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:51.180
 to watch Our Flag Means Death immediately afterwards.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.340
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.960
 week coming to you from four mysterious locations around the globe.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.820
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and joining

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.660
 us once again it is the return of our very special guest Reese Darby and once again we

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.420
 have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.620
 days and in no particular order here we go.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.820
 Starting with fact number one and that is Reese.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.420
 My fact is that pirate Steed Bonnet invented the idea of walking the plank.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:38.100
 That's a pretty big invention, I would say in the world of pirating.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.700
 I don't use it in my day to day life, it's pretty niche isn't it?

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.700
 It's putting together two things that already exist, walking and planks, it doesn't come

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.100
 up with anything new there, has he?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.380
 I know but if you're even a child and you dress up as a pirate one of the first things

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.820
 you learn in your entire life is that they walk the plank, I mean he is, what a legacy.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.820
 That's right.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.100
 Is it true though?

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.440
 Let's put it this way, it's more of a myth really that he came up with it.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.660
 That's fine, that's what we deal in.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.380
 It's a Dan fact you know, you know the show.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:20.340
 So well he might have done, some people say that he did, I actually believe he did because

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.700
 even though it's out there as a myth, I believe knowing Steed as I do, playing the role of

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.860
 Steed for two seasons now, that he would have come up with it in reality because the whole

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.500
 idea behind walking the plank is they blindfold the person and they make them walk it and

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.660
 so then they get away with not being accused of murder because that person has killed themselves.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.740
 The captain has said, alright walk along that plank will you, all the best and the guy's

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.380
 like, hey what's happening, hey walk along here, you can imagine it as I'm describing

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.380
 it here.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:10.260
 I've got to blindfold on, where's this plank going you know and then that's the shark.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.420
 So he wouldn't want to stab someone or shoot someone, no he wants to do it, he wants to

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.420
 be slightly away from the action right and say, you did it yourself.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.140
 Absolutely very uncomfortable with the idea of killing someone.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.060
 Why are you hitting yourself, why are you punching yourself, why are you letting yourself

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.460
 get eaten by sharks.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.460
 Exactly that's it.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.740
 Is that getting you into heaven?

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.980
 I was uncomfortable with killing people so I just let them kill themselves.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.660
 He's still, he's walking a fine line isn't he already.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.180
 He's walking a fine plank for sure but I think that's the point, it's a moral issue and so

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.100
 he can think to himself, oh I didn't kill him, he killed himself, he walked off that

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.500
 plank that I designed and it's quite a ingenious idea really to think that especially back

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.900
 in those days you could make someone kill themselves without you having to actually

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.660
 get your hands dirty.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.580
 Which was we should say like the golden age of piracy, 1718 was it, he died?

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.580
 Yes.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.580
 I think.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.140
 So 1700, 17 to 1730 was the golden age, he was right in the middle of it.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.020
 Wasn't he very short lived really as a pirate, for a pirate who is quite famous, it was quite

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.220
 a brief career wasn't it?

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.220
 Two years.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.140
 I live with the man, I think it was like a year and a half.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.060
 I think we should just quickly praisey this guy in his entirety, this was someone who was

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.620
 a really well to do character, he was living very rich, he had a wife, he had some kids

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.700
 and then he just decided as part of ultimately what was I guess a midlife crisis or he was

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.540
 dealing with trauma of a quite difficult childhood, just left his family, bought a ship and just

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.220
 said I'm now a pirate, got a crew, named the ship The Revenge and just started sailing

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.740
 and he paid his staff, you know he paid the pirates, he was as you say a gentleman pirate

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.500
 with zero abilities.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.740
 Didn't he not tell the pirates that they were going to be pirates?

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.620
 I read somewhere that he kind of brought them on, he got all of these guys to be his staff

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.140
 and then only when they were at sea he said oh by the way you're pirates, this isn't just

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.820
 a fun cruise, this is a.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.100
 That sounds like him as well, knowing him being in his shoes, absolutely yeah, he definitely,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.260
 he bought the ship, it was already called The Revenge I believe and he liked the name

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.960
 of it and it was actually quite a common name for ships back then and then yeah he installed,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.580
 this is the really fun stuff, he installed a library on the boat so he built a library

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:36.060
 because he loved his books, he wanted to leave home and leave his wife and life but he didn't

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.660
 want to leave his books, something you might do Dan, so he brought his entire collection

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.460
 of his books and put them on the ship.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.900
 I reckon Dan, I reckon you would go being a pirate with your books of course but also

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.740
 probably your Ben Elton collection.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.980
 Absolutely, well you're signed, everything signed you've got in your house would come

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.980
 with you.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:01.060
 You'd need memorabilia to sort of wow blackbeard with you know, no actually Ben Elton did

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.820
 I think actually hold this particular bit of tissue, really, wow, I was actually going

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.820
 to say it was pretty hard on his wife with the book stealing, not only is she lost her

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.380
 husband but he's nicked all the bloody books but actually in your case Dan it would be

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.620
 quite a relief probably for Fenella, yeah it'd be like the ultimate Marie Kundo or whatever

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:26.220
 that book was called, it's like yeah, you know, step four, make your husband a pirate,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.540
 lose all.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.540
 Thank God.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.180
 Yeah and so in the series as well there's the relationship, the fact that he in real

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.260
 life meets blackbeard, the most famous of all the pirates and what's crazy as well is

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.820
 I assume blackbeard must have existed for a long time but he had a two-year run as well,

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.460
 that was it, blackbeard's pirating years were two years.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.460
 It's amazing.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.260
 It was pretty fast and loose as a pirate, didn't you, it probably wasn't the safest

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.540
 line of work to go into for being honest.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.540
 No.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:00.060
 They were like the Liz Truss of pirates, weren't they, those guys, that's the most fluttering

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:05.660
 comparison Liz Truss has ever got but yeah, blackbeard and him had quite a weird relationship

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:12.580
 but it's kind of the relationship to a needy loser and the real cool guy of the open seas

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.540
 because Steve wasn't that good at pirating especially at first, was he?

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.540
 No.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.540
 You know there's the reality through the knowledge we have from various accounts and

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:26.340
 history and then there's obviously the fictional version which my show is so without getting

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.820
 too confused about which is real and which isn't because the real reports are sketchy

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:37.220
 at best as well but when you look at it, it kind of makes sense that something happened

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:42.140
 between the two of them, even if it was just a friendship, blackbeard was fascinated by

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.480
 this guy because he looked glorious in his outfits, he had these little winker picker

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:53.220
 shoes and glorious coats and various things like that, he was a fancy man and blackbeard

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.300
 must have gone what the hell are you doing in this job because you know they were all

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.620
 desperate, they didn't want to become pirates, that was like the only life they had to go

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:06.540
 into because of their circumstance and so here's this guy who's like I want to be part

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.340
 of this too and he's absolutely not supposed to be there and he was wounded and I think

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.020
 instead of just letting him like killing him or getting rid of him, I think there was a

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:20.260
 massive fascination, I think maybe if you look at blackbeard wanting to see the other

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.740
 side of how the other side lives, like probably a lot of people did back in those days, you're

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:30.460
 either ridiculously poor and haven't got anything going on or you're the aristocracy and never

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.700
 the twain shall meet and so when they do, I think that's when you've got this really

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:39.300
 interesting like oh how can I become you or how can I learn from you or how can I steal

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.660
 your ideas to make me better.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:49.540
 So you was like the Louis Theroux of the pirating world, spending a few weeks observing, getting

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.540
 all the accessories.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.540
 Yeah, exactly.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.780
 Perhaps because he could have just killed him, he could have just got rid of him and

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:59.540
 this guy back in history was not, he's not as portrayed as capable as I am in the show,

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.540
 you know.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.540
 And that's saying something.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.660
 But I reckon this is a really interesting way of doing history right because we don't

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.140
 have much information about Steve Bonnet, we have little bits here and there, but Rhys,

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.740
 you've lived as him for two years in the show pretty much and I reckon you've got a really

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.100
 good insight into what he might have been thinking and what he might have done and stuff.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.100
 Yeah.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.100
 Why the hell he did it?

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.100
 That's always the great mystery, isn't it?

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.300
 It's always portrayed as this huge midlife crisis, which makes sense, it's the fantasy

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.820
 that every eight-year-old has that we grow out of by the time we're twelve.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.820
 That's not midlife, is it?

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.820
 Eight years old?

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.320
 It's like when you have a midlife crisis, you revert back to those tragic fantasies

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.760
 you had as a child that are unrealistic and it was portrayed in, you know, the famous

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.140
 book of pirates, which is where we get basically all of our pirate knowledge by a mysterious

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.740
 person called Captain Charles Johnson, who was written a few years later.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:56.340
 And his portrayal, which is often what is repeated, is that he was trying to bear the

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.300
 awful situation of having a nagging wife, but yeah, Rhys, you've been him, why did he

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.300
 do it?

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.900
 I really hope that you, James and Anna, are subtly trying to get Rhys to sort of channel

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.260
 Steve and he comes through now and Rhys is no longer here.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.300
 We're getting this dandy.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.300
 Steve is just on the show.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.680
 Look, I definitely think there was a midlife crisis situation going on if you look back

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:26.480
 at the accounts, but also he had this life that he didn't necessarily want.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.220
 He was born into aristocracy and at that time piracy had just kicked in and it was this

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:37.260
 ridiculous, adventurous, out at sea life that was pretty much the opposite of what

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.260
 he's doing.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.580
 And he's never even been to sea, by the way, this guy.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.540
 So he's imagining, oh, wow, what would that be like?

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.980
 And of course, anyone who's really intensely into their book reading has a great imagination.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.860
 And I think he just one day went, look, I've actually got the means to, to change this.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.860
 And he probably had one massive fight with the wife that he obviously wasn't really getting

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.980
 on with and went, right, that's it.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:57.980
 I'm out.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.980
 I'm out.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.740
 And in the middle of the night, you know, he, he sorted this out and just took off on

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.740
 a whim.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:09.060
 And I think that, you know, he probably thought that he had the means to, to get away with

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.980
 it because he was a chiefly person.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.860
 He was someone who was sort of high up there.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.460
 And so he probably didn't even imagine he was going to get into trouble.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.100
 It certainly seemed like he didn't.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.180
 It's confidence, blind confidence.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:28.100
 I once walked a plank in a virtual reality video game and this is why I was thinking

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.440
 about how these guys were blindfolded.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.980
 So we weren't blindfolded when we did this, but you're walking the plank on the top of

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.500
 a massive building.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.860
 And then the idea is you got to the end and then you jumped off and then you were in virtual

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.500
 reality and you thought you were dying.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.100
 And then you kept falling, falling, falling, and then you hit the floor and you absolutely

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.820
 shit yourself because you thought you were dead, but actually you're in virtual reality.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.220
 But what I thought was it was more scary because I could see what was happening, whereas these

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.020
 guys were blindfolded.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.460
 So it's the idea that they wouldn't know when they're getting to the end of the plank.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.560
 They'll just keep walking and that's it.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560
 Yes.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.920
 Well, let's have a chat about that.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:10.080
 I mean, I think why do they need to be blindfolded for a start?

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.920
 Because they know they're out at sea.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.920
 They're on a boat.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920
 All right.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920
 Step up.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.920
 Step up onto the edge here.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920
 Oh, this is...

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.920
 Well, I can feel that this is the edge of the boat.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.920
 No, no, no.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920
 It's not.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.920
 No.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.920
 You're going into one of the rooms.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.920
 We're going to have a little party.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.920
 No, no.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.920
 I can feel the wind in my face here.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:25.920
 No, no, no.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.920
 It's fine.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.920
 Walk.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.920
 Just keep walking.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.920
 All right.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.920
 Yes.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.920
 Yes.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.920
 Oh, well, this is going out into the sea, isn't it?

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.920
 No, no.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.920
 No, this is a little...

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920
 It's actually a bridge towards the bar.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.920
 I've got a cocktail here waiting for you, Larry.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.920
 Okay.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.920
 Okay.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920
 It was very windy.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920
 Yes.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.920
 Well, we're all blowing.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920
 Blow.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920
 Oh, that doesn't...

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920
 It feels...

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.920
 It feels like normal wind.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.920
 Not you.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920
 You know what?

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.920
 Your wind's like Larry.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.920
 Ah, cheeky bugger.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.480
 Just keep walking down there, mate.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.480
 And I know I've really got into that, but, you know, I think...

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.120
 I've forgotten what we were asking.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.760
 But I actually think that's true because it means you couldn't have, like, surprise parties

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.920
 on a boat, could you?

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.440
 Because every time you put a blindfold on and you're walked into a room and they say

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.440
 it's a party...

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.440
 Yeah.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.560
 I think that's a good point we've got to.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.360
 In history, there's been no surprise parties on pirate ships for that reason.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.360
 Happy birthday!

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.360
 Whoa!

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.560
 It's starting to real quick.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:30.560
 It actually doesn't make any sense that they would be able to walk a plank while out in

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.360
 the rough seas blindfolded and shaking with nerves.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.360
 Oh, yes.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.360
 I mean, you fall off.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.360
 You don't get to the end of that plank, do you?

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.360
 No.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.360
 Such a good point.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.360
 You're falling off straight away.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.400
 Also, is this where we got the diving board from?

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400
 Yeah.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400
 Ah, yes.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.400
 I was just thinking...

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.600
 Imagine the cockiness of someone that you've sentenced to death who walks blindfolded to

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.600
 the end of the plank, jumps off and does a triple backwards up a salt.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.600
 That's amazing.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.600
 That's a legend.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600
 What a death!

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.600
 What a death!

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600
 Yeah.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:08.560
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.440
 Okay, my fact this week is that goats like it when you smile at them, but only if you

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.120
 approach them from the right-hand side.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.920
 How can that possibly be true?

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.920
 Why can it be true?

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:26.520
 The findings of a study in 2018 at the Buttercup Sanctuary for Goats in Kent and what they

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:33.080
 did was they put photos of humans, men and women, black and white, and they put one on

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.720
 the left and one on the right, and one of them was smiling and one of them wasn't, and

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.360
 the goats always went to the smiling one, but only when it was on the right-hand side.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.160
 When it was on the left-hand side, they couldn't give a shit.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.600
 They would just randomly go to one or the other, but when it was on the right-hand side,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.600
 they always went to it, and two things here, one, not many animals care whether humans

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.600
 are smiling or not.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.600
 We know that dogs do.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.240
 We know that horses do.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.720
 That's because they're domesticated animals, and this is one of the first other animals

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.040
 that we found that actually cares if humans smile, and the other thing is that perhaps

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.440
 why are they only bothered about the right-hand side?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.160
 Well, it could be the way that their brain processes things.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:18.400
 So maybe they're processing emotions on one side of the brain or visual things on one

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.400
 side of the brain.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.400
 We're not really sure.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.960
 Why do they use black and white photo?

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.160
 Can you not fork out in the budget for a colour photography?

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.480
 Do they see colour?

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.480
 Do they see colour?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.480
 That's a great question.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.480
 That's a great question.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:36.360
 You know goats almost as well as, you know, Steve Bonnet, do you think they see colour?

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.560
 I would like to think they do, especially my ones.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:45.640
 When I turn up to feed them, I always come in from the left, and they're smiling.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:51.120
 I'm smiling, but they can't.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.760
 You always make sure to smile?

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.760
 That's part of it.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.320
 I'm just remenining that I must be smiling because I'm happy to see that.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.160
 I don't see them a hell of a lot because they're in New Zealand, but I spend time with them

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.560
 when I'm there, of course.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.720
 They are emotionally intelligent.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:13.720
 I hadn't realised that they were to this extent, so they did a study where researchers

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:18.240
 recorded goats making certain noises, noises when they were happy and noises when they

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.240
 were sad.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.160
 So this did involve the researchers making the goats happy and sad, so they'd make them

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.480
 happy by sort of giving them food, and then they'd make them sad, and this is sort of

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.400
 like really minimal level of sadness.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.920
 They'd isolate them from their herd for five minutes, or they'd get a goat to watch another

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.880
 goat eat when that goat didn't have much food.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.360
 But I know goats, and that is very sad for them.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360
 That's tragic.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.120
 The two things they really care about are being together and eating.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.120
 Oh, really?

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.120
 That's it.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.120
 Oh, yeah, that's it.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.640
 And to have fun, they climb, so they love to get on top of things, and they love running

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.440
 around, but they much prefer to be doing all that sort of stuff to see it.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.440
 Right.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.000
 OK, well, maybe this was like torture for them, perhaps.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 It would have been.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.880
 And also, Anna, I've been in a restaurant with you when one of us has got our food,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.640
 and yours hasn't quite arrived yet.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.640
 The look on your face.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.840
 I make some pretty weird noises.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.840
 I can't deny that.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.080
 OK, I make some weird goat-like, bleating sounds.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.600
 Anyway, the noises that goats make are pretty much indistinguishable to us when they're

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.960
 happy and sad in those situations, except probably reason for your own goats you pick

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.960
 up on it.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.280
 But if you play those sounds to their fellow goats, just audio recordings, their heart

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.320
 rates will stay normal, and they'll be all chilled out when they hear the happy sounds.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.400
 But when they hear the almost identical sounding, anxious sounds, then their heart rates kind

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.440
 of shoot up, so they're feeling this empathy on behalf of this other goat.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440
 Wow.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.320
 Rhys, have you ever, this is a leaning into a myth here, but I'd just be curious, have

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.960
 you ever dipped your feet into salt water and then let goats lick your feet?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.960
 No.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.960
 No?

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.960
 OK.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.440
 I've already, but I have taken the goats for a walk down on the beach and been through

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.440
 salt water.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.360
 Yeah, so, OK, next time you're back in New Zealand, give it a go, because I'd be curious

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.400
 to hear whether or not this hurts.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.600
 This was a sort of myth that's been in books for a long time, and possibly it was tried

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.200
 once or twice, who knows, where the ancient Romans were said to have used a thing called

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.600
 tickle torture, and the idea was that you would get someone, you would soak their feet

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.560
 in salt water, and then the salt would then be licked by a thirsty ghost.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.560
 Ghost?

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.560
 Ghost.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.640
 I took a turn.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.440
 Oh my God.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.840
 I love salt, don't I?

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:43.540
 Oh, no, I just checked my notes down and all this is actually about ghosts.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.720
 All this stuff I've been saying about goats.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.000
 It's ghosts like it if you smile at them.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.440
 Always approach a ghost from the right-hand side, yeah.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.440
 Now it's making sense.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:20:00.120
 So, apparently, if a goat licks your feet, because they have really rough tongues, that

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.040
 the torture, and because they're so thirsty and the salt makes them thirstier, they keep

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.600
 licking, and then they rip your feet off, and that would be a method of torture back

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.600
 in the...

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.600
 Rip your feet off.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.600
 Their tongues aren't made of teeth, are they?

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.600
 No, sorry.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.040
 They would slowly, like a lollipop, lick their way through your feet.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:25.120
 Yeah, I tend to not let their mouths too close to my body bits, because they have teeth and

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:31.560
 everything, you know, and they're always wanting to nibble, and so they nibble on my clothes,

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:39.320
 they pull my garments, and I certainly can't see myself getting my naked feet out and dangling

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.040
 them in front of their faces with salt.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.040
 Do they then...

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.040
 Another question about your goats.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.760
 I mean, do they urinate on themselves and each other, or themselves?

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.160
 So first of all, they'll wheel over themselves to attract a female, and it looks kind of

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.160
 cool.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.840
 Billy Goats shove their heads right between their legs, because they want to wee in their

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:03.160
 bids, because I guess that gathers up the smell better, and they wheel over them, and

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:10.920
 then they will go to the lady who can tell that he's up for a shag, but then he tests

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.920
 her urine as well to make sure that she's eligible, to make sure that she's actually

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:21.800
 on heat, and so she will squat down, and he'll put his head between her legs, and then she'll

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:27.640
 wheel over him, and then they curl up the lips, the flame and response, which is where if

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.760
 you see a goat expose its lip, like curl up its top lip, it's got all these receptors

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.760
 in it.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.360
 Yeah, James is doing it right now, it's very attractive look actually, it's got receptors

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.280
 in it that pick up whether the urine has the right hormones in it that says this woman is

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:49.960
 ready to be fertilised by you, and so it's very wee based courting process, sexy stuff.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.160
 I know nothing of that, because I only have boy goats.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.400
 Oh really?

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:00.800
 Yeah, well when you have both, you know, you're intimating, and if you've got females, then

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.920
 you're into milking, so I've only got male castoffs, which you know, the boy goats are

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.840
 only good for either meat or pets.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.320
 Yeah, oh wow, so they're never aroused your goats, they never need to move themselves.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.000
 They're never aroused, and I've never even seen them wee.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 Oh they must?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.760
 No, never, never seen them wee, mind you, mine are pedigree, so I don't think they do.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.120
 Yeah good point, I've heard that about certain breeds, they just explode with urine at their

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.120
 death, don't they?

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:36.440
 Well sometimes I see them hiding, and I come to the pen and I think, oh what's going on,

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:42.600
 you having a wee are you, and then I can hear, don't come in here, I'm in here, and that

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.080
 kind of thing, and so I wonder, there's probably something happening there, and then they just

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.360
 come through, oh hello dad, what's going on today?

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.120
 Do they call you dad?

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.680
 Yeah they call me dad.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.600
 I didn't see you coming dad, you came on the left hand side, did you?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.120
 Yeah yeah sorry, I was going to check on you guys, so you want to go for another walk down

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.120
 to the beach?

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.160
 Oh no, I'm fine, Alexander's just behind the pen there, don't go around there, he's

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.640
 just doing something, don't worry about him.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:14.920
 Are you sure you've got goats, not a sort of pantomime act as it goes across trees?

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.960
 But here's an interesting thing about goats, so you said like pedigree goats, you can get

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.840
 them, you can get really good goats, especially for milking and stuff, and in order to get

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.280
 those you might need a stud, so you might need a really good male goat who's going to

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.200
 have sex with lots of females, but the thing is that they can only have so many, they can

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.360
 only have sex so many times, right, there's only so many hours in the day that you can

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:44.680
 do that, and so recently they've come up with a new way of, basically what they do is they

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:51.200
 put some genes into a goat which changes its testicles, so they're effectively the testicles

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:57.600
 of another goat, and so this goat which isn't the normal stud can have sex with a female

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:03.040
 and the offspring will be the offspring of the original stud, even though the stud's

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.040
 just at home having a coffee.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.040
 Oh my god, really?

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.040
 Really?

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.280
 It's like the Handmaid's Tale kind of, where you think you're shagging one person but you're

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.800
 actually shagging the more fertile person, it's like it's actually a less dark version

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.520
 of the Handmaid's Tale without the feminist dystopian undertones.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.520
 The Milkmaid's Tale.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.520
 Exactly.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:29.160
 I wonder if that's quite demoralising though for the goat who the person said your testes

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.760
 aren't good enough, we're just going to shove these other blokes on you, who you've always

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.360
 been intimidated by anyway.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.560
 I don't think they even know they're goats.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.560
 They're probably dreams.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.560
 Goats?

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.560
 Of course they know they're goats.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.560
 Yeah.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.560
 Very good.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.960
 Because I've tried to take them out, you know, we've gone into town and my guys have

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.640
 got, no, no, we can't, we're goats, we can't go in there, we're not going to, we won't

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.120
 be allowed in there, Dad.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.640
 Can I, can I, can you take the blindfold off me?

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.920
 No, just, just, you'll be fine, Alexander, we're just, we're going into town.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:07.320
 I can sense there's someone coming up to me on the left hand side, I can sense it.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.320
 He's asking me for ID, Dad, what do I do?

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:15.480
 Dad, I don't have any ID, I'm a goat, I told him I was, I'm a goat.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.000
 Look, I'm sorry, he doesn't know he's a goat, if you could just let him, I do know I'm a

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.160
 goat, Dad, I told you, and get the blindfold off me.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:31.280
 I saw a photo earlier today of it was a tree which looked like it was growing goats.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.040
 There was like an apple tree, there was like 30 goats.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040
 They love climbing trees.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.040
 But they were just all sitting in this tree and I didn't think they had the dexterity

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.040
 to do it.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.360
 I don't know, yeah, they're big on, yeah.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.000
 They do like climbing trees and they like climbing, but often if you see those photos,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.360
 some places will fake it, just fake it for tourists basically, they'll kind of tie the

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.800
 goats into trees and then say, look, all these goats have climbed this tree and they're

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.560
 all free will, because at the end of the day, they need the tourists to come and take the

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.560
 photos, but the goats aren't going to do what they want.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.320
 Sometimes they'll climb and sometimes they won't, so they, yeah, they kind of fake it

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320
 sometimes.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.160
 That's the shocking reality of tourism in some of these places.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.480
 I'm afraid so.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.720
 The other thing is, there's a theory that goats used to be birds and that's why they're

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.680
 in the trees a lot, because they are reverting back to their previous life.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.560
 Is there scientific papers written supporting this theory or is this just some bloke in

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.560
 your local pub?

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.360
 No, I'm just, I'm pulling it up now.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.360
 Okay.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.360
 Here it is.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.360
 Scientific theories.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.360
 Goats.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.360
 Yeah, goats used to be birds.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.360
 There it is.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.360
 Involved letters.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.360
 Absolutely incredible.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.360
 Well, that's two pages and it's signed at the bottom there.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.360
 Two pages.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.360
 That's your evidence.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360
 They believe they're flying.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:58.960
 That's the closest thing they can get to going back to their old life as a bird by flying.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.920
 And then they'll end up in the trees and you'll, you'll often hear them twerking.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.920
 Twerking.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.920
 No, twerping.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.400
 You should see them twerk.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.280
 He's amazing.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.360
 What's the actual word that birds make?

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:41.800
 facts, which isn't as amazing as that but is true, is that we've never talked about myotonic

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:49.360
 goats and I think they always deserve a mention. The myotonic fainting goats. They're a breed

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:55.320
 in Tennessee that basically have an anomaly in their genes where when they panic, if they're

00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:00.880
 approached from the left for instance or not smiling or there's a loud noise, something

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.040
 like that, then they try to escape. But what this does is contracts their muscles so they

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:10.360
 stiffen up completely and then just kind of fall over onto their side and it's quite comical

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.240
 to see if you've never seen it. It's bizarre. I've seen videos of that. Yeah. It's very

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.520
 interesting. Do we know why it happens Anna? Because it feels like it would die out quite

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:25.280
 quickly. Well I think it was only dyed in as it were quite recently through breeding

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.160
 so I don't think it would have any evolutionary purpose and you're right, in the wild they

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.280
 probably wouldn't survive very long but they are now bred from the same batch that have

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:39.760
 passed this. I think Steve Bonnet suffered from that same gene anomaly just sort of

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:45.320
 stiffening up and fainting at the site of any sort of doubt. Oh yeah. Yeah. And he overcame

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:50.960
 it. Did he? Well how did he overcome it? Well you know just really sort of you know getting

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.080
 with a really tough pirate and learning how to proper be a pirate. You know I think goats

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:03.320
 if you put those little feinty ones in with you know some real hardcore proper rustic goats

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:08.800
 that probably learn the ways and would become more goaty. Yeah. Less feinty. Billy Goat Blackbeard

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.840
 takes them under their wing. Yeah that's right. What you can also do is you can deprive them

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.600
 of water which bizarrely cures this problem. There are other problems if you don't get

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.520
 the water out now. So it's a very fine balance to strike but they're kind of useful now because

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:28.040
 myotonia is also a thing in humans like sudden muscle seizures. Some people have that. The

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:33.400
 jumping Frenchmen of Maine are they called or something like that. I remember. Really?

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.520
 I didn't know. I don't know about them are they a group of myotonia. There was a group

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.440
 of French immigrants in Maine I think and they had this kind of thing where as soon

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.200
 as you shocked them they were just feinted. Oh really? Wow. Wow. Yeah. How long are they

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.080
 stiff for? How long do they like does it just slowly wear off? Yeah I think so. It's the

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.240
 goats. They just kind of wake up don't they the goats. It's like a feint. Yeah. Yeah I've

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.480
 seen the videos. It's bizarre. I've seen the videos. It's bizarre. I imagine if people

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:07.120
 did do that and it's a very bizarre trait isn't it? Yeah it would make the start of

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:12.320
 the 100 meters not much good would it? As soon as the bang goes off everyone just fainted.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:17.440
 It would be a race to see who came round the quickest. Yeah. That's why the Goat Olympics

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.160
 have never taken off. Yeah we call the best in the world the goats. What's going on?

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:33.640
 Yeah. Okay it is time for fact number three and that is Anna. My fact this week is that

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:38.960
 Tin Tin's hair originally lay flat on his head until it got blown upwards in an early

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:47.920
 comic strip and it never came back down. Wow. And that's why he's got that famous stupid

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:55.120
 quiff. Stupid, brilliant quiff. How dare you. Yeah. What are you talking about? Your stupid.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:02.000
 Okay. Actually Reese is sporting it's sort of half Tin Tinian quiff at the moment so

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.040
 should be careful. But yeah and it doesn't it was not mentioned anywhere in the comic.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.400
 It's just the very first Tin Tin comic that was released. This is in January 1929 and

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:19.600
 it was a tantin au pied de soviete. Tin Tin in the land of the Soviets and about sort

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:25.360
 of 10 pages in in the version I was reading. He drops out of a tree, much like a goat and

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:31.440
 falls into a convertible car sitting underneath it deliberately and drives the car away and

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.920
 in the next plate you see his hair pushed up and then you follow the story through and

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.920
 it just never drops again. So weird. Did they do it on purpose? Was this a subconscious thing?

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.480
 We'll never know. We'll never know. Well I actually have the book here of course because

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:54.160
 oh wow you do. Big Tin Tin fan and and I looked at this and yeah you're right we can we can

00:31:54.160 --> 00:32:08.160
 have a look here. I think it's as you say around page 10. Yes. Yeah this is an audio format.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.800
 Yeah you've you've all got imaginations at home. We want you to imagine Tin Tin climbing up a tree.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:20.880
 So climbing up a tree. See his his quiff hair is forward. Uh-huh. Yep. Okay he climbs up the tree

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:27.920
 and then there he is for those at home that are listening to this. You guys can hear him here

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:33.840
 jumping. Now he's in the car and it's flipped to the back and it's because of the wind of the car

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:39.680
 and you can all hear that in that panel there. Yeah. But that's that's that's pretty amazing that

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.480
 it happens midway through a comic. It's not like the start of a new comic. It's like it's like

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.360
 Herge the the creator and the illustrator of Tin Tin did that in one panel and went oh that looks

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.440
 good. I think so. Well I'll just leave that. That's what I think happened. Yeah yeah. And do you know

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:58.880
 what's amazing about what you just showed us? There's a little something in that comic which is

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:06.480
 what absolutely exploded Tin Tin into the masses of Europe and it and it was a very specific thing

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.720
 that you might not have noticed as we were all just looking at these cartoons. Well did you notice

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:18.640
 at home anyone? Write in if you spotted the moment. The four of us is what I'm talking about and

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:24.400
 what it was is that this is 1929. This is the same year that Popeye was invented by the way.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:29.760
 And so this is and you know it's years before Superman and Batman. This is really old school

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:36.480
 comic books. What they have in these drawings are speech bubbles and Europe did not have

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:41.760
 speech bubbles at this point in their comics. They were over in America but they were a completely

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:46.800
 new idea to certainly Belgium and let's say surrounding countries. I don't know about the

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:55.200
 UK specifically. Luxembourg. Possibly Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The Netherlands. Let's go there.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:01.360
 Yeah and I read a great biography or rather I read a few pages from a great biography by Harry

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:06.880
 Thompson about Tin Tin saying that basically his words in these speech bubbles were treated as if

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:11.920
 they were carved on tablets of stone. They became quotes and they became something you would remember

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:18.720
 as a result of these speech bubbles and that is why Tin Tin exploded. So sorry. Are we claiming,

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.480
 I would say at the moment for me the invention of the speech bubble is up there with the invention

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:27.360
 of the concept of walking a plank. I don't know if it's getting kind of... He didn't invent it.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:32.320
 Einstein. Exactly. He didn't even invent it and it's not... No. It didn't independently appear,

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.640
 did it? It wasn't like oh wow how weird they've got these in America. Presumably they just read

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.200
 a comic in America and thought well let's start doing that. Is that right? No but do you remember

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:46.640
 when OK Go did their first video on Treadmills and you barely even heard the music? You were so

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.600
 busy watching this innovative video. That's what it was. Could tell you what the song is.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:58.400
 Exactly. Oh the Treadmill song. The Treadmill song exactly. What a relatable for future generations.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:05.520
 Well you know in like 300 years everyone will be talking about you know how we all do those

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:11.520
 Treadmill dances now. Yeah. You know how everyone does them. Well guess who did them first? Yeah.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:17.760
 It was exactly. Yeah. That book by the way, the Tintin in the Soviet countries or whatever it is,

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.400
 I have that as well but if you go to the Tintin shop in London they'll only sell it to you under

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:29.840
 the counter. No. Yeah so I went to, it was my tin anniversary and I thought I'd buy my wife some

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:35.680
 tin tin stuff and she's Russian so I thought I'd buy the Soviet Tintin book and I went

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.800
 and it wasn't anywhere and I didn't really know enough about Tintin that I knew it existed but

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.600
 I assumed that it was maybe really rare and I said oh do you have this book and they went yeah well

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.800
 we keep it under here now and since the Russian invasion of Ukraine they don't put it on display

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.960
 anymore in that shop. That's so weird. That's incredible. So you feel like you were buying

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:04.400
 comic book porn? Is it quite exciting? They gave me an unmarked paper bag. Yeah.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:10.960
 Do you know what's crazy? So 1929 is when Tintin debuts. By 1930 the comic is so massive that

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:18.160
 Herge was invited to meet the Empress who was the ex-Empress I guess Zeta of Austria-Hungary

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:25.120
 at the time and when he arrived he arrived by train and there was just huge crowds of people there

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:30.720
 to meet not Herge specifically but Tintin because they hired an actor to be Tintin

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:36.880
 who was an unknown kid who didn't have the right color hair and he was mobbed and not only did he

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:42.960
 not have the right color hair he also couldn't quite keep the quiff up so Herge had to keep this

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:50.240
 little like little tin of oily grease hair grease. I thought you were gonna go something about Mary

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:58.240
 about it there Dan for a second. Oh Jesus. Tintin had to ejaculate every 30 minutes.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:03.040
 Like those poor goats? Like the goats. He had to have someone else's testicles implanted into him.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:10.880
 Exactly. Yeah. Blistering particles Tintin. But yeah so they came off this train and Tintin the

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.760
 kid was mobbed and he was he was ripped away and Herge had to go and chase him and bring him back

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:22.160
 but it was like one direction. Yeah right. If you remember them. Poor guy. Yeah. Yeah it was and in

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:29.200
 fact you said you gave a famous Tintin quote there James blistering barnacles. Blistering barnacles.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:35.520
 Indeed. It's Captain Haddock right who says that. Yes. Yes frequently and this these are quite

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.840
 interesting thing about translating Tintin into English because obviously it was originally

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:46.400
 written in French. I was reading an interview with Leslie Lonsdale Cooper and she was one of the two

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.360
 main translators of Tintin from French into English and she was doing it for 30 years but

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.160
 she said one of the great challenges is fitting the words exactly into the speech bubbles because

00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.400
 you get exactly the same images but I don't you know when you hear a French announcement on a

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.960
 tannoy and then you hear the English one and the French one always goes on about five times longer

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.680
 so I don't know how she was compressing that but blistering barnacles was one of the things that

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:17.920
 she came up with as a translation of actually Mise Sabor. I think it was in French which means a

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:25.200
 thousand portholes. He's from Belgium though isn't he so yeah speak French. Speak French in

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:31.280
 half of Belgium they do. He's supposedly based on a Frenchman wasn't he Tintin. Robert Sexy.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:39.200
 Yes. That's a good name. It's a great name isn't it. Robert Sexy. He was a French journalist

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:45.840
 and apparently he looked a bit like Tintin. He went on adventures to the Soviet Union to the

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.400
 Democratic Republic of Congo and to the US in the same order that Tintin does those books

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:57.200
 but Hergé always said Tintin c'est moi so he always claimed that Tintin was based on himself

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.280
 but we think he might have been inspired by various different journalists. There was another

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:05.680
 theory that Tintin and all the characters were based on the family members of Hergé

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.600
 and he denied it later in life. He said no no no it's nothing to do with them

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:14.400
 but let me just quickly tell you about his family. There was his younger brother Paul

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:21.440
 who had a round face and a quiff. There was his dad Alexis who was a clumsy man who had a twin

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:27.600
 brother called Leon who lived nearby and the two of them would go for walks and they would wear

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:34.640
 identical bowler hats and carry identical canes singing in unison as they did. His dog Snowy

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:40.800
 who originally had the name Milo in French. Who does have the name Milo.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:46.880
 Who sorry rather who does have the name Milo in French shares that name with Hergé's first

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:53.120
 girlfriend. Yes but that's no yeah a lot of people a lot of people have suggested are you saying

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:58.960
 something rude but Harry Thompson points out that at the time it was considered to be a great

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:04.160
 crime if you were a young boy hanging out with the opposite sex certainly if you were depicting

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:08.960
 that in comics and so the only way he could represent this person who was very fond of

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.720
 was to put her as a dog in there otherwise he would have gotten a lot of trouble.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:20.160
 What what kind of weird excuse maker for the fact that Hergé put pretty much zero women

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:25.520
 in all of his comics were you reading oh we weren't allowed to include women in comic books

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:32.320
 they had to be dogs they had to come in disguise he just didn't put any women characters in it

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:37.600
 it's a bit of a bit of a hard to draw hard to draw women. That's not true what about

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:44.720
 Bianca Kesterfuhrer the opera singer she's a huge character in this you're right she's

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:50.960
 she is a heroine as well yeah that's true no you're right he had one he had Bianca that is true

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:56.240
 and he did have the dog who maybe was based on his girlfriend but also weirdly the person James

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:02.800
 mentioned sex there he had a travel companion called Milou as well so it might have been no way yeah

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.680
 have you guys read what is apparently the best tint in and I haven't read it I'm ashamed ashamed

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:14.080
 to say but tinted in Tibet people seem to say I'm guessing have you read Therese yes so that's

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:20.480
 that's that's my favorite I mean I've let people know that I yeah I think I remember back it might

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:25.920
 still be there on used to be on one of the social medias you put down your favorite book and I just

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:31.360
 always put tinted in Tibet oh you've got such good taste that was his favorite you probably know

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:36.240
 this that was Erzges favorite as well oh really yeah I didn't know that that's awesome um I just

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:41.680
 because it's got a Sasquatch in it as well that's why oh yeah of course that's why it's your favorite

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.440
 I thought you liked it for the great philosophical undertones and the exploration of kind of

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.840
 Buddhist theology but it's it's the Sasquatch no I've never read it I just I just flicked through

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:56.800
 and go straight to the Sasquatch and look at the pictures every time well it makes tinted the only

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.600
 fictional character to have received the light of truth award from the Dalai Lama so this is like

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:07.440
 the best honor that the Dalai Lama can bestow and it's to anyone who improves public understanding

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.400
 of Tibet which is questionable if they did chug a Sasquatch into the storyline but yeah the Dalai

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:19.280
 Lama gave tinted this amazing light of truth what's a Yeti you know yeah it's a Yeti yeah it's

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:25.760
 perfectly correct it is you're right it and he's a good guy like he saves them so really I love it

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.560
 when that happens yeah there's there's it's a good it's a great book does the Dalai Lama believe in

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:38.560
 Yeti's do you know if anyone knows I would say so yeah so he has alluded to a belief unfortunately

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:46.640
 the person he alluded that belief to was Brian Blessed so I'm not sure if we can trust Brian's

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:53.120
 reporting but he when Brian was looking to climb to Mount Everest and obviously looking for Yeti's

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:58.960
 along the way he had a what's it called an audience with the Dalai Lama and he met him they they

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:04.160
 apparently did some boxing together Brian took a walk with them in the wood he saw him revive a

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:09.920
 headless dead snake back to life and then they talked about Yeti's and he suggested that yeah

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:16.640
 that they are real so yeah headless dead snake back to life what did he do just pick it up and wobble

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:29.680
 it oh my god hey you're just wobbling that it's a knife it's a knife again he's doing it like the

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:36.000
 thumb trick where you make it go hey look at that well here's the other thing too I'll say about the

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:44.400
 hair the haircut on Tintin think about when you do find your your do you know when you you you're

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:48.960
 young or whatever you may be in your 20s you're playing whether you're sorting something out

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:55.120
 and you go right that's me quite often not everybody but a lot of people will will keep that

00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:00.560
 hairdo for their entire life and so that kind of fits in when you think about that because yeah

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:05.840
 even when you lose your hair or it goes gray or whatever you know you go into your your later

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:12.160
 stages of life you still got that same hairdo you had when you're in your early 20s that's a really

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:18.320
 good point there was a thing wasn't there there was a scientific paper written about Tintin which was

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:23.520
 when the first book was written he was supposed to be 14 and by the time the last book was written

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:31.920
 he must have been about 60 because Herge was writing them for so long but he was 60 years old

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:38.000
 never had to shave none of his hair's fallen out yeah he's still got those boyish features

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.840
 and according to these scientists they reckon he suffered from hypopetuitorism due to repeated

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:49.520
 blows to the head and some of the early books and does that stop you aging properly yeah it means

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:57.440
 you never go through puberty he's got sort of an inverse to what most middle-aged men have where

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:02.320
 he's bald all around the middle of his head and then he's got just lots of hair in the middle

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:06.800
 and i'm looking at james has actually brought a tintin doll you have a tintin yes yeah to this

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:11.840
 episode another visual feature that will be lost on our audience but it looks like a mohawk for me

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.400
 he really does doesn't it yeah i know that he does have hair sorry when you turn it around

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.640
 yeah it does yeah it's just from the front he looks bald i just say one one final thing is that

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:26.720
 that he he really didn't like tintin at the end much the way that arthur kohn and doil got sick

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:32.000
 of his creation of sherlock and he threw him off a cliff and and killed him off a waterfall

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:39.920
 uh arguably it's just a wet cliff right only because i went there a few weeks ago did you

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.400
 so the right light falls yeah all right would you say wet cliff is an accurate description

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:51.600
 so he um he really didn't like tintin at the end and he was quite sick of him and so the final

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:57.120
 tintin book that herje was working on up until the point of his death was a book called tintin

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:03.920
 and alfart and all we have is the sort of rough sketches of it but the final pain that he got

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:10.480
 up to the final bit of the story was having tintin covered in liquid polyester and being

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:17.120
 sold as a work of art and we that's the cliffhanger we don't know what happened does he die does he

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:25.120
 survive tintin is like uh like woody from toy story left on a cliffhanger we'll never know so do you

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:30.640
 mean he was put in like a work of art like a damian hearst kind of thing yes that's the idea

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.720
 knowing tintin as i as i do i would say he'd probably escape from that

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:41.600
 yeah but his his god might have turned him against that right like herje was who knows

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.880
 what he was going to do there we just don't know we don't know reese it's it it's interesting isn't

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:52.800
 yeah i well uh it's interesting isn't it they these people that play also when you think of actors

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:59.600
 that play these um characters that are so loved and they get sick of them as well i was just thinking

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:06.080
 of harrison ford with han solo does he not like did he not like hans by the way he he said he'll

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:12.320
 come back to star wars but he wanted the characters to die which is a spoiler but at least that's if

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:18.880
 you haven't seen that one it came out a few years ago now um but and then the whole james bond dying

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:25.760
 in that last bond that that daniel craig that's a bit more fresh that's a bit more fresh it reminds

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:36.720
 me of uh that character anna karellina yeah i don't know if you okay it is time for our final

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:43.920
 fact of the show and that is my fact my fact this week is that for over 50 years now the author of

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:50.160
 a nearly complete history of the moose in new zealand has been looking for moose in new zealand

00:47:50.160 --> 00:48:00.800
 despite there being no moose in new zealand or is there oh yeah exactly or is there is there no

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:05.920
 there isn't well there could be there is could there be all right well talk to us about why would

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:10.480
 he not be looking is it quite a short book it sounds like there's not much to put in this book

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.800
 right now if there are no moose in new zealand are you kidding me though there's plenty in this

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.520
 book and it's not his only book he's written a bunch of books he's written a wild moose chase

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:26.640
 he's this guy is a legend of new zealand yeah i knew you'd like that chance um this is a man called

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:33.680
 ken tustin and he has been in the national parks in new zealand in fiordland looking for moose

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:40.560
 because there was moose back in the 1920s 30s when they were introduced and there's your clincher

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:46.960
 there was moose so that it's not like oh he's going to look for theories and i hope there's some

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:53.360
 there you know there there was moose put there that'll be dead bad now those ones it's 100 years ago

00:48:53.360 --> 00:49:00.800
 it's a little thing called mating oh is that yeah go down to the sea get your toes wet

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.760
 come and meet me on a wet cliff mate

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:18.880
 wow oh blindfold you is that someone blowing no it's not it's just the wind all right get your

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:31.680
 idea out show us your twerks here we go and mating say this is okay so um i i got the uh the decade

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:37.680
 slightly wrong this was in 1910 and what it was is that new zealanders basically in 1910 wanted

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:42.560
 something to hunt and they had no natural land mammals of that size and so moose were introduced

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.760
 basically to rectify that so initially the moose really adapted well to the surroundings

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:53.200
 but then red deer were introduced into the area and that changed the whole food change so much

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:59.360
 that by 1952 so there was a good you know 40 odd years that they were around the moose population

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:06.240
 really dwindled and then basically by 1930 disappeared altogether but then in 1952 one was

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:11.520
 called on camera so there's 20 there's a 20 odd year period where people thought they were extinct

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:18.400
 and then suddenly boom here is a moose and that is why this guy says there may be more moose because

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:24.960
 moose are really good at hiding yes they are no they're really they're really hard to see they're

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:32.000
 huge i know big amla's i know i know but this is a huge national park you know it's really hard to

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.200
 spot one um a moose could be standing in a in a field 100 yards away and you won't see it

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:44.880
 wow they do get they get hit by cars a lot don't they moose like that is a big problem in canada

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.640
 and is that because of their this invisibility that they can switch up and off well that must be right

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:54.560
 yeah because they they've got this mystical ability they can stand still for a long time

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.280
 and one of their i think one of their look if you can just take this seriously

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:07.200
 one of their um you know like a a security measure uh defense mechanisms there you go there's the

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:13.920
 terms i knew you'd get there uh is to you know like um quite a lot of animals use that with a

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:18.960
 just freeze like the goat thinking and it's always yeah well no that's a different one that's you

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:23.280
 know but that well kind of but that's there that's a gene anomaly yeah i'm just trying to think of

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:29.600
 some other animals that do it do the old freeze um a few bugs in headlights they would rabbit headlights

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:34.480
 mules mules do that definitely i think when they're they just freeze when they can't deal with

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.840
 situation i think so yeah like a possum something they would kind of pretend to be dead no i think

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:45.920
 all the examples you've given so far are incorrect okay but there are some bugs and things out there

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:51.680
 that will just i think okay here's one the stick insect because i saw it yesterday okay and a frozen

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:57.840
 stick insect so the thing is i used to have pet stick insects as a child and they never moved

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:02.000
 ever it wasn't that as soon as they were in danger they stopped moving they just stayed

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 there's defense mechanism they were scared of me yeah absolutely so i've had one i had one on my

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:15.600
 steering wheel the other day this is back in new zealand when i was in the in the rural property

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:21.920
 and i went to grab my steering wheel to to to drive as you do and there's a there's a sticky

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:26.800
 on there and i went oh come on mate because of my hands need to be there he was in the two position

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:32.480
 because you know you go for 11 and two it's the worst place and i went i grabbed the 11 and i always

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:37.360
 grabbed the left first grabbed the 11 going for the two oh there's a sticky there and i says to him

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:42.480
 come on mate and i and he just honestly i see him looking at me i'm on the right hand side of him

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:48.240
 no prob's there but he's not moving and i come in slowly i'm cut and i even told him coming in with

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:54.000
 the hand buddy coming in because you're on my two position and nothing just absolutely frozen so in

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:02.560
 the end i just picked him up and he made out like he was a stick the whole time i've come to think of

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:07.920
 it it might have been a poor poor stupid stick insect because i see what you're saying now you're

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.800
 saying animals that are camouflage to their environment freeze but he's not a steering

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:17.840
 wheel insect so it would be good if you could know as an animal that the thing you're sitting on

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:23.200
 yeah it's not like but you look nothing like it yeah i mean chameleons they're the other ones

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:28.400
 that lizards in general will will freeze or or really dart away but lizards are the ones that will

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:34.240
 will freeze as a mechanism so let's go back to what what what was your fact in what are we talking

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:40.320
 about moose we were talking about mooses right that's right and so hey this is pretty cool we

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:46.720
 wrote a book years ago risa where there was a new zealand professor called neil gemel who had

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:54.320
 gone to loch nests and he had used a new form called e dna to try and sample the waters of

00:53:54.320 --> 00:54:00.880
 loch nests to see if the monster may exist and so e dna seems like quite an obvious thing that you

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:06.160
 would use in order to try and find the moose because you could go there and if the moose had

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.560
 been let's say around a little stream or a pond and if it had been sipping from it in the last

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:16.400
 21 days neil would be able to use this device to then take extracts out and say ah there's moose

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:23.360
 dna in there that means they're alive yeah so i actually dm'd him on twitter and i asked him you

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:28.880
 know is this is this a thing would you be up for doing it and he said it's so weird i actually

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:35.600
 met ken i met this guy who's been looking for moose yeah and he met him when he went back to

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:41.280
 loch nests to deliver the results of his findings about the water that he took from loch nests

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:47.680
 and ken happened to be there on holiday and they met at loch nests to then discuss looking for the

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:52.320
 moose actually i might seem like it's a massive coincidence but where is ken gonna holiday it's

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:56.880
 obviously gonna be loch nests isn't it where are these two nutters that you've happened to have

00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:04.480
 heard of gonna see each other how day so is he gonna do it well he he talks about it so he said

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:09.120
 what did he say he said ken and i've kept in touch and the plan was to jump on board with him

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:13.600
 next time he found some sign of moose but there's been little found in the past few years still

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:18.640
 remains a possibility we've surveyed quite large sections of yordland and do reasonably

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.680
 broad biodiversity surveys setting baselines and looking for various things endangered birds some

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:30.960
 species that are presumed to be extinct and of course moose so far there is no evidence of those

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:38.000
 however there's been a hugely exciting thing for ken that happened in 2020 which is that a kid

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:47.280
 well i say kid he's a teenager and when i say teenager he's in his 20s and he was on a flight

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:51.760
 he was a guy called ben young who was in a helicopter flying over fjordland doing some

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:57.840
 surveying and he saw a moose he saw the moose now here's the thing here's the thing he's a

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:02.320
 canadian who used to work with moose there you go he knows what a moose looks like we all know

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:10.560
 what a moose looks like no but canadians really know he was really no he was specifically a former

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:16.560
 moose hunting guide in canada i still go listen james he would really know reese you're the one

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:21.200
 who just told us a canadian could be standing a hundred feet from a moose on in a plain meadow

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:32.720
 and not see it so there you go yeah normally but this guy was a trained moose yeah looker

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:37.920
 wasn't he he's a trained moose looker yeah yeah it's i have to say it's not it obviously is not

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:44.320
 the maddest idea they were there like you say it is a big place and um sometimes these things

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:50.400
 come to fruition so there's another really great kiwi animal uh animal in new zealand

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:54.880
 the tarkahey which i think are pretty rare i doubt have you seen tarkahey i think they're

00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:00.000
 quite rare aren't they reese yes they're they're rare nice nice looking very nice looking birds

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.240
 though what kind of birds yeah they're the largest bird in like the rail family so like

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:10.960
 coots and mohens but much bigger very beautiful blue green feathers huge red beak that goes all

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:17.120
 the way up over their foreheads they can't fly but anyway we thought the tarkahey was extinct

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:23.040
 by about 1900 so i think the first sighting by europeans was 1849 obviously the europeans

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:28.560
 captured it roasted it ate it they sort of went quite quickly extinct and then there's a guy called

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:34.480
 jeffrey orbell who when he was a kid his mum just showed him a picture of one i think in a childhood

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:40.160
 book and he got a hunch as a child i bet that's still out there and he spent his life kind of

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:45.280
 reading up on them and he was he was a doctor i think he was a an eye doctor so he was a legit

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:50.720
 had a job um he knew how eyes worked so he'd be perfect for looking for things he knows how they

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:59.280
 really work he could he could really see yeah yeah so he took his expert eyes out on this 1948

00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:06.080
 expedition and he they went up this mountain and you know these things haven't been seen for 50 years

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:10.080
 and they sat by a little bit of water and two of them just walked straight into their nets

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:14.880
 these lovely little birds waddled in and we discovered and now they have them i think they're

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:22.400
 only about 300 they're very unusual but yeah they're very endangered yeah uh but look there you go i mean

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:28.000
 that's just one example of how animals and don't forget you know the more intelligent they are they

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:34.160
 know we're around they know that they're endangered there's only a small group of them and they hide

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:41.280
 and they worry and they at their their survival instinct is their main feature and so they are

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.440
 doing whatever it can take because otherwise they could be caught they could be shot we only think

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:50.480
 it from a human capacity of how how would we hide how would we stay alive but we're nowhere near as

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:56.560
 good as animals in the natural environment of the forest at staying alive yeah you're right a moose

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:02.320
 that's that's ingrained in its system isn't it get away um just back to the fjordlands very quickly

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:07.840
 i just want to give a quick shout out to a legend of the world of ornithology um he was part of the

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:14.640
 ornithological society of new zealand joined in 1957 a guy called ron jack nilson who very sadly

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:22.480
 passed away october 26 2022 um he was a legend of his field and he spent much like ken many many

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:29.040
 years looking for an elusive supposedly extinct species of bird which are called the south island

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:34.400
 coca-coco have you heard of that reese the south island coca-coco um oh yeah we found those this year

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:40.720
 in november wasn't it yeah it was the first of november last year yeah when did he die

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:54.800
 october 26 oh no oh that is so close yeah but no seriously what what what how do you spell

00:59:54.800 --> 01:00:03.680
 the bird name ko with a line above the k b o sorry k a ko so coca-coco and it's a bird that hasn't

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:10.000
 been seen for many many years um people occasionally have supposed sightings but no one has properly

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.920
 confirmed it no one has a photo and if anyone in new zealand in that region is listening there is at

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:21.040
 least there was when this paper was written a ten thousand dollar reward for any photographic proof

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.360
 of the south island coca-coco there's quite a lot of quite a lot of money to be made isn't there if

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:31.760
 you can find these things that don't exist oh it's not the easiest way probably to put in a decent

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.920
 sell a reliable salary if you tell your partner you know i'm gonna quit my job because i've heard

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.840
 lots of money to be made you're nagging me too much i'm gonna get my books and i'm gonna go and

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:54.640
 find the coca-coco okay i'll see you dinner the age old story okay that is it that is all of our facts

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.640
 thank you so much for listening if you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things
