00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.600
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.880
 Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round our microphones

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.400
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.000
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact this week, my fact is whenever JFK flew

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.360
 in Air Force One, he was sat in a rocking chair. Wow, that's clever, is it? So if there's any

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.120
 turbulence you don't feel it because you just rock. Brilliant, really good point.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.320
 Did he have a special porch constructed inside Air Force One which he could put his rocking chair on?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.360
 That would be a great look. Now this was what's surprising that he had a rocking chair on a plane,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.680
 you'd think that's not very safe. Well also I would think, you know what's really annoying for a lot

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.640
 of people on planes is when the person in front of you kind of leans back. What if they were constantly

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.400
 leaving back and leaning forward and leaning back for the whole flight? Yeah, you're right,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.040
 that would be terrible, but also you'd be walloping your head into the chair in front of you.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.000
 You would have to basically everyone in the plane would have to be in sync and going forward or

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.800
 backwards at the same time, wouldn't they? Yeah, well that's apparently a thing that does happen,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:44.480
 but maybe we'll get to that later. So wow, yeah fact. Tantalizing. So JFK, the reason he had a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.000
 rocking chair is because he had back problems, big back problems, and this was a result of his

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.840
 years in the war, he developed these problems. And so a physician called Janet Travelle in 1955

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.600
 said to him, why don't you do some swimming? But also why don't you try it a rocking chair?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.160
 And he tried it and he loved it so much that he had it everywhere. He got this one rocking chair

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.160
 which he had in the Oval Office, he had it at his home, he gave it to friends, he had about 12 of them

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.120
 and one of them was put on board Air Force One. And so any time he was flying anywhere,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.840
 that's what he would be saddened. Cool, very cool. Was it, do we know if it was rooted into the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.000
 ground or was it slipping all over the aeroplane? And also could he get a seatbelt on it? I've got

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.800
 a lot of questions about how this works. I know, I had those questions too and I'm afraid there's

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.280
 very scant detail of the, I guess you know, that's that sort of, you know, need to know basis

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.600
 information. Sure, maybe you had a normal seat for takeoff and landing and then went onto it for the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.000
 That makes sense. I would have thought takeoff is the crucial moment when you won it and you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.960
 can really, because you tip right back, wouldn't you? Yeah, you want a hamster wheel really,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.960
 don't you, for the takeoff? I do. Yeah, you don't want the president to flip on takeoff.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:00.320
 These are a specific kind of rocking chair, aren't they? The thing called the Kennedy Rocker.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.520
 He didn't pick that because of the name, they're named after him, the specific model of chair.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.960
 But the really cool thing is there are now about 40 airports in the USA which have rocking chairs

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.560
 in them, just in the terminal buildings and, you know, looking out over the planes and the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.800
 tarmac and all of this. And this is a huge trend and it's, it only started in the late 90s when

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.520
 there was an exhibition at Charlotte Douglas International Airport. They had an exhibition

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.560
 called Porch Sitting and there were loads of rocking chairs. And then at the end of the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.120
 exhibition, they removed them and people said, "What are you doing? We like those. We love

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.280
 sitting in those chairs." So now they've spread across America and they're just everywhere.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.880
 And those are Kennedy Rockers. Exactly. Yeah, they're known as, well, that's the nickname,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.000
 they're Carolina Rockers. And yeah, they're perfect because they mean that you can just

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.400
 move them wherever you need to. So if you just need to clean up. And just very good for putting

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.480
 near a wall, near a wall plug for travellers. So yeah, they love it. Is it, what do you say,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.920
 you can move them wherever you need as opposed to normal chairs? Yeah, most chairs in airports

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.960
 aren't movable. They're stuck to the ground, aren't they? Oh, well, I can't believe they don't get

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.520
 stolen all the time. Yeah, but you're not going to be able to sneak that onto a plane, are you Anna?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.600
 You're not going to be able to get it underneath the seat in front, are you?

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.040
 His back problems were terrible. I hadn't realised what a horrible, painful life he had.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.120
 And it's weird that he was recommended swimming, since it seems to be excessive swimming that

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.320
 might have made them a lot worse in the first place. Oh, really? So he got, he was a really

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.840
 sickly president. A lot of people say he's the sickest president, not in a cool way, that they've

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.360
 ever had. Really? Yeah, there's been a bunch of studies done on his health recently. And he was

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.880
 always in and out of hospital. I mean, who was it? Who was it who was in an actual wheelchair

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.320
 and had a stroke? FDR, yeah. FDR, yeah. And who was the one who died like two days after?

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.520
 Yeah, William Henry Harrison, yeah. He died after a month. Was he the sickest? Maybe. I don't know

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.600
 if that's an illness. You didn't say, oh, God, I've just been diagnosed with having been shot in

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.880
 the face. He wasn't shot. He died of a chill. He went to his inauguration without wearing a hat.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.880
 That's a good point. All right. Well, that's true. That's a new illness, not long lasting.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.200
 Yeah. I guess these neuroscientists haven't read up on all the histories of president's health,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.320
 but he was sickly and he had this terrible back, which was made worse when he fought in the war,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.160
 which he shouldn't have because he didn't pass the health test because of his health problems,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.000
 but his dad pulled some strings. And in 1943, he was in the Navy and his boat was struck by a

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.480
 Japanese destroyer. And so it sank and the crew had to swim for almost six kilometers in order to

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.400
 get to dry land. And not only that, but he swam while towing an injured crew member with him

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.400
 between his teeth. So he got ahold of his life jacket and towed him between his teeth,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.880
 the six kilometers. And then the subsequent days, he had to keep swimming from island to island

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.960
 until they were rescued. And they believe that made his back significantly worse. Well, it would.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.600
 You would have thought. So it seemed like a bit of a sick joke that the doctor then said,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.040
 have you tried swimming to fix it? Yeah, that's really good advice.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.600
 That doctor, though, Jeanette Travelle, what I like about her is she basically invented deep heat.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.880
 You know that stuff that when you're playing football, for me and other people doing other

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.600
 sports, like you put it on and it kind of heats the inside of you. And it supposedly makes you

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.360
 feel better if you've had a bit of a knock. Well, a lot of her research was about using these

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.960
 vapor coolant sprays to relieve pain. And that's basically what deep heat is today. So she did

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.960
 that. What is it? Deep heat. Well, it makes it burn so much. There's one that I have which is

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.800
 used capsaicin. I don't know if that's deep heat or some jelly. Yeah, but I think they use different

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.040
 chemicals. But yeah. Okay, right. That's cool. So if you're out of deep heat, you could just

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:52.240
 rub some fresh chili into the affected area. Let's say, you know, I see a doctor first is what I'm

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.880
 saying. I don't know. I actually think you can trust it. I actually think, Anna, you say the

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.120
 swimming was the bad bit of advice. I think the prescription of a rocking chair was the worst

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.880
 bit of advice because rocking chairs seem to be more dangerous to presidents than anything I can

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:15.520
 see. So how many presidents, how many presidents, again, how many there's a slight history issue here,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.880
 more dangerous than assassinators, for instance. Well, how many, how many presidents have been

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:28.000
 assassinated for right? Yeah, four, three of the four are very closely tied to rocking chairs. So

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.200
 Jonathan Kennedy, the last chair that he sat in prior to that car chair was on Air Force One.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.320
 He was in his rocking chair. That was the last thing that he was on, and he loved his rocking

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.040
 chair. William McKinley, another assassinated president, he campaigned the whole time in his

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.400
 wicker rocking chair out on his front porch. That's where he did all of his pitching to be

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.360
 president. And Abraham Lincoln was sitting in a rocking chair when he was assassinated.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.840
 What, the theater? Yeah, in Ford Theater, he was sitting in a rocking chair. So three of the four

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.600
 presidents that have been assassinated have very close ties to rocking chairs. And I think that's

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:06.000
 something we've not been reporting on as a society. James Garfield was actually on his way to open

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.440
 a rocking chair factory. You know, you can visit if you want. And if you happen to be in Michigan,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.280
 the Lincoln rocking chair, and you can still see a dark spot on the back of it, which I think people

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:24.240
 like to believe is blood from when he was shot. But it's actually, I think more disgustingly,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.200
 the hair oil from people repeatedly sitting in it in the early 1800s.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:36.880
 So Dan, what was it you were saying before about, you gave us a tease or something at the start,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:44.080
 didn't you? Oh, that's right. Yes. There's a report that I briefly scanned. So I'm afraid no further

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.400
 details of the top headline here. But when people in rocking chairs see each other rocking next to

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.120
 each other, they will naturally sink the rock. They will make the rock go at the same rhythm.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:59.920
 And I think we do that on bridges and so on, I've heard. Yes. Okay. So one of the reasons...

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.360
 Will you be taking questions, Dan? Is that like you will?

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:14.240
 This is the worst TED talk I've ever had. I did read the paper, Dan. And I read a few papers about

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.240
 this because it is really interesting. And it's basically exactly like you say, apart from the

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.480
 bridge part, which I've literally no idea what you're talking about. But yeah, if you put two

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.800
 people in a room together with two rocking chairs, they will move and sink. And we're not quite sure

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.160
 why they do it, but there are some clues. And we think it's probably that you're seeing someone

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.640
 else do it and it's like the visual clues and you're subconsciously trying to get in sync with

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.440
 someone else because you're empathetic with them. And one reason we think that is because actually

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:47.360
 if you get autistic children, they don't do it. So if you get an autistic child and a non-autistic

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.400
 child in a room and they're both sat on rocking chairs, the autistic child will not go and sink

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.280
 with the other child. Interesting. Yeah, kind of interesting, isn't it? It's like when you walk

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.080
 and sink with someone. You know, when you're walking down the street with a friend and then you

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.480
 realise you're walking like a boy band or something. That's right. Just naturally. And if you do that on

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.880
 a bridge, it can cause bridges to collapse. Oh, that's the thing. That's the issue. Did you guys

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.640
 read about the world's largest rocking chair? No. No. It's big. I mean, there have been a few

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.240
 world's largest rocking chairs. There's one called Big John. These are all in the States, by the way.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.000
 That was 32 feet tall, got the Guinness World Record. Very exciting. That got blown out of the

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.760
 water by a 42 foot tall one in Fanning, Missouri, which had to be welded to the ground because

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.800
 it was so clearly dangerous. Wait a minute. So that means it's not rocking? No, exactly. It's

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.520
 controversy. But anyway, neither of those is now the world's largest rocking chair because in 2015,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:45.600
 a place called Casey, Illinois built a 56 foot tall rocking chair. And so the others have had to

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:52.000
 rename themselves the former world's largest rocking chair, which is cool. And does that one

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.280
 rock? Do you know? I think the Casey one does rock. And the Casey one, have you heard of Casey,

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.480
 Illinois? I feel like I have, actually. I don't know why, though. I bet you've probably been there,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.480
 James, because it's also home to the world's biggest wind chime, biggest wooden shoes,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.920
 biggest knitting needles and a 200 kilo pencil. Their entire tourist economy is based on having

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.920
 quite big things. And it's worked. They used to be really, the town used to be really broke. And

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.840
 now they've got big things and they get tourists. It genuinely works. I've always thought because

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.600
 obviously America has lots of these places all over it. If aliens did come to our earth after

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.120
 it's been depopulated, they'd think that America was populated by giants. There was a species of

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.560
 giants that lived in peace alongside the humans. And then also whenever they come to the UK and we

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:46.000
 have all our muddle villages, they'll think that we are all tiny people. I'm speaking of America.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 Have you heard about the 1901 rocking chair riots? No. Yes, I have. What a story. So this was all the

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.600
 fault of this guy called Oscar Spate. And he was like a wheeler dealer wanting to make some money,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.320
 decided to move some rocking chairs into Central Park, place them all over it. So it was Central

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.760
 and Madison Park in fact, place them everywhere. But the moment people sat in one, he installed

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.800
 henchmen just so hiding out of sight, who would leap in front of you and say that'll be five cents

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:21.200
 please, or three cents for the less comfortable ones. And people didn't like that. And the more

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.800
 they complained, the more he installed more. And eventually it got out of hand when there was this

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.120
 heat wave, someone who was feeling a bit faint sat in one of his rocking chairs and he got

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.640
 yanked out from underneath him by one of this bloke's henchmen called Thomas Tully. And a massive

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:42.240
 crowd chased Thomas Tully through Central Park and into a hotel shouting, "Linch him, linch him."

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.880
 He had to run upstairs in the hotel to lock himself in one of the rooms until they'd gone away.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.680
 And then this mob marched through the streets of New York saying, you know, get rid of the chairs,

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:56.560
 sort of smashing rocking chairs all over the place, singing the Marseillais. It was big stuff.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.440
 One of the problems was that they removed all of the normal seats. On this really hot weekend,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.840
 they'd removed all the normal seats for repairs on the same day. So all was left was his rocking

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.720
 chairs. And so that's when it all kicked off. But they did try it for a bit afterwards. And there

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.440
 was one worker who tried to collect some fees, but was stabbed by an elderly woman with a hat pin.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.640
 And then he thought, okay, well, what I'm going to do is I still want to do this because it's a

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.280
 good business idea. And he got the idea from Europe, you know, like if you go to parks in London,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:31.280
 you might find there are deck chairs. He thought, I'm still going to go with this. And so he thought,

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.440
 well, I'm going to get all my chairs in one little corner, and then I'm going to hire them out to

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.360
 people, right? And then we won't have the problem of people accidentally sitting in there and us

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.240
 saying five cents, please. And he did that. But then basically, as soon as they saw that,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.600
 all the unlockers started throwing stones at him and just like tried to get him out of the park.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.080
 And eventually he had to give up. But the park commissioner, the head of the park commissioner,

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.360
 who was called George C. Claussen, who had kind of said yes to the thing in the first place,

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.480
 said, okay, this is kind of all my fault. So he bought all the rocking chairs of this guy's spate,

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:10.640
 and he put them in the park and wrote in massive letters free on them. And so people were allowed

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.640
 to sit on them for free from then on. That's weird, because that would make me think I could just

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.680
 take the chair. Yeah, we already established that you're a massive rocking chair thief.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:25.200
 I just got a perfect spot in the corner of my bedroom and needs a rocking chair.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:37.440
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My fact is that due to COVID-19,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:44.000
 the 2020-2020 Cricket World Cup will be in 2021, and the 2021-2020 will happen in 2022.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:52.960
 Amazing. So, yeah, this is just, this is a fact. It comes from the economists world in

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.800
 2021, which is a sort of guide to the year ahead. 2020 is a kind of cricket. For those of you

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.040
 listening who are not cricket fans, it's a kind of super fast, whizzy version of normal.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.960
 Yeah, so normal cricket, we play it for five days. And often there's no result.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:12.800
 Usually it's raining. And you just come back four days later and say, let's just call it a draw.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.520
 But this one, it's like really fast. It's over in two hours, 20 overs each. You're done.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.520
 Exactly. So they could have fitted in probably in 2019, but they should have done, but they

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.880
 didn't. And it was going to happen in Australia. And then obviously in 2020, with COVID, the

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.040
 International Cricket Council said that's going to be pushed forward. And India's hosting a 2021,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.200
 which is now happening in 2022. I don't know what's happening to the 2022 tournament.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.880
 I mean, surely at some point we're going to have to play two world cups in one year.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.200
 No. I think it's the reason that they don't rename it probably because they've already

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:51.200
 printed all the merch. Oh, I don't know. There must be loads of merch from 2020,

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.040
 which was printed. And what about all the, is it the Olympics that were going to be happening in

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.840
 Tokyo? Again, they're still calling it the 2020 Olympics. Are they? That's going to be a little

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:08.000
 nugget of confusion for historians in 200 years. It's also going to be huge anxiety for anyone

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.520
 who had the worst year in 2020 when they see that popping up everywhere. But it's happening again.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:21.280
 Very triggering. Very triggering number. Yeah, cricket's been, well, it's been affected by COVID

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.920
 much like everything else on earth, hasn't it? It's probably the main one.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.080
 I say it's the biggest sufferer. The main thing that seems to have happened to cricket,

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.000
 everything is always like, you know, cricket's had a tavern yet, everything's had to change.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.040
 There's the saliva rule. And then that's pretty much it. Basically, you're not allowed to put

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.000
 saliva on the ball anymore for very obvious reasons, which they used to do to shine the ball.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.120
 And what are they doing instead? Well, there are rules. So if that happens,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.800
 and the Empire sees you happening, he will have to sanitize the ball. Right. And then hand it back.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.560
 They should have a sort of sprinkler system between the two wickets, which is like a wall of

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:04.240
 sanitizer that the ball passes through, like it's a car wash. That's a great idea. That's such a

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.880
 good idea. So for the people who aren't into cricket, the reason you do this is you spit on

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.200
 one side of the ball, you rub it against your pants, and it makes one side shiny. And the other

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.080
 side not shiny, which makes it move in the air in a slightly unusual way, which can make it

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.320
 difficult for the batsman. That's why you do that. And these days, what they do, I believe,

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.200
 is you can do it with your sweat rather than with your saliva, I think. Wait, are you allowed

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.280
 to do it with your sweat? I believe so, but I haven't looked that up, but I think that's right.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.160
 Interesting. So if you sweat on someone, they can't get Covid from that.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.040
 I think it's quite hard to transmit through sweat. I think so. It's harder. Right. Maybe

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.400
 it's not impossible. But if you're playing cricket in winter, do you have someone just

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.080
 sort of in a sauna, and he quickly runs out? That is one thing about cricket is it's very

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:54.560
 much a summer spot. Yeah. What you have to do, if you're the team sweater, then you have to

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.240
 constantly be getting into embarrassing situations and making awkward comments.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.080
 So you feel really awkward and then you sweat more. And then you've got, you know, you can

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.880
 wring yourself out on that. And actually, weirdly, and this is very ironic, someone with Covid

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.560
 would be sweating a lot because they'd have a fever. So they would ironically be the best

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:18.160
 person to have in that role. Right. Catch 22. Catch 22 is a great name for a cricketing base

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:24.640
 or a thriller, isn't it? Because there are 22 players in total. Oh, my God. Oh, really?

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.720
 Hang on. Surely that's going to be what they're calling the 2022 2020 World Cup.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:34.400
 The 2021 2020 World Cup in 2022 is going to be called Catch 22.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:40.640
 There was a 2020 World Cup this year in cricket. Did it happen early?

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:47.120
 It did. It was the Women's 2020, Women's T20. The final was Australia beating India in Melbourne,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:55.200
 and they had 86,174 spectators to watch that game, which is only 4,000 shots of the world record

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:01.120
 of any women's sporting event in history. Wow. Which was the 1999 World Cup in California.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:07.280
 But Women's T20 is absolutely massive. It's big in the UK and big in Australia and India,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.840
 but actually all around the world, it's really big. So the next T20 World Cup,

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:18.560
 they're going to have teams from Bhutan, Botswana, Malawi, Myanmar, Philippines, Argentina, Brazil.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.400
 And the reason that these countries have got really good women's teams is because,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.680
 if you think about it, let's say you're Brazil, for instance, and you're trying to bring cricket up

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.000
 and you're trying to make it popular, it's going to be so hard for you to break into the men's game

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.960
 because like the main men's teams have been going for hundreds and hundreds of years and,

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.920
 you know, they're really entrenched at the very, very top. But the Brazilian women's T20 team,

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.080
 they really do think that they have a chance to get into the finals and, you know, and maybe do

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:51.040
 something because the best teams, obviously still England and India and Australia are good,

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.360
 but they might be able to get into those lower echelons. So, yeah, really big in lots and lots of

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.280
 countries. Sneaky. Coming in through the back door, we call that Fire the Wins game.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:08.080
 The first cricket World Cup was the Women's World Cup in 1973, in fact. So, people tend to say the

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:14.880
 first cricket World Cup ever was 1975, but the ladies did it two years earlier. And I just mainly

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.040
 like it because the captain of the women's team, of the England women's team at the time and the

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:26.240
 instigator was called Rachel Hayhoe. That'd be brilliant if you're in the crowd and you

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:34.720
 wanted to chant her name. Hey, Ho! Hey, Ho! The first ever international 2020 match

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.760
 was also a women's game. Was it? Yeah. I don't really like to talk about it because England lost

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:46.080
 against New Zealand. Against New Zealand? We won this one. Hayhoe won. So, we'll just discuss

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.320
 this one till the cows come home. So, it was started when she convinced her pal Jack Haywood to

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:57.600
 run Wolves Football Club and he was really up for it. He said, "Because it's quite simple.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.600
 I love women and I love cricket. What could be better than the two rolled together?"

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.560
 And so, he bankrolled the whole thing. And they came and Australia came over and the only other

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.720
 thing I could find about it in the match reports was that the Australian team in one of their off

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.120
 days went to Longleat and the tournament report said they had a confrontation with an inquisitive

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:22.240
 Rhino. That's all that happened. The first ever women's cricket match was in 1793.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:31.360
 97. It's a long time ago. That was 11 married women of Berry versus 11 unmarried women of Berry.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.040
 Were those team names? They were the teams, yeah. They were the team names.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.440
 It was always married versus singles. Yeah, what's that? It's not a single shaming thing in the

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:45.040
 olden days of sports. Well, it's unmarried. So, can you have widows and virgins on the same team?

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.920
 Yeah. Are they separate teams? I don't know. I don't know what the rules were, but

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.120
 by technically speaking, by the look of it, it looks like you could.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.960
 I bet it was, this is a bit like, you know, cricketers who have dual nationality. I bet

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.080
 widows could actually play for the singles or the married. They could probably decide.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.800
 Yeah. Well, you could defect by just marrying sort of just a fan, right?

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.120
 Yeah. If you're on the unmarried team, you would want your best player to never meet anyone and

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.840
 get married to them, wouldn't you? You'd be always, it'd be hilariously always trying to kind

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.400
 of spoil all of their dates and stuff. That's really good. I think this is a good subplot,

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.520
 maybe a B-plotline for catch-22 when we write a sports-based dramedy.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.200
 The married women of Burry, by the way, they were so good. They were absolutely amazing.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.000
 They were written about in Australian newspapers. They were so good.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.640
 And they offered to play any other women's team in the world for any sum. That's how confident they were.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:44.480
 Wow. One T20 match that I discovered, which has led me into a whole area of cricket I didn't

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:51.760
 know existed, was the Blind Cricket T20. And that's obviously just a subsection of

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:58.160
 General Blind Cricket, which is fascinating to watch. I'd never heard of it. And it's really

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:03.600
 cool. There's 11 players on each team. And the idea is that four of those players are completely

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.760
 blind. They're known as B1. And three players are partially blind, B2. And the final four,

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.000
 partially sighted players, B3. And there's all these adaptions that they do to the sport to

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.600
 make it work. So if you were the bowler, you would be bowling a ball, which is significantly

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.480
 larger than a standard ball. And it's filled with ball bearings. So it's got audible cues for

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:30.640
 you to hear it coming towards you if you can't see. And so if you're bowling as well, you have to

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.040
 yell play so that they know that it's been thrown. So you know that you're ready to get it. You can't

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.880
 be bowled out if you're completely blind. If it hits the wicket, so it has to be an LBW.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.720
 And usually the bowling is rolled on the floor, so you can hear those ball bearings going.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:51.040
 It's really fascinating to watch. And they do T20 as well. And Pakistan is where I discovered this

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.000
 through their team. They won it, I think, in 2016. And yeah, there's lots of YouTube clips

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.880
 to watch. It's very exciting. Very cool. So is the ball rolled to make it go more slowly?

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.240
 I suppose. Or to make it audible. I think it's the audible time. Also to make it a lot safer,

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.120
 probably. Because you probably don't want Jafaracha bowling at you, even if it does have

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.240
 ball bearings in it, if you're blind. Yeah, exactly. I think it used to be rolled along

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:21.920
 the ground until sort of mid 1800s. I think we've mentioned that. Yeah, I think certain

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.440
 cheating Australians still have done that in history as well, but we won't go into it.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:32.880
 All right, let's move on. Have you heard of the longest match ever? So the T20 was obviously

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.840
 a short format of cricket. The longest test match ever was 12 days long. And it still ended in a

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:44.640
 draw. It was 1939. It was England, South Africa. It was called the Timeless Test, which used to

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.680
 be a format of cricket where you just don't have to stop playing until someone wins. And the only

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.680
 reason the match ended was the ship that the English team were booked onto was due to leave

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:59.280
 South Africa. And in fact, it had already left, they were in Durban, I think it had already left

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.560
 Durban. And they said, Oh, it's fine. We'll just get a train to Cape Town. Let's just keep playing

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.000
 a couple more days and see if we can finish the match. And they still didn't finish it. It was

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.920
 still a draw. And I think they ended the practice off. Yeah, I did read about that actually. And

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.840
 it was getting really close. England only needed 42 more runs to win the game. And they had two

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.280
 players left in. And so it was really getting close to a really exciting denouement. But they

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.960
 were like, no, we're going to have to go. And at one stage, they considered leaving the two players

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:31.680
 behind who was still in. Just everyone else going home to see if they could get over the line.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:37.840
 That's so funny. The longest, speaking of longest cricket things in South Africa,

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:46.000
 the longest six was also in South Africa, the longest six ever hit apparently. And this was

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.280
 Can we guess? Was it Chris Gale? What can you guess how long it was? Oh,

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.720
 I thought who it was. I thought Andy was going to regale us with all the crickets, as he knows.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.720
 No way. I mean, I thought Chris Gale probably, but I didn't want to play it.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.200
 I can give you a clue as to who it was. James, this might help you. So this was one of South

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.080
 Africa's best players at the turn of the 20th century. Hansi Cronya? At the turn of the 20th

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:14.960
 century. Oh, he is old. When you're saying turning the 20th century, you don't mean from the 20th

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.120
 to the 21st, you mean? Exactly. I think that's pretty ambiguous, to be honest. You're absolutely

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:25.600
 right. It turns twice, doesn't it? That was that guy Smith, wasn't it? Was it? Oh, yeah. Yeah,

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.160
 you're close. It was Sinclair. You got the right first letter. Was it two miles? Can I just guess

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:39.440
 that as a distance hit? It's close. Times. Go on. Did they play it on the top of an enormous plateau?

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:46.880
 And so the ball was hit out of the grounds and then fell two miles. Or maybe hit it onto a rhino's

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:52.320
 horn and then it stuck on the rhino's horn and then he gallops across the well. That's good.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:57.120
 That's closer. I can tell you that. I'm going to say it lands on the back of a truck and the

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.960
 truck drives off and it takes it 50 miles. Dan's done it. He's absolutely nailed it with the reason.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:08.240
 He hasn't gone far enough. It was 560 miles. It landed on the back of a coal truck on a railway

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:15.680
 track. I'm going to allow truck and it travelled from Joberg to the Cape before being retrieved

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:22.560
 and that counts for the long distance in history. Do you know that there is only one person who has

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:29.280
 ever appeared in World Cups in two different spots in the same year? That's interesting. This is only

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:36.400
 in 2003 so quite recently. It's a Namibian guy called Rudy Van Vuren and he appeared in both

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.600
 the Cricket World Cup and the Rugby World Cup for Namibia in the same year. That is really cool.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:47.920
 Until you find out that he lost all six games of cricket by a total of 813 runs

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:55.200
 and lost all four rugby games by a total of 282 points. Oh boy. That is the equivalent of when

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.960
 Bart Simpson plays a dozen grandmasters at chess and loses to every single one of them.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:09.280
 Still, if you didn't tell us that extra bit. It's still amazing. Do you know when the first ever

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.120
 cricket match, international cricket match, was played in Albania by an Albanian team?

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:19.120
 Do I know when that happened? It would be an old piece of information for us to have stored

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.240
 unless we just... Really? It's not the classic where where you went.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:29.920
 Was it one of the turns of the 20th century? It was a bit after the turn of a century.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:37.040
 It's either going to be really recent or in sort of 200 BC. I know because Albania didn't exist

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.520
 until after World War One, did it? I don't think. Well, okay. But it could have been the foot what

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:48.400
 was what turned into Albania. What are we trying to guess? When the... 2015. 2015 is when it happened.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.760
 Oh, okay. 2015. And what happened again? Sorry. Albania had their first international cricket

00:28:53.760 --> 00:29:02.560
 match. It was the first time. And they played with, it was on the 24th of May, 2015, the Albanian

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:09.920
 Eagles versus the international Lions. So not an official British cricket team. And the captain

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:16.800
 of the Albanian team was the Prince of Albania, the Crown Prince. And the of the British team,

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:24.640
 it was Tony Hawks, the comedian who set it up. Yeah. And the Crown Prince and his Albanian

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:31.680
 team won the match. They won by one run and they were all out for 49. And the trophy that they won

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:38.800
 was the Sonoran Wisdom Trophy, which is the trophy of the Cup. Isn't normal wisdom supposed to be

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.920
 really popular in Albania or is that? Yes, he's incredibly popular in Albania. For some bizarre

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.720
 reason, they love slapstick over there. And I say that as someone who spent a bit of time there.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.240
 They love Laurel and Hardy. They love Chaplin. So Norman Wisdom fits in perfectly with that.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:58.000
 Do they have... Well, we have Wisdom's cricket almanac. They have Wisdom's cricket almanac.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.560
 Oh my god. Wow.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:10.480
 Okay, it is time for fact number three. And that is James.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:16.240
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1682, Russia was ruled by two half brothers,

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:22.880
 aged 16 and 10. A special double throne was built so they could make proclamations together,

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:27.920
 but it had a secret window behind it so they could get messages from their sister Sophia,

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:34.640
 who was literally the power behind the throne. Amazing. So cool. It is really cool. So how did

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.920
 this window work? Talked to us about this throne. You'd open and close it. She'd put a bit of paper

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:46.880
 in. Kind of, yeah. So there's basically behind where one of them sat, there's a little kind of hole

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.800
 and normally it's covered with velvets. You can't tell whether it's a hole or not,

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:55.840
 but the idea is that someone could be discreetly hidden behind there and they'd be able to kind

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:03.200
 of whisper things to the young czars or they could possibly pass little pieces of paper or

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.840
 stuff like that. Or if you wanted to distract them during a proclamation, you could poke them in the

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:14.560
 bottom presumably on their speech. It would be in the neck. It would be stupid to put that

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:20.480
 little velvet window by their arse. You're not going to get past many secrets to that.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:27.200
 Shall I give you a little bit of background on this Russian history really, really quickly? So

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:34.960
 this is in 1682 there was a Tsar called Fyodor and when he died, the country was in a bit of a

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:40.320
 shambles. He was, he wasn't really able to rule. He'd sent the army into loads of stupid campaigns

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:45.680
 and he'd left no heir. And so it was up to the nobles to fill the throne and you had two families,

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:51.440
 the Naryshkins and the Miroslavskis, who basically hated each other and they had to decide who was

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.000
 going to take the throne between them, which family. So the Duma, who was the Russian parliament,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.760
 they had to basically pick one. They had to basically choose who was the right horse and

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:05.520
 they would say we'll go for them. The Miroslavsky candidate was Ivan, but he was quite sickly.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:10.800
 So they decided not to go for him. They went for the guy from the Naryshkin family called Peter,

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:18.320
 who later would become Peter the Great. So Sofia was a part of the Miroslavsky family like Ivan,

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.080
 but she was really strong. She got the army on her side and she persuaded everyone to go with a

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:27.360
 joint rulership. But so that meant that you had two rulers at the same time. And then she became

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.160
 in charge of Russia. She fired the head of the army. Actually she had him executed. She replaced

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:37.040
 the head of the army with one of her favourites. She took over most of Ukraine. She took over Kiev

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.880
 in exchange for helping Poland against the Turks. It was just basically all crazy kind of game of

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.720
 throne stuff until Sofia went a little bit too far. She tried to get the army to overthrow Peter.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.840
 The army liked Peter, so they arrested Sofia, had her tried and compelled her to take the veil,

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.960
 so she had to become a nun. And then Peter became the emperor and Peter became Peter the Great.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.120
 He loved sending people to the Naryshkin family. It was a real classic Peter the Great power move.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:09.760
 So not only did he send Sofia there, he sent her sisters along there as well, at least two of them,

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:15.680
 maybe more. And he also sent his own wife to a nunnery later on, because he seems to have been

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:21.520
 bored of her basically. So he was terrible. No, that was Ivan who was the terrible. Peter was

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:28.240
 the great. Easy mistake to make. Well, Peter is not great in my opinion. I think we need to rename

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:34.160
 him. He was a horrible guy. Peter the Dickhead, I think. He was someone who basically just killed

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.760
 people in the most brutal ways. Disagree. I mean, what do you mean disagree? What was the great bit?

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:45.680
 I mean, he'd had a very traumatic upbringing, and it was not an especially decent bit of human

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.880
 history. I don't think he was especially worse than many of his predecessors, to be honest.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.560
 It was Zaris Russia. You accepted gruesome killings, but I want to hear about one of the

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.240
 gruesome killings. But also the great part was because he modernized the country, I think,

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.480
 more than him not killing people. Can we get some good bitching from Dan, though?

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:07.760
 No, we've actually covered him quite a lot with his atrocities back. We mentioned that he was

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.920
 very much into anatomy, so he would go to the headings and he would study the bodies of people

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.720
 that were killed. And when he had one of his ex-girlfriends murdered by having her head chopped

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:24.080
 off, he then picked up her head and explained about the windpipe and so on, literally in the

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.760
 moment to a crowd like a TED talk. Just interestingly, this is where this happens,

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.720
 and then he kissed her on the face and then popped her down on the floor. That's a dickhead to me.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:40.400
 Just on Sophia, a tiny bit about her, she was known for being kind of shrewd and clever and

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:45.920
 skillful, wasn't she? Which I guess is how she wielded all this power. But she was not very

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.560
 favourably reported on it in other ways, so there was a French diplomat called Foy de Lanneville

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:56.080
 who wrote about her, who acknowledged that she was very shrewd. He said, "As much as her waist is

00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:02.240
 short, wide and rough, so her mind is thin, shrewd and skillful." Which, actually, when you look

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:09.040
 at it like, what is a thin mind? What is that? I don't know. But he did write of her, "She is terribly

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:15.200
 fat, has facial hair, lupus on her legs, is at least 40 years old, and has a head the size of

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:21.280
 a pot." What a vague way of describing someone, because pots are not a standard size. That's

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.360
 stupid. It's like saying, "I have a foot the size of a shoe."

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:35.200
 Wow. Yeah, maybe pots were all one size in those days. But that's one of the innovations Peter

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:40.080
 the Great had, of course, is the Great Pot Revolution, where he introduced different size pots.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.960
 They called him Potter the Great, actually, for a lot of his time. So, this fact is about

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:54.640
 thrones, and this sort of weird double throne that they had. I didn't know that when you're

00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:00.960
 becoming king or queen in Britain, you don't sit on a throne. You sit on a chair. It's called

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:07.120
 the coronation chair, and it's explicitly not a throne. So, do we not have a throne? Is that

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:11.120
 what you're saying? No, they've got buckets of thrones, actually. But this particular

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:17.920
 thing. It used to be not looked after especially well. So, it's the oldest bit of furniture in

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.120
 England made by someone who's known, who's named, someone called Walter of Durham. But it was in

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.120
 such bad nick that in Westminster Abbey in the 18th century, you could have a go at sitting on it

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.760
 for a small payment, if you just paid a verdure or something. And it's even got carved into the

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.720
 back of it, graffiti from all the people who visited. So, somebody wrote, "P. Abbott slept

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:42.000
 in this chair 5th to 6th July 1800." That's the official coronation chair of the whole country.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.800
 What I find really weird about that is that all those bits of graffiti are quite old, aren't

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.120
 they? Like you say, they're from the 18th century or even maybe a little bit after that. But they're

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:58.480
 from around then. But in 1914, the chair was blown up by the suffragettes. As in, they put a bomb

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.440
 there and bits fell off it. And so, they decided to put it all back together. But they decided

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.080
 not to get rid of any of the graffiti. Isn't that weird? They thought all the graffiti was part

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:13.120
 of it now, but you would think that a coronation chair shouldn't have P. Abbott slept here.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:19.760
 I like the fact that the coronation chair was specifically made to, in order to accommodate

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.400
 the stolen coronation chair of the Scots, which does make you understand why some Scottish people

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:29.680
 aren't massively keen. But it was, so it was literally built so that underneath it, it could

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:36.720
 contain the stone of schoon, which is basically the throne of the Scots. And I had never read about

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:42.480
 when the Scots stole the stone of schoon back in 1950. I've never read the story, but there may be

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:49.120
 people who remember this. So, this was a huge deal. It was back in 1308, when it was taken back down,

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.960
 when Edward I, the hammer of the Scots, defeated the Scots. And he had the English throne or

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:57.840
 coronation chair built in order to sit on top of the stone of schoon. And in 1950,

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.520
 four Scottish students managed to break into Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:08.080
 and steal it back. But it sounds hilarious. So, they broke in and according to one of the guys,

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:13.360
 they went in and it weighs 25 stone. So, it is quite a heavy stone. And they picked it up,

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:18.080
 dropped it, it's split in two. And the ringleader, for whom this presumably is the most precious

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.600
 thing he can imagine, said, "I was absolutely delighted when I realized we'd broken it because

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:27.520
 it made it much easier to transport." And then they smuggled it back up. And that's the last time

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:33.200
 the border between Scotland and England has closed is in 1950, they shut the border in order to try

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.640
 and stop it from getting across, which is something. But it does come back now, right? It visits,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:43.040
 it visits the throne. So, yeah, it's now back in Scotland. But if there's a coronation,

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:49.840
 it comes back down. So, one of the students Anna died just last year. He was called Alan Stewart

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:56.240
 and he was alive until last year. Oh, wow, really? Yeah. And it was really exciting. They buried it,

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.120
 actually. They took it to Kent and they just buried it in the ground saying, "Police are going

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:06.320
 to be looking for a stone, so we will hide it." And then the fury died down and he just subtly

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.480
 drove back down to Kent to collect it from where they had hidden it. But when they got there,

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.760
 there was a gypsy encampment right where the stone was. So, he couldn't just dig it up. He just

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.680
 couldn't just march into there. So, he had to sort of negotiate and say, "By the way, can I

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.320
 dig up the stone?" There's two weird things about that. First of all, if you're going to break into

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:31.200
 Westminster Abbey, I think Christmas Day is not their quiet day, is it? You want to go on a Thursday

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:37.120
 when no one's in Westminster Abbey, don't you? That's so weird. How heavy did you say it was?

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.440
 It weighed about 25 stone. How many kilograms is that, do you know?

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.600
 Oh, I don't work. Is it 2.2? 2.2 kilograms in a stone, something like that.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.040
 That's pounds and pounds of kilos. Oh, so it's way more than that.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.520
 Two big men. It's one extremely fat man. It's 160 kilos.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:40:03.280
 Yeah, 158.7. Oh my god. I tried to lift 154 kilo stone when I was in Iceland earlier this year.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:11.520
 What they had is, when you're an Icelandic, let's say Viking, and you wanted to get on a ship,

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:15.520
 they would have all these stones and whichever one you could lift up would tell you which

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.720
 job you were going to have on the boat. So, if you could lift the lightest one,

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.880
 then you could only be like a cock or something. And if you could lift the heaviest one,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:30.400
 then you could be like one of the main rowers. And the heaviest one was 154 kilograms.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:37.920
 And not only could I not lift it, I mean, I couldn't even push it a millimeter from where it was.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:43.120
 It's just so heavy. Well, imagine something four kilos heavier than the stone you couldn't lift,

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.360
 James. That's what they had to lift. Surely, why would you want to be one of the main rowers

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.200
 on a ship when you can get a cushy job in the kitchen by failing to lift a stone? There must

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.040
 have been a lot of big beefy guys saying, "Oh, no, I can't possibly lift that. That's really heavy."

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.760
 I think there's quite a lot of honor in being able to lift them. Because, for instance,

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.920
 when I tried to lift them and I had a whole load of Taurus watching me to see if I could do it,

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:08.400
 I must have it. I didn't feel like throwing it. I feel like I was really going to try my absolute

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.440
 hardest. Well, you would have been useless on this expedition.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:19.440
 I was just looking about the idea of people taking up the throne, people being handed to,

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:27.120
 and Albania actually offered up the throne to someone who was not Albanian.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:32.800
 They offered it up to, no, but close to what I was saying earlier, C. B. Fry, C. B. Fry,

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.840
 who was captain of the England cricket team. So, we almost had an English cricketer as the

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:43.040
 head of Albania years before they even thought to play an international match and set up the

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:50.160
 Norman Wisdom Cup. Why? Have you just typed Albania cricket into Google a thousand times

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:54.160
 for this podcast? Do you know who the youngest monarch in the world is at the moment?

00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:04.080
 You can't guess it. Oh. Because he is the king of an area of Uganda. So, he's not super famous.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:10.080
 He's called King Oyo. He's 28 years old, and he's from Toro, which is a kingdom in Uganda.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:18.160
 But he came to power at the age of just three. Okay. He now rules over 3% of Uganda's population,

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.520
 and at his coronation, he was sat on the throne, playing with a toy car all the way through,

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.040
 kind of fidgeting. And at one stage, when there was a speech by the president,

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.280
 Mussavini, he started crying, jumped off the throne, and ran to his mother's lap.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:39.200
 He controls 3%. He's in charge of 3% of the population of Uganda. So,

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:46.480
 another percent with every age that he goes. Yeah, that's how it works. It's a very weird

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.520
 political system they've got in Uganda, actually. The Queen is so close to having all of the UK.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:59.280
 She's got 90-something percent. He was visited by Nelson Mandela when he was very young,

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:05.040
 and Nelson Mandela had to wait in the VIP tent until he'd finished playing with all of his toys

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:11.440
 and agreed to come out and meet Nelson Mandela. But now, he's a goodwill ambassador for HIV and

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:16.720
 stuff like that. So, he's quite awesome, actually. Cool. I will see now. 28, doesn't he? Yeah.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.080
 And he said that he said the reason that he ran into his mother's lap is because they tried to

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:26.240
 put a lion's skin crown on him, and he was scared of it. And then the next day after his coronation,

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.160
 age three, he had to attend a cabinet meeting.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.960
 Wow, sweet.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:40.080
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.440
 My fact this week is that if an octopus's arm comes off,

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.920
 it will keep picking up food and trying to put it where its mouth used to be.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.040
 Wow. So, I misread this when you sent it around. Yeah, I thought the octopus

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.000
 will keep picking up food, and I was like, "How can it do that? It hasn't got an arm left."

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.360
 But you mean the arm, the dis-attacked, the disembodied arm picks up the food?

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:04.560
 The arm, the dangling modifier. Very badly phrased fact. Had a week to think about it and yet.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.080
 A dangling modifier could be that arm, couldn't it? Yeah, it feels like it.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:13.280
 Yeah, the arm itself will keep picking up food, and it's not the end of the world

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.640
 if an octopus's arm falls off. So, don't worry about that at home. As we've mentioned before,

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.800
 they can regrow their arms. And they've got seven more. We should point that out.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.960
 They've got plenty to go around. And this was discovered in a study where

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:32.480
 there was an octopus's arm was amputated, and they realized for about an hour after they are

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.560
 severed, or more than an hour, then they still operate like a normal arm. So,

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.280
 they'll recoil if they're touched or if something scary is stroking them,

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.800
 and they will pick up food and then drop it in the mouth that doesn't exist. So, presumably,

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.480
 they'll pick up a bit of food and then turn around to see the same bit of food they're behind

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.960
 them picking up again and continuing that comedy routine. You know that kind of thing where you

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:57.120
 have like phantom arm syndrome, where you lose your arm and you kind of think it's there? It's

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.520
 almost the opposite of that, isn't it? The arm has a phantom rest of body syndrome.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:07.760
 So, I really think that two-thirds of their neurons are in their arms,

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:12.720
 and the arms are sort of running independent to the other arms as well. They don't necessarily

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.920
 know what the other arms are doing. But so, does that mean that if I was the octopus,

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.400
 I would just have an arm feeding me whenever it wanted to feed me, as opposed to me?

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.680
 Would I be mid-chat and it's trying to force feed me some fish?

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.920
 It's really interesting. Possibly. Well, they've done a lot. No one really knew this until quite

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.960
 recently, and they've done a study quite very recently where they had like a maze, and when I

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:43.760
 say maze, it was like a tube with two bits going off like a letter Y. And they taught the octopuses

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:48.480
 to always put their hands down one of these tubes, because that's where the food is, and the other

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.600
 one was always empty. And what they found was that when they learned how to do that with one

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.240
 tentacle, and then they put another tentacle in, then that tentacle knew how to do it as well.

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:03.760
 And what that tells us is not that they can't work independently, but that they definitely

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.880
 are able to work as a group as well. So, if you teach your arm to do one thing,

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.800
 the other arm will also know how to do it. So, they're not completely independent.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.400
 They can act independently, but they also have, they can talk to each other. So,

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.240
 they wouldn't just feed themselves without, you know... I'm actually surprised they had to do

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:24.640
 a study into that. I mean, surely, obviously, an octopus's whole body is acting as a whole body?

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:30.880
 No, no, no. Well, not always. So, this is the really weird thing. So, they do... So, they have

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:35.120
 molecules which stops the skin sticking to itself, because obviously, they've got suckers all over

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:41.360
 them. But octopuses are able to pause those molecules if they want to grab another octopus,

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.200
 which they sometimes do. They're able to pause the bit which stops them sticking on to each other,

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:51.760
 right? But that is a glitchy system in an octopus. Sometimes, the off switch doesn't work. And so,

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:57.600
 there is conflict between octopus-central and octopus-arm brain sending different signals about

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.360
 whether or not they can touch another bit of skin. And so, they will sometimes dance around

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.760
 an object for minutes on end while they're working out this kind of laggy computer system

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:09.520
 inside themselves. And they're just... You can't work out what they're doing, and neither can they.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.080
 Very frustrating. So weird.

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.280
 Some researchers say that different arms have different personalities.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:24.160
 But they'll say things like, "So, some arms will be more confident than others, so you'll maybe show

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:28.560
 it a new teddy bear or something. And the front arms are often a little bit more confident than the

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.080
 back arms. So, they'll reach towards it, whereas the back ones will recoil away."

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.200
 That's amazing. That is incredible.

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:40.080
 So, if you're sat at the dinner table with an octopus, and you've got a pissed-off right arm,

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:44.320
 but a really fun party flat-arm, you want to be on that side of the table.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:50.960
 I should say I read this in a magazine called New Issue, which is brilliant. My friend gave it to

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:56.000
 me, and it's the big issue North is releasing this four times a year, and it's a beautiful

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.120
 magazine full of excellent long reads. So, highly recommend.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:05.120
 One thing that's been in the news quite a lot in the last couple of weeks, and when I say news,

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:10.400
 I don't mean, you know, most news. I mean, the kind of news that I read, and that is the octopuses

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:15.840
 that have started punching fish in the heads when you were saying about personalities in different

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:22.960
 arms. And it seems that some octopuses, they will look for fish with other fish. So, the fish are

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:27.760
 trying to find food, and the octopuses are trying to find food, and they all kind of work together.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.360
 But sometimes, if one of the fish doesn't do what the octopus wants to do,

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:37.440
 then he just punches them in the head, and they just swim off. And the guy who wrote this study

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.720
 was called Eduardo Sampaio from the University of Lisbon, and he said that whenever he saw it,

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:47.120
 he laughed out loud and almost choked on his own regulator. And if you see the videos,

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:51.440
 it really is quite funny to see an octopus punching a fish.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:59.040
 And it's sometimes when they want a bit of food, for example, but also it can be

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:03.680
 for no discernible benefit. That's the other thing I said. It might be disciplined to say

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:09.760
 stay in line and keep obeying me, but that's just a theory. It seems to be, they set out of spite,

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:15.760
 which is just gorgeous. It's unbelievable. It's kind of like they're the villain in a movie,

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.680
 and the fish is the stupid henchman who they keep on whacking. It's like the pinky in the brain,

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.960
 almost. Do you know what bit of the human an octopus is most like?

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.720
 As in what small parts of the human the entire octopus is like? Is that right?

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.560
 Yeah, I'll say that.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.800
 Like your hand, because it's got lots of appendages.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:40.240
 No, nearly. Eyeball. Yeah, it's kind of consistency. Yeah, it's actually, Anna, do you want to have

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:47.120
 crack? My mouth? You've been using it. It's, yeah, I mean, you have to see a doctor about the suckers

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:52.320
 in your mouth. But yeah, I'll give you that one. It's your tongue. And the tongue is the most

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:58.160
 like the octopus because they're both muscular hydrostats, i.e. almost every muscle that you've

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.320
 got as a human is attached to a bone. And it's all, you know, you move by the bone of the muscle

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:07.680
 working together. The tongue obviously has no skeletal support. It's just muscle moving itself.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:12.800
 And that's exactly how octopuses move as well. They compress fluid into one section,

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:18.240
 and that creates movement in another section. So you've basically got an octopus in your mouth.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.080
 That's how they squeeze into tiny spaces, right? It's the same way that you can squeeze your tongue

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:26.320
 into a coke bottle and get it stuck there. And an octopus can squeeze

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:32.000
 into a tiny space. I think there's something like if, and now I'm going to work in kilos,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.880
 so James isn't confused, but 120 kilo octopus can squeeze into a pipe, which is about like smaller

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.960
 than an exhaust pipe. So you'll have an octopus the size of a human, the weight of a human,

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.920
 which can somehow squeeze through a tiny pipe. I thought that it actually doesn't even matter

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:50.960
 on the size. It all just depends on size of beak and eyeball, because those are the only solid

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:56.080
 bits of it. Although if you've got enough skin there, fold it up. I think people say it's just

00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:00.800
 dependent on beak, but you do actually have other substance to it that you need to fold up,

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:05.040
 don't you, when you watch them go through. But yeah, it's basically down to beak size.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:12.880
 Do you guys know the artist Hokusai? You do? Yeah. For people at home, he's the one who did

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.920
 the wave that you'll see on lots of, you know, Japanese, right? The Japanese tsunami famous.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.840
 He once did a woodcut of an octopus giving oral sex to a fisherman's wife.

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:32.480
 It's a very famous one. And according to octopus experts, the animal doesn't look like it's enjoying

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:39.760
 it at all. The wife, however. Well, the wife does look like she's enjoying it. I mean,

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:44.160
 only search for this if you're not in work, like none of us is at the moment, but don't search for

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.000
 it if anyone's looking at your laptop. And if you're one of our children listeners. Yeah, exactly.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:53.760
 But the woman does look like she's enjoying herself. But according to this was an article

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:59.840
 by Diane Kelly writing in Gizmodo, she says that the northern Pacific giant octopus, which is what

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:06.000
 this is, when it's amorous, when it's feeling horny, it will change its skin and it will become a

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.920
 slightly different pattern. It'll have white spots on a red background. And this, this octopus

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:17.680
 doesn't have that at all. And also that octopus always mates with mating arm. I think we've said

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:23.280
 before that one of the arms is used for mating. But in this painting, their mating arm is actually

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:28.880
 hidden right behind the octopus. So the octopus does not look like he's enjoying it at all. One

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:34.960
 little bit more. He looks like he's devouring the woman. Are you saying that Hokusai didn't do

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:40.000
 his research or that just he's maybe he did, but he's trying to depict something different to

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.520
 what we think it's, it's called even darker than what you would have thought. I don't know,

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:50.160
 Hokusai, I kind of like your earlier stuff where there was just a wave really good. I think this

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.240
 is a bit of a it's called something like, I can't remember it's called something like the dream of

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:59.840
 the fisherman's wife or something like that. So maybe it's the fisherman's wife's what she imagines

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.960
 and she doesn't necessarily imagine everything to be completely, you know, biologically correct.

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:10.480
 Hokusai can't blame the fisherman's wife for not knowing about octopus morphology. No way.

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:16.800
 Was this the thing, James, that it was erotica involving sea creatures?

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:22.960
 There is a subculture, I believe, online. I didn't search for this when I was doing my research,

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:28.640
 but my understanding is that there, I don't know of anything earlier than this Hokusai painting.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.560
 A woodcut, sorry.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:36.800
 Dan, do you have a fact about Albanian cricket in this section? I'm just, I've been waiting for

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.680
 it for ages and I just want to know. I'm holding on to it. When the time is right, I will lob it in.

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:47.760
 Just while we're talking about sort of touching octopuses in a sort of nice way,

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:55.280
 that's another thing that they share with humans. They get very, very huggy when they're high on MDMA,

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.840
 which scientists have discovered recently. So they discovered that octopuses, when they did

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:05.680
 a full genetic, what's it called, when they map the genes of an octopus. Yeah, and they found that

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:11.200
 there was a serotonin thing that was very similar to humans. They were very surprised by that and

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.680
 they thought, well, surely it doesn't respond because when we do MDMA and any kind of drug,

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:21.760
 the serotonin levels go up and down and so on. They tried it on an octopus and they acted exactly

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.800
 in the sort of lovey way that we might do if we were on drugs and they didn't expect that because

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:32.080
 when we have octopuses in a lab, they often have to put them in different tanks because they're

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:36.080
 very vicious. They're quite, they like their isolation and so they'll often eat each other,

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.000
 kill each other if they're in the same tank, but then they discovered once they were on drugs,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.640
 they started hanging out with each other and hugging each other and you know, peace and love,

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:48.800
 man. Yeah, so it was a bit very boring for the researchers, that experiment, because they also

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:54.000
 were very tedious to talk to, weren't they? Six hours straight, just droning on about nothing.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.960
 Guys, I've got one fact about severed limbs, which this is about, right? Sort of severed limbs,

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:06.240
 octopus arms, but except this is a human thing. This is a story from 2005. And it's that an American

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:10.960
 man called Clarence Stowers, he found a severed finger in his tub of ice cream, right, that he'd

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:16.000
 just been served, but then he refused to give it back to an injured employee so it could be

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.880
 reattached to the employee because he wanted it as evidence in legal action against the store.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:25.680
 And what happened was, he found a chewy object in his ice cream, he thought it was an ingredient,

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:30.000
 he realised it was a finger. The employee had just lost his finger in a machine used to beat

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.960
 the ice cream. So his colleagues were rushing to help the man who'd lost a finger, but one of the

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:40.080
 guys at the ice cream parlor hadn't noticed and unknowingly served the finger up to Mr. Stowers.

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:46.880
 I didn't think we even sold raspberry ripple, but fine. And then a week later, he repented and he

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:50.160
 said, all right, you can have the finger back, which is obviously completely pointless by that

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:56.080
 stage. Oh my God. The employee was pointless as well, wasn't he? There was a bunch of

00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:05.840
 pointing going on anyway. Can you identify the man who ate your finger? No. Okay, that's it. That

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.920
 is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

 Otherwise, we'll see you again next week for another episode. Goodbye.

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:50.800
 Hi, everyone. Just a very quick coda to today's show, if I may, where I'd like to clarify one of

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:56.880
 the facts. So you might remember it was the study which I mentioned where autistic children were

00:56:56.880 --> 00:57:02.240
 put on rocking chairs and they didn't sink up their rocking. Well, that study does exist,

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:08.160
 and it did happen. All of that's true, but what is very, very much not true is the fact that autistic

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:13.200
 people don't feel empathy at all. That is not true. That is not a fact, and there's a very strong

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:18.160
 implication made by myself that that is true. So I just want to make it really clear it is not

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:23.280
 true that autistic people don't feel empathy. Now, a lot of people used to think that was true,

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.760
 but there was a whole load of work done in the last few years that suggests what's happening is

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:32.880
 very much a two-way street. So what we think's happening is that the autistic child does feel

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:38.320
 empathy, but they display it in a way that the non-autistic person can't understand, and,

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:43.600
 importantly, vice versa. So it's called the double empathy problem. And if you think about it, it

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:48.080
 makes quite a lot of sense, because apart from anything else, communication is always a two-way

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:53.200
 thing, isn't it? And neither person's perspective is more valid than the other person's. It's just

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:58.560
 some people experience the world in a slightly different way. One other probably much more

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:03.520
 obvious problem with what I said is that you can't possibly say anything is true of all autistic

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:09.280
 people, because, as we probably most of us know, autism is a spectrum condition, which means it

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:14.080
 affects different people in different ways. So that probably should have been a bit of a red flag

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:19.360
 when I said that fact in the first place. Anyway, just like to apologize for not making all that

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.320
 clear in the podcast itself. As you can imagine, I spent quite a lot of time this weekend reading up

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:30.160
 about all the most recent theories on autism. But having said that, since doing loads of research

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:34.720
 is not exactly penance for me, it's what I absolutely love doing. I've also made a small

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:39.920
 donation to the National Autistic Society, who as well as helping families are involved in loads

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:44.720
 of the groundbreaking research that I've been reading this weekend. So I hope that does clear

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:48.640
 things up a little bit. And if it doesn't, then there's a whole load of research out there that

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:53.760
 you can read yourself. And a good place to start is at autism.org.uk.
