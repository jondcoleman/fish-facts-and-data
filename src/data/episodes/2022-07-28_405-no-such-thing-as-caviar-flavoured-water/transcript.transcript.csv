00:00:14,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:19,00:00:25,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Canterbury!
00:00:25,00:00:31,[applause]
00:00:31,00:00:38,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin,"
00:00:38,00:00:43,"and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:43,00:00:50,"and in no particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:50,00:00:57,"My fact is that, if it's served carefully enough, nobody can tell the difference between pate and dog food."
00:00:57,00:01:00,You've all been wasting your money all these years.
00:01:00,00:01:06,"I'm not coming to your restaurant. How do you serve it if, what's the difference?"
00:01:06,00:01:10,"Well, this was a study done by the American Association of Wine Economists in 2009,"
00:01:10,00:01:16,who I guess just got bored of studying wine and sort of branched out into wine-affiliated foods like pate.
00:01:16,00:01:19,"And they basically, they were trying to work out if people could tell the difference."
00:01:19,00:01:26,"So, the researchers, they blended up some dog food, that's what they did, until it looked like liver mousse, basically."
00:01:26,00:01:32,"And then they had about, I think, 18 subjects and they challenged them to work out which was dog food and which was not."
00:01:32,00:01:39,"And about one person in six guessed dog food, but there were six samples."
00:01:39,00:01:42,"So, there is no better than chance, effectively, that people can tell."
00:01:42,00:01:46,"I should say, you're being a bit unfair, Andy. They also garnished it with parsley."
00:01:46,00:01:50,Sorry. Sorry. Everything had parsley on.
00:01:50,00:01:56,"So, the really weird thing about this is that people knew it was horrible, but they just didn't know it wasn't pate."
00:01:56,00:02:01,"They knew that one of the things was dog food, but 72% of the people who tasted it said,"
00:02:01,00:02:04,"""Well, that is the worst thing in this whole array of samples."""
00:02:04,00:02:08,"But most of them, five and six, did not say that the dog food."
00:02:08,00:02:12,"So, presumably, they thought, ""This is disgusting, but that can't possibly..."""
00:02:12,00:02:14,Do they think dog food tastes better than it does?
00:02:14,00:02:18,"I think, yeah, I think they did. And I think the researchers had told them,"
00:02:18,00:02:20,"""Don't worry, we're not going to feed you something horrible."""
00:02:20,00:02:23,"And they tasted that and they said, ""Well, that is horrible, so it can't be the dog food."""
00:02:23,00:02:24,"So, should we be eating dog food?"
00:02:24,00:02:26,No. No. Okay.
00:02:26,00:02:28,Why not? Why not?
00:02:28,00:02:31,"Sounds like we think it's horrible. We just don't think it's dog food, but we still don't enjoy it."
00:02:31,00:02:32,But I like pate.
00:02:32,00:02:35,It tastes worse. 70% of people think it tastes worse.
00:02:35,00:02:38,The worst out of all the pates they were given.
00:02:38,00:02:41,"It still tastes like a bad pate, which I think I'd still like."
00:02:41,00:02:46,"So, okay. To be honest, it wasn't the worst tasting thing there."
00:02:46,00:02:50,"That was the liver worst. It was probably the worst tasting because they had liver worst,"
00:02:50,00:02:53,"duck liver mousse, pork liver pate and spam."
00:02:53,00:02:55,"Oh, God!"
00:02:55,00:02:59,"And the liver worst, I think, was the one that they most often thought was pet food, right?"
00:02:59,00:02:59,Yeah.
00:02:59,00:03:00,Pizarre.
00:03:00,00:03:07,"And turns out, a journalist did a very unscientific study just asking her friends to feed a bunch of stuff to their dogs."
00:03:07,00:03:11,And dogs also prefer the taste of actual pate to dog food.
00:03:11,00:03:16,"Unsurprisingly, as anyone who has a dog knows, they always want to eat human food more than they want to eat dog food."
00:03:16,00:03:18,"But that's for variety, right?"
00:03:18,00:03:21,"That's why I think if I had dog food, I'd be like, ""Man, that feels really nice."""
00:03:21,00:03:23,"But, you know, if I had it every night, I'd beâ€¦"
00:03:23,00:03:25,"There's nothing to stop you from having dog food, though."
00:03:25,00:03:31,"And if you come down to my new restaurant, Fido's, you can have it every night."
00:03:31,00:03:36,"I wonder, though, if it's the same with dogs, that they're sort of, you know,"
00:03:36,00:03:39,whether or not they're tricked into thinking they think something is tasty.
00:03:39,00:03:42,"For example, there's an adventure he was called Charleston Ellis."
00:03:42,00:03:50,"He's the guy who created a dog biscuit that was shaped like a bone, rather than it just being a biscuit."
00:03:50,00:03:55,"And when he shaped it into a bone, suddenly his dog that he was testing it on really liked it."
00:03:55,00:04:00,"And there's this quote where he says that he says, ""To this day,"" and this is in 1936,"
00:04:00,00:04:04,"""I cannot tell whether my dog is interested in the bone-shaped biscuit because it fools him as such."""
00:04:04,00:04:09,"He's like, ""Ah, it's a bone."" Or, ""Whether after my shaping the biscuit in an effort to cater to his taste,"
00:04:09,00:04:15,"he feels duty-bound to fool his master by simulating an interest in it."""
00:04:15,00:04:17,"Yeah, possible."
00:04:17,00:04:20,Very polite dog he's got there.
00:04:20,00:04:22,"What you're saying about dogs preferring human food is interesting,"
00:04:22,00:04:24,"because I don't have a dog, and I didn't know that."
00:04:24,00:04:31,But I thought that the whole point of dog food was that you had to make it taste disgusting enough for dogs to like.
00:04:31,00:04:32,"That's what they say, isn't it?"
00:04:32,00:04:35,And this is particularly what they do with treats.
00:04:35,00:04:41,"Dog treats is they add stuff like, is it cadaverine and putrescine?"
00:04:41,00:04:45,So it's things that smell like rotting corpses and rotting food to us.
00:04:45,00:04:48,Talk about it does exactly what it says on the tin.
00:04:48,00:04:50,"But that's apparently what they like. This is what they claim,"
00:04:50,00:04:55,"is that the more repulsive it smells to us, the more delicious it is to pets."
00:04:55,00:04:57,And so that's what they add to...
00:04:57,00:05:03,And I think we might have said before on the show that sometimes you get humans who taste the dog food.
00:05:03,00:05:08,But I read that the reason they do that is more because you don't want the humans to be disgusted
00:05:08,00:05:12,"when they're feeding their dogs, otherwise they won't buy that kind of dog food."
00:05:12,00:05:14,It's not about taste being good for humans.
00:05:14,00:05:17,It's about us not being disgusted when we put it in a bowl.
00:05:17,00:05:20,"That's interesting, because I was reading a dog food manufacturer who was saying"
00:05:20,00:05:24,the hardest thing about it is to make something that's not repulsive to humans.
00:05:24,00:05:28,"Because what dogs like is like feces, roadkill, vomit."
00:05:28,00:05:31,"I probably won't have the starter, I mean."
00:05:31,00:05:37,"And if you serve something that's a combination of feces, roadkill and vomit,"
00:05:37,00:05:39,the human owners do tend to bulk at it.
00:05:39,00:05:40,Yes.
00:05:40,00:05:41,That gets challenged.
00:05:41,00:05:43,"Have you guys heard the phrase ""eating your own dog food""?"
00:05:43,00:05:44,No.
00:05:44,00:05:47,So this is not a phrase I've heard. I think it's an American thing.
00:05:47,00:05:48,You can imagine what it means though.
00:05:48,00:05:50,Trying something...
00:05:50,00:05:51,It's from the business world.
00:05:51,00:05:52,It's...
00:05:52,00:05:54,"Oh, let's say you're Microsoft."
00:05:54,00:05:54,Yes.
00:05:54,00:05:57,"You want people who work at Microsoft to be using Microsoft products, you know."
00:05:57,00:05:57,Okay.
00:05:57,00:06:01,"So you want, you know, the proof of the pudding is in the..."
00:06:01,00:06:04,Are you using another better metaphor to explain your shittier metaphor?
00:06:04,00:06:06,"Yeah, I think I was."
00:06:06,00:06:09,"But yeah, you should be comfortable trying your own product"
00:06:09,00:06:13,"and you should believe in it enough that you can honestly recommend it to other people, you know,"
00:06:13,00:06:14,"and you should be eating your own dog food, anyway."
00:06:14,00:06:17,"But that doesn't make any sense, because you're not recommending it to other people."
00:06:17,00:06:18,You're recommending it to dogs.
00:06:18,00:06:22,It would make sense if Bill Gates was trying to market computers to cats.
00:06:22,00:06:24,But he's not.
00:06:24,00:06:25,Okay.
00:06:25,00:06:26,Okay.
00:06:26,00:06:31,"All right, now we've all acknowledged the structural flaws in the metaphor."
00:06:31,00:06:35,"There was a man called Mitch Felderhoff who actually did eat his own dog food last year,"
00:06:35,00:06:39,"because he lives in Texas and he owns a dog food firm,"
00:06:39,00:06:40,and he did it for a month.
00:06:40,00:06:42,Only eight products that his firm made.
00:06:42,00:06:43,Cool.
00:06:43,00:06:47,"He got approval from his doctor and his wife crucially before he started,"
00:06:47,00:06:49,because of what I imagine his breath was like.
00:06:49,00:06:50,"And he did say,"
00:06:50,00:06:54,"""One of the things I did that was key is that I did do some intermittent fasting,"
00:06:54,00:06:57,"i.e. some meals, I just didn't need anything at all."""
00:06:57,00:07:02,There was a woman in America called Dorothy Hunter who did the same thing in 2014.
00:07:02,00:07:05,"She worked for a company called The Honest Kitchen,"
00:07:05,00:07:08,"and for a month, again, she ate nothing but dog food."
00:07:08,00:07:12,"She said that she didn't add any seasoning, but she heard that hot sauce is good."
00:07:12,00:07:15,"Who she heard that from, and maybe your name, I'm not sure."
00:07:15,00:07:18,"But she said the main problem is that humans are social eaters,"
00:07:18,00:07:22,"and socially, this has been very hard."
00:07:22,00:07:24,So I can imagine her going at a dinner party for her friends
00:07:24,00:07:27,and bringing a pedigree chum with her and whatever.
00:07:27,00:07:30,They just put it on the floor in the corner.
00:07:30,00:07:33,"The word pate, originally meant pet food."
00:07:33,00:07:34,Did it?
00:07:34,00:07:34,Yeah.
00:07:34,00:07:38,"It appeared in the 18th century, I think, in France."
00:07:38,00:07:39,"It had its first use, it had a doubly."
00:07:39,00:07:42,Its first use was specifically about chicken food.
00:07:42,00:07:44,"And when I was looking through sources that refer to pate,"
00:07:44,00:07:46,"it goes right up until the end of the 19th century,"
00:07:46,00:07:47,pate refers to chicken food.
00:07:47,00:07:51,And then it broadened to mean kind of breadcrumbs and bits of meat
00:07:51,00:07:52,that you'd give to any pet.
00:07:52,00:07:54,And then somehow it became pate.
00:07:54,00:07:55,Wow.
00:07:55,00:07:56,Yeah.
00:07:56,00:07:58,No wonder they couldn't tell the difference.
00:07:58,00:08:01,Maybe they're from the 15th century or whatever.
00:08:01,00:08:03,That's what it was.
00:08:03,00:08:07,"You know that if they're given the choice, dogs will not give humans treats."
00:08:07,00:08:09,Oh.
00:08:09,00:08:10,What do you mean?
00:08:10,00:08:13,"As in, researchers trained 37 dogs to press a button"
00:08:13,00:08:14,which would give them a treat.
00:08:14,00:08:15,Yeah.
00:08:15,00:08:17,"Okay, so the dogs were well familiar with the fact"
00:08:17,00:08:20,"that pressing this button gives a treat, provides a treat."
00:08:20,00:08:23,And then the button was placed in another room.
00:08:23,00:08:26,"Oh, the humans were placed next door with the button"
00:08:26,00:08:27,and the dogs would beg.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"The dogs would beg, beg, beg, please press this button"
00:08:29,00:08:30,so I get a treat falling into my room.
00:08:30,00:08:31,Yeah.
00:08:31,00:08:33,"Anyway, the situation was then reversed"
00:08:33,00:08:35,and the button was put into the room with the dog.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"And no matter what the humans did, the dogs did not care."
00:08:38,00:08:41,They pressed the button no greater for the people
00:08:41,00:08:42,who had given them treats.
00:08:42,00:08:43,They're for the people who hadn't given them treats.
00:08:43,00:08:45,What a great experiment.
00:08:45,00:08:47,Do you think they'd take us for walks if we needed it?
00:08:47,00:08:48,Sounds like no.
00:08:48,00:08:49,Sounds like no.
00:08:49,00:08:50,They're not doing anything.
00:08:50,00:08:51,"Well, no, but that's different"
00:08:51,00:08:55,because then we'd be shitting all over their furniture and that's...
00:08:55,00:08:57,Are they doing this because they're mean or stupid?
00:08:57,00:08:58,Do they know?
00:08:58,00:08:59,I think.
00:08:59,00:09:00,I think it's stupid.
00:09:00,00:09:00,Do you think?
00:09:00,00:09:03,Because I think my cat would not just not press the button
00:09:03,00:09:09,but would also probably unplug it so no one else can get a treat.
00:09:09,00:09:12,Do dogs and cats can taste water?
00:09:12,00:09:14,"Yeah, I can taste water."
00:09:14,00:09:15,You can't?
00:09:15,00:09:15,"Yes, I can."
00:09:15,00:09:18,"Only if you put black currants in it, Dan."
00:09:18,00:09:19,"Yeah, you can taste squash."
00:09:19,00:09:21,"No, you can taste from a tap."
00:09:21,00:09:24,"It's sort of, I guess that's probably like the metals and stuff."
00:09:24,00:09:25,You basically can't.
00:09:25,00:09:27,"I mean, there are some studies that say water has a bit of a sour taste,"
00:09:27,00:09:31,"but essentially humans don't have specific taste receptors for water,"
00:09:31,00:09:34,which is why it's so bland and crap and we have to make squash.
00:09:34,00:09:37,"Whereas dogs and cats, the reason you don't get a dog and cat squash"
00:09:37,00:09:40,is that they've got specific receptors on the tip of their tongue.
00:09:40,00:09:42,Those are discovered in the 1950s.
00:09:42,00:09:44,"They found it first on frogs and then thought,"
00:09:44,00:09:46,"oh, I wonder what else can taste water?"
00:09:46,00:09:50,"And when you drop water onto the tongues of like sedated cats and dogs,"
00:09:50,00:09:52,it stimulates all these receptors.
00:09:52,00:09:53,I don't suppose we know what it tastes like.
00:09:53,00:09:54,"So they're just watery, I guess."
00:09:54,00:09:56,They say it tastes like caviar.
00:09:56,00:09:57,"Yeah, really?"
00:09:57,00:10:01,"No, they don't know."
00:10:01,00:10:07,Fallen for the old classic Anna Prank.
00:10:07,00:10:08,They refuse to tell us.
00:10:08,00:10:12,I can't believe I fell right in the trap.
00:10:12,00:10:16,I was out with my in-laws on a walk recently and they have a dog called Benji
00:10:16,00:10:20,and Benji started licking really disgusting puddle.
00:10:20,00:10:25,"And like, you know, and I was like, Benji."
00:10:25,00:10:26,"And I said that and they said, no, it's fine."
00:10:26,00:10:28,And I haven't had a dog for years.
00:10:28,00:10:30,"Why, what does that taste like to them?"
00:10:30,00:10:31,And why can they survive?
00:10:31,00:10:32,Because that would.
00:10:32,00:10:36,"Well, it might have feces and roadkill in which case it's chef's kiss."
00:10:36,00:10:38,"That's their ribina, is it?"
00:10:38,00:10:40,They do tend to prefer a puddle.
00:10:40,00:10:43,"And our dog loves to whee in a puddle at the same time as drinking from it,"
00:10:43,00:10:46,which I think is a nice touch.
00:10:46,00:10:52,"I feel like it's almost a perpetual motion machine, isn't it?"
00:10:52,00:10:54,We could use it to power something.
00:10:54,00:10:55,It's renewable energy.
00:10:55,00:10:57,It is time for fact number two.
00:10:57,00:10:58,And that is my fact.
00:10:58,00:11:01,"My fact this week is that during World War Two,"
00:11:01,00:11:07,Heinz developed a self-heating can of soup to work it.
00:11:07,00:11:09,It had to be lit like a bomb.
00:11:09,00:11:15,"Unfortunately, it very often exploded like one too."
00:11:15,00:11:17,So this was a pretty remarkable thing.
00:11:17,00:11:20,"During the war efforts, when they were going out,"
00:11:20,00:11:23,there was this big problem that they had terrible food
00:11:23,00:11:24,and they wanted to have better food.
00:11:24,00:11:27,And to cook food was kind of a giveaway
00:11:27,00:11:29,because you would have to start fires and so on.
00:11:29,00:11:31,And it would just be a giveaway to where an army might be.
00:11:31,00:11:35,"So Heinz along with the army, they developed this self-heating can"
00:11:35,00:11:39,which effectively looked like a can that had a wick sticking out.
00:11:39,00:11:40,So like a bomb.
00:11:40,00:11:44,"And soldiers were encouraged to light it using cigarette, lit cigarettes."
00:11:44,00:11:47,And it would take about four minutes to heat the can.
00:11:47,00:11:50,"But before you lit it, you were meant to puncture holes into it."
00:11:50,00:11:53,"And if you punctured the holes in the wrong way, which often happened,"
00:11:53,00:11:58,the can would then heat up in such a way that it would lead to an explosion.
00:11:58,00:12:00,"If you'd be covered in tomato soup, everyone would be like,"
00:12:00,00:12:02,"""It's blood! He's hit by a bomb!"""
00:12:02,00:12:05,It was a very confusing time.
00:12:05,00:12:07,And this kind of often happened.
00:12:07,00:12:09,"In some cases, it wasn't even to do with the puncturing."
00:12:09,00:12:11,Just there was faulty cans and so on.
00:12:11,00:12:16,So there were people talking about cans exploding at Normandy.
00:12:16,00:12:19,"There was tomato soup everywhere, you know, and getting scolded."
00:12:19,00:12:23,You would feel so embarrassed if you were injured on Normandy beaches
00:12:23,00:12:27,by a malfunctioning tin of soup.
00:12:27,00:12:31,As you collected your military cross.
00:12:31,00:12:35,What was it for again? Just getting into it at Normandy.
00:12:35,00:12:38,There was one account where they were just trying these out.
00:12:38,00:12:39,I think this was in 1944.
00:12:39,00:12:42,There was a fertility of ships off the South Coast of Britain.
00:12:42,00:12:44,And it was the first time they'd seen these.
00:12:44,00:12:48,And I think it seems like you're supposed to put holes in the top of the can.
00:12:48,00:12:50,And someone put them in the sides.
00:12:50,00:12:52,And then the can was at head height.
00:12:52,00:12:56,"And it sprayed directly into his ears, apparently."
00:12:56,00:13:00,And he got very badly scolded is because it was it was heated by a heating element inside the can.
00:13:00,00:13:05,It was so it got very hot and the can itself got extremely hot.
00:13:05,00:13:06,It was health and safety nightmare.
00:13:06,00:13:13,"Yeah, they often I mean, it's what they said about the Second World War in Toto."
00:13:13,00:13:15,They got very hot and some soldiers.
00:13:15,00:13:19,"I don't know if this was after they'd used the they poured the soup out,"
00:13:19,00:13:24,but they would use the cans effectively as a hot water bottle in the colder places that they were at.
00:13:24,00:13:27,Because they were just they got so hot you had to handle them with a cloth.
00:13:27,00:13:31,"And so, yeah, and they used to attach them onto the side of bombs, right?"
00:13:31,00:13:34,And that's why we got the term souped up weapons.
00:13:34,00:13:38,"Yeah, no, you're not going to fall for that one like I felt the cover up."
00:13:38,00:13:43,"I was so close, but because of what she did to you earlier was a bit more on edge."
00:13:43,00:13:50,The self-heating can was invented in 1879 by a guy called Yevgeny Fyodorov from Russia.
00:13:50,00:13:54,His had quick lime in it and water and you would twist the bottom
00:13:54,00:13:56,and the two things would mix and they would warm up.
00:13:56,00:13:58,"Unfortunately, it didn't really warm them up very much."
00:13:58,00:14:02,"So you just you had this stew, but it was kind of a lukewarm stew."
00:14:02,00:14:07,"And he was also the first person that I could find who made a plane in Russia, Fyodorov."
00:14:07,00:14:09,"So yeah, he's a proper engineer."
00:14:09,00:14:14,"That's a big leap up, isn't it? Self-heating soup can one day, plane the next."
00:14:14,00:14:18,"Yeah, but it was it was soup cans that helped it lift into the no, it wasn't."
00:14:18,00:14:22,"It was it wasn't self-propelling, it would tie to the back of a car or a carriage."
00:14:22,00:14:25,And the carriage would drive along and he would be lifted up by it.
00:14:25,00:14:27,Cool. That's really cool.
00:14:27,00:14:29,"See, that's more self-heating."
00:14:29,00:14:32,"The Heinz ones were a bit cheaty because you did apply the cigarette, didn't you?"
00:14:32,00:14:34,"Oh, yeah. But that's more self-heating."
00:14:34,00:14:39,And I did read another account of someone who had a self-heating can in World War Two in Germany.
00:14:39,00:14:42,And they said that you pulled a flap and that ignited an element.
00:14:42,00:14:43,So like flint or something.
00:14:43,00:14:46,So it seems like you didn't need a source of flame.
00:14:46,00:14:50,"And in fact, now you you'd use the same thing that this this Russian guy used"
00:14:50,00:14:55,"because there's now something called hot can, which I really want to buy some of these."
00:14:55,00:14:57,They have they do the same thing.
00:14:57,00:15:02,They put limestone and water in the space between the inner packet and the outer packet.
00:15:02,00:15:08,And the way you heat it up is you do it comes with a little spike with a thing to come with your can of soup.
00:15:08,00:15:10,But it comes with a spike and you pierce the water.
00:15:10,00:15:15,So it mixes with the limestone and it's this reaction like an exothermic reaction.
00:15:15,00:15:17,"And in eight minutes, you've got boiling hot soup."
00:15:17,00:15:18,That's cool. That's awesome.
00:15:18,00:15:20,Get it from Harvey Nichols. Four pounds of can.
00:15:20,00:15:24,I don't believe you. I don't believe a word you say anymore.
00:15:24,00:15:28,But that's nice that it's sort of upmarket store like Harvey Nichols.
00:15:28,00:15:32,"Because I don't know if we've said before, I think we may have done the first shop to sell baked beans in the UK."
00:15:32,00:15:35,Heinz baked beans was Fornemann Mason.
00:15:35,00:15:36,Right.
00:15:36,00:15:40,"Yeah, it was an extremely luxurious product back in the day."
00:15:40,00:15:43,I guess because it was imported from from America.
00:15:43,00:15:45,Yeah. That was it. Yeah.
00:15:45,00:15:47,"It was Henry Heinz who came up with it, who was known as the Pickle King."
00:15:47,00:15:51,And he started growing pickles at the age of eight and selling them.
00:15:51,00:15:53,"Yeah, he was an incredible..."
00:15:53,00:15:55,"Was he growing like because pickles don't grow, right?"
00:15:55,00:15:57,You have to take a vegetable and you have to pickle it.
00:15:57,00:15:58,Was he like growing the...
00:15:58,00:16:00,"Yeah, that's a good point, actually."
00:16:00,00:16:01,Yeah.
00:16:01,00:16:02,Yeah.
00:16:02,00:16:05,Do you know that he's related to Donald Trump?
00:16:05,00:16:06,Is he?
00:16:06,00:16:09,"Yeah, yeah, the Heinz family and the Trump families are related."
00:16:09,00:16:12,That's how he's so orange is the baked bean.
00:16:12,00:16:15,Just raw baked beans on his face.
00:16:15,00:16:17,"What's the connection, do you know?"
00:16:17,00:16:21,"Yeah, it's a place called Kallstadt, which is in Germany."
00:16:21,00:16:23,And both the families came from there.
00:16:23,00:16:26,"Henry Heinz was the second cousin to Frederick Trump,"
00:16:26,00:16:28,who was the grandfather of Donald Trump.
00:16:28,00:16:29,Right.
00:16:29,00:16:34,"And if you go to this town, they are much happier with the Heinz connection"
00:16:34,00:16:36,than they are with the Trump connection.
00:16:36,00:16:40,Partly because the Heinz family recently provided a major donation
00:16:40,00:16:43,"for the renovation of the local organ,"
00:16:43,00:16:45,whereas Donald Trump did not contribute to this project.
00:16:45,00:16:47,Right.
00:16:47,00:16:49,"Well, there's another American political connection"
00:16:49,00:16:52,"in that the great, great, great granddaughter,"
00:16:52,00:16:55,"something in that territory of Heinz,"
00:16:55,00:16:58,"is married to John Kerry when he was running and still is married,"
00:16:58,00:17:00,but when he was running for presidency.
00:17:00,00:17:01,"And so he didn't get the presidency,"
00:17:01,00:17:04,"but he got to fall back on those baked bean billions,"
00:17:04,00:17:05,which is millions.
00:17:05,00:17:06,Good consolation.
00:17:06,00:17:08,"Yeah, she was Republican, wasn't she?"
00:17:08,00:17:09,Theresa.
00:17:09,00:17:10,"Was she, right?"
00:17:10,00:17:13,"And she remained Republican until he said,"
00:17:13,00:17:16,"""I'm actually going to run president on the Democrat label."
00:17:16,00:17:18,"Would you mind switching your allegiance?"""
00:17:18,00:17:20,"And then in 2004, she reluctantly was like,"
00:17:20,00:17:21,"""Okay, I'll become a Democrat."""
00:17:21,00:17:22,Wow.
00:17:22,00:17:25,It's a different variety of me for this presidential campaign.
00:17:25,00:17:29,"Well, there are 57 varieties, right?"
00:17:29,00:17:30,Because Heinz's 57 varieties.
00:17:30,00:17:33,"Yeah, that's why I made the joke about the 57 varieties."
00:17:33,00:17:36,"We should quickly say, because people are screaming at home"
00:17:36,00:17:38,that there aren't 57 varieties.
00:17:38,00:17:39,It's just a marxing thing.
00:17:39,00:17:41,"Yeah, it was clever, right?"
00:17:41,00:17:42,"There were about 6,000?"
00:17:42,00:17:44,"No, it was more..."
00:17:44,00:17:45,"No, there were lots."
00:17:45,00:17:46,I think there were a few thousand.
00:17:46,00:17:47,"At the time, there was..."
00:17:47,00:17:49,"Oh, at the time there were already over 60."
00:17:49,00:17:50,Yeah.
00:17:50,00:17:53,"What it was was, it was the number five and seven."
00:17:53,00:17:55,I think him and his wife had a favorite number.
00:17:55,00:17:57,"I think his was five, his wife was seven, or vice versa."
00:17:57,00:17:59,And that's the only reason.
00:17:59,00:18:01,"And he'd seen another product, sort of."
00:18:01,00:18:05,"It was like, you know, 60 different kinds of footwear,"
00:18:05,00:18:06,"you know, for one company."
00:18:06,00:18:07,"And he thought, ""That's very clever."""
00:18:07,00:18:08,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:08,00:18:09,"And now, if you go on the website, they're like,"
00:18:09,00:18:12,"""Oh, it's ridiculous. Of course, we have more than 57."
00:18:12,00:18:13,"""It's just a random number."
00:18:13,00:18:16,"""We actually have more than 5,700."""
00:18:16,00:18:19,"So, again, they've taken that random number."
00:18:19,00:18:20,They can't get away from it.
00:18:20,00:18:24,"He did experiment with 59 and 51 first,"
00:18:24,00:18:25,which makes me wonder if nine and one
00:18:25,00:18:27,were the favorite numbers of his mistresses.
00:18:27,00:18:28,If...
00:18:28,00:18:29,"Oh, wow."
00:18:29,00:18:31,He finally ends up on 57.
00:18:31,00:18:33,"So I looked up Heinz on YouGov, the website,"
00:18:33,00:18:35,because they have a lot of interesting data.
00:18:35,00:18:40,Heinz is the brand most liked by women in the UK.
00:18:40,00:18:41,Okay.
00:18:41,00:18:42,"It's one, the sort of..."
00:18:42,00:18:43,Did they...
00:18:43,00:18:45,"No, I was going to say, did they make vibrators?"
00:18:45,00:18:48,I don't know why that's COVID to my head.
00:18:48,00:18:49,"It's not one of the 6,000."
00:18:49,00:18:50,"That's a messy night on your own, isn't it?"
00:18:50,00:18:52,Last couple of years...
00:18:52,00:18:57,Traumatizing thing for your husband to walk in on
00:18:57,00:19:00,at the end of the night.
00:19:00,00:19:03,I was just trying to shake the ketchup to get it out.
00:19:03,00:19:06,"Oh, my God."
00:19:06,00:19:08,Is the 10th most popular thing in the UK?
00:19:08,00:19:09,"Is it, really?"
00:19:09,00:19:10,Or is...
00:19:10,00:19:12,Does that not say to you that people just don't have
00:19:12,00:19:15,much of an imagination when asked what's the best thing?
00:19:15,00:19:16,"No, but guess what's number one?"
00:19:16,00:19:19,Number one of all the things in the UK.
00:19:19,00:19:20,Is it a product?
00:19:20,00:19:21,I'm not saying anything.
00:19:21,00:19:22,Is it Canterbury Cathedral?
00:19:22,00:19:25,It's not playing to the local audience.
00:19:25,00:19:26,It's Canterbury Cathedral.
00:19:26,00:19:28,"Not even top thousand, I'm afraid."
00:19:28,00:19:29,Oh.
00:19:29,00:19:30,I'll give us a clue.
00:19:30,00:19:31,It's an obvious one.
00:19:31,00:19:32,A glove.
00:19:32,00:19:33,A queen?
00:19:33,00:19:34,Like Prince Philip?
00:19:34,00:19:35,"Like the queen, but not..."
00:19:35,00:19:36,Buckingham Palace.
00:19:36,00:19:37,"No, Prince Andrew."
00:19:37,00:19:38,David Assembra.
00:19:38,00:19:39,David Assembra.
00:19:39,00:19:41,David Assembra is the most popular thing in the UK.
00:19:41,00:19:43,"Then there are a load of charities, you know,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,"British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research."
00:19:45,00:19:48,"Number seven, Tom Hanks."
00:19:48,00:19:49,Yeah.
00:19:49,00:19:50,"Number eight, Heinz."
00:19:50,00:19:51,"Number 10, Lego."
00:19:51,00:19:53,"11, Google Maps."
00:19:53,00:19:55,This is an interesting one.
00:19:55,00:19:56,"Number 31, Queen."
00:19:56,00:19:59,"Number 96, The Queen."
00:19:59,00:20:00,Ouch.
00:20:00,00:20:05,Slap in the face for Lizzie.
00:20:05,00:20:10,She's probably feeling under pressure.
00:20:10,00:20:14,"You know, Heinz made Mayo Chup once."
00:20:14,00:20:15,What's that?
00:20:15,00:20:17,"Well, it's what it sounds like."
00:20:17,00:20:18,Mayo Lays and Ketchup.
00:20:18,00:20:19,That's absolutely right.
00:20:19,00:20:21,"It's a combination product, and they launched..."
00:20:21,00:20:23,"I think they launched it in the US a while earlier,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,"but they launched it in Canada in 2019,"
00:20:25,00:20:28,"at which point the chief of the Kree people,"
00:20:28,00:20:31,"you know, one of the First Nations peoples in Canada,"
00:20:31,00:20:35,"explained that in the Kree language, it means shit face."
00:20:35,00:20:37,"Oh, no way."
00:20:37,00:20:41,I got absolutely Mayo Chups last night.
00:20:41,00:20:44,Have you guys heard of Muriel Leto?
00:20:44,00:20:45,No.
00:20:45,00:20:48,"Well, you should have done, because she was the person"
00:20:48,00:20:51,who came up with the idea of painting Campbell's soup.
00:20:51,00:20:53,"So, you know that Andy Warhol thing?"
00:20:53,00:20:54,"Yeah, yeah."
00:20:54,00:20:56,"So, basically, he didn't know what to do."
00:20:56,00:20:58,"He wanted to get away from what he was doing,"
00:20:58,00:21:00,which was quite similar to another artist called
00:21:00,00:21:03,"Roy Lichtenstein, and he didn't know what to paint."
00:21:03,00:21:05,"And this person called Muriel Leto,"
00:21:05,00:21:08,she said you should paint something that everyone sees every day
00:21:08,00:21:10,that everyone recognizes like a can of soup.
00:21:10,00:21:14,And we know that she said that because she asked for some money.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"She didn't, she said, ""I know what you have to do,"
00:21:16,00:21:18,"but you need to give me $50 first."""
00:21:18,00:21:22,"And Andy Warhol gave her $50, and she gave him this idea."
00:21:22,00:21:25,"He went straight out, bought a load of soup, decided to paint it,"
00:21:25,00:21:31,"and he sold his, or his painting sold in 2006 for $11.7 million."
00:21:31,00:21:35,And I think everyone would kind of agree that it's not how great
00:21:35,00:21:38,"the painting is, but it's the idea that's the important part of it."
00:21:38,00:21:41,And she sold that idea for $50.
00:21:41,00:21:42,Really?
00:21:42,00:21:43,Yeah.
00:21:43,00:21:49,"I can't tell if people are applauding selling the idea really cheaply, or..."
00:21:49,00:21:52,"Well, she also wrote er, ""Mirotic Novels,"""
00:21:52,00:21:56,and she was known nickname for a while as the first lady of Hunky Punky.
00:21:56,00:21:58,"Oh, cool."
00:21:58,00:22:01,"That deserves a round of applause, doesn't it?"
00:22:01,00:22:04,"It was her who pioneered that Heinz vibrator, wasn't it?"
00:22:04,00:22:08,"Listen, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:22:08,00:22:11,"It is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:22:11,00:22:15,"Okay, my fact this week is that Argentina's armed forces"
00:22:15,00:22:21,"have 47 ships, 139 aircraft, and 20 llamas."
00:22:22,00:22:24,Hmm.
00:22:24,00:22:25,Why?
00:22:25,00:22:28,"Well, the ships are to attack things on the water."
00:22:28,00:22:29,Thank you.
00:22:29,00:22:30,Yeah.
00:22:30,00:22:32,And aircraft for the Air Force mostly.
00:22:32,00:22:35,So you're not saying these are the infantry?
00:22:35,00:22:39,Are they kind of therapy llamas for stressed out soldiers?
00:22:39,00:22:40,"No, no, they are."
00:22:40,00:22:44,"Because the army does lots of other things rather than just being in wars,"
00:22:44,00:22:47,it often has to help infrastructure in the country.
00:22:47,00:22:51,"This is for when they have logistics, they're in the high mountains."
00:22:51,00:22:53,"Especially in the pandemic, for instance,"
00:22:53,00:22:55,they've had to get medicines up into the mountains.
00:22:55,00:22:57,The army have been brought in to help.
00:22:57,00:22:59,"It's not always easy for people to get up there,"
00:22:59,00:23:02,but it's very easy for llamas to get up there.
00:23:02,00:23:05,"Then when the llama does get up there on its own, how is it helping?"
00:23:05,00:23:07,"Well, it usually..."
00:23:07,00:23:10,I can't say I'd be real short if I'm dying on a mountain side.
00:23:10,00:23:11,"It's just cute, right?"
00:23:11,00:23:12,It's just cute.
00:23:12,00:23:13,People can walk around with it.
00:23:13,00:23:15,"No, it will have a soldier with it,"
00:23:15,00:23:17,"but it's a beast of burden that is a llama,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,so they will carry the stuff up there.
00:23:19,00:23:20,Right.
00:23:20,00:23:23,So it's quite hard to put stuff on a wagon or in a car
00:23:23,00:23:25,and get it up to the top of the mountain.
00:23:25,00:23:27,It's not so hard to put it on the back of a llama.
00:23:27,00:23:28,Yeah.
00:23:28,00:23:29,"But you can't ride them, can you?"
00:23:29,00:23:31,"Lamas, no, you'll break their backs."
00:23:31,00:23:32,They're too fragile to be...
00:23:32,00:23:35,"Yeah, you shouldn't ride, never ride a llama."
00:23:35,00:23:37,If you learn one thing tonight.
00:23:37,00:23:39,Unless you're a child.
00:23:39,00:23:42,"In the aircraft, do they then have..."
00:23:42,00:23:45,"Unless, sorry, for calling you off, yes, unless you're a child."
00:23:45,00:23:46,I didn't want...
00:23:46,00:23:48,"Because I know there are some kids in the audience,"
00:23:48,00:23:50,"and you should feel free to ride llamas, I think,"
00:23:50,00:23:52,"for the next couple of years, maybe until you hit adolescence."
00:23:52,00:23:53,"As you were, Dan."
00:23:53,00:23:54,Thank you.
00:23:54,00:23:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:57,00:24:00,"Yeah, I'm just curious, where they lived inside these boats."
00:24:00,00:24:01,Do they have their own...
00:24:01,00:24:03,"No, they don't live inside the boats,"
00:24:03,00:24:04,all the airplanes or anything.
00:24:04,00:24:05,I just...
00:24:05,00:24:07,I was listing the things in their armed forces.
00:24:07,00:24:08,So many questions.
00:24:08,00:24:10,How did they tailor their uniforms?
00:24:10,00:24:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:11,00:24:12,Okay.
00:24:12,00:24:13,Dancer all of his notes.
00:24:13,00:24:14,How did they sail the ship?
00:24:14,00:24:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:15,00:24:16,Throw away that page.
00:24:16,00:24:17,Okay.
00:24:17,00:24:21,"They used to use their dung, though, in the Peruvian army,"
00:24:21,00:24:22,to actually...
00:24:22,00:24:24,"That's why I thought they might be on the ship,"
00:24:24,00:24:27,because their feces is actually useful as petrol
00:24:27,00:24:28,for the actual ships.
00:24:28,00:24:29,"Oh, really?"
00:24:29,00:24:30,"Yeah, they used to burn it."
00:24:30,00:24:31,It's cool.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"Yeah, it's a good fuel."
00:24:32,00:24:35,"The Inca people, obviously, were a huge llama keeping culture,"
00:24:35,00:24:37,and they had thousands and thousands.
00:24:37,00:24:39,The wild llamas as well.
00:24:39,00:24:42,And their method of hunting llamas was to do the hokey-cokey.
00:24:42,00:24:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:43,00:24:44,This is so cool.
00:24:44,00:24:45,Okay.
00:24:45,00:24:46,So what?
00:24:46,00:24:47,"Left arm in, left arm out?"
00:24:47,00:24:48,"Well, you all..."
00:24:48,00:24:49,"Well, hokey-cokey are old langzine,"
00:24:49,00:24:51,depending on how you feel about it.
00:24:51,00:24:54,"Basically, what you need to do if you're in the Inca society,"
00:24:54,00:24:57,"you gather 50,000 to 60,000 people, quite a lot."
00:24:57,00:24:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:58,00:25:00,You surround the llama plane.
00:25:00,00:25:02,"You all join arms, and you slowly move in."
00:25:02,00:25:03,"No, come on."
00:25:03,00:25:04,You move in.
00:25:04,00:25:06,"You corral the llamas into a smaller and smaller space,"
00:25:06,00:25:09,"and then people enter the, you know, the killing zone"
00:25:09,00:25:12,"with slings and bolasses and lassoes and stuff, I guess."
00:25:12,00:25:14,"And you would get up to 30,000 llamas"
00:25:14,00:25:16,in a single day's hunting that way.
00:25:16,00:25:17,That's amazing.
00:25:17,00:25:18,Wow.
00:25:18,00:25:19,"It's a lot of pressure, though,"
00:25:19,00:25:21,"because if you accidentally let go of someone,"
00:25:21,00:25:22,and they all run through your...
00:25:22,00:25:23,They all get out.
00:25:23,00:25:24,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right."
00:25:24,00:25:25,Thank you.
00:25:25,00:25:27,"Yeah, you do the left arm in, left arm out thing,"
00:25:27,00:25:29,which is not a part of the song you're supposed to reenact.
00:25:29,00:25:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:30,00:25:32,They did use them in wild the Incas.
00:25:32,00:25:34,We know that they used a lot.
00:25:34,00:25:35,"We don't know exactly how,"
00:25:35,00:25:37,but we think probably as a beast of burden again.
00:25:37,00:25:39,But there was one battle where they abandoned
00:25:39,00:25:42,"15,000 llamas after a battle with the Spanish."
00:25:42,00:25:43,Whoa.
00:25:43,00:25:45,So they were using a lot of them.
00:25:45,00:25:46,Yeah.
00:25:46,00:25:47,"Okay, fair enough."
00:25:47,00:25:48,I don't think you feel abandoned
00:25:48,00:25:49,"if there's 15,000 of you there."
00:25:49,00:25:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:51,00:25:53,"Yeah, that's fair, that's fair."
00:25:53,00:25:55,"The Israeli army uses llamas,"
00:25:55,00:25:57,"or at least it used to until 2017,"
00:25:57,00:26:00,and they've started using robots instead.
00:26:00,00:26:01,Wow.
00:26:01,00:26:02,Robot llamas?
00:26:02,00:26:03,Or...
00:26:03,00:26:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:04,00:26:05,Regrettably not.
00:26:05,00:26:07,"They're just like little doggie, doggie robots."
00:26:07,00:26:09,Is that for guarding?
00:26:09,00:26:12,"No, they would use them so when the army was going"
00:26:12,00:26:13,"to get into the mountains,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,they would have llamas with them.
00:26:15,00:26:17,They would be carrying things.
00:26:17,00:26:19,They were really useful because they kept cool
00:26:19,00:26:20,amidst gunfire.
00:26:20,00:26:21,"So whenever there was gunfire,"
00:26:21,00:26:23,a llama wouldn't shit itself and run away.
00:26:23,00:26:24,It would just kind of cool.
00:26:24,00:26:25,Wow.
00:26:25,00:26:26,"Yeah, yeah, this is cool."
00:26:26,00:26:27,That's amazing.
00:26:27,00:26:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:28,00:26:30,"Ironically, they're very difficult to alarm,"
00:26:30,00:26:31,aren't they?
00:26:31,00:26:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:32,00:26:33,Yes.
00:26:33,00:26:34,"And they would also,"
00:26:34,00:26:36,"if they were in the mountains and got very cold,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,they would lie down with the soldiers
00:26:38,00:26:39,"and kind of keep them warm,"
00:26:39,00:26:40,"because they're very fluffy,"
00:26:40,00:26:41,very wobbly.
00:26:41,00:26:42,Really?
00:26:42,00:26:45,"Yeah, they could lie for up to three days"
00:26:45,00:26:47,without moving with the soldiers around them
00:26:47,00:26:48,if you needed to ambush.
00:26:48,00:26:49,"Oh, God."
00:26:49,00:26:51,"Which robots can't do, really."
00:26:51,00:26:52,"I mean, they can stay still,"
00:26:52,00:26:54,but they can't keep you warm at night.
00:26:54,00:26:56,If you make a very fluffy robot.
00:26:56,00:26:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:57,00:26:59,What a self-heating robot.
00:26:59,00:27:01,Like the cans of soups.
00:27:01,00:27:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:02,00:27:04,"Well, llama mating is pretty interesting."
00:27:04,00:27:05,Just while we're on llamas lying down
00:27:05,00:27:07,and keeping each other warm at night.
00:27:07,00:27:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:08,00:27:12,Because they're really hard to breed.
00:27:12,00:27:15,There are a few reasons in their natural mating cycle
00:27:15,00:27:17,which make them really difficult to breed.
00:27:17,00:27:19,So they don't breed like us.
00:27:19,00:27:22,"So female llamas release an egg after sex,"
00:27:22,00:27:25,"as opposed to the human method of once per month,"
00:27:25,00:27:26,"you know, come on May."
00:27:26,00:27:27,"Yeah, I got it."
00:27:27,00:27:30,"But also, llama semen is very lethargic."
00:27:30,00:27:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:31,00:27:34,And they are known as dribble ejaculators.
00:27:34,00:27:36,"Oh, God."
00:27:36,00:27:38,Jesus Christ.
00:27:38,00:27:39,It's really...
00:27:39,00:27:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:40,00:27:44,It's so hard to get semen out of a llama.
00:27:44,00:27:46,It's like getting blood out of a stone.
00:27:46,00:27:50,That is the worst thing I've ever heard you say.
00:27:50,00:27:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:51,00:27:54,"But there are great news, guys."
00:27:54,00:27:57,"Artificial llama vaginas, which you can buy on the market."
00:27:57,00:27:58,No one can stop you.
00:27:58,00:28:00,"If you've got the money, you can get one."
00:28:00,00:28:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:01,00:28:03,And they come with a kind of hot water bottle
00:28:03,00:28:06,to simulate the temperature of a real llama.
00:28:06,00:28:09,"And they also come with a surrounding life size,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,cuddly female llama bottom.
00:28:11,00:28:12,Wow.
00:28:12,00:28:13,Yeah.
00:28:13,00:28:14,"Just the bottom, then."
00:28:14,00:28:15,You can if you're feeling flash.
00:28:15,00:28:17,You can get the full female llama package.
00:28:17,00:28:19,You can't do that.
00:28:19,00:28:20,I think you can.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Really?
00:28:21,00:28:22,"I mean, don't."
00:28:22,00:28:25,"Well, do what you like, actually, you know."
00:28:25,00:28:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:26,00:28:27,"Oh, do they do checks?"
00:28:27,00:28:28,"When you buy the llama vagina,"
00:28:28,00:28:31,do they check that you do have a male llama?
00:28:31,00:28:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:32,00:28:33,They should.
00:28:33,00:28:34,I didn't know.
00:28:34,00:28:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:36,00:28:38,"I know what you're saying about they can't stop you,"
00:28:38,00:28:40,but it kind of feels like they should be able to stop you.
00:28:40,00:28:41,They should be able to stop you.
00:28:41,00:28:43,They should be back on checks.
00:28:43,00:28:45,Is there a dribble ejaculator in the house?
00:28:45,00:28:46,How do you know my school nickname?
00:28:46,00:28:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:51,00:28:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:55,00:28:57,They're very sociable.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"We're talking about real llamas now, right?"
00:28:59,00:29:00,Yeah.
00:29:00,00:29:01,Yeah.
00:29:01,00:29:04,"In a platonic way, they may not be good at shagging,"
00:29:04,00:29:06,but they do love each other.
00:29:06,00:29:08,And that's why they make such good guards.
00:29:08,00:29:11,So you know people often have a llama to guard their herd of sheep
00:29:11,00:29:12,or their herd of goats.
00:29:12,00:29:14,And that's because they get super protective of them.
00:29:14,00:29:16,"So you've got your herd of goats, you've got a llama."
00:29:16,00:29:18,They're great and they scare away.
00:29:18,00:29:20,They've been known to kill wolves and stuff occasionally.
00:29:20,00:29:21,Wow.
00:29:21,00:29:22,It's very impressive.
00:29:22,00:29:26,"But if you've got a llama guard, do not get two llama guards,"
00:29:26,00:29:28,"because the moment that you get a second one,"
00:29:28,00:29:30,it just becomes friends with its llama
00:29:30,00:29:32,and ignores all the goats and the sheep.
00:29:32,00:29:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:33,00:29:35,And that's them all get ravaged by the wolves.
00:29:35,00:29:39,There's a golf course in North Carolina called Telemore Golf Course.
00:29:39,00:29:43,And they have caddies that are llamas.
00:29:43,00:29:46,So the llamas will carry your golf clubs around with you.
00:29:46,00:29:48,But one thing that I saw in only one place
00:29:48,00:29:51,is that there are golfers who have these llamas.
00:29:51,00:29:53,"And they've noticed that whenever they hit a good shot,"
00:29:53,00:29:57,"just before they hit it, the llama gives off a little moan."
00:29:57,00:30:00,"It kind of goes, ""Rrrrrrrrr"" like that."
00:30:00,00:30:02,And so you have these golfers who are stood there
00:30:02,00:30:04,"and they're just waiting to hear,"
00:30:04,00:30:06,"they keep moving a little bit this way, a little bit that way."
00:30:06,00:30:08,"And as soon as they hear the moan, they go, ""Right!"""
00:30:08,00:30:09,And then they hit it.
00:30:09,00:30:10,Wow.
00:30:10,00:30:13,These are the llamas can tell good golf posture.
00:30:13,00:30:14,Yeah.
00:30:14,00:30:16,That's what it seems like.
00:30:16,00:30:18,Unbelievable.
00:30:18,00:30:19,That's amazing.
00:30:19,00:30:21,They do make weird noises.
00:30:21,00:30:24,"Like the noise of alarm is, sounds like,"
00:30:24,00:30:26,"I can't describe it, it sounds like a rusty door hinge."
00:30:26,00:30:28,And that is exactly what it's like.
00:30:28,00:30:30,"It's like, ""Rrrrrrrrr"""
00:30:30,00:30:31,Yeah.
00:30:31,00:30:32,Something out of a horror film.
00:30:32,00:30:34,But not when they're mating.
00:30:34,00:30:38,"When they're mating, I hesitate to return to the field"
00:30:38,00:30:40,because everyone lost their shit last time.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"But they are, they orgle."
00:30:43,00:30:45,Orgling is what they do.
00:30:45,00:30:48,Orgling and dribbling.
00:30:48,00:30:49,They make that noise.
00:30:49,00:30:50,Really?
00:30:50,00:30:51,"Yeah, they do."
00:30:51,00:30:53,"If you hit orgling, you're in trouble."
00:30:53,00:30:55,Or in luck.
00:30:55,00:30:57,"In luck, yeah."
00:30:57,00:31:00,There's a dribble coming your way.
00:31:00,00:31:07,I was on kentlive.com.co.uk
00:31:07,00:31:10,reading about llama-related news from this year.
00:31:10,00:31:11,Yeah.
00:31:11,00:31:14,British natureism have an event.
00:31:14,00:31:17,"This is actually in East Sussex, but people from Kent can go."
00:31:17,00:31:24,It's a walking with llamas completely naked night.
00:31:24,00:31:28,"Feels, feels it would have been safer to make it a day event."
00:31:28,00:31:34,"Anyway, it was supposed to happen at the start this year."
00:31:34,00:31:36,I think it might have got cancelled due to COVID.
00:31:36,00:31:38,"But maybe, maybe we'll come back."
00:31:38,00:31:41,"Anyway, the British natureism website, it's been taken down."
00:31:41,00:31:45,"But I did notice that on there, weirdly, they sell hoodies, fleeces"
00:31:45,00:31:48,and 19 different designs of t-shirts
00:31:48,00:31:50,on the British natureism website.
00:31:50,00:31:52,You've got to have something to take off.
00:31:52,00:31:54,Exactly.
00:31:54,00:31:58,"I'm just picturing the horror movie, that scene where it's completely dark."
00:31:58,00:31:59,You're lost in the woods.
00:31:59,00:32:01,"You're going, ""Who is that? I can hear someone."""
00:32:01,00:32:09,We need to move on to our final fact of the show.
00:32:09,00:32:13,"It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna."
00:32:13,00:32:16,"My fact this week is that for a few days every year,"
00:32:16,00:32:19,Britain's beaches are covered in worm sperm.
00:32:19,00:32:21,"Oh, good. More sperm. Okay."
00:32:21,00:32:27,That's right. It's not the driveling kind.
00:32:27,00:32:30,It's specifically lug worm sperm.
00:32:30,00:32:32,And this is incredible.
00:32:32,00:32:34,"So, I was on a beach recently, and I was looking at, you know,"
00:32:34,00:32:38,those lug worm sand spirals you see on pretty much all beaches
00:32:38,00:32:40,at low tide.
00:32:40,00:32:43,They look like long worms made of sand.
00:32:43,00:32:46,And they're created by lug worms because they dig these burrows
00:32:46,00:32:50,and then they deposit these things on top of the burrows.
00:32:50,00:32:53,"But the other thing they do is, the way they mate,"
00:32:53,00:32:57,"is the male lug worm, who's in quite a deep burrow on the beach"
00:32:57,00:33:00,"for a couple of days a year, he spurts some sperm out."
00:33:00,00:33:03,"So, when the tide goes out, he spurts his sperm out onto the sand."
00:33:03,00:33:06,"In a little white lump, you can see it if you keep your eyes peeled."
00:33:06,00:33:09,"And when the tide comes in, it gets all this lug worm sperm."
00:33:09,00:33:12,"So, there'll be thousands and thousands of little piles of sperm on the beach."
00:33:12,00:33:16,"The tide comes in and it washes it into the females' burrows,"
00:33:16,00:33:19,and they get a little cascade of sperm coming down.
00:33:19,00:33:21,And it fertilises their eggs.
00:33:21,00:33:23,And that's romance.
00:33:23,00:33:25,It's a circle of life. Yeah.
00:33:25,00:33:27,It's so amazing how they never... They never meet.
00:33:27,00:33:30,"I mean, so many of us, they never meet. It's like, ""You've got mail."""
00:33:30,00:33:32,Or...
00:33:32,00:33:34,Is that what happens? You've got mail?
00:33:34,00:33:37,How do they send it through the pubs?
00:33:37,00:33:39,"Yeah, Tom Hanks sends you mail."
00:33:39,00:33:42,"No, what kind of people like Tom Hanks so much?"
00:33:42,00:33:45,He's fathered most of the people in this country.
00:33:45,00:33:48,"Also, they do meet, I know, at the end of ""You've got mail."""
00:33:48,00:33:50,But mostly lug worms...
00:33:50,00:33:53,"It's like IVF, I would say, would be a better analogy."
00:33:53,00:33:55,"Or like, when you go to a sperm bank."
00:33:55,00:33:58,"It's unbelievable. It's also unbelievable that lug worms,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,"which I had never heard of, by the way. I don't know if that's especially ignorant,"
00:34:01,00:34:04,"I'd never heard of lug worms being a thing before researching this fact,"
00:34:04,00:34:08,"that they all mate at exactly the same day, every year."
00:34:08,00:34:11,"You know, the same few days, they just all know to do it."
00:34:11,00:34:13,We don't know how. They know that either.
00:34:13,00:34:16,"Like, we know that there is pheromones involved, right?"
00:34:16,00:34:20,"So, when the female notices that there's sperm washing around,"
00:34:20,00:34:22,she'll release her eggs.
00:34:22,00:34:25,"And when the males can tell those eggs around, they release their sperm."
00:34:25,00:34:28,But what triggers it in the first place? We have no idea.
00:34:28,00:34:31,"And so there's a thing called sperm watch, which is..."
00:34:31,00:34:33,"It's on after spring watch, isn't it?"
00:34:33,00:34:35,It's the late night version.
00:34:35,00:34:37,The red button.
00:34:37,00:34:45,"And what they want is for people to, like, tell them when they see this stuff on the beach."
00:34:45,00:34:48,"So you will see this little pile of, you know, white stuff on the beach."
00:34:48,00:34:51,"They say, ""Don't confuse it with seagull poo."""
00:34:51,00:34:53,It looks a lot like seagull poo.
00:34:53,00:34:55,"But if you see these things that look like seagull poo,"
00:34:55,00:34:59,"but they're in little ponds, then tell them, and then hopefully we can work out what it is."
00:34:59,00:35:03,It might be the temperature. It might be a change in weather. We're just not sure.
00:35:03,00:35:06,"Yeah. I love, though, like, as you say, this is a citizen thing,"
00:35:06,00:35:08,and there was a big website and big PR push.
00:35:08,00:35:12,"And they were like, you know, this is like, for anyone of any age, go out."
00:35:12,00:35:16,"But as James points out, someone decided to call it sperm watch."
00:35:16,00:35:18,And it just feels the most inappropriate.
00:35:18,00:35:23,"And it was things like, you go on their site, and for any would-be sperm spotters, again,"
00:35:23,00:35:26,you get a pencil and a clipboard.
00:35:26,00:35:28,"Well, this is what they ask you to take, a pencil, a clipboard,"
00:35:28,00:35:31,tied tables and a recording sheet.
00:35:31,00:35:33,"And the idea is that you've got to run around,"
00:35:33,00:35:36,"and I think you have to see how many you can spot in ten minutes,"
00:35:36,00:35:41,or the time it takes to find a hundred of them to know that this is an area that's fucking-
00:35:41,00:35:44,It's a fun game. It's like Pokemon Go.
00:35:44,00:35:47,It is. Yeah. It's like Pokemon Goo.
00:35:49,00:35:54,"Can I just tell you the one... So, Anna, you said that the casts they have on the beach,"
00:35:54,00:35:58,"as in they live in a burrow in a U-shaped burrow, and they eat food at one end,"
00:35:58,00:36:00,"and then they just poo it out at the other end of the burrow,"
00:36:00,00:36:02,"and they're in this U-shape, and that's what produces the cast."
00:36:02,00:36:06,"The headline of this on the Barry Today website was,"
00:36:06,00:36:10,"""The love life of lug worms involves the casts of thousands."""
00:36:10,00:36:12,- Nice. - How good is that?
00:36:12,00:36:13,- Lovely. - What's the burrow today?
00:36:13,00:36:15,"- Just for people called Barry. - Yeah, okay."
00:36:15,00:36:17,How did you get on it?
00:36:17,00:36:22,"So there are two types in the UK, two species, the blow lug worms and the black lug worms,"
00:36:22,00:36:26,"and what I find incredible is how deep they go and how big they are,"
00:36:26,00:36:29,"because there's little coils of sand. You're expecting a small little worm,"
00:36:29,00:36:33,"but the black lug worm can be 40 centimetres long,"
00:36:33,00:36:38,"so like half a metre long, practically, and it burrows down about 70 centimetres."
00:36:38,00:36:41,"So you need to dig pretty far, because people dig for these quite a lot."
00:36:41,00:36:45,"They're very useful as fishing bait, but you need to dig a long way to get one little worm,"
00:36:45,00:36:48,"and then they're not little. - No, that's true."
00:36:48,00:36:54,"I watch the movie Dune this weekend, and this really spoiled it for me,"
00:36:54,00:37:00,"because all the way through I was like, these massive worms that live underneath the dunes in Dune,"
00:37:00,00:37:03,how are they reproducing? Where are their casts?
00:37:03,00:37:09,"Anyway, the other people in the cinema did not appreciate those questions."
00:37:09,00:37:13,"Their breathing is pretty amazing, so they can breathe."
00:37:13,00:37:17,"There was a big mystery about how they could breathe so long when the tide goes out,"
00:37:17,00:37:21,"and when it comes in, and they worked out it was something like six hours that they could survive,"
00:37:21,00:37:27,"and they studied it and looked into what was going on, and it turns out that they have..."
00:37:27,00:37:31,"So if we... God, it's science, I get a bit stuck,"
00:37:31,00:37:39,"but the hemoglobin thing, so in human blood, one hemoglobin protein holds four oxygen molecules at a time."
00:37:39,00:37:45,"The lug worm, it's 156, and it's insane, and what they've done is they've isolated it,"
00:37:45,00:37:49,"and they've applied it to medicine now, and it's a huge thing for transplants"
00:37:49,00:37:53,"of any things like liver and so on, because it means that you can hold it."
00:37:53,00:37:56,"If they're pushing this hemoglobin new product that they've created,"
00:37:56,00:38:01,you can make it last for days rather than hours for a transplant needing to happen.
00:38:01,00:38:03,It's a game changer. - It's because they breathe through gills.
00:38:03,00:38:06,"So they breathe through gills, and then they take in a huge amount of oxygen,"
00:38:06,00:38:11,"and there was one French scientist called Frank Zell who found this out in the '90s,"
00:38:11,00:38:15,"and the amazing thing about lug worm blood is it's compatible with all blood types,"
00:38:15,00:38:21,"because the hemoglobin is not anchored to red blood cells, so this is really exciting."
00:38:21,00:38:25,"There is a factory in France which produces over a million lug worms a year,"
00:38:25,00:38:30,"each of them producing a tiny amount of blood, but that has been used in kidney transplants."
00:38:30,00:38:34,"It makes people recover faster, it improves their organ function."
00:38:34,00:38:38,"They are so incredible. - It's still being tested a little there, isn't it?"
00:38:38,00:38:43,"But they are using it in real life things, and the first person to have a double face transplant"
00:38:43,00:38:47,"use this stuff, by which I mean he didn't end up with two faces at the end."
00:38:47,00:38:50,"He had a face put on, it rejected, and he had another one done."
00:38:50,00:38:53,"- Yeah, he wasn't like, ""Can I get one on the back as well? That'll look cool."""
00:38:53,00:38:56,"- I was reading about blood worms, which are very similar."
00:38:56,00:39:00,"In fact, I was reading about sand worms in general, of which a lug worm is a type,"
00:39:00,00:39:05,"and in Maine, in America, it's one of the main sandworm digging up industries."
00:39:05,00:39:09,So Maine employs about a thousand people who go and dig up lug worms and blood worms
00:39:09,00:39:11,and sell them to anglers.
00:39:11,00:39:15,"And I just really enjoyed this. It was a New York Times article from 1976,"
00:39:15,00:39:19,"so I don't know if it's still the case, but you basically get blood worm hunters"
00:39:19,00:39:23,"and sand worm hunters, and the sand worms are a bit more free-swimming"
00:39:23,00:39:26,"and the blood worms are a bit more burrowing, like our lug worms."
00:39:26,00:39:29,"And apparently, they're two extremely separate groups."
00:39:29,00:39:33,It's like the People's Front of Judea and the Judean People's Front. They hate each other.
00:39:33,00:39:38,"And the blood worms have a reputation, apparently, for real roughness."
00:39:38,00:39:43,"And in fact, there was a strike of all of the sandwormers and blood worms in 1976."
00:39:43,00:39:47,"And when both groups were striking, the blood worms told the sandwormers"
00:39:47,00:39:50,"that if they dared to accept an offer for, like, a pay increase"
00:39:50,00:39:54,"that didn't involve a pay increase also for the blood worms,"
00:39:54,00:39:58,the blood worms said they would go and tear up all of their mudflats
00:39:58,00:40:00,which they used to do their harvesting.
00:40:00,00:40:03,Wow. That's a menacing phrase to hear.
00:40:03,00:40:05,"""I'll tear up your mudflats."""
00:40:05,00:40:08,It could mean any number of things.
00:40:08,00:40:10,We're going to have to wrap up in a second.
00:40:10,00:40:13,"Can I just tell you, there's a giant beach worm in Australia"
00:40:13,00:40:16,which is one centimetre wide and three metres long.
00:40:16,00:40:18,Did you say giant? Yeah.
00:40:18,00:40:20,And did you say centimetres?
00:40:20,00:40:22,"Sorry, I just watched June this weekend."
00:40:22,00:40:24,"Okay. Not 400 metres. Yeah, yeah."
00:40:24,00:40:26,Wow. So what's it do?
00:40:26,00:40:28,It just wriggles around.
00:40:28,00:40:30,"But no, three metres."
00:40:30,00:40:33,"It's very, very long and only a tiny bit wide."
00:40:33,00:40:35,It's a really strange organism.
00:40:35,00:40:39,"It's a strong fisherman, isn't it, that puts that on the end of his rod."
00:40:39,00:40:41,A whole fishing line is the worm.
00:40:41,00:40:43,Yeah. A plot twist.
00:40:43,00:40:46,Go on.
00:40:46,00:40:49,"Well, I can tell you there is a new taste in town."
00:40:49,00:40:53,Okay. So there's salty and bitter and all that kind of stuff.
00:40:53,00:40:55,"We've talked about umami on this show,"
00:40:55,00:40:57,"I'm pretty sure, in our QI as well."
00:40:57,00:40:59,There's also a thing called kokumi.
00:40:59,00:41:02,"And kokumi is something, it doesn't really taste of anything,"
00:41:02,00:41:05,but it makes other tastes enhanced.
00:41:05,00:41:07,"And we have a special receptor in our tongue,"
00:41:07,00:41:09,so we know it does count as a proper taste.
00:41:09,00:41:12,"Anyway, you find it in fish sperm."
00:41:12,00:41:14,Wow.
00:41:14,00:41:17,The caviar menu at Fido's Restaurant and Grill
00:41:17,00:41:19,just got a new option.
00:41:19,00:41:22,Do you know what's so weird is that I was reading about kokumi
00:41:22,00:41:24,"for the first fact we mentioned today,"
00:41:24,00:41:26,because cats love it.
00:41:26,00:41:30,And they deliberately try and get kokumi and umami into cat food.
00:41:30,00:41:32,So there we go.
00:41:32,00:41:35,"Wait a minute, it also tastes a bit like caviar."
00:41:35,00:41:38,So maybe the water does taste of caviar.
00:41:38,00:41:41,It's all coming together.
00:41:41,00:41:44,How beautiful. We've tied it all up in a bow.
00:41:44,00:41:46,There we go. A good point to end on then.
00:41:46,00:41:48,That is it. That is all of our facts.
