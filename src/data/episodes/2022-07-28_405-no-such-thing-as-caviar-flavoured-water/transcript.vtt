00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.400
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Canterbury!

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.300
 [applause]

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.400
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.200
 and in no particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.600
 My fact is that, if it's served carefully enough, nobody can tell the difference between pate and dog food.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 You've all been wasting your money all these years.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.000
 I'm not coming to your restaurant. How do you serve it if, what's the difference?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.800
 Well, this was a study done by the American Association of Wine Economists in 2009,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.300
 who I guess just got bored of studying wine and sort of branched out into wine-affiliated foods like pate.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.900
 And they basically, they were trying to work out if people could tell the difference.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.600
 So, the researchers, they blended up some dog food, that's what they did, until it looked like liver mousse, basically.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.500
 And then they had about, I think, 18 subjects and they challenged them to work out which was dog food and which was not.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.300
 And about one person in six guessed dog food, but there were six samples.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.200
 So, there is no better than chance, effectively, that people can tell.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.400
 I should say, you're being a bit unfair, Andy. They also garnished it with parsley.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.800
 Sorry. Sorry. Everything had parsley on.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.400
 So, the really weird thing about this is that people knew it was horrible, but they just didn't know it wasn't pate.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.100
 They knew that one of the things was dog food, but 72% of the people who tasted it said,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.700
 "Well, that is the worst thing in this whole array of samples."

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.300
 But most of them, five and six, did not say that the dog food.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.200
 So, presumably, they thought, "This is disgusting, but that can't possibly..."

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.400
 Do they think dog food tastes better than it does?

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.000
 I think, yeah, I think they did. And I think the researchers had told them,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.100
 "Don't worry, we're not going to feed you something horrible."

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.500
 And they tasted that and they said, "Well, that is horrible, so it can't be the dog food."

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.800
 So, should we be eating dog food?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.400
 No. No. Okay.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.000
 Why not? Why not?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.700
 Sounds like we think it's horrible. We just don't think it's dog food, but we still don't enjoy it.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.900
 But I like pate.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.700
 It tastes worse. 70% of people think it tastes worse.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.100
 The worst out of all the pates they were given.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.400
 It still tastes like a bad pate, which I think I'd still like.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.000
 So, okay. To be honest, it wasn't the worst tasting thing there.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.300
 That was the liver worst. It was probably the worst tasting because they had liver worst,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.700
 duck liver mousse, pork liver pate and spam.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.300
 Oh, God!

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.100
 And the liver worst, I think, was the one that they most often thought was pet food, right?

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.700
 Yeah.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.400
 Pizarre.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.100
 And turns out, a journalist did a very unscientific study just asking her friends to feed a bunch of stuff to their dogs.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.200
 And dogs also prefer the taste of actual pate to dog food.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.500
 Unsurprisingly, as anyone who has a dog knows, they always want to eat human food more than they want to eat dog food.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.400
 But that's for variety, right?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.400
 That's why I think if I had dog food, I'd be like, "Man, that feels really nice."

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.600
 But, you know, if I had it every night, I'd beâ€¦

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.900
 There's nothing to stop you from having dog food, though.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.700
 And if you come down to my new restaurant, Fido's, you can have it every night.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.100
 I wonder, though, if it's the same with dogs, that they're sort of, you know,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.400
 whether or not they're tricked into thinking they think something is tasty.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.900
 For example, there's an adventure he was called Charleston Ellis.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.200
 He's the guy who created a dog biscuit that was shaped like a bone, rather than it just being a biscuit.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.400
 And when he shaped it into a bone, suddenly his dog that he was testing it on really liked it.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.100
 And there's this quote where he says that he says, "To this day," and this is in 1936,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.500
 "I cannot tell whether my dog is interested in the bone-shaped biscuit because it fools him as such."

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.700
 He's like, "Ah, it's a bone." Or, "Whether after my shaping the biscuit in an effort to cater to his taste,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.600
 he feels duty-bound to fool his master by simulating an interest in it."

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.100
 Yeah, possible.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.000
 Very polite dog he's got there.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.800
 What you're saying about dogs preferring human food is interesting,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.600
 because I don't have a dog, and I didn't know that.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.200
 But I thought that the whole point of dog food was that you had to make it taste disgusting enough for dogs to like.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.800
 That's what they say, isn't it?

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.900
 And this is particularly what they do with treats.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.100
 Dog treats is they add stuff like, is it cadaverine and putrescine?

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.700
 So it's things that smell like rotting corpses and rotting food to us.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.200
 Talk about it does exactly what it says on the tin.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.200
 But that's apparently what they like. This is what they claim,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.400
 is that the more repulsive it smells to us, the more delicious it is to pets.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.700
 And so that's what they add to...

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.000
 And I think we might have said before on the show that sometimes you get humans who taste the dog food.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.600
 But I read that the reason they do that is more because you don't want the humans to be disgusted

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.000
 when they're feeding their dogs, otherwise they won't buy that kind of dog food.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.800
 It's not about taste being good for humans.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.500
 It's about us not being disgusted when we put it in a bowl.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.500
 That's interesting, because I was reading a dog food manufacturer who was saying

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.000
 the hardest thing about it is to make something that's not repulsive to humans.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.800
 Because what dogs like is like feces, roadkill, vomit.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.300
 I probably won't have the starter, I mean.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.100
 And if you serve something that's a combination of feces, roadkill and vomit,

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.300
 the human owners do tend to bulk at it.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.100
 Yes.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.500
 That gets challenged.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.900
 Have you guys heard the phrase "eating your own dog food"?

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.500
 No.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.100
 So this is not a phrase I've heard. I think it's an American thing.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.900
 You can imagine what it means though.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.500
 Trying something...

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.600
 It's from the business world.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.400
 It's...

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.400
 Oh, let's say you're Microsoft.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.800
 Yes.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.200
 You want people who work at Microsoft to be using Microsoft products, you know.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.700
 Okay.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.100
 So you want, you know, the proof of the pudding is in the...

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.500
 Are you using another better metaphor to explain your shittier metaphor?

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.900
 Yeah, I think I was.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.400
 But yeah, you should be comfortable trying your own product

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.100
 and you should believe in it enough that you can honestly recommend it to other people, you know,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.900
 and you should be eating your own dog food, anyway.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.300
 But that doesn't make any sense, because you're not recommending it to other people.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.400
 You're recommending it to dogs.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.900
 It would make sense if Bill Gates was trying to market computers to cats.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.100
 But he's not.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.200
 Okay.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.900
 Okay.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.600
 All right, now we've all acknowledged the structural flaws in the metaphor.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.900
 There was a man called Mitch Felderhoff who actually did eat his own dog food last year,

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.000
 because he lives in Texas and he owns a dog food firm,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.400
 and he did it for a month.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.700
 Only eight products that his firm made.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.400
 Cool.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.100
 He got approval from his doctor and his wife crucially before he started,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.400
 because of what I imagine his breath was like.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.600
 And he did say,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.300
 "One of the things I did that was key is that I did do some intermittent fasting,

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.800
 i.e. some meals, I just didn't need anything at all."

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.400
 There was a woman in America called Dorothy Hunter who did the same thing in 2014.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.000
 She worked for a company called The Honest Kitchen,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.200
 and for a month, again, she ate nothing but dog food.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.800
 She said that she didn't add any seasoning, but she heard that hot sauce is good.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.700
 Who she heard that from, and maybe your name, I'm not sure.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.700
 But she said the main problem is that humans are social eaters,

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.200
 and socially, this has been very hard.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.900
 So I can imagine her going at a dinner party for her friends

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.300
 and bringing a pedigree chum with her and whatever.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.800
 They just put it on the floor in the corner.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.500
 The word pate, originally meant pet food.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.200
 Did it?

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.900
 Yeah.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.200
 It appeared in the 18th century, I think, in France.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.500
 It had its first use, it had a doubly.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.300
 Its first use was specifically about chicken food.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.100
 And when I was looking through sources that refer to pate,

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.200
 it goes right up until the end of the 19th century,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.800
 pate refers to chicken food.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.300
 And then it broadened to mean kind of breadcrumbs and bits of meat

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.800
 that you'd give to any pet.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.900
 And then somehow it became pate.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.700
 Wow.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.300
 Yeah.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.000
 No wonder they couldn't tell the difference.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.900
 Maybe they're from the 15th century or whatever.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.300
 That's what it was.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.700
 You know that if they're given the choice, dogs will not give humans treats.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.500
 Oh.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.300
 What do you mean?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.400
 As in, researchers trained 37 dogs to press a button

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.800
 which would give them a treat.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.100
 Yeah.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.600
 Okay, so the dogs were well familiar with the fact

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.400
 that pressing this button gives a treat, provides a treat.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.400
 And then the button was placed in another room.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.000
 Oh, the humans were placed next door with the button

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.100
 and the dogs would beg.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.400
 The dogs would beg, beg, beg, please press this button

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.900
 so I get a treat falling into my room.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.200
 Yeah.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.100
 Anyway, the situation was then reversed

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.100
 and the button was put into the room with the dog.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.400
 And no matter what the humans did, the dogs did not care.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.100
 They pressed the button no greater for the people

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.200
 who had given them treats.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.900
 They're for the people who hadn't given them treats.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.100
 What a great experiment.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.900
 Do you think they'd take us for walks if we needed it?

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.700
 Sounds like no.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.300
 Sounds like no.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.500
 They're not doing anything.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.500
 Well, no, but that's different

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.700
 because then we'd be shitting all over their furniture and that's...

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.700
 Are they doing this because they're mean or stupid?

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.500
 Do they know?

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.000
 I think.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.300
 I think it's stupid.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.700
 Do you think?

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.300
 Because I think my cat would not just not press the button

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:09.300
 but would also probably unplug it so no one else can get a treat.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.700
 Do dogs and cats can taste water?

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.200
 Yeah, I can taste water.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.000
 You can't?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.700
 Yes, I can.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.500
 Only if you put black currants in it, Dan.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.900
 Yeah, you can taste squash.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.700
 No, you can taste from a tap.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.300
 It's sort of, I guess that's probably like the metals and stuff.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.100
 You basically can't.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.900
 I mean, there are some studies that say water has a bit of a sour taste,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.100
 but essentially humans don't have specific taste receptors for water,

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.300
 which is why it's so bland and crap and we have to make squash.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.700
 Whereas dogs and cats, the reason you don't get a dog and cat squash

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.600
 is that they've got specific receptors on the tip of their tongue.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.100
 Those are discovered in the 1950s.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.900
 They found it first on frogs and then thought,

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.700
 oh, I wonder what else can taste water?

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.200
 And when you drop water onto the tongues of like sedated cats and dogs,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.000
 it stimulates all these receptors.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.600
 I don't suppose we know what it tastes like.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.900
 So they're just watery, I guess.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.500
 They say it tastes like caviar.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.900
 Yeah, really?

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.800
 No, they don't know.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.100
 Fallen for the old classic Anna Prank.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.400
 They refuse to tell us.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.600
 I can't believe I fell right in the trap.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.300
 I was out with my in-laws on a walk recently and they have a dog called Benji

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.600
 and Benji started licking really disgusting puddle.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.200
 And like, you know, and I was like, Benji.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.900
 And I said that and they said, no, it's fine.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.700
 And I haven't had a dog for years.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.400
 Why, what does that taste like to them?

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.700
 And why can they survive?

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.400
 Because that would.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.800
 Well, it might have feces and roadkill in which case it's chef's kiss.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.900
 That's their ribina, is it?

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.400
 They do tend to prefer a puddle.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.600
 And our dog loves to whee in a puddle at the same time as drinking from it,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.000
 which I think is a nice touch.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.400
 I feel like it's almost a perpetual motion machine, isn't it?

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.000
 We could use it to power something.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.700
 It's renewable energy.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.500
 It is time for fact number two.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.900
 And that is my fact.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.900
 My fact this week is that during World War Two,

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:07.100
 Heinz developed a self-heating can of soup to work it.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.000
 It had to be lit like a bomb.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.200
 Unfortunately, it very often exploded like one too.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.800
 So this was a pretty remarkable thing.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.500
 During the war efforts, when they were going out,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.300
 there was this big problem that they had terrible food

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.700
 and they wanted to have better food.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.300
 And to cook food was kind of a giveaway

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.400
 because you would have to start fires and so on.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.900
 And it would just be a giveaway to where an army might be.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.900
 So Heinz along with the army, they developed this self-heating can

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.800
 which effectively looked like a can that had a wick sticking out.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.900
 So like a bomb.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.800
 And soldiers were encouraged to light it using cigarette, lit cigarettes.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.400
 And it would take about four minutes to heat the can.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.400
 But before you lit it, you were meant to puncture holes into it.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.700
 And if you punctured the holes in the wrong way, which often happened,

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.200
 the can would then heat up in such a way that it would lead to an explosion.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.900
 If you'd be covered in tomato soup, everyone would be like,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.900
 "It's blood! He's hit by a bomb!"

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.400
 It was a very confusing time.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.800
 And this kind of often happened.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.800
 In some cases, it wasn't even to do with the puncturing.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.600
 Just there was faulty cans and so on.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.400
 So there were people talking about cans exploding at Normandy.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.000
 There was tomato soup everywhere, you know, and getting scolded.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.400
 You would feel so embarrassed if you were injured on Normandy beaches

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.000
 by a malfunctioning tin of soup.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 As you collected your military cross.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.400
 What was it for again? Just getting into it at Normandy.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.800
 There was one account where they were just trying these out.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.800
 I think this was in 1944.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.500
 There was a fertility of ships off the South Coast of Britain.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.700
 And it was the first time they'd seen these.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.600
 And I think it seems like you're supposed to put holes in the top of the can.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.100
 And someone put them in the sides.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.700
 And then the can was at head height.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.000
 And it sprayed directly into his ears, apparently.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.700
 And he got very badly scolded is because it was it was heated by a heating element inside the can.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.000
 It was so it got very hot and the can itself got extremely hot.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.300
 It was health and safety nightmare.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:13.400
 Yeah, they often I mean, it's what they said about the Second World War in Toto.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.900
 They got very hot and some soldiers.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.800
 I don't know if this was after they'd used the they poured the soup out,

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.400
 but they would use the cans effectively as a hot water bottle in the colder places that they were at.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.500
 Because they were just they got so hot you had to handle them with a cloth.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.400
 And so, yeah, and they used to attach them onto the side of bombs, right?

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.600
 And that's why we got the term souped up weapons.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.900
 Yeah, no, you're not going to fall for that one like I felt the cover up.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.600
 I was so close, but because of what she did to you earlier was a bit more on edge.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:50.800
 The self-heating can was invented in 1879 by a guy called Yevgeny Fyodorov from Russia.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.000
 His had quick lime in it and water and you would twist the bottom

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.200
 and the two things would mix and they would warm up.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.800
 Unfortunately, it didn't really warm them up very much.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.400
 So you just you had this stew, but it was kind of a lukewarm stew.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.400
 And he was also the first person that I could find who made a plane in Russia, Fyodorov.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.600
 So yeah, he's a proper engineer.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.000
 That's a big leap up, isn't it? Self-heating soup can one day, plane the next.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.400
 Yeah, but it was it was soup cans that helped it lift into the no, it wasn't.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.600
 It was it wasn't self-propelling, it would tie to the back of a car or a carriage.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.600
 And the carriage would drive along and he would be lifted up by it.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.600
 Cool. That's really cool.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.000
 See, that's more self-heating.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.200
 The Heinz ones were a bit cheaty because you did apply the cigarette, didn't you?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.400
 Oh, yeah. But that's more self-heating.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.200
 And I did read another account of someone who had a self-heating can in World War Two in Germany.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.400
 And they said that you pulled a flap and that ignited an element.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.800
 So like flint or something.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.200
 So it seems like you didn't need a source of flame.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.000
 And in fact, now you you'd use the same thing that this this Russian guy used

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 because there's now something called hot can, which I really want to buy some of these.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 They have they do the same thing.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.600
 They put limestone and water in the space between the inner packet and the outer packet.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:08.600
 And the way you heat it up is you do it comes with a little spike with a thing to come with your can of soup.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.600
 But it comes with a spike and you pierce the water.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.000
 So it mixes with the limestone and it's this reaction like an exothermic reaction.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.200
 And in eight minutes, you've got boiling hot soup.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.400
 That's cool. That's awesome.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.600
 Get it from Harvey Nichols. Four pounds of can.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.200
 I don't believe you. I don't believe a word you say anymore.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.000
 But that's nice that it's sort of upmarket store like Harvey Nichols.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.800
 Because I don't know if we've said before, I think we may have done the first shop to sell baked beans in the UK.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.600
 Heinz baked beans was Fornemann Mason.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.400
 Right.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.000
 Yeah, it was an extremely luxurious product back in the day.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.400
 I guess because it was imported from from America.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.000
 Yeah. That was it. Yeah.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.800
 It was Henry Heinz who came up with it, who was known as the Pickle King.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.800
 And he started growing pickles at the age of eight and selling them.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.000
 Yeah, he was an incredible...

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.600
 Was he growing like because pickles don't grow, right?

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.600
 You have to take a vegetable and you have to pickle it.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.800
 Was he like growing the...

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.000
 Yeah, that's a good point, actually.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 Yeah.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.800
 Yeah.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.400
 Do you know that he's related to Donald Trump?

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.200
 Is he?

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.200
 Yeah, yeah, the Heinz family and the Trump families are related.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.800
 That's how he's so orange is the baked bean.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.600
 Just raw baked beans on his face.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.600
 What's the connection, do you know?

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.200
 Yeah, it's a place called Kallstadt, which is in Germany.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.400
 And both the families came from there.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.600
 Henry Heinz was the second cousin to Frederick Trump,

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.800
 who was the grandfather of Donald Trump.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.600
 Right.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.000
 And if you go to this town, they are much happier with the Heinz connection

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.600
 than they are with the Trump connection.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.200
 Partly because the Heinz family recently provided a major donation

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.000
 for the renovation of the local organ,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.800
 whereas Donald Trump did not contribute to this project.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.000
 Right.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.400
 Well, there's another American political connection

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.200
 in that the great, great, great granddaughter,

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.200
 something in that territory of Heinz,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.600
 is married to John Kerry when he was running and still is married,

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.400
 but when he was running for presidency.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.800
 And so he didn't get the presidency,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.800
 but he got to fall back on those baked bean billions,

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800
 which is millions.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800
 Good consolation.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.600
 Yeah, she was Republican, wasn't she?

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.600
 Theresa.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.600
 Was she, right?

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.200
 And she remained Republican until he said,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.600
 "I'm actually going to run president on the Democrat label.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.400
 Would you mind switching your allegiance?"

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.000
 And then in 2004, she reluctantly was like,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.200
 "Okay, I'll become a Democrat."

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200
 Wow.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.400
 It's a different variety of me for this presidential campaign.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.600
 Well, there are 57 varieties, right?

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.800
 Because Heinz's 57 varieties.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.600
 Yeah, that's why I made the joke about the 57 varieties.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.200
 We should quickly say, because people are screaming at home

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.400
 that there aren't 57 varieties.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.800
 It's just a marxing thing.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.000
 Yeah, it was clever, right?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.800
 There were about 6,000?

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.000
 No, it was more...

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 No, there were lots.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 I think there were a few thousand.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.200
 At the time, there was...

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.200
 Oh, at the time there were already over 60.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.200
 Yeah.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.200
 What it was was, it was the number five and seven.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.200
 I think him and his wife had a favorite number.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.800
 I think his was five, his wife was seven, or vice versa.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.400
 And that's the only reason.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.800
 And he'd seen another product, sort of.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.000
 It was like, you know, 60 different kinds of footwear,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 you know, for one company.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.400
 And he thought, "That's very clever."

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.800
 And now, if you go on the website, they're like,

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.200
 "Oh, it's ridiculous. Of course, we have more than 57.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.400
 "It's just a random number.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.400
 "We actually have more than 5,700."

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.000
 So, again, they've taken that random number.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.600
 They can't get away from it.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.000
 He did experiment with 59 and 51 first,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.600
 which makes me wonder if nine and one

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.400
 were the favorite numbers of his mistresses.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.400
 If...

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.400
 Oh, wow.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.400
 He finally ends up on 57.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.200
 So I looked up Heinz on YouGov, the website,

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.000
 because they have a lot of interesting data.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.600
 Heinz is the brand most liked by women in the UK.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600
 Okay.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.600
 It's one, the sort of...

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.600
 Did they...

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.600
 No, I was going to say, did they make vibrators?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.000
 I don't know why that's COVID to my head.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 It's not one of the 6,000.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.600
 That's a messy night on your own, isn't it?

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.600
 Last couple of years...

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.600
 Traumatizing thing for your husband to walk in on

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.000
 at the end of the night.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 I was just trying to shake the ketchup to get it out.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Oh, my God.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.600
 Is the 10th most popular thing in the UK?

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.600
 Is it, really?

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.600
 Or is...

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.600
 Does that not say to you that people just don't have

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.000
 much of an imagination when asked what's the best thing?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.600
 No, but guess what's number one?

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.000
 Number one of all the things in the UK.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Is it a product?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 I'm not saying anything.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.600
 Is it Canterbury Cathedral?

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.000
 It's not playing to the local audience.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.400
 It's Canterbury Cathedral.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.000
 Not even top thousand, I'm afraid.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Oh.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 I'll give us a clue.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 It's an obvious one.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 A glove.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 A queen?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Like Prince Philip?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Like the queen, but not...

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Buckingham Palace.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 No, Prince Andrew.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 David Assembra.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 David Assembra.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 David Assembra is the most popular thing in the UK.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Then there are a load of charities, you know,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Number seven, Tom Hanks.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Yeah.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Number eight, Heinz.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 Number 10, Lego.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 11, Google Maps.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 This is an interesting one.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Number 31, Queen.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Number 96, The Queen.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Ouch.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Slap in the face for Lizzie.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 She's probably feeling under pressure.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 You know, Heinz made Mayo Chup once.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 What's that?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 Well, it's what it sounds like.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Mayo Lays and Ketchup.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 That's absolutely right.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 It's a combination product, and they launched...

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 I think they launched it in the US a while earlier,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 but they launched it in Canada in 2019,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 at which point the chief of the Kree people,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 you know, one of the First Nations peoples in Canada,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 explained that in the Kree language, it means shit face.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 Oh, no way.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 I got absolutely Mayo Chups last night.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Have you guys heard of Muriel Leto?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 No.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Well, you should have done, because she was the person

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 who came up with the idea of painting Campbell's soup.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 So, you know that Andy Warhol thing?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 So, basically, he didn't know what to do.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 He wanted to get away from what he was doing,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 which was quite similar to another artist called

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Roy Lichtenstein, and he didn't know what to paint.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 And this person called Muriel Leto,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 she said you should paint something that everyone sees every day

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 that everyone recognizes like a can of soup.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 And we know that she said that because she asked for some money.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 She didn't, she said, "I know what you have to do,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 but you need to give me $50 first."

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 And Andy Warhol gave her $50, and she gave him this idea.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 He went straight out, bought a load of soup, decided to paint it,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 and he sold his, or his painting sold in 2006 for $11.7 million.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 And I think everyone would kind of agree that it's not how great

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 the painting is, but it's the idea that's the important part of it.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 And she sold that idea for $50.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Really?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Yeah.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 I can't tell if people are applauding selling the idea really cheaply, or...

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Well, she also wrote er, "Mirotic Novels,"

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 and she was known nickname for a while as the first lady of Hunky Punky.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Oh, cool.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 That deserves a round of applause, doesn't it?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 It was her who pioneered that Heinz vibrator, wasn't it?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Listen, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that Argentina's armed forces

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 have 47 ships, 139 aircraft, and 20 llamas.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Hmm.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Why?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 Well, the ships are to attack things on the water.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 Thank you.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Yeah.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 And aircraft for the Air Force mostly.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 So you're not saying these are the infantry?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 Are they kind of therapy llamas for stressed out soldiers?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 No, no, they are.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 Because the army does lots of other things rather than just being in wars,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 it often has to help infrastructure in the country.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 This is for when they have logistics, they're in the high mountains.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Especially in the pandemic, for instance,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 they've had to get medicines up into the mountains.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 The army have been brought in to help.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 It's not always easy for people to get up there,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 but it's very easy for llamas to get up there.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Then when the llama does get up there on its own, how is it helping?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 Well, it usually...

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 I can't say I'd be real short if I'm dying on a mountain side.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 It's just cute, right?

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 It's just cute.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 People can walk around with it.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 No, it will have a soldier with it,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 but it's a beast of burden that is a llama,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 so they will carry the stuff up there.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Right.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 So it's quite hard to put stuff on a wagon or in a car

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 and get it up to the top of the mountain.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 It's not so hard to put it on the back of a llama.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 Yeah.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 But you can't ride them, can you?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Lamas, no, you'll break their backs.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 They're too fragile to be...

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 Yeah, you shouldn't ride, never ride a llama.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 If you learn one thing tonight.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 Unless you're a child.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 In the aircraft, do they then have...

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Unless, sorry, for calling you off, yes, unless you're a child.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 I didn't want...

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Because I know there are some kids in the audience,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 and you should feel free to ride llamas, I think,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 for the next couple of years, maybe until you hit adolescence.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 As you were, Dan.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 Thank you.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 Yeah, I'm just curious, where they lived inside these boats.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Do they have their own...

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 No, they don't live inside the boats,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 all the airplanes or anything.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 I just...

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 I was listing the things in their armed forces.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 So many questions.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 How did they tailor their uniforms?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Okay.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 Dancer all of his notes.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 How did they sail the ship?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Throw away that page.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Okay.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 They used to use their dung, though, in the Peruvian army,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 to actually...

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 That's why I thought they might be on the ship,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 because their feces is actually useful as petrol

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 for the actual ships.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Oh, really?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Yeah, they used to burn it.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 It's cool.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Yeah, it's a good fuel.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 The Inca people, obviously, were a huge llama keeping culture,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 and they had thousands and thousands.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 The wild llamas as well.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 And their method of hunting llamas was to do the hokey-cokey.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 This is so cool.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 Okay.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 So what?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Left arm in, left arm out?

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Well, you all...

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 Well, hokey-cokey are old langzine,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 depending on how you feel about it.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Basically, what you need to do if you're in the Inca society,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 you gather 50,000 to 60,000 people, quite a lot.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 You surround the llama plane.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 You all join arms, and you slowly move in.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 No, come on.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 You move in.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 You corral the llamas into a smaller and smaller space,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 and then people enter the, you know, the killing zone

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 with slings and bolasses and lassoes and stuff, I guess.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 And you would get up to 30,000 llamas

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 in a single day's hunting that way.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 That's amazing.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Wow.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 It's a lot of pressure, though,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 because if you accidentally let go of someone,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 and they all run through your...

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 They all get out.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 Thank you.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 Yeah, you do the left arm in, left arm out thing,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 which is not a part of the song you're supposed to reenact.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 They did use them in wild the Incas.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 We know that they used a lot.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 We don't know exactly how,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 but we think probably as a beast of burden again.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 But there was one battle where they abandoned

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 15,000 llamas after a battle with the Spanish.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 Whoa.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 So they were using a lot of them.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Yeah.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Okay, fair enough.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 I don't think you feel abandoned

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 if there's 15,000 of you there.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Yeah, that's fair, that's fair.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 The Israeli army uses llamas,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 or at least it used to until 2017,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 and they've started using robots instead.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Wow.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 Robot llamas?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Or...

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Regrettably not.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 They're just like little doggie, doggie robots.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Is that for guarding?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 No, they would use them so when the army was going

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 to get into the mountains,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 they would have llamas with them.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 They would be carrying things.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 They were really useful because they kept cool

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 amidst gunfire.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 So whenever there was gunfire,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 a llama wouldn't shit itself and run away.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 It would just kind of cool.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Wow.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 Yeah, yeah, this is cool.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 That's amazing.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 Ironically, they're very difficult to alarm,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 aren't they?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Yes.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 And they would also,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 if they were in the mountains and got very cold,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 they would lie down with the soldiers

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 and kind of keep them warm,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 because they're very fluffy,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 very wobbly.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Really?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 Yeah, they could lie for up to three days

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 without moving with the soldiers around them

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 if you needed to ambush.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Oh, God.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 Which robots can't do, really.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 I mean, they can stay still,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 but they can't keep you warm at night.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 If you make a very fluffy robot.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 What a self-heating robot.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Like the cans of soups.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Well, llama mating is pretty interesting.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 Just while we're on llamas lying down

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 and keeping each other warm at night.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Because they're really hard to breed.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 There are a few reasons in their natural mating cycle

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 which make them really difficult to breed.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 So they don't breed like us.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 So female llamas release an egg after sex,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 as opposed to the human method of once per month,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 you know, come on May.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 Yeah, I got it.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 But also, llama semen is very lethargic.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 And they are known as dribble ejaculators.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Oh, God.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Jesus Christ.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 It's really...

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 It's so hard to get semen out of a llama.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 It's like getting blood out of a stone.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 That is the worst thing I've ever heard you say.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 But there are great news, guys.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Artificial llama vaginas, which you can buy on the market.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 No one can stop you.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 If you've got the money, you can get one.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 And they come with a kind of hot water bottle

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 to simulate the temperature of a real llama.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 And they also come with a surrounding life size,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 cuddly female llama bottom.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 Wow.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 Yeah.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Just the bottom, then.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 You can if you're feeling flash.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 You can get the full female llama package.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 You can't do that.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 I think you can.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Really?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 I mean, don't.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Well, do what you like, actually, you know.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Oh, do they do checks?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 When you buy the llama vagina,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 do they check that you do have a male llama?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 They should.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 I didn't know.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 I know what you're saying about they can't stop you,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 but it kind of feels like they should be able to stop you.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 They should be able to stop you.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 They should be back on checks.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 Is there a dribble ejaculator in the house?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 How do you know my school nickname?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 They're very sociable.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 We're talking about real llamas now, right?

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Yeah.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Yeah.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 In a platonic way, they may not be good at shagging,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 but they do love each other.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 And that's why they make such good guards.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 So you know people often have a llama to guard their herd of sheep

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 or their herd of goats.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And that's because they get super protective of them.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 So you've got your herd of goats, you've got a llama.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 They're great and they scare away.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 They've been known to kill wolves and stuff occasionally.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 Wow.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 It's very impressive.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 But if you've got a llama guard, do not get two llama guards,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 because the moment that you get a second one,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 it just becomes friends with its llama

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 and ignores all the goats and the sheep.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 And that's them all get ravaged by the wolves.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 There's a golf course in North Carolina called Telemore Golf Course.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 And they have caddies that are llamas.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 So the llamas will carry your golf clubs around with you.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 But one thing that I saw in only one place

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 is that there are golfers who have these llamas.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 And they've noticed that whenever they hit a good shot,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 just before they hit it, the llama gives off a little moan.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 It kind of goes, "Rrrrrrrrr" like that.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 And so you have these golfers who are stood there

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 and they're just waiting to hear,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 they keep moving a little bit this way, a little bit that way.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 And as soon as they hear the moan, they go, "Right!"

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 And then they hit it.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Wow.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 These are the llamas can tell good golf posture.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Yeah.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 That's what it seems like.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Unbelievable.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 That's amazing.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 They do make weird noises.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Like the noise of alarm is, sounds like,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 I can't describe it, it sounds like a rusty door hinge.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 And that is exactly what it's like.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 It's like, "Rrrrrrrrr"

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 Yeah.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 Something out of a horror film.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 But not when they're mating.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 When they're mating, I hesitate to return to the field

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 because everyone lost their shit last time.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 But they are, they orgle.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Orgling is what they do.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Orgling and dribbling.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 They make that noise.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 Really?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 Yeah, they do.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 If you hit orgling, you're in trouble.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Or in luck.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 In luck, yeah.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 There's a dribble coming your way.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 I was on kentlive.com.co.uk

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 reading about llama-related news from this year.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 Yeah.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 British natureism have an event.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 This is actually in East Sussex, but people from Kent can go.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 It's a walking with llamas completely naked night.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Feels, feels it would have been safer to make it a day event.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 Anyway, it was supposed to happen at the start this year.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 I think it might have got cancelled due to COVID.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 But maybe, maybe we'll come back.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Anyway, the British natureism website, it's been taken down.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 But I did notice that on there, weirdly, they sell hoodies, fleeces

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 and 19 different designs of t-shirts

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 on the British natureism website.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 You've got to have something to take off.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Exactly.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 I'm just picturing the horror movie, that scene where it's completely dark.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 You're lost in the woods.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 You're going, "Who is that? I can hear someone."

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 We need to move on to our final fact of the show.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 My fact this week is that for a few days every year,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 Britain's beaches are covered in worm sperm.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Oh, good. More sperm. Okay.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 That's right. It's not the driveling kind.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 It's specifically lug worm sperm.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 And this is incredible.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 So, I was on a beach recently, and I was looking at, you know,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 those lug worm sand spirals you see on pretty much all beaches

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 at low tide.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 They look like long worms made of sand.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 And they're created by lug worms because they dig these burrows

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 and then they deposit these things on top of the burrows.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 But the other thing they do is, the way they mate,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 is the male lug worm, who's in quite a deep burrow on the beach

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 for a couple of days a year, he spurts some sperm out.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 So, when the tide goes out, he spurts his sperm out onto the sand.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 In a little white lump, you can see it if you keep your eyes peeled.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 And when the tide comes in, it gets all this lug worm sperm.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 So, there'll be thousands and thousands of little piles of sperm on the beach.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 The tide comes in and it washes it into the females' burrows,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 and they get a little cascade of sperm coming down.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 And it fertilises their eggs.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 And that's romance.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 It's a circle of life. Yeah.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 It's so amazing how they never... They never meet.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 I mean, so many of us, they never meet. It's like, "You've got mail."

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Or...

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Is that what happens? You've got mail?

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 How do they send it through the pubs?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 Yeah, Tom Hanks sends you mail.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 No, what kind of people like Tom Hanks so much?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 He's fathered most of the people in this country.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Also, they do meet, I know, at the end of "You've got mail."

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 But mostly lug worms...

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 It's like IVF, I would say, would be a better analogy.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Or like, when you go to a sperm bank.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 It's unbelievable. It's also unbelievable that lug worms,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 which I had never heard of, by the way. I don't know if that's especially ignorant,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 I'd never heard of lug worms being a thing before researching this fact,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 that they all mate at exactly the same day, every year.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 You know, the same few days, they just all know to do it.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 We don't know how. They know that either.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Like, we know that there is pheromones involved, right?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 So, when the female notices that there's sperm washing around,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 she'll release her eggs.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 And when the males can tell those eggs around, they release their sperm.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 But what triggers it in the first place? We have no idea.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 And so there's a thing called sperm watch, which is...

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 It's on after spring watch, isn't it?

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 It's the late night version.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 The red button.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 And what they want is for people to, like, tell them when they see this stuff on the beach.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 So you will see this little pile of, you know, white stuff on the beach.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 They say, "Don't confuse it with seagull poo."

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 It looks a lot like seagull poo.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 But if you see these things that look like seagull poo,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 but they're in little ponds, then tell them, and then hopefully we can work out what it is.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 It might be the temperature. It might be a change in weather. We're just not sure.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Yeah. I love, though, like, as you say, this is a citizen thing,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 and there was a big website and big PR push.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 And they were like, you know, this is like, for anyone of any age, go out.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 But as James points out, someone decided to call it sperm watch.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 And it just feels the most inappropriate.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 And it was things like, you go on their site, and for any would-be sperm spotters, again,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 you get a pencil and a clipboard.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 Well, this is what they ask you to take, a pencil, a clipboard,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 tied tables and a recording sheet.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 And the idea is that you've got to run around,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 and I think you have to see how many you can spot in ten minutes,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 or the time it takes to find a hundred of them to know that this is an area that's fucking-

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 It's a fun game. It's like Pokemon Go.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 It is. Yeah. It's like Pokemon Goo.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Can I just tell you the one... So, Anna, you said that the casts they have on the beach,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 as in they live in a burrow in a U-shaped burrow, and they eat food at one end,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 and then they just poo it out at the other end of the burrow,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 and they're in this U-shape, and that's what produces the cast.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 The headline of this on the Barry Today website was,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 "The love life of lug worms involves the casts of thousands."

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 - Nice. - How good is that?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 - Lovely. - What's the burrow today?

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 - Just for people called Barry. - Yeah, okay.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 How did you get on it?

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 So there are two types in the UK, two species, the blow lug worms and the black lug worms,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 and what I find incredible is how deep they go and how big they are,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 because there's little coils of sand. You're expecting a small little worm,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 but the black lug worm can be 40 centimetres long,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 so like half a metre long, practically, and it burrows down about 70 centimetres.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 So you need to dig pretty far, because people dig for these quite a lot.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 They're very useful as fishing bait, but you need to dig a long way to get one little worm,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 and then they're not little. - No, that's true.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 I watch the movie Dune this weekend, and this really spoiled it for me,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 because all the way through I was like, these massive worms that live underneath the dunes in Dune,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 how are they reproducing? Where are their casts?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 Anyway, the other people in the cinema did not appreciate those questions.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 Their breathing is pretty amazing, so they can breathe.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 There was a big mystery about how they could breathe so long when the tide goes out,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 and when it comes in, and they worked out it was something like six hours that they could survive,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 and they studied it and looked into what was going on, and it turns out that they have...

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 So if we... God, it's science, I get a bit stuck,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 but the hemoglobin thing, so in human blood, one hemoglobin protein holds four oxygen molecules at a time.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 The lug worm, it's 156, and it's insane, and what they've done is they've isolated it,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 and they've applied it to medicine now, and it's a huge thing for transplants

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 of any things like liver and so on, because it means that you can hold it.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 If they're pushing this hemoglobin new product that they've created,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 you can make it last for days rather than hours for a transplant needing to happen.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 It's a game changer. - It's because they breathe through gills.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 So they breathe through gills, and then they take in a huge amount of oxygen,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 and there was one French scientist called Frank Zell who found this out in the '90s,

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 and the amazing thing about lug worm blood is it's compatible with all blood types,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 because the hemoglobin is not anchored to red blood cells, so this is really exciting.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 There is a factory in France which produces over a million lug worms a year,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 each of them producing a tiny amount of blood, but that has been used in kidney transplants.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 It makes people recover faster, it improves their organ function.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 They are so incredible. - It's still being tested a little there, isn't it?

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 But they are using it in real life things, and the first person to have a double face transplant

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 use this stuff, by which I mean he didn't end up with two faces at the end.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 He had a face put on, it rejected, and he had another one done.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 - Yeah, he wasn't like, "Can I get one on the back as well? That'll look cool."

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 - I was reading about blood worms, which are very similar.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 In fact, I was reading about sand worms in general, of which a lug worm is a type,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 and in Maine, in America, it's one of the main sandworm digging up industries.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 So Maine employs about a thousand people who go and dig up lug worms and blood worms

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 and sell them to anglers.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 And I just really enjoyed this. It was a New York Times article from 1976,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 so I don't know if it's still the case, but you basically get blood worm hunters

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 and sand worm hunters, and the sand worms are a bit more free-swimming

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 and the blood worms are a bit more burrowing, like our lug worms.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 And apparently, they're two extremely separate groups.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 It's like the People's Front of Judea and the Judean People's Front. They hate each other.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 And the blood worms have a reputation, apparently, for real roughness.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 And in fact, there was a strike of all of the sandwormers and blood worms in 1976.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 And when both groups were striking, the blood worms told the sandwormers

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 that if they dared to accept an offer for, like, a pay increase

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 that didn't involve a pay increase also for the blood worms,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 the blood worms said they would go and tear up all of their mudflats

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 which they used to do their harvesting.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 Wow. That's a menacing phrase to hear.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 "I'll tear up your mudflats."

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 It could mean any number of things.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 We're going to have to wrap up in a second.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 Can I just tell you, there's a giant beach worm in Australia

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 which is one centimetre wide and three metres long.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 Did you say giant? Yeah.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 And did you say centimetres?

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 Sorry, I just watched June this weekend.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 Okay. Not 400 metres. Yeah, yeah.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 Wow. So what's it do?

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 It just wriggles around.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 But no, three metres.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 It's very, very long and only a tiny bit wide.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 It's a really strange organism.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 It's a strong fisherman, isn't it, that puts that on the end of his rod.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 A whole fishing line is the worm.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 Yeah. A plot twist.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 Go on.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Well, I can tell you there is a new taste in town.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 Okay. So there's salty and bitter and all that kind of stuff.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 We've talked about umami on this show,

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 I'm pretty sure, in our QI as well.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 There's also a thing called kokumi.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 And kokumi is something, it doesn't really taste of anything,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 but it makes other tastes enhanced.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 And we have a special receptor in our tongue,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 so we know it does count as a proper taste.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 Anyway, you find it in fish sperm.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 Wow.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 The caviar menu at Fido's Restaurant and Grill

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 just got a new option.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 Do you know what's so weird is that I was reading about kokumi

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 for the first fact we mentioned today,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 because cats love it.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 And they deliberately try and get kokumi and umami into cat food.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 So there we go.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 Wait a minute, it also tastes a bit like caviar.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 So maybe the water does taste of caviar.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 It's all coming together.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 How beautiful. We've tied it all up in a bow.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 There we go. A good point to end on then.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 That is it. That is all of our facts.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
