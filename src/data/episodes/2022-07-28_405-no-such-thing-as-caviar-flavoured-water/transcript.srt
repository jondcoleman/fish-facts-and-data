00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,400
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Canterbury!

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,300
 [applause]

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:38,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin,

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,400
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:50,200
 and in no particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:57,600
 My fact is that, if it's served carefully enough, nobody can tell the difference between pate and dog food.

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,800
 You've all been wasting your money all these years.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,000
 I'm not coming to your restaurant. How do you serve it if, what's the difference?

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,800
 Well, this was a study done by the American Association of Wine Economists in 2009,

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,300
 who I guess just got bored of studying wine and sort of branched out into wine-affiliated foods like pate.

13
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,900
 And they basically, they were trying to work out if people could tell the difference.

14
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,600
 So, the researchers, they blended up some dog food, that's what they did, until it looked like liver mousse, basically.

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,500
 And then they had about, I think, 18 subjects and they challenged them to work out which was dog food and which was not.

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:39,300
 And about one person in six guessed dog food, but there were six samples.

17
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,200
 So, there is no better than chance, effectively, that people can tell.

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,400
 I should say, you're being a bit unfair, Andy. They also garnished it with parsley.

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,800
 Sorry. Sorry. Everything had parsley on.

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,400
 So, the really weird thing about this is that people knew it was horrible, but they just didn't know it wasn't pate.

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,100
 They knew that one of the things was dog food, but 72% of the people who tasted it said,

22
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,700
 "Well, that is the worst thing in this whole array of samples."

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,300
 But most of them, five and six, did not say that the dog food.

24
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,200
 So, presumably, they thought, "This is disgusting, but that can't possibly..."

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,400
 Do they think dog food tastes better than it does?

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,000
 I think, yeah, I think they did. And I think the researchers had told them,

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,100
 "Don't worry, we're not going to feed you something horrible."

28
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,500
 And they tasted that and they said, "Well, that is horrible, so it can't be the dog food."

29
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,800
 So, should we be eating dog food?

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
 No. No. Okay.

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
 Why not? Why not?

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,700
 Sounds like we think it's horrible. We just don't think it's dog food, but we still don't enjoy it.

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,900
 But I like pate.

34
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,700
 It tastes worse. 70% of people think it tastes worse.

35
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,100
 The worst out of all the pates they were given.

36
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,400
 It still tastes like a bad pate, which I think I'd still like.

37
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,000
 So, okay. To be honest, it wasn't the worst tasting thing there.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,300
 That was the liver worst. It was probably the worst tasting because they had liver worst,

39
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,700
 duck liver mousse, pork liver pate and spam.

40
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,300
 Oh, God!

41
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,100
 And the liver worst, I think, was the one that they most often thought was pet food, right?

42
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,700
 Yeah.

43
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,400
 Pizarre.

44
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,100
 And turns out, a journalist did a very unscientific study just asking her friends to feed a bunch of stuff to their dogs.

45
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,200
 And dogs also prefer the taste of actual pate to dog food.

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,500
 Unsurprisingly, as anyone who has a dog knows, they always want to eat human food more than they want to eat dog food.

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,400
 But that's for variety, right?

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,400
 That's why I think if I had dog food, I'd be like, "Man, that feels really nice."

49
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,600
 But, you know, if I had it every night, I'd be…

50
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,900
 There's nothing to stop you from having dog food, though.

51
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,700
 And if you come down to my new restaurant, Fido's, you can have it every night.

52
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,100
 I wonder, though, if it's the same with dogs, that they're sort of, you know,

53
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,400
 whether or not they're tricked into thinking they think something is tasty.

54
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,900
 For example, there's an adventure he was called Charleston Ellis.

55
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:50,200
 He's the guy who created a dog biscuit that was shaped like a bone, rather than it just being a biscuit.

56
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,400
 And when he shaped it into a bone, suddenly his dog that he was testing it on really liked it.

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,100
 And there's this quote where he says that he says, "To this day," and this is in 1936,

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,500
 "I cannot tell whether my dog is interested in the bone-shaped biscuit because it fools him as such."

59
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,700
 He's like, "Ah, it's a bone." Or, "Whether after my shaping the biscuit in an effort to cater to his taste,

60
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,600
 he feels duty-bound to fool his master by simulating an interest in it."

61
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,100
 Yeah, possible.

62
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,000
 Very polite dog he's got there.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,800
 What you're saying about dogs preferring human food is interesting,

64
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,600
 because I don't have a dog, and I didn't know that.

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,200
 But I thought that the whole point of dog food was that you had to make it taste disgusting enough for dogs to like.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,800
 That's what they say, isn't it?

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,900
 And this is particularly what they do with treats.

68
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,100
 Dog treats is they add stuff like, is it cadaverine and putrescine?

69
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,700
 So it's things that smell like rotting corpses and rotting food to us.

70
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,200
 Talk about it does exactly what it says on the tin.

71
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
 But that's apparently what they like. This is what they claim,

72
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,400
 is that the more repulsive it smells to us, the more delicious it is to pets.

73
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,700
 And so that's what they add to...

74
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,000
 And I think we might have said before on the show that sometimes you get humans who taste the dog food.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,600
 But I read that the reason they do that is more because you don't want the humans to be disgusted

76
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,000
 when they're feeding their dogs, otherwise they won't buy that kind of dog food.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,800
 It's not about taste being good for humans.

78
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,500
 It's about us not being disgusted when we put it in a bowl.

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 That's interesting, because I was reading a dog food manufacturer who was saying

80
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,000
 the hardest thing about it is to make something that's not repulsive to humans.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,800
 Because what dogs like is like feces, roadkill, vomit.

82
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,300
 I probably won't have the starter, I mean.

83
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,100
 And if you serve something that's a combination of feces, roadkill and vomit,

84
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,300
 the human owners do tend to bulk at it.

85
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,100
 Yes.

86
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,500
 That gets challenged.

87
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,900
 Have you guys heard the phrase "eating your own dog food"?

88
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,500
 No.

89
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,100
 So this is not a phrase I've heard. I think it's an American thing.

90
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,900
 You can imagine what it means though.

91
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,500
 Trying something...

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,600
 It's from the business world.

93
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
 It's...

94
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
 Oh, let's say you're Microsoft.

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,800
 Yes.

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,200
 You want people who work at Microsoft to be using Microsoft products, you know.

97
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,700
 Okay.

98
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,100
 So you want, you know, the proof of the pudding is in the...

99
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,500
 Are you using another better metaphor to explain your shittier metaphor?

100
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,900
 Yeah, I think I was.

101
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,400
 But yeah, you should be comfortable trying your own product

102
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,100
 and you should believe in it enough that you can honestly recommend it to other people, you know,

103
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,900
 and you should be eating your own dog food, anyway.

104
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,300
 But that doesn't make any sense, because you're not recommending it to other people.

105
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,400
 You're recommending it to dogs.

106
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,900
 It would make sense if Bill Gates was trying to market computers to cats.

107
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,100
 But he's not.

108
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,200
 Okay.

109
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,900
 Okay.

110
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,600
 All right, now we've all acknowledged the structural flaws in the metaphor.

111
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,900
 There was a man called Mitch Felderhoff who actually did eat his own dog food last year,

112
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,000
 because he lives in Texas and he owns a dog food firm,

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,400
 and he did it for a month.

114
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,700
 Only eight products that his firm made.

115
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,400
 Cool.

116
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,100
 He got approval from his doctor and his wife crucially before he started,

117
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,400
 because of what I imagine his breath was like.

118
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,600
 And he did say,

119
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,300
 "One of the things I did that was key is that I did do some intermittent fasting,

120
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,800
 i.e. some meals, I just didn't need anything at all."

121
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,400
 There was a woman in America called Dorothy Hunter who did the same thing in 2014.

122
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,000
 She worked for a company called The Honest Kitchen,

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,200
 and for a month, again, she ate nothing but dog food.

124
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,800
 She said that she didn't add any seasoning, but she heard that hot sauce is good.

125
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,700
 Who she heard that from, and maybe your name, I'm not sure.

126
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,700
 But she said the main problem is that humans are social eaters,

127
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,200
 and socially, this has been very hard.

128
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,900
 So I can imagine her going at a dinner party for her friends

129
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,300
 and bringing a pedigree chum with her and whatever.

130
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,800
 They just put it on the floor in the corner.

131
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,500
 The word pate, originally meant pet food.

132
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,200
 Did it?

133
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,900
 Yeah.

134
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,200
 It appeared in the 18th century, I think, in France.

135
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,500
 It had its first use, it had a doubly.

136
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,300
 Its first use was specifically about chicken food.

137
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,100
 And when I was looking through sources that refer to pate,

138
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,200
 it goes right up until the end of the 19th century,

139
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,800
 pate refers to chicken food.

140
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,300
 And then it broadened to mean kind of breadcrumbs and bits of meat

141
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,800
 that you'd give to any pet.

142
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,900
 And then somehow it became pate.

143
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,700
 Wow.

144
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,300
 Yeah.

145
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,000
 No wonder they couldn't tell the difference.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,900
 Maybe they're from the 15th century or whatever.

147
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,300
 That's what it was.

148
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,700
 You know that if they're given the choice, dogs will not give humans treats.

149
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,500
 Oh.

150
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,300
 What do you mean?

151
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,400
 As in, researchers trained 37 dogs to press a button

152
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,800
 which would give them a treat.

153
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,100
 Yeah.

154
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,600
 Okay, so the dogs were well familiar with the fact

155
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,400
 that pressing this button gives a treat, provides a treat.

156
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,400
 And then the button was placed in another room.

157
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,000
 Oh, the humans were placed next door with the button

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,100
 and the dogs would beg.

159
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,400
 The dogs would beg, beg, beg, please press this button

160
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,900
 so I get a treat falling into my room.

161
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,200
 Yeah.

162
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,100
 Anyway, the situation was then reversed

163
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
 and the button was put into the room with the dog.

164
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,400
 And no matter what the humans did, the dogs did not care.

165
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,100
 They pressed the button no greater for the people

166
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,200
 who had given them treats.

167
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,900
 They're for the people who hadn't given them treats.

168
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,100
 What a great experiment.

169
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,900
 Do you think they'd take us for walks if we needed it?

170
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,700
 Sounds like no.

171
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,300
 Sounds like no.

172
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,500
 They're not doing anything.

173
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
 Well, no, but that's different

174
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,700
 because then we'd be shitting all over their furniture and that's...

175
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,700
 Are they doing this because they're mean or stupid?

176
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,500
 Do they know?

177
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,000
 I think.

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,300
 I think it's stupid.

179
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,700
 Do you think?

180
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,300
 Because I think my cat would not just not press the button

181
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,300
 but would also probably unplug it so no one else can get a treat.

182
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,700
 Do dogs and cats can taste water?

183
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,200
 Yeah, I can taste water.

184
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,000
 You can't?

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,700
 Yes, I can.

186
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,500
 Only if you put black currants in it, Dan.

187
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,900
 Yeah, you can taste squash.

188
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,700
 No, you can taste from a tap.

189
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,300
 It's sort of, I guess that's probably like the metals and stuff.

190
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,100
 You basically can't.

191
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,900
 I mean, there are some studies that say water has a bit of a sour taste,

192
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,100
 but essentially humans don't have specific taste receptors for water,

193
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,300
 which is why it's so bland and crap and we have to make squash.

194
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,700
 Whereas dogs and cats, the reason you don't get a dog and cat squash

195
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,600
 is that they've got specific receptors on the tip of their tongue.

196
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,100
 Those are discovered in the 1950s.

197
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,900
 They found it first on frogs and then thought,

198
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,700
 oh, I wonder what else can taste water?

199
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,200
 And when you drop water onto the tongues of like sedated cats and dogs,

200
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,000
 it stimulates all these receptors.

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
 I don't suppose we know what it tastes like.

202
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,900
 So they're just watery, I guess.

203
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,500
 They say it tastes like caviar.

204
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,900
 Yeah, really?

205
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,800
 No, they don't know.

206
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,100
 Fallen for the old classic Anna Prank.

207
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,400
 They refuse to tell us.

208
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,600
 I can't believe I fell right in the trap.

209
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,300
 I was out with my in-laws on a walk recently and they have a dog called Benji

210
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,600
 and Benji started licking really disgusting puddle.

211
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,200
 And like, you know, and I was like, Benji.

212
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,900
 And I said that and they said, no, it's fine.

213
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,700
 And I haven't had a dog for years.

214
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,400
 Why, what does that taste like to them?

215
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,700
 And why can they survive?

216
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,400
 Because that would.

217
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,800
 Well, it might have feces and roadkill in which case it's chef's kiss.

218
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,900
 That's their ribina, is it?

219
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,400
 They do tend to prefer a puddle.

220
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,600
 And our dog loves to whee in a puddle at the same time as drinking from it,

221
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,000
 which I think is a nice touch.

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,400
 I feel like it's almost a perpetual motion machine, isn't it?

223
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,000
 We could use it to power something.

224
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,700
 It's renewable energy.

225
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,500
 It is time for fact number two.

226
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,900
 And that is my fact.

227
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,900
 My fact this week is that during World War Two,

228
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,100
 Heinz developed a self-heating can of soup to work it.

229
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,000
 It had to be lit like a bomb.

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,200
 Unfortunately, it very often exploded like one too.

231
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,800
 So this was a pretty remarkable thing.

232
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,500
 During the war efforts, when they were going out,

233
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,300
 there was this big problem that they had terrible food

234
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,700
 and they wanted to have better food.

235
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,300
 And to cook food was kind of a giveaway

236
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,400
 because you would have to start fires and so on.

237
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,900
 And it would just be a giveaway to where an army might be.

238
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,900
 So Heinz along with the army, they developed this self-heating can

239
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,800
 which effectively looked like a can that had a wick sticking out.

240
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,900
 So like a bomb.

241
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,800
 And soldiers were encouraged to light it using cigarette, lit cigarettes.

242
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,400
 And it would take about four minutes to heat the can.

243
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,400
 But before you lit it, you were meant to puncture holes into it.

244
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,700
 And if you punctured the holes in the wrong way, which often happened,

245
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,200
 the can would then heat up in such a way that it would lead to an explosion.

246
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,900
 If you'd be covered in tomato soup, everyone would be like,

247
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,900
 "It's blood! He's hit by a bomb!"

248
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,400
 It was a very confusing time.

249
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,800
 And this kind of often happened.

250
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
 In some cases, it wasn't even to do with the puncturing.

251
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,600
 Just there was faulty cans and so on.

252
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,400
 So there were people talking about cans exploding at Normandy.

253
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,000
 There was tomato soup everywhere, you know, and getting scolded.

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,400
 You would feel so embarrassed if you were injured on Normandy beaches

255
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,000
 by a malfunctioning tin of soup.

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 As you collected your military cross.

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,400
 What was it for again? Just getting into it at Normandy.

258
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,800
 There was one account where they were just trying these out.

259
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
 I think this was in 1944.

260
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,500
 There was a fertility of ships off the South Coast of Britain.

261
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,700
 And it was the first time they'd seen these.

262
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,600
 And I think it seems like you're supposed to put holes in the top of the can.

263
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,100
 And someone put them in the sides.

264
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,700
 And then the can was at head height.

265
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,000
 And it sprayed directly into his ears, apparently.

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,700
 And he got very badly scolded is because it was it was heated by a heating element inside the can.

267
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,000
 It was so it got very hot and the can itself got extremely hot.

268
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,300
 It was health and safety nightmare.

269
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:13,400
 Yeah, they often I mean, it's what they said about the Second World War in Toto.

270
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,900
 They got very hot and some soldiers.

271
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,800
 I don't know if this was after they'd used the they poured the soup out,

272
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,400
 but they would use the cans effectively as a hot water bottle in the colder places that they were at.

273
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,500
 Because they were just they got so hot you had to handle them with a cloth.

274
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,400
 And so, yeah, and they used to attach them onto the side of bombs, right?

275
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,600
 And that's why we got the term souped up weapons.

276
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,900
 Yeah, no, you're not going to fall for that one like I felt the cover up.

277
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,600
 I was so close, but because of what she did to you earlier was a bit more on edge.

278
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,800
 The self-heating can was invented in 1879 by a guy called Yevgeny Fyodorov from Russia.

279
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,000
 His had quick lime in it and water and you would twist the bottom

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,200
 and the two things would mix and they would warm up.

281
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,800
 Unfortunately, it didn't really warm them up very much.

282
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,400
 So you just you had this stew, but it was kind of a lukewarm stew.

283
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,400
 And he was also the first person that I could find who made a plane in Russia, Fyodorov.

284
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,600
 So yeah, he's a proper engineer.

285
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,000
 That's a big leap up, isn't it? Self-heating soup can one day, plane the next.

286
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,400
 Yeah, but it was it was soup cans that helped it lift into the no, it wasn't.

287
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,600
 It was it wasn't self-propelling, it would tie to the back of a car or a carriage.

288
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 And the carriage would drive along and he would be lifted up by it.

289
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
 Cool. That's really cool.

290
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,000
 See, that's more self-heating.

291
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,200
 The Heinz ones were a bit cheaty because you did apply the cigarette, didn't you?

292
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,400
 Oh, yeah. But that's more self-heating.

293
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,200
 And I did read another account of someone who had a self-heating can in World War Two in Germany.

294
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,400
 And they said that you pulled a flap and that ignited an element.

295
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,800
 So like flint or something.

296
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,200
 So it seems like you didn't need a source of flame.

297
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,000
 And in fact, now you you'd use the same thing that this this Russian guy used

298
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 because there's now something called hot can, which I really want to buy some of these.

299
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 They have they do the same thing.

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,600
 They put limestone and water in the space between the inner packet and the outer packet.

301
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,600
 And the way you heat it up is you do it comes with a little spike with a thing to come with your can of soup.

302
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
 But it comes with a spike and you pierce the water.

303
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,000
 So it mixes with the limestone and it's this reaction like an exothermic reaction.

304
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,200
 And in eight minutes, you've got boiling hot soup.

305
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,400
 That's cool. That's awesome.

306
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,600
 Get it from Harvey Nichols. Four pounds of can.

307
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,200
 I don't believe you. I don't believe a word you say anymore.

308
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,000
 But that's nice that it's sort of upmarket store like Harvey Nichols.

309
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,800
 Because I don't know if we've said before, I think we may have done the first shop to sell baked beans in the UK.

310
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,600
 Heinz baked beans was Fornemann Mason.

311
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,400
 Right.

312
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,000
 Yeah, it was an extremely luxurious product back in the day.

313
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,400
 I guess because it was imported from from America.

314
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,000
 Yeah. That was it. Yeah.

315
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,800
 It was Henry Heinz who came up with it, who was known as the Pickle King.

316
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,800
 And he started growing pickles at the age of eight and selling them.

317
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,000
 Yeah, he was an incredible...

318
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,600
 Was he growing like because pickles don't grow, right?

319
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
 You have to take a vegetable and you have to pickle it.

320
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,800
 Was he like growing the...

321
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
 Yeah, that's a good point, actually.

322
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Yeah.

323
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,800
 Yeah.

324
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,400
 Do you know that he's related to Donald Trump?

325
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,200
 Is he?

326
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,200
 Yeah, yeah, the Heinz family and the Trump families are related.

327
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,800
 That's how he's so orange is the baked bean.

328
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,600
 Just raw baked beans on his face.

329
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
 What's the connection, do you know?

330
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,200
 Yeah, it's a place called Kallstadt, which is in Germany.

331
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,400
 And both the families came from there.

332
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,600
 Henry Heinz was the second cousin to Frederick Trump,

333
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,800
 who was the grandfather of Donald Trump.

334
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,600
 Right.

335
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,000
 And if you go to this town, they are much happier with the Heinz connection

336
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,600
 than they are with the Trump connection.

337
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,200
 Partly because the Heinz family recently provided a major donation

338
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,000
 for the renovation of the local organ,

339
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,800
 whereas Donald Trump did not contribute to this project.

340
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,000
 Right.

341
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,400
 Well, there's another American political connection

342
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,200
 in that the great, great, great granddaughter,

343
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
 something in that territory of Heinz,

344
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,600
 is married to John Kerry when he was running and still is married,

345
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,400
 but when he was running for presidency.

346
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,800
 And so he didn't get the presidency,

347
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
 but he got to fall back on those baked bean billions,

348
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
 which is millions.

349
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
 Good consolation.

350
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,600
 Yeah, she was Republican, wasn't she?

351
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
 Theresa.

352
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
 Was she, right?

353
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,200
 And she remained Republican until he said,

354
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,600
 "I'm actually going to run president on the Democrat label.

355
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,400
 Would you mind switching your allegiance?"

356
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
 And then in 2004, she reluctantly was like,

357
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,200
 "Okay, I'll become a Democrat."

358
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
 Wow.

359
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,400
 It's a different variety of me for this presidential campaign.

360
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,600
 Well, there are 57 varieties, right?

361
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,800
 Because Heinz's 57 varieties.

362
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,600
 Yeah, that's why I made the joke about the 57 varieties.

363
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,200
 We should quickly say, because people are screaming at home

364
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,400
 that there aren't 57 varieties.

365
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,800
 It's just a marxing thing.

366
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,000
 Yeah, it was clever, right?

367
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,800
 There were about 6,000?

368
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,000
 No, it was more...

369
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 No, there were lots.

370
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 I think there were a few thousand.

371
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
 At the time, there was...

372
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
 Oh, at the time there were already over 60.

373
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
 Yeah.

374
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,200
 What it was was, it was the number five and seven.

375
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
 I think him and his wife had a favorite number.

376
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,800
 I think his was five, his wife was seven, or vice versa.

377
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,400
 And that's the only reason.

378
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,800
 And he'd seen another product, sort of.

379
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,000
 It was like, you know, 60 different kinds of footwear,

380
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 you know, for one company.

381
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,400
 And he thought, "That's very clever."

382
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

383
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,800
 And now, if you go on the website, they're like,

384
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,200
 "Oh, it's ridiculous. Of course, we have more than 57.

385
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,400
 "It's just a random number.

386
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
 "We actually have more than 5,700."

387
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,000
 So, again, they've taken that random number.

388
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,600
 They can't get away from it.

389
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,000
 He did experiment with 59 and 51 first,

390
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
 which makes me wonder if nine and one

391
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,400
 were the favorite numbers of his mistresses.

392
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
 If...

393
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
 Oh, wow.

394
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
 He finally ends up on 57.

395
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,200
 So I looked up Heinz on YouGov, the website,

396
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,000
 because they have a lot of interesting data.

397
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,600
 Heinz is the brand most liked by women in the UK.

398
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
 Okay.

399
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
 It's one, the sort of...

400
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
 Did they...

401
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
 No, I was going to say, did they make vibrators?

402
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,000
 I don't know why that's COVID to my head.

403
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 It's not one of the 6,000.

404
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,600
 That's a messy night on your own, isn't it?

405
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
 Last couple of years...

406
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,600
 Traumatizing thing for your husband to walk in on

407
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
 at the end of the night.

408
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 I was just trying to shake the ketchup to get it out.

409
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Oh, my God.

410
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,600
 Is the 10th most popular thing in the UK?

411
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
 Is it, really?

412
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
 Or is...

413
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
 Does that not say to you that people just don't have

414
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,000
 much of an imagination when asked what's the best thing?

415
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,600
 No, but guess what's number one?

416
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,000
 Number one of all the things in the UK.

417
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Is it a product?

418
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I'm not saying anything.

419
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,600
 Is it Canterbury Cathedral?

420
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,000
 It's not playing to the local audience.

421
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,400
 It's Canterbury Cathedral.

422
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,000
 Not even top thousand, I'm afraid.

423
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Oh.

424
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I'll give us a clue.

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 It's an obvious one.

426
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 A glove.

427
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 A queen?

428
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Like Prince Philip?

429
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Like the queen, but not...

430
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Buckingham Palace.

431
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 No, Prince Andrew.

432
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 David Assembra.

433
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 David Assembra.

434
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 David Assembra is the most popular thing in the UK.

435
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Then there are a load of charities, you know,

436
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research.

437
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Number seven, Tom Hanks.

438
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Yeah.

439
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Number eight, Heinz.

440
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Number 10, Lego.

441
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 11, Google Maps.

442
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 This is an interesting one.

443
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Number 31, Queen.

444
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Number 96, The Queen.

445
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Ouch.

446
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Slap in the face for Lizzie.

447
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 She's probably feeling under pressure.

448
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 You know, Heinz made Mayo Chup once.

449
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 What's that?

450
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Well, it's what it sounds like.

451
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Mayo Lays and Ketchup.

452
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 That's absolutely right.

453
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 It's a combination product, and they launched...

454
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 I think they launched it in the US a while earlier,

455
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 but they launched it in Canada in 2019,

456
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 at which point the chief of the Kree people,

457
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 you know, one of the First Nations peoples in Canada,

458
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 explained that in the Kree language, it means shit face.

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Oh, no way.

460
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 I got absolutely Mayo Chups last night.

461
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Have you guys heard of Muriel Leto?

462
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 No.

463
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Well, you should have done, because she was the person

464
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 who came up with the idea of painting Campbell's soup.

465
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 So, you know that Andy Warhol thing?

466
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Yeah, yeah.

467
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 So, basically, he didn't know what to do.

468
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 He wanted to get away from what he was doing,

469
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 which was quite similar to another artist called

470
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Roy Lichtenstein, and he didn't know what to paint.

471
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And this person called Muriel Leto,

472
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 she said you should paint something that everyone sees every day

473
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 that everyone recognizes like a can of soup.

474
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 And we know that she said that because she asked for some money.

475
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 She didn't, she said, "I know what you have to do,

476
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 but you need to give me $50 first."

477
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And Andy Warhol gave her $50, and she gave him this idea.

478
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 He went straight out, bought a load of soup, decided to paint it,

479
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 and he sold his, or his painting sold in 2006 for $11.7 million.

480
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And I think everyone would kind of agree that it's not how great

481
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 the painting is, but it's the idea that's the important part of it.

482
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And she sold that idea for $50.

483
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Really?

484
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Yeah.

485
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 I can't tell if people are applauding selling the idea really cheaply, or...

486
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Well, she also wrote er, "Mirotic Novels,"

487
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 and she was known nickname for a while as the first lady of Hunky Punky.

488
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Oh, cool.

489
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 That deserves a round of applause, doesn't it?

490
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 It was her who pioneered that Heinz vibrator, wasn't it?

491
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Listen, we need to move on to our next fact.

492
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

493
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that Argentina's armed forces

494
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 have 47 ships, 139 aircraft, and 20 llamas.

495
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Hmm.

496
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Why?

497
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Well, the ships are to attack things on the water.

498
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Thank you.

499
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Yeah.

500
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And aircraft for the Air Force mostly.

501
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 So you're not saying these are the infantry?

502
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Are they kind of therapy llamas for stressed out soldiers?

503
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 No, no, they are.

504
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Because the army does lots of other things rather than just being in wars,

505
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 it often has to help infrastructure in the country.

506
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 This is for when they have logistics, they're in the high mountains.

507
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Especially in the pandemic, for instance,

508
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 they've had to get medicines up into the mountains.

509
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 The army have been brought in to help.

510
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 It's not always easy for people to get up there,

511
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 but it's very easy for llamas to get up there.

512
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Then when the llama does get up there on its own, how is it helping?

513
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Well, it usually...

514
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 I can't say I'd be real short if I'm dying on a mountain side.

515
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 It's just cute, right?

516
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 It's just cute.

517
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 People can walk around with it.

518
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 No, it will have a soldier with it,

519
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 but it's a beast of burden that is a llama,

520
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 so they will carry the stuff up there.

521
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Right.

522
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 So it's quite hard to put stuff on a wagon or in a car

523
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and get it up to the top of the mountain.

524
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 It's not so hard to put it on the back of a llama.

525
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Yeah.

526
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 But you can't ride them, can you?

527
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Lamas, no, you'll break their backs.

528
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 They're too fragile to be...

529
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Yeah, you shouldn't ride, never ride a llama.

530
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 If you learn one thing tonight.

531
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Unless you're a child.

532
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 In the aircraft, do they then have...

533
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Unless, sorry, for calling you off, yes, unless you're a child.

534
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I didn't want...

535
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Because I know there are some kids in the audience,

536
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 and you should feel free to ride llamas, I think,

537
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 for the next couple of years, maybe until you hit adolescence.

538
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 As you were, Dan.

539
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Thank you.

540
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 [LAUGHTER]

541
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Yeah, I'm just curious, where they lived inside these boats.

542
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Do they have their own...

543
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 No, they don't live inside the boats,

544
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 all the airplanes or anything.

545
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I just...

546
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 I was listing the things in their armed forces.

547
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 So many questions.

548
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 How did they tailor their uniforms?

549
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 [LAUGHTER]

550
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Okay.

551
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Dancer all of his notes.

552
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 How did they sail the ship?

553
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 [LAUGHTER]

554
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Throw away that page.

555
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Okay.

556
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 They used to use their dung, though, in the Peruvian army,

557
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 to actually...

558
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 That's why I thought they might be on the ship,

559
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 because their feces is actually useful as petrol

560
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 for the actual ships.

561
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Oh, really?

562
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Yeah, they used to burn it.

563
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 It's cool.

564
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Yeah, it's a good fuel.

565
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 The Inca people, obviously, were a huge llama keeping culture,

566
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 and they had thousands and thousands.

567
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 The wild llamas as well.

568
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And their method of hunting llamas was to do the hokey-cokey.

569
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 [LAUGHTER]

570
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 This is so cool.

571
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Okay.

572
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 So what?

573
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Left arm in, left arm out?

574
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Well, you all...

575
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Well, hokey-cokey are old langzine,

576
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 depending on how you feel about it.

577
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Basically, what you need to do if you're in the Inca society,

578
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 you gather 50,000 to 60,000 people, quite a lot.

579
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 [LAUGHTER]

580
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 You surround the llama plane.

581
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 You all join arms, and you slowly move in.

582
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 No, come on.

583
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You move in.

584
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 You corral the llamas into a smaller and smaller space,

585
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 and then people enter the, you know, the killing zone

586
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 with slings and bolasses and lassoes and stuff, I guess.

587
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 And you would get up to 30,000 llamas

588
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 in a single day's hunting that way.

589
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 That's amazing.

590
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Wow.

591
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 It's a lot of pressure, though,

592
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 because if you accidentally let go of someone,

593
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 and they all run through your...

594
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 They all get out.

595
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

596
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Thank you.

597
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Yeah, you do the left arm in, left arm out thing,

598
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 which is not a part of the song you're supposed to reenact.

599
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 [LAUGHTER]

600
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 They did use them in wild the Incas.

601
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 We know that they used a lot.

602
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 We don't know exactly how,

603
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 but we think probably as a beast of burden again.

604
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 But there was one battle where they abandoned

605
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 15,000 llamas after a battle with the Spanish.

606
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Whoa.

607
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 So they were using a lot of them.

608
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Yeah.

609
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Okay, fair enough.

610
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 I don't think you feel abandoned

611
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 if there's 15,000 of you there.

612
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 [LAUGHTER]

613
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Yeah, that's fair, that's fair.

614
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 The Israeli army uses llamas,

615
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 or at least it used to until 2017,

616
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 and they've started using robots instead.

617
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Wow.

618
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Robot llamas?

619
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Or...

620
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 [LAUGHTER]

621
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Regrettably not.

622
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 They're just like little doggie, doggie robots.

623
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Is that for guarding?

624
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 No, they would use them so when the army was going

625
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 to get into the mountains,

626
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 they would have llamas with them.

627
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 They would be carrying things.

628
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 They were really useful because they kept cool

629
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 amidst gunfire.

630
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 So whenever there was gunfire,

631
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 a llama wouldn't shit itself and run away.

632
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 It would just kind of cool.

633
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Wow.

634
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Yeah, yeah, this is cool.

635
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 That's amazing.

636
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 [LAUGHTER]

637
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Ironically, they're very difficult to alarm,

638
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 aren't they?

639
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 [LAUGHTER]

640
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Yes.

641
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And they would also,

642
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 if they were in the mountains and got very cold,

643
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 they would lie down with the soldiers

644
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 and kind of keep them warm,

645
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 because they're very fluffy,

646
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 very wobbly.

647
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Really?

648
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Yeah, they could lie for up to three days

649
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 without moving with the soldiers around them

650
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 if you needed to ambush.

651
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Oh, God.

652
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Which robots can't do, really.

653
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 I mean, they can stay still,

654
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 but they can't keep you warm at night.

655
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 If you make a very fluffy robot.

656
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 [LAUGHTER]

657
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 What a self-heating robot.

658
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Like the cans of soups.

659
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 [LAUGHTER]

660
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Well, llama mating is pretty interesting.

661
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Just while we're on llamas lying down

662
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 and keeping each other warm at night.

663
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Oh, yeah.

664
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Because they're really hard to breed.

665
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 There are a few reasons in their natural mating cycle

666
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 which make them really difficult to breed.

667
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 So they don't breed like us.

668
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 So female llamas release an egg after sex,

669
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 as opposed to the human method of once per month,

670
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 you know, come on May.

671
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Yeah, I got it.

672
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 But also, llama semen is very lethargic.

673
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 [LAUGHTER]

674
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And they are known as dribble ejaculators.

675
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Oh, God.

676
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Jesus Christ.

677
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 It's really...

678
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 [LAUGHTER]

679
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 It's so hard to get semen out of a llama.

680
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 It's like getting blood out of a stone.

681
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 That is the worst thing I've ever heard you say.

682
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 [LAUGHTER]

683
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 But there are great news, guys.

684
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Artificial llama vaginas, which you can buy on the market.

685
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 No one can stop you.

686
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 If you've got the money, you can get one.

687
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 [LAUGHTER]

688
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And they come with a kind of hot water bottle

689
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 to simulate the temperature of a real llama.

690
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 And they also come with a surrounding life size,

691
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 cuddly female llama bottom.

692
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Wow.

693
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Yeah.

694
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Just the bottom, then.

695
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 You can if you're feeling flash.

696
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 You can get the full female llama package.

697
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 You can't do that.

698
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I think you can.

699
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Really?

700
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 I mean, don't.

701
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Well, do what you like, actually, you know.

702
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 [LAUGHTER]

703
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Oh, do they do checks?

704
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 When you buy the llama vagina,

705
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 do they check that you do have a male llama?

706
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 [LAUGHTER]

707
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 They should.

708
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 I didn't know.

709
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 [LAUGHTER]

710
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 I know what you're saying about they can't stop you,

711
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 but it kind of feels like they should be able to stop you.

712
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 They should be able to stop you.

713
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 They should be back on checks.

714
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Is there a dribble ejaculator in the house?

715
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 How do you know my school nickname?

716
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 [LAUGHTER]

717
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 [LAUGHTER]

718
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 They're very sociable.

719
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 We're talking about real llamas now, right?

720
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Yeah.

721
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Yeah.

722
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 In a platonic way, they may not be good at shagging,

723
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 but they do love each other.

724
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And that's why they make such good guards.

725
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 So you know people often have a llama to guard their herd of sheep

726
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 or their herd of goats.

727
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And that's because they get super protective of them.

728
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 So you've got your herd of goats, you've got a llama.

729
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 They're great and they scare away.

730
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 They've been known to kill wolves and stuff occasionally.

731
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Wow.

732
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 It's very impressive.

733
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 But if you've got a llama guard, do not get two llama guards,

734
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 because the moment that you get a second one,

735
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 it just becomes friends with its llama

736
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 and ignores all the goats and the sheep.

737
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 [LAUGHTER]

738
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 And that's them all get ravaged by the wolves.

739
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 There's a golf course in North Carolina called Telemore Golf Course.

740
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 And they have caddies that are llamas.

741
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 So the llamas will carry your golf clubs around with you.

742
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 But one thing that I saw in only one place

743
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 is that there are golfers who have these llamas.

744
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And they've noticed that whenever they hit a good shot,

745
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 just before they hit it, the llama gives off a little moan.

746
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 It kind of goes, "Rrrrrrrrr" like that.

747
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 And so you have these golfers who are stood there

748
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 and they're just waiting to hear,

749
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 they keep moving a little bit this way, a little bit that way.

750
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And as soon as they hear the moan, they go, "Right!"

751
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And then they hit it.

752
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Wow.

753
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 These are the llamas can tell good golf posture.

754
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Yeah.

755
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 That's what it seems like.

756
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Unbelievable.

757
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 That's amazing.

758
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 They do make weird noises.

759
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Like the noise of alarm is, sounds like,

760
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I can't describe it, it sounds like a rusty door hinge.

761
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And that is exactly what it's like.

762
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 It's like, "Rrrrrrrrr"

763
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Yeah.

764
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Something out of a horror film.

765
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 But not when they're mating.

766
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 When they're mating, I hesitate to return to the field

767
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 because everyone lost their shit last time.

768
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 But they are, they orgle.

769
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Orgling is what they do.

770
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Orgling and dribbling.

771
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 They make that noise.

772
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Really?

773
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Yeah, they do.

774
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 If you hit orgling, you're in trouble.

775
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Or in luck.

776
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 In luck, yeah.

777
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 There's a dribble coming your way.

778
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I was on kentlive.com.co.uk

779
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 reading about llama-related news from this year.

780
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Yeah.

781
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 British natureism have an event.

782
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 This is actually in East Sussex, but people from Kent can go.

783
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 It's a walking with llamas completely naked night.

784
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Feels, feels it would have been safer to make it a day event.

785
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Anyway, it was supposed to happen at the start this year.

786
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 I think it might have got cancelled due to COVID.

787
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 But maybe, maybe we'll come back.

788
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Anyway, the British natureism website, it's been taken down.

789
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 But I did notice that on there, weirdly, they sell hoodies, fleeces

790
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 and 19 different designs of t-shirts

791
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 on the British natureism website.

792
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 You've got to have something to take off.

793
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Exactly.

794
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 I'm just picturing the horror movie, that scene where it's completely dark.

795
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 You're lost in the woods.

796
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 You're going, "Who is that? I can hear someone."

797
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 We need to move on to our final fact of the show.

798
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

799
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 My fact this week is that for a few days every year,

800
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Britain's beaches are covered in worm sperm.

801
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Oh, good. More sperm. Okay.

802
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 That's right. It's not the driveling kind.

803
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 It's specifically lug worm sperm.

804
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 And this is incredible.

805
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 So, I was on a beach recently, and I was looking at, you know,

806
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 those lug worm sand spirals you see on pretty much all beaches

807
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 at low tide.

808
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 They look like long worms made of sand.

809
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 And they're created by lug worms because they dig these burrows

810
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 and then they deposit these things on top of the burrows.

811
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 But the other thing they do is, the way they mate,

812
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 is the male lug worm, who's in quite a deep burrow on the beach

813
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 for a couple of days a year, he spurts some sperm out.

814
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 So, when the tide goes out, he spurts his sperm out onto the sand.

815
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 In a little white lump, you can see it if you keep your eyes peeled.

816
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And when the tide comes in, it gets all this lug worm sperm.

817
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 So, there'll be thousands and thousands of little piles of sperm on the beach.

818
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 The tide comes in and it washes it into the females' burrows,

819
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 and they get a little cascade of sperm coming down.

820
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And it fertilises their eggs.

821
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 And that's romance.

822
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 It's a circle of life. Yeah.

823
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 It's so amazing how they never... They never meet.

824
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 I mean, so many of us, they never meet. It's like, "You've got mail."

825
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Or...

826
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Is that what happens? You've got mail?

827
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 How do they send it through the pubs?

828
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Yeah, Tom Hanks sends you mail.

829
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 No, what kind of people like Tom Hanks so much?

830
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 He's fathered most of the people in this country.

831
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Also, they do meet, I know, at the end of "You've got mail."

832
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 But mostly lug worms...

833
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 It's like IVF, I would say, would be a better analogy.

834
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Or like, when you go to a sperm bank.

835
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 It's unbelievable. It's also unbelievable that lug worms,

836
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 which I had never heard of, by the way. I don't know if that's especially ignorant,

837
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 I'd never heard of lug worms being a thing before researching this fact,

838
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 that they all mate at exactly the same day, every year.

839
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 You know, the same few days, they just all know to do it.

840
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 We don't know how. They know that either.

841
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Like, we know that there is pheromones involved, right?

842
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 So, when the female notices that there's sperm washing around,

843
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 she'll release her eggs.

844
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And when the males can tell those eggs around, they release their sperm.

845
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 But what triggers it in the first place? We have no idea.

846
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And so there's a thing called sperm watch, which is...

847
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 It's on after spring watch, isn't it?

848
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 It's the late night version.

849
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 The red button.

850
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 And what they want is for people to, like, tell them when they see this stuff on the beach.

851
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 So you will see this little pile of, you know, white stuff on the beach.

852
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 They say, "Don't confuse it with seagull poo."

853
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 It looks a lot like seagull poo.

854
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 But if you see these things that look like seagull poo,

855
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 but they're in little ponds, then tell them, and then hopefully we can work out what it is.

856
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 It might be the temperature. It might be a change in weather. We're just not sure.

857
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Yeah. I love, though, like, as you say, this is a citizen thing,

858
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 and there was a big website and big PR push.

859
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 And they were like, you know, this is like, for anyone of any age, go out.

860
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 But as James points out, someone decided to call it sperm watch.

861
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 And it just feels the most inappropriate.

862
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 And it was things like, you go on their site, and for any would-be sperm spotters, again,

863
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 you get a pencil and a clipboard.

864
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Well, this is what they ask you to take, a pencil, a clipboard,

865
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 tied tables and a recording sheet.

866
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 And the idea is that you've got to run around,

867
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 and I think you have to see how many you can spot in ten minutes,

868
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 or the time it takes to find a hundred of them to know that this is an area that's fucking-

869
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 It's a fun game. It's like Pokemon Go.

870
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 It is. Yeah. It's like Pokemon Goo.

871
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Can I just tell you the one... So, Anna, you said that the casts they have on the beach,

872
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 as in they live in a burrow in a U-shaped burrow, and they eat food at one end,

873
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 and then they just poo it out at the other end of the burrow,

874
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 and they're in this U-shape, and that's what produces the cast.

875
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 The headline of this on the Barry Today website was,

876
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 "The love life of lug worms involves the casts of thousands."

877
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 - Nice. - How good is that?

878
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 - Lovely. - What's the burrow today?

879
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 - Just for people called Barry. - Yeah, okay.

880
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 How did you get on it?

881
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 So there are two types in the UK, two species, the blow lug worms and the black lug worms,

882
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 and what I find incredible is how deep they go and how big they are,

883
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 because there's little coils of sand. You're expecting a small little worm,

884
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 but the black lug worm can be 40 centimetres long,

885
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 so like half a metre long, practically, and it burrows down about 70 centimetres.

886
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 So you need to dig pretty far, because people dig for these quite a lot.

887
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 They're very useful as fishing bait, but you need to dig a long way to get one little worm,

888
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 and then they're not little. - No, that's true.

889
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 I watch the movie Dune this weekend, and this really spoiled it for me,

890
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 because all the way through I was like, these massive worms that live underneath the dunes in Dune,

891
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 how are they reproducing? Where are their casts?

892
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Anyway, the other people in the cinema did not appreciate those questions.

893
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Their breathing is pretty amazing, so they can breathe.

894
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 There was a big mystery about how they could breathe so long when the tide goes out,

895
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 and when it comes in, and they worked out it was something like six hours that they could survive,

896
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 and they studied it and looked into what was going on, and it turns out that they have...

897
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 So if we... God, it's science, I get a bit stuck,

898
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 but the hemoglobin thing, so in human blood, one hemoglobin protein holds four oxygen molecules at a time.

899
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 The lug worm, it's 156, and it's insane, and what they've done is they've isolated it,

900
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 and they've applied it to medicine now, and it's a huge thing for transplants

901
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 of any things like liver and so on, because it means that you can hold it.

902
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 If they're pushing this hemoglobin new product that they've created,

903
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 you can make it last for days rather than hours for a transplant needing to happen.

904
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 It's a game changer. - It's because they breathe through gills.

905
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 So they breathe through gills, and then they take in a huge amount of oxygen,

906
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 and there was one French scientist called Frank Zell who found this out in the '90s,

907
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 and the amazing thing about lug worm blood is it's compatible with all blood types,

908
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 because the hemoglobin is not anchored to red blood cells, so this is really exciting.

909
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 There is a factory in France which produces over a million lug worms a year,

910
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 each of them producing a tiny amount of blood, but that has been used in kidney transplants.

911
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 It makes people recover faster, it improves their organ function.

912
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 They are so incredible. - It's still being tested a little there, isn't it?

913
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 But they are using it in real life things, and the first person to have a double face transplant

914
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 use this stuff, by which I mean he didn't end up with two faces at the end.

915
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 He had a face put on, it rejected, and he had another one done.

916
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 - Yeah, he wasn't like, "Can I get one on the back as well? That'll look cool."

917
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 - I was reading about blood worms, which are very similar.

918
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 In fact, I was reading about sand worms in general, of which a lug worm is a type,

919
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 and in Maine, in America, it's one of the main sandworm digging up industries.

920
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 So Maine employs about a thousand people who go and dig up lug worms and blood worms

921
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 and sell them to anglers.

922
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 And I just really enjoyed this. It was a New York Times article from 1976,

923
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 so I don't know if it's still the case, but you basically get blood worm hunters

924
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 and sand worm hunters, and the sand worms are a bit more free-swimming

925
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 and the blood worms are a bit more burrowing, like our lug worms.

926
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 And apparently, they're two extremely separate groups.

927
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 It's like the People's Front of Judea and the Judean People's Front. They hate each other.

928
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 And the blood worms have a reputation, apparently, for real roughness.

929
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 And in fact, there was a strike of all of the sandwormers and blood worms in 1976.

930
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 And when both groups were striking, the blood worms told the sandwormers

931
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 that if they dared to accept an offer for, like, a pay increase

932
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 that didn't involve a pay increase also for the blood worms,

933
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 the blood worms said they would go and tear up all of their mudflats

934
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 which they used to do their harvesting.

935
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Wow. That's a menacing phrase to hear.

936
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 "I'll tear up your mudflats."

937
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 It could mean any number of things.

938
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 We're going to have to wrap up in a second.

939
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Can I just tell you, there's a giant beach worm in Australia

940
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 which is one centimetre wide and three metres long.

941
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Did you say giant? Yeah.

942
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 And did you say centimetres?

943
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Sorry, I just watched June this weekend.

944
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Okay. Not 400 metres. Yeah, yeah.

945
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 Wow. So what's it do?

946
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 It just wriggles around.

947
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 But no, three metres.

948
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 It's very, very long and only a tiny bit wide.

949
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 It's a really strange organism.

950
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 It's a strong fisherman, isn't it, that puts that on the end of his rod.

951
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 A whole fishing line is the worm.

952
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 Yeah. A plot twist.

953
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 Go on.

954
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Well, I can tell you there is a new taste in town.

955
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 Okay. So there's salty and bitter and all that kind of stuff.

956
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 We've talked about umami on this show,

957
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 I'm pretty sure, in our QI as well.

958
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 There's also a thing called kokumi.

959
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 And kokumi is something, it doesn't really taste of anything,

960
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 but it makes other tastes enhanced.

961
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 And we have a special receptor in our tongue,

962
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 so we know it does count as a proper taste.

963
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 Anyway, you find it in fish sperm.

964
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 Wow.

965
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 The caviar menu at Fido's Restaurant and Grill

966
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 just got a new option.

967
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 Do you know what's so weird is that I was reading about kokumi

968
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 for the first fact we mentioned today,

969
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 because cats love it.

970
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 And they deliberately try and get kokumi and umami into cat food.

971
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 So there we go.

972
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Wait a minute, it also tastes a bit like caviar.

973
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 So maybe the water does taste of caviar.

974
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 It's all coming together.

975
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 How beautiful. We've tied it all up in a bow.

976
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 There we go. A good point to end on then.

977
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 That is it. That is all of our facts.

978
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
