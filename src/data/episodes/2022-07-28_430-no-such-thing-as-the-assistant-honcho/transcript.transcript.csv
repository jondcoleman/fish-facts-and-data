00:00:13,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:18,00:00:21,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:25,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:25,00:00:30,and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:30,00:00:35,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:35,00:00:38,Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.
00:00:38,00:00:43,"My fact this week is that there's hardly any fresh water on Easter Island, so the indigenous"
00:00:43,00:00:46,people drank straight from the sea.
00:00:46,00:00:48,That's why they're dead.
00:00:48,00:00:53,"They all immediately died, they landed there, a thousand years ago, all died, no they didn't"
00:00:53,00:00:54,die.
00:00:54,00:00:56,This is the amazing thing about it.
00:00:56,00:01:01,"So Europeans first got there in the 1700s, 1722, they noticed that the indigenous people"
00:01:01,00:01:05,"there, the Pacific Islanders who travelled over there hundreds of years earlier, seemed"
00:01:05,00:01:07,to be drinking straight from the sea.
00:01:07,00:01:11,"Very confusing, haven't thought about it again for 400 years and then scientists looked into"
00:01:11,00:01:17,it and they realized that actually fresh water kind of emerges on the shore.
00:01:17,00:01:22,So the fact that there's no fresh water or very little fresh water because the soil is
00:01:22,00:01:27,"super porous and so it rains and the soil just sucks it in straight away, no streams"
00:01:27,00:01:28,or anything.
00:01:28,00:01:34,But the rainwater goes down into the earth and then travels out to the beach underground
00:01:34,00:01:37,and then it re-emerges just at the shoreline.
00:01:37,00:01:43,So when the tide's out you can kind of go and scoop up some of that water which is in
00:01:43,00:01:46,"the very shallows of the sea and it's still salty, don't get me wrong, I think it would"
00:01:46,00:01:47,taste like shit.
00:01:47,00:01:48,Yep.
00:01:48,00:01:49,It won't taste like salt.
00:01:49,00:01:53,It all tastes like salt but it's not salty enough that it dehydrates you to death.
00:01:53,00:01:56,"So it's like a river but it's underground kind of, right?"
00:01:56,00:01:57,Yeah.
00:01:57,00:02:01,"How did they survive long enough to experiment with that, to not be wiped out?"
00:02:01,00:02:02,"That's extraordinary, right?"
00:02:02,00:02:06,I thought initially that it would just be a body of water that was consistently there.
00:02:06,00:02:09,You're telling me a tide has to go out and then they find the water?
00:02:09,00:02:11,"Yeah, although the tide does go out most days."
00:02:11,00:02:17,"Yeah, true, but it's annoying having to wait 12 hours if you're at a time of wrong."
00:02:17,00:02:21,"And it's annoying like this morning I had to wait for Starbucks to open, that's annoying"
00:02:21,00:02:22,as well.
00:02:22,00:02:23,"That's the same, isn't it."
00:02:23,00:02:26,We can empathize in a lot of ways.
00:02:26,00:02:31,I guess if you're thirsty and you're really dying of thirst and the only water that you
00:02:31,00:02:34,"can see is the water on the shore of the sea, maybe you give it a try?"
00:02:34,00:02:36,"And also it's a 1200, they didn't know anything."
00:02:36,00:02:39,"It's very far away from, can we just say how far away from stuff East Ireland is?"
00:02:39,00:02:45,"The nearest inhabited island is 2,000 kilometres away, South America is 3,500 kilometres away"
00:02:45,00:02:48,"so it's in the very, very, it's in the South Pacific, isn't it?"
00:02:48,00:02:49,It's just so far from everywhere.
00:02:49,00:02:53,"It's kind of halfway between Chile and Australia, isn't it really?"
00:02:53,00:02:57,"Because when I went to South America I thought, oh well just pop over to Easter Island for"
00:02:57,00:02:59,"maybe a couple of days, that'd be really cool."
00:02:59,00:03:03,And then I looked about how long the flight was going to be and I'm not going to get there
00:03:03,00:03:04,"and that's the amazing thing, isn't it?"
00:03:04,00:03:06,How do people get there and how do people end up there?
00:03:06,00:03:10,"Well we know it's the Polynesians, right, but like how did they discover the island?"
00:03:10,00:03:11,What were they doing?
00:03:11,00:03:14,"There's a lot of origin stories, there's a lot of archaeological, like everyone has"
00:03:14,00:03:18,"a different idea that they bring to the table, but no one can decide."
00:03:18,00:03:20,"Your idea would be the Aliens one, I suppose, Dan?"
00:03:20,00:03:21,Is there an Aliens one?
00:03:21,00:03:22,Of course there's an Aliens one.
00:03:22,00:03:23,Yeah.
00:03:23,00:03:24,Happy red that one.
00:03:24,00:03:27,"Your mate Dan, Eric von Daniken, is there someone you're talking about, James?"
00:03:27,00:03:28,"Well it's just the, that's the famous one, right?"
00:03:28,00:03:29,"Yeah, yeah."
00:03:29,00:03:30,Wow.
00:03:30,00:03:36,"He thinks that a race of superior intelligent creatures got shipwrecked, effectively, on"
00:03:36,00:03:40,"Easter Island, taught the locals how to make the statues, started making a load of them for"
00:03:40,00:03:44,"their own amusement, then got picked up before they'd finished all of them, which is why some"
00:03:44,00:03:46,"of the statues are not finished, and then just left again."
00:03:46,00:03:50,His basically theory is that if there were ever any really amazing structures made where
00:03:50,00:03:54,"white people weren't there, then it must be aliens, so you could be pretty sure that"
00:03:54,00:03:55,he would think that.
00:03:55,00:03:59,"Yeah, he's not my mate by the way, can I just quickly, he's our specifically not to be"
00:03:59,00:04:01,"associated with me, soâ€¦"
00:04:01,00:04:05,"But yeah, Andy, about the statues, that's the famous thing, right, isn't it, the statues,"
00:04:05,00:04:10,"the big heads on Easter Island, and there's a thing about the big heads that they tend"
00:04:10,00:04:15,"to be clustered near the areas where you can get this water, and so some people think that"
00:04:15,00:04:19,maybe they were kind of a marker to tell you where the best place is to get a little bit
00:04:19,00:04:20,of drinking water there.
00:04:20,00:04:21,"Oh, wow."
00:04:21,00:04:26,They've recently realised that the positioning of the statues coincides with particularly
00:04:26,00:04:30,"these areas of freshwater springs, and even inland, it coincides with places where you"
00:04:30,00:04:34,"be able to get a well and get some fresh water, and it makes sense, if you're going to sign"
00:04:34,00:04:38,"post anything as a bunch of rural islanders, you probably sign post water, don't you?"
00:04:38,00:04:42,"But that's such a big sign post, that's the thing, it's an amazingly, it's so much"
00:04:42,00:04:44,effort to go to flag there is water here.
00:04:44,00:04:47,"But it was kind of their thing though, wasn't it, like there's a thousand of them on the"
00:04:47,00:04:53,"island, you know, they'd make it up in this hill bit where they used volcanic rock in"
00:04:53,00:04:58,"ash that was called tuff, and they would carve, and then they would drag down and slide down"
00:04:58,00:05:03,"with an amazing sort of hit rate of not damaging them as well, which is pretty extraordinary"
00:05:03,00:05:07,"given their size, you know, there's people who've gone and visited and seen broken ones,"
00:05:07,00:05:11,"but on average, it was said that they could just bring them down, these giant structures"
00:05:11,00:05:14,"and walk them to where they needed to be, and some of them would be, as you say, would"
00:05:14,00:05:19,"be facing water, some would be facing inland to protect the land, some, there's seven in"
00:05:19,00:05:23,"particular, which were meant to represent seven different Polynesian tribes that had"
00:05:23,00:05:29,"come over, so a group of people facing the direction of which they all originated from,"
00:05:29,00:05:33,"we don't know if that's true, that's just a theory on the island, yeah."
00:05:33,00:05:36,"The big question is, when they were transporting them down, did they slide from the top of"
00:05:36,00:05:40,"the hill on the Moai, like, they were sledges."
00:05:40,00:05:41,On the Moai?
00:05:41,00:05:43,"They're called Moai, the statues."
00:05:43,00:05:46,"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you meant did the statues slide on, yeah, yeah."
00:05:46,00:05:47,"On, no, no, no."
00:05:47,00:05:51,"But they might have been, the statues might have sledge, that's one theory, or they might"
00:05:51,00:05:52,have been put on log rollers.
00:05:52,00:05:54,"Well, Dan said walked, didn't he?"
00:05:54,00:05:57,"And the other theory is that they walked into a position, that you put a big rope around"
00:05:57,00:06:00,"them and just stroll them, you know, like when you're trying to move a heavy bit of furniture."
00:06:00,00:06:01,Like a fridge.
00:06:01,00:06:04,"Yeah, you lift one corner and move that, and then you put that down."
00:06:04,00:06:06,"And the aliens go, ""Pivot!"""
00:06:06,00:06:07,Yeah.
00:06:07,00:06:12,"The other thing about them, which I think you found out recently, James, I mean, you weren't"
00:06:12,00:06:18,"the original person to point it out, but there's as much of them underground as above ground."
00:06:18,00:06:19,Yes.
00:06:19,00:06:20,"Unbelievable, they're not heads."
00:06:20,00:06:26,"They're just statues of entire bodies, but apparently over hundreds of years, soil accumulation"
00:06:26,00:06:28,and various bits of erosion and stuff buried the bodies.
00:06:28,00:06:32,"Isn't that incredible, though, that they didn't bury the bodies themselves, so it's not like"
00:06:32,00:06:33,they hid it.
00:06:33,00:06:36,The erosion has happened that all of them just seem to have a head left.
00:06:36,00:06:37,Yeah.
00:06:37,00:06:38,That's quite amazing.
00:06:38,00:06:42,"It's like someone, it's like a kid been buried and sat, and his parents have left him there."
00:06:42,00:06:45,"We haven't talked about the most interesting structures on Easter Island, I would say."
00:06:45,00:06:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:46,00:06:47,Which is their chicken houses.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Do you guys read about these?
00:06:48,00:06:49,No.
00:06:49,00:06:51,So they've got great chicken houses.
00:06:51,00:06:56,"They're called haremoa, and they were almost impregnable to robbers, because obviously there"
00:06:56,00:07:00,"was a time of long decline on the island, you needed to protect your protein wherever"
00:07:00,00:07:01,you could.
00:07:01,00:07:02,Yeah.
00:07:02,00:07:03,So they're vital.
00:07:03,00:07:06,"They should have really pivoted completely to chickens, I think, but I'm not going to"
00:07:06,00:07:07,give them advice.
00:07:07,00:07:08,"Look, they've clearly been through a lot."
00:07:08,00:07:09,"Anyway, these chicken houses were really good."
00:07:09,00:07:13,"They were two meters high, up to 20 meters long, made completely of stone."
00:07:13,00:07:18,"It's a huge can of stones, basically, and they are quite mysterious, because the other"
00:07:18,00:07:21,thing about them is that human skulls have been found inside the chicken houses.
00:07:21,00:07:22,Whoa.
00:07:22,00:07:25,Are we thinking that chickens actually were eating the humans?
00:07:25,00:07:27,That's what I'm thinking.
00:07:27,00:07:31,"Do you think the chickens made the massive heads, because they thought human heads are"
00:07:31,00:07:32,so delicious?
00:07:32,00:07:35,"If we make some massive ones, then that will bring us more."
00:07:35,00:07:36,It will bring more.
00:07:36,00:07:37,I think that's it.
00:07:37,00:07:38,Yeah.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"I think theory, and again, it's so much theorizing, I think it's that they were chief's skulls,"
00:07:41,00:07:46,"and that they were believed to have a fertilizing power, these skulls, to increase the egg yields."
00:07:46,00:07:47,So pretty goth.
00:07:47,00:07:48,"Oh, really?"
00:07:48,00:07:50,To just have some skulls in your hen house.
00:07:50,00:07:53,"I knew you'd like those hen houses, because they're like dry stone walls, aren't they,"
00:07:53,00:07:54,Andy?
00:07:54,00:07:55,Yeah.
00:07:55,00:07:56,"They're very, very similar."
00:07:56,00:07:57,And you said how they're impregnable.
00:07:57,00:08:00,"The interesting thing about that is, they're made like dry stone walls, so they're made"
00:08:00,00:08:02,of loads and loads of stones going all the way around.
00:08:02,00:08:08,"But one of the stones, you can pull out and use it as a door, but unless you're the one"
00:08:08,00:08:12,"who built it, you don't know which stone it is, and so you can get in and get your chickens"
00:08:12,00:08:14,"out, but no robber can get the chickens out."
00:08:14,00:08:15,That's fantastic.
00:08:15,00:08:16,That's so good.
00:08:16,00:08:20,I'd love to go to Easter Island and only photograph the chicken houses.
00:08:20,00:08:24,I would really come back with a slideshow for my family.
00:08:24,00:08:30,"There were 1,233 of those chicken houses, and only 887 stone heads, so I think we're"
00:08:30,00:08:32,concentrating on the wrong thing.
00:08:32,00:08:33,I couldn't agree more.
00:08:33,00:08:36,And do you think they should have pivoted to chickens because of the other thing that
00:08:36,00:08:39,"formed the basis of their protein diet, which was rats?"
00:08:39,00:08:41,"Oh, another good reason to pivot to chickens."
00:08:41,00:08:45,I do have so many reasons to pivot to chickens.
00:08:45,00:08:50,"They've done some studies recently, some analysis of the teeth of skeletons, and it shows that"
00:08:50,00:08:53,"their source of protein was rats, and they ate loads of rats, although apparently Pacific"
00:08:53,00:08:56,Island rats are slightly tastier than European rats.
00:08:56,00:08:57,Okay.
00:08:57,00:08:58,Who's studied this?
00:08:58,00:09:02,"Yeah, we actually just read this in New Scientist or something, so I don't know how much all"
00:09:02,00:09:04,the researchers have gone to compare them.
00:09:04,00:09:07,"I'm still not going to Kentucky Fried Rat, that's all I say."
00:09:07,00:09:11,"But as you say, Andy and Dan, the theorizing is out of control."
00:09:11,00:09:16,"We know almost nothing, so pretty much everything we've said so far is just based on a few bits"
00:09:16,00:09:17,"of evidence, and we piece stuff together."
00:09:17,00:09:22,"The stuff we know for sure is stuff that's told from living memory, and so the stuff"
00:09:22,00:09:26,"we know for sure is actually about the cult that followed the big head cult, which is the"
00:09:26,00:09:31,"Birdman cult, and we do actually have information about that, and this is another theory about"
00:09:31,00:09:37,"who knocked down the head, so basically, Westerner's arrived, and sometime after Cook went"
00:09:37,00:09:41,"there in the late 1700s, then the head cult was replaced with this Birdman cult, so they"
00:09:41,00:09:45,"just tore down the heads because they were like, ""We're the guys in charge now,"" but"
00:09:45,00:09:48,the cool thing about the Birdman cult was how they elected their head poncho.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Did you read this?
00:09:49,00:09:50,Did you say poncho then?
00:09:50,00:09:51,Poncho.
00:09:51,00:09:52,Poncho.
00:09:52,00:09:53,I said poncho.
00:09:53,00:09:54,"Oh, good."
00:09:54,00:09:55,"Oh, I heard poncho as well."
00:09:55,00:09:57,"It's a phrase, but head poncho isn't a phrase."
00:09:57,00:10:00,That's why we were surprised to hear it.
00:10:00,00:10:01,It's almost a better phrase.
00:10:01,00:10:02,"It is, yeah."
00:10:02,00:10:03,I'm the head poncho here.
00:10:03,00:10:05,Especially if you've got a really awesome poncho whenever you get the combat.
00:10:05,00:10:07,I think it would need that.
00:10:07,00:10:08,Yeah.
00:10:08,00:10:10,Is it just for your head?
00:10:10,00:10:12,"Are you wearing a poncho for your body, and then you've got a head poncho on top?"
00:10:12,00:10:13,"Yeah, double poncho."
00:10:13,00:10:15,This is what they wore on the islands.
00:10:15,00:10:19,"Because I know what a poncho is, and that's why I like the phrase, but I don't know what"
00:10:19,00:10:22,"a poncho is really, part of the - I get some guy."
00:10:22,00:10:24,"You never hear about poncho when not preceded by head, do you?"
00:10:24,00:10:25,You never hear about the second poncho in the world?
00:10:25,00:10:26,"No, you never do."
00:10:26,00:10:27,"No, no, no."
00:10:27,00:10:28,Vice-honcho.
00:10:28,00:10:31,"Yes, I'm the assistant poncho."
00:10:31,00:10:39,"Well, look, the head poncho competition in the Birdman cult was to elect the Tangata"
00:10:39,00:10:42,"Manu, who was the bird man of the year, happened every year."
00:10:42,00:10:46,"And essentially, it was the first person to find the first egg that was laid by the sooty"
00:10:46,00:10:50,"turn every year, and the way they did it was..."
00:10:50,00:10:51,It's not...
00:10:51,00:10:56,"If they go like just whispering his ear, like a little bear, what's that sooty turn?"
00:10:56,00:11:02,"You were the honcho last year, sooty, it's Sweep's turn now."
00:11:02,00:11:05,Maybe all the statues are hollow inside.
00:11:05,00:11:10,It's a massive Matthew Carbet who comes along and...
00:11:10,00:11:11,With incredibly strong arms.
00:11:11,00:11:14,"They're the finger puppets of the gods, that's what they are."
00:11:14,00:11:17,That is a Vontanican book I absolutely would devour.
00:11:17,00:11:20,"Sorry, they're trying to find the egg."
00:11:20,00:11:22,"Yeah, it does feel like we have wandered off course."
00:11:22,00:11:26,"They're trying to find the egg of the sooty turn, and the way they do it is the main competitors"
00:11:26,00:11:30,"would either compete themselves or they'd elect a Hopu, which was someone who competed"
00:11:30,00:11:31,on their behalf.
00:11:31,00:11:34,"And what they had to do was they had to climb down this cliff, they'd have to swim a mile"
00:11:34,00:11:39,"out to sea, very rough seas, mile out to sea, and land on this island."
00:11:39,00:11:42,And it was the island where all the birds came and laid their eggs every spring.
00:11:42,00:11:47,"They wait there for a few weeks on this island, and then eventually the birds would arrive."
00:11:47,00:11:51,"The first one to spot the first egg would signal back to the main island and say, ""I've"
00:11:51,00:11:53,"got the egg, you win, master."""
00:11:53,00:11:56,"And then the reward, here's where it gets really exciting, if you're the first one"
00:11:56,00:12:01,"to get the egg is, you get to shave off your eyebrows and eyelashes and your head, your"
00:12:01,00:12:06,"hair, not your head, and you took a new name that was adopted as the name of the year,"
00:12:06,00:12:10,and then you danced and sang your way to the royal residence where you had to live in total
00:12:10,00:12:11,seclusion for a year.
00:12:11,00:12:12,And that's what you get.
00:12:12,00:12:15,"It does sound quite good actually, living in total seclusion for a year."
00:12:15,00:12:16,"Yeah, and people bought you food actually."
00:12:16,00:12:17,Did they?
00:12:17,00:12:18,Yeah.
00:12:18,00:12:19,It's a dream.
00:12:19,00:12:20,But the food was rats.
00:12:20,00:12:21,Yeah.
00:12:21,00:12:22,But nice rats.
00:12:22,00:12:23,"Yeah, nice."
00:12:23,00:12:31,"All of the statues were knocked over at some point after first Western contact, when the"
00:12:31,00:12:36,"first sailors arrived, which was 1722, there was a Dutchman called Jacob Roggeveen."
00:12:36,00:12:39,"He visited on Easter Day in 1722, which is why he gave it the name Easter Island."
00:12:39,00:12:40,They were all standing.
00:12:40,00:12:41,They were all fine.
00:12:41,00:12:43,There were no descriptions of any that had fallen over.
00:12:43,00:12:46,"And then a couple hundred years later, they're all knocked over."
00:12:46,00:12:48,And it would have taken a huge amount of effort to knock them over.
00:12:48,00:12:51,The people clearly decided we don't want these anymore.
00:12:51,00:12:52,Yeah.
00:12:52,00:12:57,"I think they felt, well, this is one of the many theories, let's get some of it."
00:12:57,00:13:01,But this is the theory I think on the side of the kind of more mythological side is that
00:13:01,00:13:03,they were idols to the gods.
00:13:03,00:13:08,And because the island had been so ravaged in terms of the deforestation that they'd
00:13:08,00:13:10,"done and so on, because that's the main thing, isn't it?"
00:13:10,00:13:12,There's hardly any trees that are left anymore.
00:13:12,00:13:15,And so they couldn't make canoes to go and fish.
00:13:15,00:13:16,And so they ran out of food.
00:13:16,00:13:17,And so it was anger.
00:13:17,00:13:20,"And they knocked down the statues to say, ""Fuck you, God."""
00:13:20,00:13:21,Wow.
00:13:21,00:13:22,That's quite angry.
00:13:22,00:13:25,Because I can imagine being angry and having a pen in your hand and throwing it to the
00:13:25,00:13:26,ground and stuff.
00:13:26,00:13:31,But actually to be so angry that you knock over a massive statue and then another and
00:13:31,00:13:33,then another and then hundreds and hundreds of them.
00:13:33,00:13:34,"Wait, were they lined up like dominoes?"
00:13:34,00:13:35,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:35,00:13:36,Possible.
00:13:36,00:13:37,You only need to get one over originally.
00:13:37,00:13:38,That would be amazing.
00:13:38,00:13:39,Maybe that's...
00:13:39,00:13:40,It was a mistake.
00:13:40,00:13:41,It was a mistake.
00:13:41,00:13:42,It was a mistake.
00:13:42,00:13:43,It's already over.
00:13:43,00:13:51,"Some dude was just leading over and shouting out, ""Girl, Mr. Bean went to Easter Island."""
00:13:51,00:13:57,"Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:13:57,00:13:59,And that is my fact.
00:13:59,00:14:07,"My fact this week is that last year, Dublin Airport received 13,569 noise complaints."
00:14:07,00:14:15,"12,272 of those were made by one person, one single person."
00:14:15,00:14:16,"5,000 in a year."
00:14:16,00:14:21,"Yeah, it was averaging basically 34 a day roughly."
00:14:21,00:14:24,That's basically presumably every time a plane takes off.
00:14:24,00:14:26,"I think so, yeah."
00:14:26,00:14:28,"We don't know who this person is, by the way."
00:14:28,00:14:29,They've kept them anonymous.
00:14:29,00:14:30,I don't know why.
00:14:30,00:14:31,Okay.
00:14:31,00:14:35,But it's something that they've done before many times.
00:14:35,00:14:38,They've doubled their amount of complaints that they previously had done.
00:14:38,00:14:40,So this isn't like they just popped out of nowhere.
00:14:40,00:14:42,They've been complaining for years.
00:14:42,00:14:46,"Weirdly, obviously due to the pandemic, flights have been down, but the complaints have been"
00:14:46,00:14:47,going up.
00:14:47,00:14:48,Yeah.
00:14:48,00:14:54,"They did kind of pop out of nowhere because they came along, I think in 2018."
00:14:54,00:15:03,"In 2018, there were 628 complaints in 2019, 3,147 in the first six months of the year."
00:15:03,00:15:06,"And then not that many since then, but some."
00:15:06,00:15:10,"And then like you say, this last couple of years, they've really picked up again."
00:15:10,00:15:13,Is it someone who's erected a tent on the runway?
00:15:13,00:15:18,"I was wondering, or someone who's set up an automatic system that every time the noise"
00:15:18,00:15:22,"goes over a certain volume, it triggers a complaint."
00:15:22,00:15:27,"Now, what this did happen in Heathrow, in 2015 Heathrow found that some people had automated"
00:15:27,00:15:33,"software that could generate complaints and they found out because when the clocks changed,"
00:15:33,00:15:35,they didn't change the clocks on their system.
00:15:35,00:15:39,So they started complaining about flights that hadn't taken off yet.
00:15:39,00:15:44,"Wait, that's so cheeky, they were what they were, they would, they would find out when"
00:15:44,00:15:49,a plane was taking off and automatically their computer would just send an email.
00:15:49,00:15:52,"That's I think that is, I think that is cheeky because I think it's got to be, you've got"
00:15:52,00:15:53,to have the noise.
00:15:53,00:15:54,You've got to have experienced noise.
00:15:54,00:15:58,"I think that's, that's what Heathrow thought as well."
00:15:58,00:16:00,Do we know if they bothered to make each email different?
00:16:00,00:16:02,Like did they write a thousand different words?
00:16:02,00:16:05,"Sir, dear madam, hello, further to my previous email."
00:16:05,00:16:11,"I mean, all this one, were they all clones of each other, this person?"
00:16:11,00:16:12,They haven't said.
00:16:12,00:16:13,Yeah.
00:16:13,00:16:16,I imagine it's pretty much the same email that would come through.
00:16:16,00:16:19,"Well, this person doesn't actually live that close to the airport either."
00:16:19,00:16:22,"They know where they live, they know where they live."
00:16:22,00:16:23,I don't even know where they live.
00:16:23,00:16:26,"OnGar, which is about 20 miles away from the airport."
00:16:26,00:16:31,And the interesting thing about that is Dublin Airport are actually quite good neighbors.
00:16:31,00:16:34,"If you look into it, as far as I'm concerned, they seem to be, and they'll offer to buy"
00:16:34,00:16:38,"your house, for instance, if it's too much on a regular basis, especially since they"
00:16:38,00:16:40,got their new runway.
00:16:40,00:16:45,"But this person is outside of that distance, but they can't be helped by any of these systems."
00:16:45,00:16:47,So that could be why they're complaining.
00:16:47,00:16:48,Yeah.
00:16:48,00:16:51,"And flight paths can be, you know, devil's it, if you're like, if you're like West London,"
00:16:51,00:16:55,it's so much of it's under the Heathrow path that you get so many planes a day.
00:16:55,00:16:59,"It also does seem that you do get these individuals, like these singular individuals that make it"
00:16:59,00:17:00,no mission to do it.
00:17:00,00:17:03,"So the heroes, I call them heroes."
00:17:03,00:17:07,So the same thing happened for Reagan airports in Washington in 2015.
00:17:07,00:17:14,"They had 8,670 noise complaints and 6,500 of those were from a single person as well."
00:17:14,00:17:15,Yeah.
00:17:15,00:17:19,"It's just some heroes, as Andy say, there's a secret society."
00:17:19,00:17:22,There's a mason's for complainers somewhere that we didn't know about.
00:17:22,00:17:25,Do you think that these people have time to go to a secret society?
00:17:25,00:17:28,"To me, I don't think they do."
00:17:28,00:17:32,"Noise complaints are just ridiculous sometimes in terms of when you read the headline, you"
00:17:32,00:17:33,"think, how's that possible?"
00:17:33,00:17:37,"My favorite one that I've read recently, a Canadian city made a noise complaint against"
00:17:37,00:17:38,an American city.
00:17:38,00:17:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:39,00:17:40,Yeah.
00:17:40,00:17:41,Wow.
00:17:41,00:17:45,"So this was Windsor, Ontario, and they were making a complaint against Detroit."
00:17:45,00:17:46,And it was because...
00:17:46,00:17:47,What?
00:17:47,00:17:48,Yeah.
00:17:48,00:17:53,"So the Detroit River is a, there's a one kilometer waterway between Windsor and Detroit."
00:17:53,00:17:58,"And they were having a festival on the riverbank with, they said on Windsor's side, the sound"
00:17:58,00:18:00,system facing directly towards them.
00:18:00,00:18:04,And so they received all these complaints from about 1.30 to 2.30 in the morning when
00:18:04,00:18:06,the music was still playing.
00:18:06,00:18:11,"And all the complaints directed on the Windsor side to their council to say, we want you"
00:18:11,00:18:15,to write to Detroit's council and officially log this as a noise complaint.
00:18:15,00:18:16,And they did.
00:18:16,00:18:17,Yeah.
00:18:17,00:18:19,"They got an official, a city got an official noise complaint from another city."
00:18:19,00:18:20,That's great.
00:18:20,00:18:21,Yeah.
00:18:21,00:18:25,"And this, imagine if this was the Franz Ferdinand moment for the civil war between Canada and..."
00:18:25,00:18:29,"Exactly, that's the music they were playing for."
00:18:29,00:18:33,I was looking at the history of filing sound complaints.
00:18:33,00:18:38,"I think the earliest I could find, the earliest official sound complaint, which resulted in"
00:18:38,00:18:41,"you know, action being taken was in 1302, this was in the UK."
00:18:41,00:18:44,And it was a petition by a bunch of friars.
00:18:44,00:18:49,"And it's just so fun because it's just exactly the same as we would say today, exactly the"
00:18:49,00:18:50,same kind of complaint.
00:18:50,00:18:54,"So they requested that this courthouse, the courthouse of Cattisall, should not be rebuilt"
00:18:54,00:18:57,to the damage and nuisance of the friars.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"Their complaint was that when it rains, people who are going to the courthouse seek refuge"
00:19:00,00:19:05,"for themselves and their horses in the church of the friars while the friars are saying mass,"
00:19:05,00:19:07,which actually does sound quite annoying.
00:19:07,00:19:08,It does sound annoying.
00:19:08,00:19:09,Yeah.
00:19:09,00:19:12,And so it's quite hard to shout mass over the noise and the press of the people.
00:19:12,00:19:15,Especially if they've taken a vow of silence or something.
00:19:15,00:19:16,That would be really annoying.
00:19:16,00:19:17,Yeah.
00:19:17,00:19:18,They can't shout them down.
00:19:18,00:19:20,Just sitting there swearing at them.
00:19:20,00:19:24,I read another study by Manchester Met and this is going back to the airports.
00:19:24,00:19:29,This was complaint data at Manchester Airport from between 1998 and 2000.
00:19:29,00:19:34,"They found what we found, which is that there is a subgroup of serial complainers out of"
00:19:34,00:19:36,all the complaints.
00:19:36,00:19:37,So they described a serial...
00:19:37,00:19:38,"Is that like cornflakes, not crunchy enough?"
00:19:38,00:19:39,Exactly.
00:19:39,00:19:40,"Oh, gosh."
00:19:40,00:19:43,Where can I address my complaint about that joke?
00:19:43,00:19:49,"I think if people are complaining about our jokes, then they would be serial complainers."
00:19:49,00:19:54,Because a serial complainer is someone who makes more than 50 complaints a year versus
00:19:54,00:19:57,"a normal complainer, who is someone who does less than that."
00:19:57,00:20:04,"But they profiled serial complainers and they found, really interestingly, that a serial"
00:20:04,00:20:09,complainer would send all of their emails between 10pm and 1am.
00:20:09,00:20:13,And then again in the morning from 7am to about 8am.
00:20:13,00:20:17,"So they'd do it just before they went to bed or just before they got up, whereas a normal"
00:20:17,00:20:19,complainer would do it at any time of the night.
00:20:19,00:20:21,"So they might do it at 1am, 2am, 3am, 4am."
00:20:21,00:20:26,So what that suggests is that the normal complainers are actually being woken up by the planes
00:20:26,00:20:30,"and got off, for God's sake, and sending an email versus serial complainers doing it just"
00:20:30,00:20:34,"before they go to bed, maybe after a few drinks, I don't know."
00:20:34,00:20:37,"And then first thing in the morning when they remember, ""Oh, that was really annoying last"
00:20:37,00:20:38,"night"" kind of thing."
00:20:38,00:20:39,Wow.
00:20:39,00:20:42,"You sort of understand the late evening one, where people are like, ""Oh, they're stewing,"
00:20:42,00:20:43,"you know?"""
00:20:43,00:20:44,"""I've got to complain about this."
00:20:44,00:20:45,"I'm so like..."""
00:20:45,00:20:46,Early morning I don't get at all.
00:20:46,00:20:50,"I wonder sometimes it's like you want to send an email at night time and you're like,"
00:20:50,00:20:54,"""If I send it now, people will think I'm drug sending it, so wait till the morning and I'm"
00:20:54,00:20:55,"going to send it then."""
00:20:55,00:20:56,It's a schedule send.
00:20:56,00:20:57,They're schedule a send.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"Well, let me reread the draft that was four years ago."
00:20:59,00:21:03,"I'll write an angry email in there, but I normally end up not sending an email, or instead"
00:21:03,00:21:04,sending an apology.
00:21:04,00:21:05,What?
00:21:05,00:21:07,Sending an apology instead of an angry email.
00:21:07,00:21:08,Love all the noise.
00:21:08,00:21:09,"Thanks, Andy."
00:21:09,00:21:10,Keep it up.
00:21:10,00:21:11,Turn it up.
00:21:11,00:21:12,I can take it.
00:21:12,00:21:22,This fight was about Dublin Airport.
00:21:22,00:21:25,Most famous Irish airline.
00:21:25,00:21:26,Erlingus.
00:21:26,00:21:27,"Come on, Andy."
00:21:27,00:21:28,Ryanair.
00:21:28,00:21:29,"Yeah, Ryanair."
00:21:29,00:21:30,It's got to be Ryanair.
00:21:30,00:21:32,I know Erlingus is a very famous one.
00:21:32,00:21:33,I only named the national carrier.
00:21:33,00:21:35,I'm afraid I say that against priority.
00:21:35,00:21:36,"Sorry, Ryanair."
00:21:36,00:21:41,A really interesting thing is that Ryanair is founded by a guy called Tony Ryan.
00:21:41,00:21:42,He's really famous.
00:21:42,00:21:45,He owned a leasing company first.
00:21:45,00:21:51,"Even today, Ireland leases about 40% of all the airplanes in this guy at any time."
00:21:51,00:21:55,Most of the smaller airlines don't own the airplanes that they own.
00:21:55,00:21:57,"They're leased from someone else, and a lot of nights from Ireland."
00:21:57,00:21:59,This was all goes back to this guy called Tony Ryan.
00:21:59,00:22:04,"He decided he wanted to set up an airline, and it's called Ryanair, but it's not named"
00:22:04,00:22:05,after him.
00:22:05,00:22:08,It's not amazing.
00:22:08,00:22:14,"He wanted to call it trans-tipperary airlines, but his friend and someone who he set up the"
00:22:14,00:22:19,"business with called Christie Ryan, decided he wanted to name it after him."
00:22:19,00:22:20,"Christie Ryan said, ""I know."
00:22:20,00:22:24,"I want to name it after me and call it Ryanair,"" and Tony Ryan said, ""You can't name it after"
00:22:24,00:22:25,"you."""
00:22:25,00:22:27,"He said, ""Well, I'm going to do it anyway,"" and in the end, they decided and called it"
00:22:27,00:22:33,"Ryanair, but Tony Ryan is the really famous guy who everyone thinks is really funny."
00:22:33,00:22:37,"That's so interesting, because online, it always, I thought it wasn't named after Christopher,"
00:22:37,00:22:40,"and it was named after Tony, because yeah, it always says it's named after Tony Ryan,"
00:22:40,00:22:41,"but secretly, it's the Christopher."
00:22:41,00:22:42,That's very funny.
00:22:42,00:22:43,That's amazing.
00:22:43,00:22:44,My God.
00:22:44,00:22:50,"I was reading a very tiny bit about noise on planes, because obviously, we're talking"
00:22:50,00:22:53,"about noise when you're on the ground from an airplane, but it's huge when you're inside,"
00:22:53,00:22:58,"and they do a lot to try and fix it, make it better, make it more manageable."
00:22:58,00:23:00,One of the things that affects is your food on a plane.
00:23:00,00:23:05,"They found in research, when you're eating food, the noise can mess with your taste buds,"
00:23:05,00:23:10,"and so, British Airways in 2014 released a little thing called sound bites."
00:23:10,00:23:14,"The idea would be that the food that you ordered on the plane, you could go into the system,"
00:23:14,00:23:19,"your little entertainment system, and you could find a track that plays a curated bit"
00:23:19,00:23:26,of noise to listen to while you're eating that meal to match the taste and help you
00:23:26,00:23:27,out with the food.
00:23:27,00:23:28,That would work.
00:23:28,00:23:33,"I've been to the fact doc, Heston Blumenthal's place, and he plays music sometimes to you when"
00:23:33,00:23:35,you eat a certain thing.
00:23:35,00:23:38,You have to wear headphones and listen to the sound of the sea while you eat some seafood
00:23:38,00:23:39,and stuff.
00:23:39,00:23:40,"Yeah, exactly."
00:23:40,00:23:43,So it'd be like Verdi would be playing while you're eating on the airplane.
00:23:43,00:23:44,It's a pasta.
00:23:44,00:23:45,Exactly.
00:23:45,00:23:46,It is that.
00:23:46,00:23:47,It is that.
00:23:47,00:23:52,"If you're on your way to Easter Island, just the sound of rats screaming, I've got a case"
00:23:52,00:23:53,study for you.
00:23:53,00:23:54,I'll go on.
00:23:54,00:23:55,Okay.
00:23:55,00:23:56,"You live in a seaside flat, right?"
00:23:56,00:23:57,Yes.
00:23:57,00:23:58,In Italy.
00:23:58,00:23:59,"Oh, lovely."
00:23:59,00:24:00,Lovely.
00:24:00,00:24:05,"And then you're maybe, you know, it's flat."
00:24:05,00:24:06,It's not one of those.
00:24:06,00:24:07,Which coast?
00:24:07,00:24:10,"Oh, it's in the Bay of Poets, I think it's called."
00:24:10,00:24:11,"Oh, romantic."
00:24:11,00:24:14,So there are four brothers who own the flat next door.
00:24:14,00:24:15,Right.
00:24:15,00:24:16,"They install a lavatory, okay?"
00:24:16,00:24:17,In one of their rooms.
00:24:17,00:24:18,"Yeah, it's fine."
00:24:18,00:24:21,"But it's right next to the headboard of your bed, and it's so loud."
00:24:21,00:24:22,Yeah.
00:24:22,00:24:23,Whose side are you on?
00:24:23,00:24:25,"Look, but I'm the person."
00:24:25,00:24:26,"Well, you live in the flat, actually."
00:24:26,00:24:27,I live in the other flat.
00:24:27,00:24:28,Yeah.
00:24:28,00:24:30,So someone's taking a shit next to your head every day.
00:24:30,00:24:31,Pretty much.
00:24:31,00:24:32,Or every night.
00:24:32,00:24:36,"I think I might consider moving, flipping my bed around so that my headboard isn't right"
00:24:36,00:24:37,there.
00:24:37,00:24:38,This is the thing.
00:24:38,00:24:41,"The couple said, ""Our home is so small, we can't rearrange the furniture."""
00:24:41,00:24:42,Okay.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"So this, get this, this happened in 2003."
00:24:44,00:24:47,"The couple who own the flat, which I put you all in, said, ""The noise is intolerable."""
00:24:47,00:24:49,"They took it to a judge, got thrown out."
00:24:49,00:24:51,They went to an appeal court.
00:24:51,00:24:54,"The appeal court judge said, ""Actually, that is bad for your quality of life."""
00:24:54,00:24:55,Okay.
00:24:55,00:24:58,The brothers fought back and took it to the Supreme Court.
00:24:58,00:25:01,"This year, in 2022, 19 years after the original complaint."
00:25:01,00:25:02,Oh my God.
00:25:02,00:25:05,And they've been holding a shit in all that time.
00:25:05,00:25:07,It's been settled.
00:25:07,00:25:08,On whose side?
00:25:08,00:25:10,In favor of the couple who own the flat.
00:25:10,00:25:13,"The brothers have had to pay 10,000 euros almost."
00:25:13,00:25:15,So what do they do now?
00:25:15,00:25:16,The brothers?
00:25:16,00:25:17,Outdoor WC?
00:25:17,00:25:18,I don't think they could sound.
00:25:18,00:25:19,I don't know if they could sound.
00:25:19,00:25:21,"Maybe they have to use their Lou, move the Lou."
00:25:21,00:25:22,I don't know.
00:25:22,00:25:23,Anyway.
00:25:23,00:25:26,Put lots of Lou Roll down before you do a number two.
00:25:26,00:25:29,"I think it was the flush, wasn't it?"
00:25:29,00:25:30,The flush.
00:25:30,00:25:31,The problem.
00:25:31,00:25:35,"But the journal newspaper said, ""In far less time than this case took, Albert Einstein"
00:25:35,00:25:37,"wrote the theory of relativity explaining the whole universe."""
00:25:37,00:25:38,"It's hard though, isn't it?"
00:25:38,00:25:40,"I mean, that, you can see both sides."
00:25:40,00:25:41,Yeah.
00:25:41,00:25:42,I think.
00:25:42,00:25:43,You're going to have a place to...
00:25:43,00:25:44,You're going to have a tie.
00:25:44,00:25:45,You're going to have a Lou.
00:25:45,00:25:46,"Yeah, yeah."
00:25:46,00:25:47,"But also, you're going to be able to sleep somewhere."
00:25:47,00:25:48,And these are small places.
00:25:48,00:25:49,Yeah.
00:25:49,00:25:50,Is it four brothers?
00:25:50,00:25:51,Yeah.
00:25:51,00:25:54,It's a bit of the story that no one's picked up on.
00:25:54,00:25:55,What?
00:25:55,00:25:56,Four brothers?
00:25:56,00:25:57,Living together for 19 years?
00:25:57,00:25:58,I think that's a bit odd.
00:25:58,00:25:59,I don't know.
00:25:59,00:26:00,I don't know.
00:26:00,00:26:01,It's quite a good life.
00:26:01,00:26:02,Yeah.
00:26:02,00:26:03,Yeah.
00:26:03,00:26:04,You're right.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Get a life.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Move out.
00:26:06,00:26:07,Why hasn't one of them got married?
00:26:07,00:26:08,Yeah.
00:26:08,00:26:09,What is happening with that family?
00:26:09,00:26:10,I think they're doing it deliberately.
00:26:10,00:26:11,Is that what you're saying?
00:26:11,00:26:15,They've clubbed together and deliberately said that they'll devote their lives to torturing
00:26:15,00:26:16,this couple.
00:26:16,00:26:17,I don't know.
00:26:17,00:26:20,"I just think when it comes to courts, when it's four brothers living together for 19"
00:26:20,00:26:22,"years, I would think something weird's going on there."
00:26:22,00:26:23,Yeah.
00:26:23,00:26:24,I'm going to leave you guys alone.
00:26:24,00:26:25,Okay.
00:26:25,00:26:26,I'm with you.
00:26:26,00:26:28,"Well, no further questions, your honor."
00:26:28,00:26:29,The prosecution rests.
00:26:29,00:26:30,Four brothers?
00:26:30,00:26:31,Do me a favor.
00:26:31,00:26:32,Okay.
00:26:32,00:26:43,"It is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:26:43,00:26:44,Okay.
00:26:44,00:26:49,"My fact this week is that in her lifetime, Emily Dickinson was better known as a baker"
00:26:49,00:26:50,than as a poet.
00:26:50,00:26:53,She thought it was a really good baker or a really bad poet.
00:26:53,00:26:56,Probably an unknown poet.
00:26:56,00:27:01,People didn't really know that she did poetry and people did know that she did baking.
00:27:01,00:27:05,"If you don't know who Emily Dickinson is, she is probably one of the most famous American"
00:27:05,00:27:06,poets.
00:27:06,00:27:11,"In her lifetime, didn't really sell or publish anything, just one or two little things."
00:27:11,00:27:13,People didn't really know about her.
00:27:13,00:27:18,"She didn't want anything to be published, but what she was famous for in her area was making"
00:27:18,00:27:22,"loads of cakes, loads of delicious things that she used to give to all the children"
00:27:22,00:27:24,all the time.
00:27:24,00:27:31,There's a new book that's come out called the Emily Dickinson Cook book by Eileen Osborne.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"In that, she says she was better known as a baker than a poet."
00:27:34,00:27:39,"Although there is another book that I've seen which is about Emily Dickinson's gardening,"
00:27:39,00:27:42,"and in that book, it says she was better known as a gardener than a poet."
00:27:42,00:27:45,"It kind of feels like whatever you write in the book about, you can say that."
00:27:45,00:27:46,She basically wasn't known as a poet.
00:27:46,00:27:51,"But what's amazing though is like she's known for the gardening, she's known for the bakery,"
00:27:51,00:27:55,"but actually she was kind of a recluse for most of her life, wasn't she?"
00:27:55,00:28:00,I think kind of is a weak way of referring to what was extreme recluseville.
00:28:00,00:28:03,So how do we know about her gardening and her bakeries?
00:28:03,00:28:04,Hang on guys.
00:28:04,00:28:05,Hang on.
00:28:05,00:28:09,"She had some pretty public experiences in the baking sphere, and I'd refer you to the"
00:28:09,00:28:15,"1856 Amherst Cattle Show, where her round loaf of Indian and rye bread won second prize."
00:28:15,00:28:19,"So before we say she was a recluse, just think about that."
00:28:19,00:28:21,"She was living in the public sphere, in the blaze of publicity."
00:28:21,00:28:25,"To be fair, her sister, Vinnie, was one of the judges for that competition."
00:28:25,00:28:26,"So slightly, yeah."
00:28:26,00:28:29,"Makes me think she actually wasn't a very good baker, because if your sister's in the"
00:28:29,00:28:31,"competition, you still can't buy first prize."
00:28:31,00:28:34,Come on mate.
00:28:34,00:28:39,"She used to make gingerbread, really good gingerbread, and she used to lower it down for neighborhood"
00:28:39,00:28:40,children.
00:28:40,00:28:44,"So she loved children, Emily Dickinson, and the people in the area in the neighborhood"
00:28:44,00:28:47,kind of knew about her.
00:28:47,00:28:54,"She was a recluse, as you say, later on in life, post this great competition triumph thing."
00:28:54,00:28:56,"But the children knew about her, and they'd run to her window, and then she erected a"
00:28:56,00:28:59,"kind of basket, which she lowered down on a string."
00:28:59,00:29:04,"And one of the people, one of the boys, remembered her later on doing it, and she'd do it and"
00:29:04,00:29:07,"make it like a game, so she'd do it very, very gradually, and gingerly, gingerly."
00:29:07,00:29:08,Brilliant.
00:29:08,00:29:13,"So as not to let the domestic servant know, because otherwise domestic servant Maggie would"
00:29:13,00:29:17,"be very angry, and then the kids would have to creep through the grass and then grab the"
00:29:17,00:29:18,gingerbread and leave.
00:29:18,00:29:21,"It's not like Maggie's getting ideas about the station, if she's stopping the lady of"
00:29:21,00:29:22,the house from giving out free gingerbread.
00:29:22,00:29:26,"Well, you know, that's good to know what side you're on, and that's it."
00:29:26,00:29:29,I'm just giving the local children gingerbread.
00:29:29,00:29:31,I just think lady of the house is a little bit...
00:29:31,00:29:33,She was the lady of the house.
00:29:33,00:29:37,"Maggie hasn't made gingerbread for the children, she's made it for, you know..."
00:29:37,00:29:40,Was she giving away gingerbread that Maggie had made?
00:29:40,00:29:41,Yes.
00:29:41,00:29:43,So why is Emily Dickinson getting the credit for all this baking?
00:29:43,00:29:44,When she's giving away someone else's gingerbread.
00:29:44,00:29:45,"Sorry, you're right."
00:29:45,00:29:48,"This boy said, ""I don't know if Emily Dickinson had made the gingerbread, or if Maggie had"
00:29:48,00:29:51,"made the gingerbread, but she seemed to be afraid of Maggie telling her not to."""
00:29:51,00:29:52,So you're right.
00:29:52,00:29:55,I think Maggie is getting ideas about the station.
00:29:55,00:29:57,Stopping Emily from giving out her gingerbread.
00:29:57,00:30:00,"Actually, if Maggie had made it, I've now come back round to her point of view, and I"
00:30:00,00:30:02,think she's getting ideas at her station.
00:30:02,00:30:05,"Like, she's correct to be irritated about this."
00:30:05,00:30:12,"It was actually quite a good spot for literary figures, this amorous place, because you had"
00:30:12,00:30:16,"not only Emily Dickinson, who obviously found out that she was amazing after her death,"
00:30:16,00:30:19,but you had people like Melville Dewey was there.
00:30:19,00:30:20,Was he from the Dewey Decimal System?
00:30:20,00:30:21,"Yeah, he was."
00:30:21,00:30:22,Yeah.
00:30:22,00:30:23,Where did he live?
00:30:23,00:30:27,From number one to number 121.04.
00:30:27,00:30:31,So he came up with the system while he was an assistant librarian at the Amherst College
00:30:31,00:30:35,"in 1876, looked into him a bit, ""Terrible human."""
00:30:35,00:30:36,"Yeah, I think he's been shallower than that."
00:30:36,00:30:37,"""Terrible human."""
00:30:37,00:30:38,"We're not supposed to use the system anymore at anything, can we?"
00:30:38,00:30:39,"Wow, really."
00:30:39,00:30:40,I believe he's been cancelled.
00:30:40,00:30:42,"He's been cancelled, but we've cancelled the system now."
00:30:42,00:30:43,We've cancelled the whole system.
00:30:43,00:30:45,It's a hell of a system to cancel.
00:30:45,00:30:48,"Robert Frost, the poet, was from there as well."
00:30:48,00:30:51,"Noah Webster was from there as well, of Webster's Dictionary."
00:30:51,00:30:52,Really?
00:30:52,00:30:56,"Yeah, he lived there, and he started writing it there, so not all these people were born"
00:30:56,00:30:57,"there, but they did huge chunks."
00:30:57,00:31:02,"He lived in Amherst, and then he went to Baltimore, and then he went to Chicago, and then he went"
00:31:02,00:31:03,up.
00:31:03,00:31:04,Yeah.
00:31:04,00:31:05,I wanted to see how long you'd get.
00:31:05,00:31:06,Alpha Betcher.
00:31:06,00:31:07,He was doing it.
00:31:07,00:31:08,Whoa.
00:31:08,00:31:09,"What was your next one, Denver?"
00:31:09,00:31:10,Yeah.
00:31:10,00:31:11,Nice.
00:31:11,00:31:12,I didn't have one after that.
00:31:12,00:31:14,"An American place beginning with E, East Virginia."
00:31:14,00:31:15,Yeah?
00:31:15,00:31:16,That's not a place?
00:31:16,00:31:17,No.
00:31:17,00:31:18,"There's Virginia, and there's West Virginia."
00:31:18,00:31:19,"Oh, my God."
00:31:19,00:31:26,"I meant the East of Virginia, obviously."
00:31:26,00:31:30,"She was such an interesting character, so I mean, first of all, she was really funny"
00:31:30,00:31:31,and fun.
00:31:31,00:31:34,"I think that people, because they know of Emmy Dickinson as this person who only ever"
00:31:34,00:31:37,"wore white, which she did, and she never left the house."
00:31:37,00:31:39,She was picturing a few other things.
00:31:39,00:31:41,"In fact, I think in the only picture we've got of her, she's not wearing white."
00:31:41,00:31:45,"Again, sorry, when I say only ever, we're expected in black and white, so she's wearing"
00:31:45,00:31:46,"black, presumably."
00:31:46,00:31:47,Just gray.
00:31:47,00:31:48,Yeah.
00:31:48,00:31:51,This is after she became a recluse.
00:31:51,00:31:52,"About the last 20 years of her life, wasn't she?"
00:31:52,00:31:53,Yeah.
00:31:53,00:31:54,She became a recluse.
00:31:54,00:31:55,But she was very funny.
00:31:55,00:32:01,"If you read her poems, they are kind of witty or dry or piss-take-y."
00:32:01,00:32:05,"I always thought one of the best opening lines to a poem was one of her most famous poems,"
00:32:05,00:32:09,"which opens, ""Because I could not stop for death, he kindly stopped for me."""
00:32:09,00:32:15,"Which I just love as a bit of, I don't know, it's humorous, it's dark, and it's an excellent"
00:32:15,00:32:16,poem.
00:32:16,00:32:19,But I think she did think about publishing a lot.
00:32:19,00:32:20,She knew she was great.
00:32:20,00:32:22,It wasn't like she had no idea she was great.
00:32:22,00:32:26,"She wrote to all these famous writers and publishers who said, ""Please let me publish"
00:32:26,00:32:27,"your poems."""
00:32:27,00:32:29,"And she would say, ""Oh no, it'd be dreadful being published."
00:32:29,00:32:31,I'm not nearly egotistical enough for that.
00:32:31,00:32:36,"How dreary to be somebody, how public, like a frog, to tell your name the live long June"
00:32:36,00:32:38,"to an admiring bog."""
00:32:38,00:32:39,So she had it in her mind.
00:32:39,00:32:43,"She was quite like Lady Doth Protest too much about it, I think."
00:32:43,00:32:44,Wow.
00:32:44,00:32:47,"Just a quick reminder, Andy's new novel will be out."
00:32:47,00:32:48,I know.
00:32:48,00:32:53,"By the time you listen to it, I'm regretting it."
00:32:53,00:32:57,"For you, the admiring bog of the listeners."
00:32:57,00:33:02,"She wrote to a guy called Thomas Wentworth Higginson asking if she could possibly, or"
00:33:02,00:33:05,"if her poems were good enough to be published, I should say."
00:33:05,00:33:09,And he actually thought that her poems were too eccentric to be published at the time.
00:33:09,00:33:14,"But he told her to avoid sloppy dashes, which if you've read any Emily Dickinson, it's"
00:33:14,00:33:15,just dashes.
00:33:15,00:33:16,It's almost all dashes.
00:33:16,00:33:17,It's just dashes.
00:33:17,00:33:20,"It's like half of Morse code, her poetry."
00:33:20,00:33:21,Right.
00:33:21,00:33:24,"I would say go back and ignore the dashes, because I remember when I was younger that"
00:33:24,00:33:27,"really put me off, because it seems so jerky."
00:33:27,00:33:29,But then if you ignore them and pretend they're normal punctuation.
00:33:29,00:33:35,"Just quickly on the Higginson man who reviewed, sort of looked over her poetry."
00:33:35,00:33:38,"So he said her writing was, I'm quoting it, ""so peculiar it seems as if the writer might"
00:33:38,00:33:43,"have taken her first lessons by studying the famous fossil bird tracks in the museum."""
00:33:43,00:33:44,"Okay, this is interesting."
00:33:44,00:33:51,"Amherst, again, like great literary womb, all of this, had these bird tracks in stone,"
00:33:51,00:33:53,which were the first dinosaur tracks ever found.
00:33:53,00:33:59,"And they were found by a 12-year-old ploughboy called Pliny, weird, so he was called Pliny"
00:33:59,00:34:00,"Moody, amazing name."
00:34:00,00:34:05,"And this was 40 years before the word dinosaur was coined, really."
00:34:05,00:34:10,"But they were known, they were nicknamed these tracks as the marks of Noah's raven."
00:34:10,00:34:11,That was what they were called.
00:34:11,00:34:14,"This lovely sort of evocative phrase for dinosaur footsteps, Noah's raven."
00:34:14,00:34:17,"And Emily Dickinson wrote, ""The thing with feathers, and dinosaurs have feathers."""
00:34:17,00:34:18,Oh my God.
00:34:18,00:34:19,Is that where we're going?
00:34:19,00:34:21,"The thing is, it's all connected."
00:34:21,00:34:22,Oh my God.
00:34:22,00:34:24,Is that your favorite one of her poems?
00:34:24,00:34:25,I don't really have one.
00:34:25,00:34:28,I didn't know very much about her at all before this.
00:34:28,00:34:31,I think there's one that you would like if you ever heard it.
00:34:31,00:34:33,All overgrown by cunning moss.
00:34:33,00:34:34,There we go.
00:34:34,00:34:35,Amen.
00:34:35,00:34:36,Amen.
00:34:36,00:34:37,She's a genius.
00:34:37,00:34:42,"What was her hit rate in terms of, we now know that she wrote about 1800, that's what"
00:34:42,00:34:44,"she left behind, poems."
00:34:44,00:34:45,How many of those have been published?
00:34:45,00:34:46,All of them.
00:34:46,00:34:47,Yeah.
00:34:47,00:34:51,But there's an incredibly weird story.
00:34:51,00:34:54,"The ones that you're talking about have all been published, and we can see all of them."
00:34:54,00:34:57,"And I would say everyone I've read, I've enjoyed."
00:34:57,00:34:58,Yeah.
00:34:58,00:34:59,But...
00:34:59,00:35:00,"So, okay."
00:35:00,00:35:01,"Her sister found them all after she died, Lavinia, Vinnie."
00:35:01,00:35:04,"And she destroyed a lot of paperwork, but correspondents and stuff like that."
00:35:04,00:35:07,So there was this mad argument between two sides of the family.
00:35:07,00:35:11,"It's all a bit complicated because her brother was called Austin Dickinson, and her brother"
00:35:11,00:35:15,"had a mistress called Mabel Loomis Todd, right?"
00:35:15,00:35:16,So some of the poems went there.
00:35:16,00:35:21,"Some of the poems went to the family of her brother, and basically the two halves of Dickinson's"
00:35:21,00:35:23,literary estate were in different hands.
00:35:23,00:35:28,"Neither family owned all the manuscripts, and neither could produce eight complete Dickinson."
00:35:28,00:35:31,One side sold them to Harvard for about half a million dollars in modern money.
00:35:31,00:35:36,"So then Harvard have claimed ownership of Dickinson in general, and for a while people"
00:35:36,00:35:38,have asked permission to Harvard to quote lines of Dickinson.
00:35:38,00:35:39,So basically it's Vex.
00:35:39,00:35:43,It feels like Amherst could be a good setting for a soap opera.
00:35:43,00:35:44,Yeah.
00:35:44,00:35:47,So you act on Emily Dickinson's dining room table for the first time.
00:35:47,00:35:48,Sorry.
00:35:48,00:35:49,Who?
00:35:49,00:35:50,Who's that?
00:35:50,00:35:51,Sorry.
00:35:51,00:35:52,Yeah.
00:35:52,00:35:53,That should have been clear.
00:35:53,00:35:54,"Austin and Mabel, who he was having their fair with."
00:35:54,00:35:55,Okay.
00:35:55,00:35:56,"With an Emily and Lavinia new, it seemed like a bit of an opus."
00:35:56,00:35:57,This is just gossip.
00:35:57,00:35:58,I know.
00:35:58,00:35:59,Let's put it down on the dining table.
00:35:59,00:36:00,Ooh.
00:36:00,00:36:03,"Hey, we've got it in writing first hand."
00:36:03,00:36:04,So it's Austin and Mabel.
00:36:04,00:36:05,Yes.
00:36:05,00:36:06,Okay.
00:36:06,00:36:09,"And it's so weird because Emily never met Mabel, but you know, they were having an affair"
00:36:09,00:36:13,"of 13 years, and Mabel would come round to Emily's house, which was next door, and they'd"
00:36:13,00:36:15,have sex on the dining room table.
00:36:15,00:36:20,"And Mabel actually played piano for Emily once, and Emily listened from behind a corner"
00:36:20,00:36:21,in the house.
00:36:21,00:36:22,What?
00:36:22,00:36:26,"And sort of delivered her a glass of sherry at the end to say, well done, lovely playing."
00:36:26,00:36:31,"Just very quickly on the recluse and all wearing white and all that kind of stuff, Martha"
00:36:31,00:36:35,"Nell Smith, who's like one of the main scholars of Dickinson, she works at the University of"
00:36:35,00:36:36,Maryland.
00:36:36,00:36:41,And she says that actually a lot of the image that we know now of Dickinson is kind of Victorian
00:36:41,00:36:46,"propaganda, and that I'll kind of say paraphrase what she says."
00:36:46,00:36:51,"She says, you know how right now, if you have a rock star, you kind of have this idea of"
00:36:51,00:36:54,"sex, drugs, rock and roll, wearing black, all that kind of stuff."
00:36:54,00:36:58,"Well, in the late 19th century, the idea of a woman poet would be someone who had a secret"
00:36:58,00:37:03,"sorrow, someone who was reclusive, someone who dressed in white, and she reckons that"
00:37:03,00:37:06,a lot of the stories that we hear now are quite exaggerated.
00:37:06,00:37:10,"I mean, obviously she did stay in the house a lot, but a lot of them are exaggerated because"
00:37:10,00:37:12,that was our idea of a poet at the time.
00:37:12,00:37:13,That is really interesting.
00:37:13,00:37:14,"And the sex, drugs and rock and roll."
00:37:14,00:37:19,"I mean, to be fair, people used to accuse her, not accuse her, but say it was all about"
00:37:19,00:37:21,"her lost love, or she was spurned in love."
00:37:21,00:37:26,"And immediately after she died, like the 1890s, people are saying, well, she must have been"
00:37:26,00:37:27,cheated on by some bloke.
00:37:27,00:37:30,"And actually, I think she might have shagged someone in her house."
00:37:30,00:37:32,So we say she must have been cheated.
00:37:32,00:37:33,"Oh, there we go."
00:37:33,00:37:34,"Over which table, Anna?"
00:37:34,00:37:38,"We think that, I can't remember why he was cool, but someone came to Vizu as a great"
00:37:38,00:37:39,admirer.
00:37:39,00:37:41,"They had a little dalliance, maybe."
00:37:41,00:37:42,Wow.
00:37:42,00:37:44,"She was actually, she was quite sociable for a recluse."
00:37:44,00:37:48,"She was like, you know how permits we always, we've done, we've talked about hermets before"
00:37:48,00:37:50,and they'd have people visit them constantly every day.
00:37:50,00:37:51,And she did sort of...
00:37:51,00:37:52,She think it was Webster.
00:37:52,00:37:54,"And he was like, nice arse, nice boobs."
00:37:54,00:37:55,Nice.
00:37:55,00:37:56,Anyway.
00:37:56,00:38:07,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:38:07,00:38:11,"My fact is that as well as a caterpillar which avoids predators by pretending to be a bird,"
00:38:11,00:38:15,there is a bird which avoids predators by pretending to be a caterpillar.
00:38:15,00:38:20,"He could pretend to be a caterpillar who's pretending to be a bird, and then you don't"
00:38:20,00:38:22,have to do any disguise.
00:38:22,00:38:23,You just...
00:38:23,00:38:24,"Yeah, exactly."
00:38:24,00:38:25,"You just say, I'm a caterpillar."
00:38:25,00:38:26,Is it?
00:38:26,00:38:30,Because that does sound like it's come up with this and it's walked into the room full of
00:38:30,00:38:32,"birds and thought, I've fucked up."
00:38:32,00:38:34,How's that helping?
00:38:34,00:38:36,These are two separate species.
00:38:36,00:38:39,"One of them actually we have mentioned before, I should fess up, it's called the North American"
00:38:39,00:38:41,Walnut Sphinx Caterpillar.
00:38:41,00:38:47,"It's not a sphinx, but it screams like a bird, which is the way it avoids predators."
00:38:47,00:38:51,"Weird Nelly Furtado version of that song, doesn't it?"
00:38:51,00:38:56,"Yeah, it makes the alarm call that a bird would make if it had seen a bird of prey."
00:38:56,00:38:59,"And so the other birds that would be eating the caterpillar think, oh God, there's a bird"
00:38:59,00:39:00,of prey in there.
00:39:00,00:39:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:01,00:39:05,"And just one extra detail on it, the report on orderbond.org, great bird website, says"
00:39:05,00:39:10,"that the insect can be, I'm quoting here, as loud as a freight train from 50 feet away."
00:39:10,00:39:11,Slightly have my doubts about it.
00:39:11,00:39:14,It depends how close you move the caterpillar to your ear.
00:39:14,00:39:19,"So you know, if you put the caterpillar right, right down, like shove it into your ear right"
00:39:19,00:39:22,"next to your eardrum, it'll be the same as a train all that distance."
00:39:22,00:39:23,I see what you're saying.
00:39:23,00:39:26,I thought what they were saying here was that if you have a freight train 50 feet away and
00:39:26,00:39:32,"you have the caterpillar 50 feet away, it feels like that's a pointless use of the phrase"
00:39:32,00:39:33,50 feet.
00:39:33,00:39:34,Yeah.
00:39:34,00:39:35,Okay.
00:39:35,00:39:39,"So anyway, the bird just quickly is called the Cenarius Mourna bird."
00:39:39,00:39:40,And it lives in the Amazon.
00:39:40,00:39:44,So it's probably not going to come across this caterpillar anytime soon.
00:39:44,00:39:48,"And the chicks imitate poisonous caterpillars, specifically the chicks, they have these spiky"
00:39:48,00:39:53,"orange feathers and it moves when its parents are away, it moves in this weird, slinky way"
00:39:53,00:39:58,and it looks genuinely exactly like a poisonous caterpillar local to the region.
00:39:58,00:39:59,It's insane.
00:39:59,00:40:00,It's nuts.
00:40:00,00:40:01,Yeah.
00:40:01,00:40:02,It's absolutely insane.
00:40:02,00:40:03,And it does this right at the beginning.
00:40:03,00:40:07,"It's like the first 20 days that it mimics this caterpillar and it's, yeah, when you"
00:40:07,00:40:11,"see pictures of it, it just looks exactly like this caterpillar."
00:40:11,00:40:14,"And when even the mother comes back to feed them, so it's because the mother has to go"
00:40:14,00:40:17,"away, do all the foraging that they're open to predators, it's only when the mother comes"
00:40:17,00:40:22,"back and makes the actual like bird call, like that they go, oh, okay, now we can give"
00:40:22,00:40:26,"it up because if she comes back and doesn't do that, they still pretend to be the caterpillars."
00:40:26,00:40:28,It's absolutely incredible.
00:40:28,00:40:32,"I would bring, if I was a predator, I would bring back one of those caterpillars and I"
00:40:32,00:40:37,would make the caterpillar do a bird call and then trick the chicks into thinking it was
00:40:37,00:40:38,their parents.
00:40:38,00:40:39,"Yes, exactly."
00:40:39,00:40:43,"But they sort of like, it's not even just the look, they're the same size as the caterpillars"
00:40:43,00:40:44,as well.
00:40:44,00:40:45,They're 12 centimetres long.
00:40:45,00:40:46,"I mean, it's, yeah."
00:40:46,00:40:51,"That feels important when it comes to camouflage, you know, if they make themselves look like"
00:40:51,00:40:56,"an elephant, but they're 12 centimetres long, no one's going to get tricked by that."
00:40:56,00:41:02,"The caterpillar, it looks like, is from the family Megalopigidae and you might have seen"
00:41:02,00:41:08,"that this caterpillar or a related caterpillar on the internet because he's got very bushy,"
00:41:08,00:41:14,"sort of blondish hair, they're actually pointy kind of venomous bristles that they have,"
00:41:14,00:41:18,but they have been known as the Trumperpillar because it looks like Donald Trump's hair
00:41:18,00:41:19,has fallen over.
00:41:19,00:41:20,"Oh, that one."
00:41:20,00:41:21,"Yeah, yeah."
00:41:21,00:41:22,That's so cool.
00:41:22,00:41:23,I didn't realise they were in that family.
00:41:23,00:41:24,"They're related, yeah."
00:41:24,00:41:29,"They disguise themselves as Donald Trump to escape, you know, execution."
00:41:29,00:41:36,They do look like the ones that they disguise themselves look a bit like that Donald Trump
00:41:36,00:41:37,"hair one, right?"
00:41:37,00:41:38,Yeah.
00:41:38,00:41:39,They're quite kind of bushy and blonde.
00:41:39,00:41:41,"Yeah, it's just the colour difference, like these ones are orange, but they both look"
00:41:41,00:41:42,a bit quiffy.
00:41:42,00:41:43,Yeah.
00:41:43,00:41:44,Yeah.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"This is a thing called Batesian mimicry, isn't it?"
00:41:46,00:41:50,The bird is definitely doing this because it's where a harmless species looks like a
00:41:50,00:41:52,"noxious species, so predators avoid them."
00:41:52,00:41:57,I think that and a type of owl are the only two that do the Batesian mimicry.
00:41:57,00:42:01,There's an owl that burrows underneath the ground and when it feels like a predator is
00:42:01,00:42:03,"coming in, it hisses like a rattlesnake."
00:42:03,00:42:05,It's got like a tsssss kind of rags.
00:42:05,00:42:06,Okay.
00:42:06,00:42:10,There's a caterpillar called the Biston Robustum caterpillar and it can make itself look like
00:42:10,00:42:11,a twig.
00:42:11,00:42:12,Okay.
00:42:12,00:42:13,That's good.
00:42:13,00:42:14,Standard camouflage.
00:42:14,00:42:15,Yeah.
00:42:15,00:42:17,But it can also make itself smell exactly like a twig.
00:42:17,00:42:18,Isn't that cool?
00:42:18,00:42:19,That is so good.
00:42:19,00:42:23,Because only when like a bird going past will see a twig and not go and eat it.
00:42:23,00:42:27,"If there's an ant that goes past it, it'll walk along the twig and then it'll just walk"
00:42:27,00:42:32,along the caterpillar and think that it's on a twig and the reason that we know that
00:42:32,00:42:37,"works is if you put the caterpillar on another twig that smells different, the ants will"
00:42:37,00:42:38,notice it.
00:42:38,00:42:43,So it'll only hide it on this very specific thing and they hunt by pheromones or they
00:42:43,00:42:46,detect things through pheromones and through smell.
00:42:46,00:42:49,So does it have to smell like the twig of a particular plant?
00:42:49,00:42:50,The one that it's on.
00:42:50,00:42:51,Yeah.
00:42:51,00:42:55,"So it needs that plant identification app, presumably, to work out which tree to get"
00:42:55,00:42:57,on to.
00:42:57,00:42:58,I just got that app.
00:42:58,00:42:59,Yeah.
00:42:59,00:43:00,It's changed my life.
00:43:00,00:43:01,Really?
00:43:01,00:43:03,"Because I find it's not very reliable in my garden, I must say."
00:43:03,00:43:04,I've uprooted everything.
00:43:04,00:43:10,You've bought yourself a horse chest nut scent and you lie on the branches.
00:43:10,00:43:11,That is so cool.
00:43:11,00:43:12,Yeah.
00:43:12,00:43:13,That is amazing.
00:43:13,00:43:14,Incredible.
00:43:14,00:43:16,And I've been eating bits of that plant so that's...
00:43:16,00:43:17,"Ah, okay."
00:43:17,00:43:18,Right.
00:43:18,00:43:19,Have you guys seen the Great Potu?
00:43:19,00:43:20,No.
00:43:20,00:43:21,Such a good bird.
00:43:21,00:43:25,"It's basically big animals that are camouflaged, that kind of cool it to us in a way, right?"
00:43:25,00:43:26,Yeah.
00:43:26,00:43:31,And the Great Potu is a 60cm tall bird that disguises itself as a tree branch.
00:43:31,00:43:33,And it's such a great life because it just stands on a tree.
00:43:33,00:43:37,It has exactly the right colourings to look like sort of broken up bark.
00:43:37,00:43:40,"And it has to stand at a bit of an angle because, you know, a branch will branch off"
00:43:40,00:43:42,the main trunk at an angle.
00:43:42,00:43:47,"So it leans forward a little bit, points its beak right upwards so that it just goes up"
00:43:47,00:43:48,in a straight line.
00:43:48,00:43:51,The only problem is it has these giant eyes which glow.
00:43:51,00:43:52,Oh yeah.
00:43:52,00:43:53,So it's really great.
00:43:53,00:43:54,So what does it...
00:43:54,00:43:56,What do people think that is?
00:43:56,00:43:57,So...
00:43:57,00:43:58,It just closes its eyes.
00:43:58,00:43:59,It has to close its eyes the whole time.
00:43:59,00:44:01,But then that's not very useful for catching prey.
00:44:01,00:44:04,But it can't tell also if someone's approaching it.
00:44:04,00:44:05,Exactly.
00:44:05,00:44:08,Because if someone's approaching it or if someone's nearby and it closes its eyes.
00:44:08,00:44:09,Yeah.
00:44:09,00:44:10,"Well, that's the problem."
00:44:10,00:44:12,It can't tell if the coast is clear because it's on your way to...
00:44:12,00:44:15,"So when it closes its eyes, its eyes open."
00:44:15,00:44:17,"If God closes one eye, it opens another."
00:44:17,00:44:23,It's got a tiny slit on its eyelid and it's actually able to move this slit around depending
00:44:23,00:44:27,on where it wants to look so it can just peer through.
00:44:27,00:44:28,That's cool.
00:44:28,00:44:29,60 centimetres.
00:44:29,00:44:30,Yeah.
00:44:30,00:44:31,I was described as two rulers.
00:44:31,00:44:34,How are you going to make yourself transparent?
00:44:34,00:44:36,"Well, I wouldn't rule that."
00:44:36,00:44:40,"But if you're camouflaging, you want to be a transparent ruler, don't you?"
00:44:40,00:44:41,Yeah.
00:44:41,00:44:42,Yeah.
00:44:42,00:44:46,I would just like grow the word shatterproof on my chest.
00:44:46,00:44:49,"Shout ""boing"" over time."
00:44:49,00:44:58,And then just eat unsuspecting schoolteachers.
00:44:58,00:44:59,Humans camouflage.
00:44:59,00:45:00,Don't we?
00:45:00,00:45:01,Yeah.
00:45:01,00:45:02,From time to time.
00:45:02,00:45:03,In war?
00:45:03,00:45:04,In war.
00:45:04,00:45:07,"In World War II, in fact, there was at least one American soldier who had put lace doilies"
00:45:07,00:45:10,on his helmet to camouflage himself whenever it was snowing.
00:45:10,00:45:11,There's a piece of furniture.
00:45:11,00:45:12,"No, because it's white."
00:45:12,00:45:13,It's already a teapot.
00:45:13,00:45:14,"That's what you put a doily on, isn't it?"
00:45:14,00:45:21,"You put it all over the back of an armchair, I think, in a little doily."
00:45:21,00:45:22,Yeah.
00:45:22,00:45:23,He's not mimicking anything.
00:45:23,00:45:24,He's just trying to hide himself.
00:45:24,00:45:25,There's a German disguised as a teapot sitting inside of the Brits.
00:45:25,00:45:26,Barret.
00:45:26,00:45:27,Closer.
00:45:27,00:45:28,Closer.
00:45:28,00:45:41,"Sarge, that chair's moving."
00:45:41,00:45:42,That'd be ridiculous.
00:45:42,00:45:43,That's incredible.
00:45:43,00:45:45,"Yeah, I saw that picture on Reddit and I thought it couldn't possibly be true, but I found"
00:45:45,00:45:49,"it in the Philadelphia Inquirer from 1945, so it definitely didn't happen."
00:45:49,00:45:52,"So it's just to blend them with the snow, basically?"
00:45:52,00:45:53,"Yeah, yeah."
00:45:53,00:45:54,Definitely did happen.
00:45:54,00:45:55,"We don't know that definitely did work, do we?"
00:45:55,00:45:57,"No, we don't."
00:45:57,00:46:01,"This picture was in 1945, so we certainly got towards the end of the war."
00:46:01,00:46:02,Okay.
00:46:02,00:46:03,That's good.
00:46:03,00:46:04,That's amazing.
00:46:04,00:46:11,"I was reading about a trend in parent stuff, parent clobber, a trend of, you know, baby"
00:46:11,00:46:12,"carriers, slings that you put the baby in."
00:46:12,00:46:13,Like a poos kind of thing.
00:46:13,00:46:14,Like a poos.
00:46:14,00:46:15,"Yeah, yeah."
00:46:15,00:46:21,But there's a growing trend for ones aimed at men to have them in camo coloration so that
00:46:21,00:46:25,men feel less uncomfortable carrying the baby around.
00:46:25,00:46:26,"Oh, really?"
00:46:26,00:46:27,Yeah.
00:46:27,00:46:30,"So you feel like you're in jungle warfare, but actually you're just taking your baby"
00:46:30,00:46:31,to the shop.
00:46:31,00:46:35,"So no one's going, ""What baby?"""
00:46:35,00:46:39,"It's for men who still want to play the field a bit, maybe chat some people up, disguise"
00:46:39,00:46:40,the baby.
00:46:40,00:46:41,Yeah.
00:46:41,00:46:44,"Yeah, they're in bars, camo, chatting up women."
00:46:44,00:46:47,"Yeah, pretty single and free and easy to live in."
00:46:47,00:46:48,What's that?
00:46:48,00:46:50,"Oh, it's my, my pager."
00:46:50,00:46:51,Pager.
00:46:51,00:46:58,"And he's chatting up quite a long time ago, last time you were chatting anyone up."
00:46:58,00:47:01,I think we've established he's been in pretty old school.
00:47:01,00:47:02,He's a doctor.
00:47:02,00:47:03,That's it.
00:47:03,00:47:04,He's a doctor.
00:47:04,00:47:05,He's still using pagers.
00:47:05,00:47:06,Yeah.
00:47:06,00:47:07,Yeah.
00:47:07,00:47:08,"It's quite Piers Morgany, isn't it?"
00:47:08,00:47:13,"Was he not, was he the one who kind of said, ""Oh, I can't believe this celebrity man is carrying"
00:47:13,00:47:14,"a baby?"""
00:47:14,00:47:15,"It was Daniel Craig, I think."
00:47:15,00:47:16,Yeah.
00:47:16,00:47:20,"Literally James Bond himself carrying a baby and Piers Morgan was going, ""He's actually"
00:47:20,00:47:21,doing it in every Bond movie.
00:47:21,00:47:22,"You just can't see it."""
00:47:22,00:47:23,Very irresponsible.
00:47:23,00:47:28,Do you remember a few years back when Trump set up the space force?
00:47:28,00:47:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:47:29,00:47:30,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:30,00:47:34,"That was, they did the official uniform of the, of the space force."
00:47:34,00:47:35,"It wasn't his idea, was it?"
00:47:35,00:47:38,There was a caterpillar on his head who was whispering the idea to him.
00:47:38,00:47:39,That would explain.
00:47:39,00:47:41,"Oh, for what?"
00:47:41,00:47:46,"Well, yeah, when they released it, they got mocked a lot for it because it was camouflage"
00:47:46,00:47:47,gear.
00:47:47,00:47:48,"Oh, well, like jungle camouflage."
00:47:48,00:47:49,Yeah.
00:47:49,00:47:50,With space forces.
00:47:50,00:47:54,"Whereas what you should wear in space, I guess, is one of those kind of kid's pajama"
00:47:54,00:47:59,sets that has a black sky and all the constellations on it.
00:47:59,00:48:02,Who attacked you?
00:48:02,00:48:03,"Well, I don't know."
00:48:03,00:48:10,"It looked like a riot, crazy."
00:48:10,00:48:11,"Okay, that's it."
00:48:11,00:48:12,That's all of our facts.
