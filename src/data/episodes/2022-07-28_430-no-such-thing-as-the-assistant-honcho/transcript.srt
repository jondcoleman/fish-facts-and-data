 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,720
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,600
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,320
 and James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,600
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,840
 Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,040
 My fact this week is that there's hardly any fresh water on Easter Island, so the indigenous

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,000
 people drank straight from the sea.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,360
 That's why they're dead.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,480
 They all immediately died, they landed there, a thousand years ago, all died, no they didn't

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
 die.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,120
 This is the amazing thing about it.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,880
 So Europeans first got there in the 1700s, 1722, they noticed that the indigenous people

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,280
 there, the Pacific Islanders who travelled over there hundreds of years earlier, seemed

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,320
 to be drinking straight from the sea.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,120
 Very confusing, haven't thought about it again for 400 years and then scientists looked into

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,200
 it and they realized that actually fresh water kind of emerges on the shore.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,480
 So the fact that there's no fresh water or very little fresh water because the soil is

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,880
 super porous and so it rains and the soil just sucks it in straight away, no streams

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
 or anything.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,320
 But the rainwater goes down into the earth and then travels out to the beach underground

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,640
 and then it re-emerges just at the shoreline.

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,080
 So when the tide's out you can kind of go and scoop up some of that water which is in

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,760
 the very shallows of the sea and it's still salty, don't get me wrong, I think it would

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
 taste like shit.

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
 Yep.

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
 It won't taste like salt.

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,360
 It all tastes like salt but it's not salty enough that it dehydrates you to death.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,280
 So it's like a river but it's underground kind of, right?

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
 Yeah.

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,680
 How did they survive long enough to experiment with that, to not be wiped out?

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
 That's extraordinary, right?

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,120
 I thought initially that it would just be a body of water that was consistently there.

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,200
 You're telling me a tide has to go out and then they find the water?

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,640
 Yeah, although the tide does go out most days.

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,160
 Yeah, true, but it's annoying having to wait 12 hours if you're at a time of wrong.

38
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,200
 And it's annoying like this morning I had to wait for Starbucks to open, that's annoying

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
 as well.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
 That's the same, isn't it.

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,680
 We can empathize in a lot of ways.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,400
 I guess if you're thirsty and you're really dying of thirst and the only water that you

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,360
 can see is the water on the shore of the sea, maybe you give it a try?

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,420
 And also it's a 1200, they didn't know anything.

45
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,840
 It's very far away from, can we just say how far away from stuff East Ireland is?

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,160
 The nearest inhabited island is 2,000 kilometres away, South America is 3,500 kilometres away

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,280
 so it's in the very, very, it's in the South Pacific, isn't it?

48
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,720
 It's just so far from everywhere.

49
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,640
 It's kind of halfway between Chile and Australia, isn't it really?

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,240
 Because when I went to South America I thought, oh well just pop over to Easter Island for

51
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,420
 maybe a couple of days, that'd be really cool.

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,000
 And then I looked about how long the flight was going to be and I'm not going to get there

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,320
 and that's the amazing thing, isn't it?

54
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,920
 How do people get there and how do people end up there?

55
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,800
 Well we know it's the Polynesians, right, but like how did they discover the island?

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
 What were they doing?

57
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,800
 There's a lot of origin stories, there's a lot of archaeological, like everyone has

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,280
 a different idea that they bring to the table, but no one can decide.

59
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,560
 Your idea would be the Aliens one, I suppose, Dan?

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
 Is there an Aliens one?

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
 Of course there's an Aliens one.

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
 Yeah.

63
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
 Happy red that one.

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,040
 Your mate Dan, Eric von Daniken, is there someone you're talking about, James?

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,880
 Well it's just the, that's the famous one, right?

66
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
 Yeah, yeah.

67
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
 Wow.

68
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,680
 He thinks that a race of superior intelligent creatures got shipwrecked, effectively, on

69
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,600
 Easter Island, taught the locals how to make the statues, started making a load of them for

70
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,320
 their own amusement, then got picked up before they'd finished all of them, which is why some

71
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,520
 of the statues are not finished, and then just left again.

72
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,760
 His basically theory is that if there were ever any really amazing structures made where

73
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,800
 white people weren't there, then it must be aliens, so you could be pretty sure that

74
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
 he would think that.

75
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,840
 Yeah, he's not my mate by the way, can I just quickly, he's our specifically not to be

76
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
 associated with me, soâ€¦

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,560
 But yeah, Andy, about the statues, that's the famous thing, right, isn't it, the statues,

78
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,240
 the big heads on Easter Island, and there's a thing about the big heads that they tend

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,360
 to be clustered near the areas where you can get this water, and so some people think that

80
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,760
 maybe they were kind of a marker to tell you where the best place is to get a little bit

81
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
 of drinking water there.

82
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
 Oh, wow.

83
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,760
 They've recently realised that the positioning of the statues coincides with particularly

84
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,840
 these areas of freshwater springs, and even inland, it coincides with places where you

85
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,240
 be able to get a well and get some fresh water, and it makes sense, if you're going to sign

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,040
 post anything as a bunch of rural islanders, you probably sign post water, don't you?

87
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,000
 But that's such a big sign post, that's the thing, it's an amazingly, it's so much

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,360
 effort to go to flag there is water here.

89
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,720
 But it was kind of their thing though, wasn't it, like there's a thousand of them on the

90
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,040
 island, you know, they'd make it up in this hill bit where they used volcanic rock in

91
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,480
 ash that was called tuff, and they would carve, and then they would drag down and slide down

92
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,320
 with an amazing sort of hit rate of not damaging them as well, which is pretty extraordinary

93
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,320
 given their size, you know, there's people who've gone and visited and seen broken ones,

94
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,200
 but on average, it was said that they could just bring them down, these giant structures

95
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,560
 and walk them to where they needed to be, and some of them would be, as you say, would

96
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,360
 be facing water, some would be facing inland to protect the land, some, there's seven in

97
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,520
 particular, which were meant to represent seven different Polynesian tribes that had

98
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,360
 come over, so a group of people facing the direction of which they all originated from,

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,000
 we don't know if that's true, that's just a theory on the island, yeah.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,960
 The big question is, when they were transporting them down, did they slide from the top of

101
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,600
 the hill on the Moai, like, they were sledges.

102
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
 On the Moai?

103
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,100
 They're called Moai, the statues.

104
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,520
 Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you meant did the statues slide on, yeah, yeah.

105
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
 On, no, no, no.

106
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,080
 But they might have been, the statues might have sledge, that's one theory, or they might

107
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,520
 have been put on log rollers.

108
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,160
 Well, Dan said walked, didn't he?

109
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,200
 And the other theory is that they walked into a position, that you put a big rope around

110
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,680
 them and just stroll them, you know, like when you're trying to move a heavy bit of furniture.

111
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
 Like a fridge.

112
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,040
 Yeah, you lift one corner and move that, and then you put that down.

113
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,040
 And the aliens go, "Pivot!"

114
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
 Yeah.

115
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,920
 The other thing about them, which I think you found out recently, James, I mean, you weren't

116
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,760
 the original person to point it out, but there's as much of them underground as above ground.

117
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
 Yes.

118
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
 Unbelievable, they're not heads.

119
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,240
 They're just statues of entire bodies, but apparently over hundreds of years, soil accumulation

120
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,520
 and various bits of erosion and stuff buried the bodies.

121
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,440
 Isn't that incredible, though, that they didn't bury the bodies themselves, so it's not like

122
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
 they hid it.

123
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,440
 The erosion has happened that all of them just seem to have a head left.

124
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
 Yeah.

125
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
 That's quite amazing.

126
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,120
 It's like someone, it's like a kid been buried and sat, and his parents have left him there.

127
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,200
 We haven't talked about the most interesting structures on Easter Island, I would say.

128
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
 Oh, yeah.

129
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
 Which is their chicken houses.

130
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
 Do you guys read about these?

131
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
 No.

132
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,520
 So they've got great chicken houses.

133
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,920
 They're called haremoa, and they were almost impregnable to robbers, because obviously there

134
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,280
 was a time of long decline on the island, you needed to protect your protein wherever

135
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
 you could.

136
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
 Yeah.

137
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
 So they're vital.

138
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
 They should have really pivoted completely to chickens, I think, but I'm not going to

139
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
 give them advice.

140
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
 Look, they've clearly been through a lot.

141
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,880
 Anyway, these chicken houses were really good.

142
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,160
 They were two meters high, up to 20 meters long, made completely of stone.

143
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,200
 It's a huge can of stones, basically, and they are quite mysterious, because the other

144
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,680
 thing about them is that human skulls have been found inside the chicken houses.

145
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
 Whoa.

146
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,120
 Are we thinking that chickens actually were eating the humans?

147
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
 That's what I'm thinking.

148
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,200
 Do you think the chickens made the massive heads, because they thought human heads are

149
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
 so delicious?

150
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,080
 If we make some massive ones, then that will bring us more.

151
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
 It will bring more.

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
 I think that's it.

153
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
 Yeah.

154
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,880
 I think theory, and again, it's so much theorizing, I think it's that they were chief's skulls,

155
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,320
 and that they were believed to have a fertilizing power, these skulls, to increase the egg yields.

156
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
 So pretty goth.

157
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
 Oh, really?

158
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,200
 To just have some skulls in your hen house.

159
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,400
 I knew you'd like those hen houses, because they're like dry stone walls, aren't they,

160
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
 Andy?

161
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
 Yeah.

162
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
 They're very, very similar.

163
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
 And you said how they're impregnable.

164
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,560
 The interesting thing about that is, they're made like dry stone walls, so they're made

165
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,960
 of loads and loads of stones going all the way around.

166
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,040
 But one of the stones, you can pull out and use it as a door, but unless you're the one

167
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,940
 who built it, you don't know which stone it is, and so you can get in and get your chickens

168
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,800
 out, but no robber can get the chickens out.

169
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
 That's fantastic.

170
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
 That's so good.

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,120
 I'd love to go to Easter Island and only photograph the chicken houses.

172
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,360
 I would really come back with a slideshow for my family.

173
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,360
 There were 1,233 of those chicken houses, and only 887 stone heads, so I think we're

174
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,000
 concentrating on the wrong thing.

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,960
 I couldn't agree more.

176
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,520
 And do you think they should have pivoted to chickens because of the other thing that

177
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,400
 formed the basis of their protein diet, which was rats?

178
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,520
 Oh, another good reason to pivot to chickens.

179
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,800
 I do have so many reasons to pivot to chickens.

180
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,600
 They've done some studies recently, some analysis of the teeth of skeletons, and it shows that

181
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,460
 their source of protein was rats, and they ate loads of rats, although apparently Pacific

182
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,840
 Island rats are slightly tastier than European rats.

183
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
 Okay.

184
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
 Who's studied this?

185
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,480
 Yeah, we actually just read this in New Scientist or something, so I don't know how much all

186
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,120
 the researchers have gone to compare them.

187
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,720
 I'm still not going to Kentucky Fried Rat, that's all I say.

188
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,880
 But as you say, Andy and Dan, the theorizing is out of control.

189
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,200
 We know almost nothing, so pretty much everything we've said so far is just based on a few bits

190
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,760
 of evidence, and we piece stuff together.

191
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,480
 The stuff we know for sure is stuff that's told from living memory, and so the stuff

192
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,360
 we know for sure is actually about the cult that followed the big head cult, which is the

193
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,280
 Birdman cult, and we do actually have information about that, and this is another theory about

194
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,040
 who knocked down the head, so basically, Westerner's arrived, and sometime after Cook went

195
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,800
 there in the late 1700s, then the head cult was replaced with this Birdman cult, so they

196
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,000
 just tore down the heads because they were like, "We're the guys in charge now," but

197
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,360
 the cool thing about the Birdman cult was how they elected their head poncho.

198
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
 Did you read this?

199
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
 Did you say poncho then?

200
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
 Poncho.

201
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
 Poncho.

202
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
 I said poncho.

203
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
 Oh, good.

204
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,360
 Oh, I heard poncho as well.

205
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,100
 It's a phrase, but head poncho isn't a phrase.

206
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,340
 That's why we were surprised to hear it.

207
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
 It's almost a better phrase.

208
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
 It is, yeah.

209
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
 I'm the head poncho here.

210
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,800
 Especially if you've got a really awesome poncho whenever you get the combat.

211
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,120
 I think it would need that.

212
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
 Yeah.

213
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,160
 Is it just for your head?

214
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,840
 Are you wearing a poncho for your body, and then you've got a head poncho on top?

215
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
 Yeah, double poncho.

216
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,920
 This is what they wore on the islands.

217
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,000
 Because I know what a poncho is, and that's why I like the phrase, but I don't know what

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 a poncho is really, part of the - I get some guy.

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,040
 You never hear about poncho when not preceded by head, do you?

220
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,760
 You never hear about the second poncho in the world?

221
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
 No, you never do.

222
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
 No, no, no.

223
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
 Vice-honcho.

224
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,760
 Yes, I'm the assistant poncho.

225
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:39,440
 Well, look, the head poncho competition in the Birdman cult was to elect the Tangata

226
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,440
 Manu, who was the bird man of the year, happened every year.

227
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,560
 And essentially, it was the first person to find the first egg that was laid by the sooty

228
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,120
 turn every year, and the way they did it was...

229
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,320
 It's not...

230
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,680
 If they go like just whispering his ear, like a little bear, what's that sooty turn?

231
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,960
 You were the honcho last year, sooty, it's Sweep's turn now.

232
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,080
 Maybe all the statues are hollow inside.

233
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,280
 It's a massive Matthew Carbet who comes along and...

234
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
 With incredibly strong arms.

235
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,200
 They're the finger puppets of the gods, that's what they are.

236
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,560
 That is a Vontanican book I absolutely would devour.

237
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,160
 Sorry, they're trying to find the egg.

238
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
 Yeah, it does feel like we have wandered off course.

239
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,840
 They're trying to find the egg of the sooty turn, and the way they do it is the main competitors

240
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,160
 would either compete themselves or they'd elect a Hopu, which was someone who competed

241
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
 on their behalf.

242
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,960
 And what they had to do was they had to climb down this cliff, they'd have to swim a mile

243
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,680
 out to sea, very rough seas, mile out to sea, and land on this island.

244
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,840
 And it was the island where all the birds came and laid their eggs every spring.

245
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,120
 They wait there for a few weeks on this island, and then eventually the birds would arrive.

246
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,520
 The first one to spot the first egg would signal back to the main island and say, "I've

247
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,400
 got the egg, you win, master."

248
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,480
 And then the reward, here's where it gets really exciting, if you're the first one

249
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,800
 to get the egg is, you get to shave off your eyebrows and eyelashes and your head, your

250
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,560
 hair, not your head, and you took a new name that was adopted as the name of the year,

251
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,180
 and then you danced and sang your way to the royal residence where you had to live in total

252
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,180
 seclusion for a year.

253
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
 And that's what you get.

254
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,160
 It does sound quite good actually, living in total seclusion for a year.

255
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,560
 Yeah, and people bought you food actually.

256
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
 Did they?

257
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
 Yeah.

258
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
 It's a dream.

259
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
 But the food was rats.

260
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
 Yeah.

261
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
 But nice rats.

262
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
 Yeah, nice.

263
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:31,040
 All of the statues were knocked over at some point after first Western contact, when the

264
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,480
 first sailors arrived, which was 1722, there was a Dutchman called Jacob Roggeveen.

265
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,880
 He visited on Easter Day in 1722, which is why he gave it the name Easter Island.

266
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
 They were all standing.

267
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
 They were all fine.

268
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,720
 There were no descriptions of any that had fallen over.

269
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,680
 And then a couple hundred years later, they're all knocked over.

270
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,840
 And it would have taken a huge amount of effort to knock them over.

271
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,800
 The people clearly decided we don't want these anymore.

272
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
 Yeah.

273
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,180
 I think they felt, well, this is one of the many theories, let's get some of it.

274
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,120
 But this is the theory I think on the side of the kind of more mythological side is that

275
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,400
 they were idols to the gods.

276
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,280
 And because the island had been so ravaged in terms of the deforestation that they'd

277
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,360
 done and so on, because that's the main thing, isn't it?

278
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,580
 There's hardly any trees that are left anymore.

279
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,460
 And so they couldn't make canoes to go and fish.

280
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,720
 And so they ran out of food.

281
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
 And so it was anger.

282
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,720
 And they knocked down the statues to say, "Fuck you, God."

283
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
 Wow.

284
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
 That's quite angry.

285
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,960
 Because I can imagine being angry and having a pen in your hand and throwing it to the

286
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
 ground and stuff.

287
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,160
 But actually to be so angry that you knock over a massive statue and then another and

288
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,960
 then another and then hundreds and hundreds of them.

289
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
 Wait, were they lined up like dominoes?

290
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
 Yeah, yeah.

291
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
 Possible.

292
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
 You only need to get one over originally.

293
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
 That would be amazing.

294
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
 Maybe that's...

295
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
 It was a mistake.

296
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
 It was a mistake.

297
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
 It was a mistake.

298
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
 It's already over.

299
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:51,020
 Some dude was just leading over and shouting out, "Girl, Mr. Bean went to Easter Island."

300
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:57,940
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

301
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,260
 And that is my fact.

302
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:07,780
 My fact this week is that last year, Dublin Airport received 13,569 noise complaints.

303
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:15,040
 12,272 of those were made by one person, one single person.

304
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,640
 5,000 in a year.

305
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,840
 Yeah, it was averaging basically 34 a day roughly.

306
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,880
 That's basically presumably every time a plane takes off.

307
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,360
 I think so, yeah.

308
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,420
 We don't know who this person is, by the way.

309
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,520
 They've kept them anonymous.

310
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
 I don't know why.

311
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
 Okay.

312
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,280
 But it's something that they've done before many times.

313
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,580
 They've doubled their amount of complaints that they previously had done.

314
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,980
 So this isn't like they just popped out of nowhere.

315
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,420
 They've been complaining for years.

316
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,940
 Weirdly, obviously due to the pandemic, flights have been down, but the complaints have been

317
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,940
 going up.

318
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,940
 Yeah.

319
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,580
 They did kind of pop out of nowhere because they came along, I think in 2018.

320
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:03,660
 In 2018, there were 628 complaints in 2019, 3,147 in the first six months of the year.

321
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,640
 And then not that many since then, but some.

322
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,400
 And then like you say, this last couple of years, they've really picked up again.

323
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,920
 Is it someone who's erected a tent on the runway?

324
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,760
 I was wondering, or someone who's set up an automatic system that every time the noise

325
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,080
 goes over a certain volume, it triggers a complaint.

326
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,880
 Now, what this did happen in Heathrow, in 2015 Heathrow found that some people had automated

327
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,200
 software that could generate complaints and they found out because when the clocks changed,

328
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,260
 they didn't change the clocks on their system.

329
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,180
 So they started complaining about flights that hadn't taken off yet.

330
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,460
 Wait, that's so cheeky, they were what they were, they would, they would find out when

331
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,060
 a plane was taking off and automatically their computer would just send an email.

332
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,700
 That's I think that is, I think that is cheeky because I think it's got to be, you've got

333
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,700
 to have the noise.

334
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
 You've got to have experienced noise.

335
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,500
 I think that's, that's what Heathrow thought as well.

336
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,580
 Do we know if they bothered to make each email different?

337
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,500
 Like did they write a thousand different words?

338
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,760
 Sir, dear madam, hello, further to my previous email.

339
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,640
 I mean, all this one, were they all clones of each other, this person?

340
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
 They haven't said.

341
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
 Yeah.

342
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,080
 I imagine it's pretty much the same email that would come through.

343
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,320
 Well, this person doesn't actually live that close to the airport either.

344
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,320
 They know where they live, they know where they live.

345
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
 I don't even know where they live.

346
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,480
 OnGar, which is about 20 miles away from the airport.

347
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,080
 And the interesting thing about that is Dublin Airport are actually quite good neighbors.

348
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,560
 If you look into it, as far as I'm concerned, they seem to be, and they'll offer to buy

349
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,740
 your house, for instance, if it's too much on a regular basis, especially since they

350
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,460
 got their new runway.

351
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,260
 But this person is outside of that distance, but they can't be helped by any of these systems.

352
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,260
 So that could be why they're complaining.

353
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,260
 Yeah.

354
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,460
 And flight paths can be, you know, devil's it, if you're like, if you're like West London,

355
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,620
 it's so much of it's under the Heathrow path that you get so many planes a day.

356
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,300
 It also does seem that you do get these individuals, like these singular individuals that make it

357
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
 no mission to do it.

358
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,400
 So the heroes, I call them heroes.

359
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,320
 So the same thing happened for Reagan airports in Washington in 2015.

360
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:14,880
 They had 8,670 noise complaints and 6,500 of those were from a single person as well.

361
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
 Yeah.

362
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,760
 It's just some heroes, as Andy say, there's a secret society.

363
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,400
 There's a mason's for complainers somewhere that we didn't know about.

364
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,640
 Do you think that these people have time to go to a secret society?

365
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,840
 To me, I don't think they do.

366
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,540
 Noise complaints are just ridiculous sometimes in terms of when you read the headline, you

367
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
 think, how's that possible?

368
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,660
 My favorite one that I've read recently, a Canadian city made a noise complaint against

369
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,860
 an American city.

370
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,860
 Oh, yeah.

371
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,860
 Yeah.

372
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,860
 Wow.

373
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,660
 So this was Windsor, Ontario, and they were making a complaint against Detroit.

374
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,660
 And it was because...

375
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,660
 What?

376
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,660
 Yeah.

377
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,300
 So the Detroit River is a, there's a one kilometer waterway between Windsor and Detroit.

378
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,180
 And they were having a festival on the riverbank with, they said on Windsor's side, the sound

379
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,640
 system facing directly towards them.

380
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,680
 And so they received all these complaints from about 1.30 to 2.30 in the morning when

381
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,520
 the music was still playing.

382
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,040
 And all the complaints directed on the Windsor side to their council to say, we want you

383
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,280
 to write to Detroit's council and officially log this as a noise complaint.

384
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
 And they did.

385
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
 Yeah.

386
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,840
 They got an official, a city got an official noise complaint from another city.

387
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
 That's great.

388
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
 Yeah.

389
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,600
 And this, imagine if this was the Franz Ferdinand moment for the civil war between Canada and...

390
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,900
 Exactly, that's the music they were playing for.

391
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,180
 I was looking at the history of filing sound complaints.

392
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,380
 I think the earliest I could find, the earliest official sound complaint, which resulted in

393
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,860
 you know, action being taken was in 1302, this was in the UK.

394
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,900
 And it was a petition by a bunch of friars.

395
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,220
 And it's just so fun because it's just exactly the same as we would say today, exactly the

396
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,220
 same kind of complaint.

397
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,980
 So they requested that this courthouse, the courthouse of Cattisall, should not be rebuilt

398
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,120
 to the damage and nuisance of the friars.

399
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,720
 Their complaint was that when it rains, people who are going to the courthouse seek refuge

400
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,880
 for themselves and their horses in the church of the friars while the friars are saying mass,

401
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,000
 which actually does sound quite annoying.

402
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 It does sound annoying.

403
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Yeah.

404
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,520
 And so it's quite hard to shout mass over the noise and the press of the people.

405
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,520
 Especially if they've taken a vow of silence or something.

406
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
 That would be really annoying.

407
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
 Yeah.

408
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
 They can't shout them down.

409
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,400
 Just sitting there swearing at them.

410
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,480
 I read another study by Manchester Met and this is going back to the airports.

411
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,940
 This was complaint data at Manchester Airport from between 1998 and 2000.

412
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,700
 They found what we found, which is that there is a subgroup of serial complainers out of

413
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,100
 all the complaints.

414
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
 So they described a serial...

415
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,900
 Is that like cornflakes, not crunchy enough?

416
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,900
 Exactly.

417
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,900
 Oh, gosh.

418
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,860
 Where can I address my complaint about that joke?

419
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,220
 I think if people are complaining about our jokes, then they would be serial complainers.

420
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,220
 Because a serial complainer is someone who makes more than 50 complaints a year versus

421
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,680
 a normal complainer, who is someone who does less than that.

422
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:04,160
 But they profiled serial complainers and they found, really interestingly, that a serial

423
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,680
 complainer would send all of their emails between 10pm and 1am.

424
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,680
 And then again in the morning from 7am to about 8am.

425
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,080
 So they'd do it just before they went to bed or just before they got up, whereas a normal

426
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,560
 complainer would do it at any time of the night.

427
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,880
 So they might do it at 1am, 2am, 3am, 4am.

428
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,340
 So what that suggests is that the normal complainers are actually being woken up by the planes

429
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,900
 and got off, for God's sake, and sending an email versus serial complainers doing it just

430
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,260
 before they go to bed, maybe after a few drinks, I don't know.

431
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,500
 And then first thing in the morning when they remember, "Oh, that was really annoying last

432
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
 night" kind of thing.

433
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 Wow.

434
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,420
 You sort of understand the late evening one, where people are like, "Oh, they're stewing,

435
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,420
 you know?"

436
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,420
 "I've got to complain about this.

437
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,420
 I'm so like..."

438
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,420
 Early morning I don't get at all.

439
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,380
 I wonder sometimes it's like you want to send an email at night time and you're like,

440
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,040
 "If I send it now, people will think I'm drug sending it, so wait till the morning and I'm

441
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
 going to send it then."

442
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
 It's a schedule send.

443
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
 They're schedule a send.

444
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,440
 Well, let me reread the draft that was four years ago.

445
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,680
 I'll write an angry email in there, but I normally end up not sending an email, or instead

446
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
 sending an apology.

447
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
 What?

448
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
 Sending an apology instead of an angry email.

449
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
 Love all the noise.

450
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
 Thanks, Andy.

451
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
 Keep it up.

452
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
 Turn it up.

453
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
 I can take it.

454
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:22,980
 This fight was about Dublin Airport.

455
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,180
 Most famous Irish airline.

456
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,180
 Erlingus.

457
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,180
 Come on, Andy.

458
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,180
 Ryanair.

459
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,180
 Yeah, Ryanair.

460
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,180
 It's got to be Ryanair.

461
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,180
 I know Erlingus is a very famous one.

462
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,680
 I only named the national carrier.

463
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,480
 I'm afraid I say that against priority.

464
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
 Sorry, Ryanair.

465
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,180
 A really interesting thing is that Ryanair is founded by a guy called Tony Ryan.

466
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,680
 He's really famous.

467
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,980
 He owned a leasing company first.

468
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:51,840
 Even today, Ireland leases about 40% of all the airplanes in this guy at any time.

469
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,000
 Most of the smaller airlines don't own the airplanes that they own.

470
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,200
 They're leased from someone else, and a lot of nights from Ireland.

471
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,680
 This was all goes back to this guy called Tony Ryan.

472
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,720
 He decided he wanted to set up an airline, and it's called Ryanair, but it's not named

473
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
 after him.

474
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,040
 It's not amazing.

475
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:14,420
 He wanted to call it trans-tipperary airlines, but his friend and someone who he set up the

476
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:19,180
 business with called Christie Ryan, decided he wanted to name it after him.

477
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,180
 Christie Ryan said, "I know.

478
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,100
 I want to name it after me and call it Ryanair," and Tony Ryan said, "You can't name it after

479
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,100
 you."

480
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,140
 He said, "Well, I'm going to do it anyway," and in the end, they decided and called it

481
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:33,440
 Ryanair, but Tony Ryan is the really famous guy who everyone thinks is really funny.

482
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,420
 That's so interesting, because online, it always, I thought it wasn't named after Christopher,

483
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,560
 and it was named after Tony, because yeah, it always says it's named after Tony Ryan,

484
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,960
 but secretly, it's the Christopher.

485
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
 That's very funny.

486
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
 That's amazing.

487
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
 My God.

488
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,120
 I was reading a very tiny bit about noise on planes, because obviously, we're talking

489
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,840
 about noise when you're on the ground from an airplane, but it's huge when you're inside,

490
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,200
 and they do a lot to try and fix it, make it better, make it more manageable.

491
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,680
 One of the things that affects is your food on a plane.

492
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,840
 They found in research, when you're eating food, the noise can mess with your taste buds,

493
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,700
 and so, British Airways in 2014 released a little thing called sound bites.

494
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,780
 The idea would be that the food that you ordered on the plane, you could go into the system,

495
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,900
 your little entertainment system, and you could find a track that plays a curated bit

496
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:26,060
 of noise to listen to while you're eating that meal to match the taste and help you

497
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,060
 out with the food.

498
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,060
 That would work.

499
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:33,260
 I've been to the fact doc, Heston Blumenthal's place, and he plays music sometimes to you when

500
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,080
 you eat a certain thing.

501
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,920
 You have to wear headphones and listen to the sound of the sea while you eat some seafood

502
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
 and stuff.

503
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
 Yeah, exactly.

504
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,760
 So it'd be like Verdi would be playing while you're eating on the airplane.

505
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
 It's a pasta.

506
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
 Exactly.

507
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
 It is that.

508
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
 It is that.

509
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,600
 If you're on your way to Easter Island, just the sound of rats screaming, I've got a case

510
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
 study for you.

511
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
 I'll go on.

512
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
 Okay.

513
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
 You live in a seaside flat, right?

514
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 Yes.

515
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
 In Italy.

516
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
 Oh, lovely.

517
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
 Lovely.

518
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,100
 And then you're maybe, you know, it's flat.

519
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,100
 It's not one of those.

520
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
 Which coast?

521
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,340
 Oh, it's in the Bay of Poets, I think it's called.

522
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,340
 Oh, romantic.

523
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,300
 So there are four brothers who own the flat next door.

524
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
 Right.

525
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
 They install a lavatory, okay?

526
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
 In one of their rooms.

527
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,300
 Yeah, it's fine.

528
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,900
 But it's right next to the headboard of your bed, and it's so loud.

529
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
 Yeah.

530
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
 Whose side are you on?

531
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,400
 Look, but I'm the person.

532
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
 Well, you live in the flat, actually.

533
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
 I live in the other flat.

534
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
 Yeah.

535
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,040
 So someone's taking a shit next to your head every day.

536
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
 Pretty much.

537
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
 Or every night.

538
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,700
 I think I might consider moving, flipping my bed around so that my headboard isn't right

539
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,700
 there.

540
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,700
 This is the thing.

541
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,300
 The couple said, "Our home is so small, we can't rearrange the furniture."

542
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,300
 Okay.

543
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,740
 So this, get this, this happened in 2003.

544
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,940
 The couple who own the flat, which I put you all in, said, "The noise is intolerable."

545
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,540
 They took it to a judge, got thrown out.

546
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,220
 They went to an appeal court.

547
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,700
 The appeal court judge said, "Actually, that is bad for your quality of life."

548
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
 Okay.

549
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,220
 The brothers fought back and took it to the Supreme Court.

550
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,320
 This year, in 2022, 19 years after the original complaint.

551
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
 Oh my God.

552
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,400
 And they've been holding a shit in all that time.

553
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,200
 It's been settled.

554
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 On whose side?

555
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,840
 In favor of the couple who own the flat.

556
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,160
 The brothers have had to pay 10,000 euros almost.

557
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
 So what do they do now?

558
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
 The brothers?

559
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
 Outdoor WC?

560
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
 I don't think they could sound.

561
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
 I don't know if they could sound.

562
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,760
 Maybe they have to use their Lou, move the Lou.

563
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
 I don't know.

564
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
 Anyway.

565
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,160
 Put lots of Lou Roll down before you do a number two.

566
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,920
 I think it was the flush, wasn't it?

567
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
 The flush.

568
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,920
 The problem.

569
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,220
 But the journal newspaper said, "In far less time than this case took, Albert Einstein

570
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,900
 wrote the theory of relativity explaining the whole universe."

571
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,900
 It's hard though, isn't it?

572
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,580
 I mean, that, you can see both sides.

573
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,580
 Yeah.

574
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
 I think.

575
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,580
 You're going to have a place to...

576
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,580
 You're going to have a tie.

577
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,580
 You're going to have a Lou.

578
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,580
 Yeah, yeah.

579
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,580
 But also, you're going to be able to sleep somewhere.

580
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,580
 And these are small places.

581
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,580
 Yeah.

582
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,580
 Is it four brothers?

583
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
 Yeah.

584
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,620
 It's a bit of the story that no one's picked up on.

585
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,620
 What?

586
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,620
 Four brothers?

587
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,620
 Living together for 19 years?

588
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,620
 I think that's a bit odd.

589
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,620
 I don't know.

590
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,620
 I don't know.

591
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
 It's quite a good life.

592
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,620
 Yeah.

593
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,620
 Yeah.

594
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,620
 You're right.

595
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,620
 Get a life.

596
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,620
 Move out.

597
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,620
 Why hasn't one of them got married?

598
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,620
 Yeah.

599
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,620
 What is happening with that family?

600
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,620
 I think they're doing it deliberately.

601
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,620
 Is that what you're saying?

602
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,800
 They've clubbed together and deliberately said that they'll devote their lives to torturing

603
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 this couple.

604
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
 I don't know.

605
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,700
 I just think when it comes to courts, when it's four brothers living together for 19

606
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
 years, I would think something weird's going on there.

607
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,700
 Yeah.

608
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,700
 I'm going to leave you guys alone.

609
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,700
 Okay.

610
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
 I'm with you.

611
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,860
 Well, no further questions, your honor.

612
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,860
 The prosecution rests.

613
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,860
 Four brothers?

614
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
 Do me a favor.

615
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
 Okay.

616
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:43,580
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James.

617
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
 Okay.

618
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,900
 My fact this week is that in her lifetime, Emily Dickinson was better known as a baker

619
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
 than as a poet.

620
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,780
 She thought it was a really good baker or a really bad poet.

621
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,820
 Probably an unknown poet.

622
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,060
 People didn't really know that she did poetry and people did know that she did baking.

623
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,660
 If you don't know who Emily Dickinson is, she is probably one of the most famous American

624
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,740
 poets.

625
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,440
 In her lifetime, didn't really sell or publish anything, just one or two little things.

626
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,060
 People didn't really know about her.

627
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,540
 She didn't want anything to be published, but what she was famous for in her area was making

628
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,660
 loads of cakes, loads of delicious things that she used to give to all the children

629
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,780
 all the time.

630
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:31,180
 There's a new book that's come out called the Emily Dickinson Cook book by Eileen Osborne.

631
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,180
 In that, she says she was better known as a baker than a poet.

632
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:39,340
 Although there is another book that I've seen which is about Emily Dickinson's gardening,

633
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,820
 and in that book, it says she was better known as a gardener than a poet.

634
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,540
 It kind of feels like whatever you write in the book about, you can say that.

635
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,900
 She basically wasn't known as a poet.

636
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,940
 But what's amazing though is like she's known for the gardening, she's known for the bakery,

637
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,700
 but actually she was kind of a recluse for most of her life, wasn't she?

638
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,540
 I think kind of is a weak way of referring to what was extreme recluseville.

639
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,140
 So how do we know about her gardening and her bakeries?

640
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,140
 Hang on guys.

641
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,140
 Hang on.

642
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,380
 She had some pretty public experiences in the baking sphere, and I'd refer you to the

643
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:15,980
 1856 Amherst Cattle Show, where her round loaf of Indian and rye bread won second prize.

644
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,060
 So before we say she was a recluse, just think about that.

645
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,500
 She was living in the public sphere, in the blaze of publicity.

646
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,180
 To be fair, her sister, Vinnie, was one of the judges for that competition.

647
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,180
 So slightly, yeah.

648
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,140
 Makes me think she actually wasn't a very good baker, because if your sister's in the

649
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,660
 competition, you still can't buy first prize.

650
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,540
 Come on mate.

651
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,660
 She used to make gingerbread, really good gingerbread, and she used to lower it down for neighborhood

652
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,660
 children.

653
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,940
 So she loved children, Emily Dickinson, and the people in the area in the neighborhood

654
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,180
 kind of knew about her.

655
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:54,060
 She was a recluse, as you say, later on in life, post this great competition triumph thing.

656
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,980
 But the children knew about her, and they'd run to her window, and then she erected a

657
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,860
 kind of basket, which she lowered down on a string.

658
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,260
 And one of the people, one of the boys, remembered her later on doing it, and she'd do it and

659
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,820
 make it like a game, so she'd do it very, very gradually, and gingerly, gingerly.

660
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,820
 Brilliant.

661
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,380
 So as not to let the domestic servant know, because otherwise domestic servant Maggie would

662
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,540
 be very angry, and then the kids would have to creep through the grass and then grab the

663
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
 gingerbread and leave.

664
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,300
 It's not like Maggie's getting ideas about the station, if she's stopping the lady of

665
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,940
 the house from giving out free gingerbread.

666
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,460
 Well, you know, that's good to know what side you're on, and that's it.

667
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,380
 I'm just giving the local children gingerbread.

668
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,620
 I just think lady of the house is a little bit...

669
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,660
 She was the lady of the house.

670
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,740
 Maggie hasn't made gingerbread for the children, she's made it for, you know...

671
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,060
 Was she giving away gingerbread that Maggie had made?

672
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
 Yes.

673
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,140
 So why is Emily Dickinson getting the credit for all this baking?

674
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,780
 When she's giving away someone else's gingerbread.

675
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,780
 Sorry, you're right.

676
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,740
 This boy said, "I don't know if Emily Dickinson had made the gingerbread, or if Maggie had

677
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,620
 made the gingerbread, but she seemed to be afraid of Maggie telling her not to."

678
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,620
 So you're right.

679
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,380
 I think Maggie is getting ideas about the station.

680
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,380
 Stopping Emily from giving out her gingerbread.

681
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,780
 Actually, if Maggie had made it, I've now come back round to her point of view, and I

682
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,980
 think she's getting ideas at her station.

683
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,900
 Like, she's correct to be irritated about this.

684
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:12,620
 It was actually quite a good spot for literary figures, this amorous place, because you had

685
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,860
 not only Emily Dickinson, who obviously found out that she was amazing after her death,

686
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,260
 but you had people like Melville Dewey was there.

687
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,860
 Was he from the Dewey Decimal System?

688
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,860
 Yeah, he was.

689
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,860
 Yeah.

690
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,860
 Where did he live?

691
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,260
 From number one to number 121.04.

692
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,700
 So he came up with the system while he was an assistant librarian at the Amherst College

693
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,060
 in 1876, looked into him a bit, "Terrible human."

694
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,300
 Yeah, I think he's been shallower than that.

695
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,300
 "Terrible human."

696
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,820
 We're not supposed to use the system anymore at anything, can we?

697
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,820
 Wow, really.

698
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
 I believe he's been cancelled.

699
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,700
 He's been cancelled, but we've cancelled the system now.

700
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,700
 We've cancelled the whole system.

701
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,460
 It's a hell of a system to cancel.

702
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,620
 Robert Frost, the poet, was from there as well.

703
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,820
 Noah Webster was from there as well, of Webster's Dictionary.

704
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,820
 Really?

705
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,940
 Yeah, he lived there, and he started writing it there, so not all these people were born

706
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,940
 there, but they did huge chunks.

707
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,020
 He lived in Amherst, and then he went to Baltimore, and then he went to Chicago, and then he went

708
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,020
 up.

709
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,020
 Yeah.

710
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,020
 I wanted to see how long you'd get.

711
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
 Alpha Betcher.

712
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,020
 He was doing it.

713
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,020
 Whoa.

714
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,020
 What was your next one, Denver?

715
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,020
 Yeah.

716
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,020
 Nice.

717
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,020
 I didn't have one after that.

718
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,500
 An American place beginning with E, East Virginia.

719
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
 Yeah?

720
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
 That's not a place?

721
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
 No.

722
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
 There's Virginia, and there's West Virginia.

723
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
 Oh, my God.

724
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:26,420
 I meant the East of Virginia, obviously.

725
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,460
 She was such an interesting character, so I mean, first of all, she was really funny

726
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,460
 and fun.

727
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,980
 I think that people, because they know of Emmy Dickinson as this person who only ever

728
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,580
 wore white, which she did, and she never left the house.

729
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,060
 She was picturing a few other things.

730
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,860
 In fact, I think in the only picture we've got of her, she's not wearing white.

731
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,780
 Again, sorry, when I say only ever, we're expected in black and white, so she's wearing

732
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,780
 black, presumably.

733
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,780
 Just gray.

734
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,780
 Yeah.

735
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,260
 This is after she became a recluse.

736
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,780
 About the last 20 years of her life, wasn't she?

737
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
 Yeah.

738
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
 She became a recluse.

739
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,780
 But she was very funny.

740
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:01,060
 If you read her poems, they are kind of witty or dry or piss-take-y.

741
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,260
 I always thought one of the best opening lines to a poem was one of her most famous poems,

742
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,980
 which opens, "Because I could not stop for death, he kindly stopped for me."

743
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:15,660
 Which I just love as a bit of, I don't know, it's humorous, it's dark, and it's an excellent

744
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
 poem.

745
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,060
 But I think she did think about publishing a lot.

746
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,060
 She knew she was great.

747
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,400
 It wasn't like she had no idea she was great.

748
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,300
 She wrote to all these famous writers and publishers who said, "Please let me publish

749
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
 your poems."

750
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,780
 And she would say, "Oh no, it'd be dreadful being published.

751
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,820
 I'm not nearly egotistical enough for that.

752
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,460
 How dreary to be somebody, how public, like a frog, to tell your name the live long June

753
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,140
 to an admiring bog."

754
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,380
 So she had it in her mind.

755
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,500
 She was quite like Lady Doth Protest too much about it, I think.

756
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
 Wow.

757
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,540
 Just a quick reminder, Andy's new novel will be out.

758
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
 I know.

759
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,180
 By the time you listen to it, I'm regretting it.

760
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,220
 For you, the admiring bog of the listeners.

761
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:02,580
 She wrote to a guy called Thomas Wentworth Higginson asking if she could possibly, or

762
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,740
 if her poems were good enough to be published, I should say.

763
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,860
 And he actually thought that her poems were too eccentric to be published at the time.

764
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,820
 But he told her to avoid sloppy dashes, which if you've read any Emily Dickinson, it's

765
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
 just dashes.

766
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,820
 It's almost all dashes.

767
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,820
 It's just dashes.

768
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,940
 It's like half of Morse code, her poetry.

769
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,940
 Right.

770
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,380
 I would say go back and ignore the dashes, because I remember when I was younger that

771
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,300
 really put me off, because it seems so jerky.

772
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,740
 But then if you ignore them and pretend they're normal punctuation.

773
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:35,140
 Just quickly on the Higginson man who reviewed, sort of looked over her poetry.

774
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,420
 So he said her writing was, I'm quoting it, "so peculiar it seems as if the writer might

775
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,020
 have taken her first lessons by studying the famous fossil bird tracks in the museum."

776
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,940
 Okay, this is interesting.

777
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:51,140
 Amherst, again, like great literary womb, all of this, had these bird tracks in stone,

778
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,900
 which were the first dinosaur tracks ever found.

779
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:59,300
 And they were found by a 12-year-old ploughboy called Pliny, weird, so he was called Pliny

780
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,780
 Moody, amazing name.

781
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,100
 And this was 40 years before the word dinosaur was coined, really.

782
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,660
 But they were known, they were nicknamed these tracks as the marks of Noah's raven.

783
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
 That was what they were called.

784
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,700
 This lovely sort of evocative phrase for dinosaur footsteps, Noah's raven.

785
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,820
 And Emily Dickinson wrote, "The thing with feathers, and dinosaurs have feathers."

786
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,820
 Oh my God.

787
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,820
 Is that where we're going?

788
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,340
 The thing is, it's all connected.

789
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,340
 Oh my God.

790
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,180
 Is that your favorite one of her poems?

791
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,940
 I don't really have one.

792
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,300
 I didn't know very much about her at all before this.

793
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,660
 I think there's one that you would like if you ever heard it.

794
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,780
 All overgrown by cunning moss.

795
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,780
 There we go.

796
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,780
 Amen.

797
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,780
 Amen.

798
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,780
 She's a genius.

799
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,700
 What was her hit rate in terms of, we now know that she wrote about 1800, that's what

800
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,260
 she left behind, poems.

801
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,500
 How many of those have been published?

802
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
 All of them.

803
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
 Yeah.

804
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,180
 But there's an incredibly weird story.

805
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,740
 The ones that you're talking about have all been published, and we can see all of them.

806
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,380
 And I would say everyone I've read, I've enjoyed.

807
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,380
 Yeah.

808
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,380
 But...

809
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,380
 So, okay.

810
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,380
 Her sister found them all after she died, Lavinia, Vinnie.

811
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,300
 And she destroyed a lot of paperwork, but correspondents and stuff like that.

812
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,380
 So there was this mad argument between two sides of the family.

813
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,980
 It's all a bit complicated because her brother was called Austin Dickinson, and her brother

814
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,140
 had a mistress called Mabel Loomis Todd, right?

815
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,980
 So some of the poems went there.

816
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,180
 Some of the poems went to the family of her brother, and basically the two halves of Dickinson's

817
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,380
 literary estate were in different hands.

818
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:28,100
 Neither family owned all the manuscripts, and neither could produce eight complete Dickinson.

819
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,540
 One side sold them to Harvard for about half a million dollars in modern money.

820
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:36,060
 So then Harvard have claimed ownership of Dickinson in general, and for a while people

821
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,620
 have asked permission to Harvard to quote lines of Dickinson.

822
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,980
 So basically it's Vex.

823
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,020
 It feels like Amherst could be a good setting for a soap opera.

824
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,020
 Yeah.

825
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,020
 So you act on Emily Dickinson's dining room table for the first time.

826
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,020
 Sorry.

827
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,020
 Who?

828
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,020
 Who's that?

829
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,020
 Sorry.

830
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,020
 Yeah.

831
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,020
 That should have been clear.

832
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,020
 Austin and Mabel, who he was having their fair with.

833
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,020
 Okay.

834
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,020
 With an Emily and Lavinia new, it seemed like a bit of an opus.

835
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
 This is just gossip.

836
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,020
 I know.

837
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,020
 Let's put it down on the dining table.

838
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
 Ooh.

839
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,020
 Hey, we've got it in writing first hand.

840
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
 So it's Austin and Mabel.

841
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,020
 Yes.

842
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,020
 Okay.

843
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,500
 And it's so weird because Emily never met Mabel, but you know, they were having an affair

844
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,340
 of 13 years, and Mabel would come round to Emily's house, which was next door, and they'd

845
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,380
 have sex on the dining room table.

846
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,100
 And Mabel actually played piano for Emily once, and Emily listened from behind a corner

847
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,100
 in the house.

848
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
 What?

849
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,060
 And sort of delivered her a glass of sherry at the end to say, well done, lovely playing.

850
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:31,180
 Just very quickly on the recluse and all wearing white and all that kind of stuff, Martha

851
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,540
 Nell Smith, who's like one of the main scholars of Dickinson, she works at the University of

852
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,540
 Maryland.

853
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:41,740
 And she says that actually a lot of the image that we know now of Dickinson is kind of Victorian

854
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,780
 propaganda, and that I'll kind of say paraphrase what she says.

855
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,100
 She says, you know how right now, if you have a rock star, you kind of have this idea of

856
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,180
 sex, drugs, rock and roll, wearing black, all that kind of stuff.

857
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,900
 Well, in the late 19th century, the idea of a woman poet would be someone who had a secret

858
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,700
 sorrow, someone who was reclusive, someone who dressed in white, and she reckons that

859
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,340
 a lot of the stories that we hear now are quite exaggerated.

860
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,060
 I mean, obviously she did stay in the house a lot, but a lot of them are exaggerated because

861
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,820
 that was our idea of a poet at the time.

862
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,820
 That is really interesting.

863
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,820
 And the sex, drugs and rock and roll.

864
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,260
 I mean, to be fair, people used to accuse her, not accuse her, but say it was all about

865
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,740
 her lost love, or she was spurned in love.

866
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,460
 And immediately after she died, like the 1890s, people are saying, well, she must have been

867
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,860
 cheated on by some bloke.

868
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,980
 And actually, I think she might have shagged someone in her house.

869
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,860
 So we say she must have been cheated.

870
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,860
 Oh, there we go.

871
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,860
 Over which table, Anna?

872
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,780
 We think that, I can't remember why he was cool, but someone came to Vizu as a great

873
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
 admirer.

874
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,820
 They had a little dalliance, maybe.

875
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,820
 Wow.

876
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,900
 She was actually, she was quite sociable for a recluse.

877
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,020
 She was like, you know how permits we always, we've done, we've talked about hermets before

878
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,300
 and they'd have people visit them constantly every day.

879
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,300
 And she did sort of...

880
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,300
 She think it was Webster.

881
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,900
 And he was like, nice arse, nice boobs.

882
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
 Nice.

883
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,900
 Anyway.

884
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:07,540
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

885
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,860
 My fact is that as well as a caterpillar which avoids predators by pretending to be a bird,

886
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,420
 there is a bird which avoids predators by pretending to be a caterpillar.

887
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,660
 He could pretend to be a caterpillar who's pretending to be a bird, and then you don't

888
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,060
 have to do any disguise.

889
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,060
 You just...

890
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,060
 Yeah, exactly.

891
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,060
 You just say, I'm a caterpillar.

892
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
 Is it?

893
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:30,100
 Because that does sound like it's come up with this and it's walked into the room full of

894
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,820
 birds and thought, I've fucked up.

895
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,860
 How's that helping?

896
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,100
 These are two separate species.

897
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,500
 One of them actually we have mentioned before, I should fess up, it's called the North American

898
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,100
 Walnut Sphinx Caterpillar.

899
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:47,420
 It's not a sphinx, but it screams like a bird, which is the way it avoids predators.

900
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,540
 Weird Nelly Furtado version of that song, doesn't it?

901
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,180
 Yeah, it makes the alarm call that a bird would make if it had seen a bird of prey.

902
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,300
 And so the other birds that would be eating the caterpillar think, oh God, there's a bird

903
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,300
 of prey in there.

904
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,300
 Oh, yeah.

905
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,500
 And just one extra detail on it, the report on orderbond.org, great bird website, says

906
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,500
 that the insect can be, I'm quoting here, as loud as a freight train from 50 feet away.

907
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
 Slightly have my doubts about it.

908
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,900
 It depends how close you move the caterpillar to your ear.

909
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,660
 So you know, if you put the caterpillar right, right down, like shove it into your ear right

910
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,060
 next to your eardrum, it'll be the same as a train all that distance.

911
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,060
 I see what you're saying.

912
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,300
 I thought what they were saying here was that if you have a freight train 50 feet away and

913
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:32,020
 you have the caterpillar 50 feet away, it feels like that's a pointless use of the phrase

914
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,500
 50 feet.

915
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,500
 Yeah.

916
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
 Okay.

917
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,780
 So anyway, the bird just quickly is called the Cenarius Mourna bird.

918
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,800
 And it lives in the Amazon.

919
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,060
 So it's probably not going to come across this caterpillar anytime soon.

920
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:48,580
 And the chicks imitate poisonous caterpillars, specifically the chicks, they have these spiky

921
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,620
 orange feathers and it moves when its parents are away, it moves in this weird, slinky way

922
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,340
 and it looks genuinely exactly like a poisonous caterpillar local to the region.

923
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,340
 It's insane.

924
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,340
 It's nuts.

925
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,340
 Yeah.

926
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,340
 It's absolutely insane.

927
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,340
 And it does this right at the beginning.

928
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,980
 It's like the first 20 days that it mimics this caterpillar and it's, yeah, when you

929
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,220
 see pictures of it, it just looks exactly like this caterpillar.

930
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,660
 And when even the mother comes back to feed them, so it's because the mother has to go

931
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,820
 away, do all the foraging that they're open to predators, it's only when the mother comes

932
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,260
 back and makes the actual like bird call, like that they go, oh, okay, now we can give

933
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,780
 it up because if she comes back and doesn't do that, they still pretend to be the caterpillars.

934
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,220
 It's absolutely incredible.

935
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,500
 I would bring, if I was a predator, I would bring back one of those caterpillars and I

936
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,300
 would make the caterpillar do a bird call and then trick the chicks into thinking it was

937
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,300
 their parents.

938
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,300
 Yes, exactly.

939
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,260
 But they sort of like, it's not even just the look, they're the same size as the caterpillars

940
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,260
 as well.

941
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,260
 They're 12 centimetres long.

942
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,260
 I mean, it's, yeah.

943
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,340
 That feels important when it comes to camouflage, you know, if they make themselves look like

944
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,440
 an elephant, but they're 12 centimetres long, no one's going to get tricked by that.

945
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:02,420
 The caterpillar, it looks like, is from the family Megalopigidae and you might have seen

946
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:08,460
 that this caterpillar or a related caterpillar on the internet because he's got very bushy,

947
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:14,460
 sort of blondish hair, they're actually pointy kind of venomous bristles that they have,

948
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,740
 but they have been known as the Trumperpillar because it looks like Donald Trump's hair

949
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,740
 has fallen over.

950
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,740
 Oh, that one.

951
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,740
 Yeah, yeah.

952
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,740
 That's so cool.

953
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,740
 I didn't realise they were in that family.

954
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,740
 They're related, yeah.

955
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,440
 They disguise themselves as Donald Trump to escape, you know, execution.

956
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:36,160
 They do look like the ones that they disguise themselves look a bit like that Donald Trump

957
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,160
 hair one, right?

958
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,160
 Yeah.

959
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
 They're quite kind of bushy and blonde.

960
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,960
 Yeah, it's just the colour difference, like these ones are orange, but they both look

961
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
 a bit quiffy.

962
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,960
 Yeah.

963
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,960
 Yeah.

964
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,800
 This is a thing called Batesian mimicry, isn't it?

965
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,500
 The bird is definitely doing this because it's where a harmless species looks like a

966
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,800
 noxious species, so predators avoid them.

967
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,660
 I think that and a type of owl are the only two that do the Batesian mimicry.

968
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,020
 There's an owl that burrows underneath the ground and when it feels like a predator is

969
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,060
 coming in, it hisses like a rattlesnake.

970
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,180
 It's got like a tsssss kind of rags.

971
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
 Okay.

972
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,760
 There's a caterpillar called the Biston Robustum caterpillar and it can make itself look like

973
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
 a twig.

974
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
 Okay.

975
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
 That's good.

976
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,760
 Standard camouflage.

977
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
 Yeah.

978
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,260
 But it can also make itself smell exactly like a twig.

979
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,260
 Isn't that cool?

980
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
 That is so good.

981
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:23,320
 Because only when like a bird going past will see a twig and not go and eat it.

982
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,660
 If there's an ant that goes past it, it'll walk along the twig and then it'll just walk

983
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,300
 along the caterpillar and think that it's on a twig and the reason that we know that

984
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:37,440
 works is if you put the caterpillar on another twig that smells different, the ants will

985
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
 notice it.

986
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,900
 So it'll only hide it on this very specific thing and they hunt by pheromones or they

987
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,260
 detect things through pheromones and through smell.

988
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,700
 So does it have to smell like the twig of a particular plant?

989
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,700
 The one that it's on.

990
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,700
 Yeah.

991
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,240
 So it needs that plant identification app, presumably, to work out which tree to get

992
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,240
 on to.

993
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
 I just got that app.

994
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
 Yeah.

995
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,240
 It's changed my life.

996
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,240
 Really?

997
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,280
 Because I find it's not very reliable in my garden, I must say.

998
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,780
 I've uprooted everything.

999
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:10,360
 You've bought yourself a horse chest nut scent and you lie on the branches.

1000
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
 That is so cool.

1001
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,360
 Yeah.

1002
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,360
 That is amazing.

1003
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
 Incredible.

1004
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,300
 And I've been eating bits of that plant so that's...

1005
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,300
 Ah, okay.

1006
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,300
 Right.

1007
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,680
 Have you guys seen the Great Potu?

1008
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
 No.

1009
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,680
 Such a good bird.

1010
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,740
 It's basically big animals that are camouflaged, that kind of cool it to us in a way, right?

1011
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,740
 Yeah.

1012
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:31,060
 And the Great Potu is a 60cm tall bird that disguises itself as a tree branch.

1013
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,980
 And it's such a great life because it just stands on a tree.

1014
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,620
 It has exactly the right colourings to look like sort of broken up bark.

1015
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,940
 And it has to stand at a bit of an angle because, you know, a branch will branch off

1016
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,240
 the main trunk at an angle.

1017
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,580
 So it leans forward a little bit, points its beak right upwards so that it just goes up

1018
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,580
 in a straight line.

1019
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,700
 The only problem is it has these giant eyes which glow.

1020
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,700
 Oh yeah.

1021
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,700
 So it's really great.

1022
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,700
 So what does it...

1023
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,700
 What do people think that is?

1024
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,700
 So...

1025
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,700
 It just closes its eyes.

1026
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,700
 It has to close its eyes the whole time.

1027
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,820
 But then that's not very useful for catching prey.

1028
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,660
 But it can't tell also if someone's approaching it.

1029
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,660
 Exactly.

1030
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,820
 Because if someone's approaching it or if someone's nearby and it closes its eyes.

1031
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,820
 Yeah.

1032
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,820
 Well, that's the problem.

1033
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,760
 It can't tell if the coast is clear because it's on your way to...

1034
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,540
 So when it closes its eyes, its eyes open.

1035
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,700
 If God closes one eye, it opens another.

1036
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:23,060
 It's got a tiny slit on its eyelid and it's actually able to move this slit around depending

1037
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,260
 on where it wants to look so it can just peer through.

1038
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,260
 That's cool.

1039
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,260
 60 centimetres.

1040
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,260
 Yeah.

1041
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,260
 I was described as two rulers.

1042
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,760
 How are you going to make yourself transparent?

1043
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,660
 Well, I wouldn't rule that.

1044
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,100
 But if you're camouflaging, you want to be a transparent ruler, don't you?

1045
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,100
 Yeah.

1046
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,100
 Yeah.

1047
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,940
 I would just like grow the word shatterproof on my chest.

1048
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,980
 Shout "boing" over time.

1049
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:58,260
 And then just eat unsuspecting schoolteachers.

1050
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,260
 Humans camouflage.

1051
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,260
 Don't we?

1052
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,260
 Yeah.

1053
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,260
 From time to time.

1054
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,260
 In war?

1055
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,260
 In war.

1056
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,260
 In World War II, in fact, there was at least one American soldier who had put lace doilies

1057
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,340
 on his helmet to camouflage himself whenever it was snowing.

1058
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,340
 There's a piece of furniture.

1059
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,340
 No, because it's white.

1060
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,340
 It's already a teapot.

1061
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,340
 That's what you put a doily on, isn't it?

1062
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:21,180
 You put it all over the back of an armchair, I think, in a little doily.

1063
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,180
 Yeah.

1064
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,180
 He's not mimicking anything.

1065
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,180
 He's just trying to hide himself.

1066
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,180
 There's a German disguised as a teapot sitting inside of the Brits.

1067
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,180
 Barret.

1068
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,180
 Closer.

1069
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,180
 Closer.

1070
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:41,060
 Sarge, that chair's moving.

1071
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,060
 That'd be ridiculous.

1072
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,060
 That's incredible.

1073
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,860
 Yeah, I saw that picture on Reddit and I thought it couldn't possibly be true, but I found

1074
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,380
 it in the Philadelphia Inquirer from 1945, so it definitely didn't happen.

1075
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,060
 So it's just to blend them with the snow, basically?

1076
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,060
 Yeah, yeah.

1077
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,060
 Definitely did happen.

1078
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,540
 We don't know that definitely did work, do we?

1079
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,460
 No, we don't.

1080
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,660
 This picture was in 1945, so we certainly got towards the end of the war.

1081
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,660
 Okay.

1082
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,660
 That's good.

1083
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,660
 That's amazing.

1084
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:11,180
 I was reading about a trend in parent stuff, parent clobber, a trend of, you know, baby

1085
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,780
 carriers, slings that you put the baby in.

1086
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,940
 Like a poos kind of thing.

1087
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,940
 Like a poos.

1088
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,940
 Yeah, yeah.

1089
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:21,900
 But there's a growing trend for ones aimed at men to have them in camo coloration so that

1090
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,140
 men feel less uncomfortable carrying the baby around.

1091
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,140
 Oh, really?

1092
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,140
 Yeah.

1093
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,580
 So you feel like you're in jungle warfare, but actually you're just taking your baby

1094
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,580
 to the shop.

1095
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,460
 So no one's going, "What baby?"

1096
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,300
 It's for men who still want to play the field a bit, maybe chat some people up, disguise

1097
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,300
 the baby.

1098
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,300
 Yeah.

1099
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,700
 Yeah, they're in bars, camo, chatting up women.

1100
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,460
 Yeah, pretty single and free and easy to live in.

1101
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,460
 What's that?

1102
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,580
 Oh, it's my, my pager.

1103
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,580
 Pager.

1104
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:58,940
 And he's chatting up quite a long time ago, last time you were chatting anyone up.

1105
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,940
 I think we've established he's been in pretty old school.

1106
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,940
 He's a doctor.

1107
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,940
 That's it.

1108
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,940
 He's a doctor.

1109
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,940
 He's still using pagers.

1110
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,940
 Yeah.

1111
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:07,940
 Yeah.

1112
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,940
 It's quite Piers Morgany, isn't it?

1113
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,740
 Was he not, was he the one who kind of said, "Oh, I can't believe this celebrity man is carrying

1114
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,740
 a baby?"

1115
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,740
 It was Daniel Craig, I think.

1116
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:16,740
 Yeah.

1117
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,100
 Literally James Bond himself carrying a baby and Piers Morgan was going, "He's actually

1118
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,220
 doing it in every Bond movie.

1119
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,220
 You just can't see it."

1120
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,220
 Very irresponsible.

1121
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:28,540
 Do you remember a few years back when Trump set up the space force?

1122
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,540
 Oh, yeah.

1123
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,540
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1124
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,180
 That was, they did the official uniform of the, of the space force.

1125
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,180
 It wasn't his idea, was it?

1126
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,900
 There was a caterpillar on his head who was whispering the idea to him.

1127
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,900
 That would explain.

1128
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,900
 Oh, for what?

1129
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,540
 Well, yeah, when they released it, they got mocked a lot for it because it was camouflage

1130
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,540
 gear.

1131
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,540
 Oh, well, like jungle camouflage.

1132
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,540
 Yeah.

1133
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,540
 With space forces.

1134
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:54,540
 Whereas what you should wear in space, I guess, is one of those kind of kid's pajama

1135
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:59,580
 sets that has a black sky and all the constellations on it.

1136
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,580
 Who attacked you?

1137
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,580
 Well, I don't know.

1138
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:10,900
 It looked like a riot, crazy.

1139
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
 Okay, that's it.

1140
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:12,900
 That's all of our facts.

1141
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,900
