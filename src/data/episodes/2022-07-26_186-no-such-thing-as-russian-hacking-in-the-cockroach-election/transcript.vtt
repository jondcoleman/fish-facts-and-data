00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.840
 Oh hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Things A Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.060
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden. My name's Anna, I'm here today with Andy,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.100
 James and fellow QIL Alice Campbell Davies, and once again, we've gathered around the mics

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.740
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:44.300
 we go, starting with you, Alice. So my fact is humans should be able to sense magnetic

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.500
 fields, should be, should be. So there's been a little bit of research into this, not that

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.460
 much actually, but we have Cryptochrome in our retinal cells, which is what's responsible

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.700
 for pigeons, migration and that kind of thing. And we also have Magnetite in our brains,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.500
 which is a magnetic nanoparticle, which helps direct other animals like bacteria.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.380
 So why the disappointing lack, why can't I say where I live from here? Well Andy, can

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.140
 you point south from here? Yes I can actually. But only because you know where the river is.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.940
 I know where the river is. Well they have actually done some studies

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.860
 on this. There's a really controversial study from the 1980s done by a guy called Robin

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.460
 Baker, where he took a bunch of students out on a minibus, drove them on a really security

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.340
 route all around Manchester, and then blindfolded them and told them to point to home. A bunch

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.740
 of them that didn't have Magnetite strapped to their heads could point home and a bunch of

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.900
 them with Magnetite strapped to their heads couldn't, which suggests that magnetic fields

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.660
 were interrupting their ability to point home. But then no one else has managed to replicate

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.140
 this study. No, in fact it's been disproven multiple times. But he has replicated the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.700
 study. So in a sense, maybe all of these people lived in that massive tower on Deensgate

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.260
 in Manchester, which you can see from pretty much the whole setting. I think they were blindfolded

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.100
 on the journey, weren't they? Yeah, I'm not sure if they were blindfolded on the way home.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.940
 That might have... It takes it too far. It's an amazing beginning for a horror story though,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.780
 where you have to put on a blindfold and get on the professor's bus and then it goes away

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.820
 and you don't know where you're going. I thought, I mean, I would have assumed that there

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.820
 was a really exciting surprise awaiting me, like a head and parcel, you know, a big champagne

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.500
 picnic if I was blindfolded and put on a bus. If I was just strapped to a magnet and told

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.500
 the point at something. Would you not think you were being kidnapped maybe? By my professor.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.660
 I don't know, I had perfectly normal professors. What normal professors who take you on head parties?

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:43.220
 So there were two people who tried to replicate this called Max Westby and Karen Partridge,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.380
 and they were at the University of Sheffield, and they were unable to do it, and they quite

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.140
 sniffly said, "Maybe it depends which side of the penine hills you're on. That's an academic

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.060
 slam in a half." It is, but I think maybe people from Yorkshire just aren't as good.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.180
 Um, it's ironic considering that a Partridge, a real Partridge, probably would be able to sense

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.500
 which side of the penines it was on. That's irony for you, right there. There are a lot of different

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.260
 kinds of manner, and sometimes actually weak jokes can just qualify as irony.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.940
 Are you being particularly appropriate because they use iron to sense where they're going?

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:29.700
 No, that's ironic. It's still not ironic. So some humans are magnetic, and they can literally

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:38.420
 pick things up. I can literally pick things up. With my hands. I can't, that's why I always have to

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.180
 ask you to do it for me. You can pour that coffee into my mouth. Do you mean they can just hold

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.020
 their hand hovering over a magnet, and the magnet will fly towards the hand? They are people who've

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.220
 had magnetic implants in their fingertips. Wouldn't that get very problematic, though, you know,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.820
 opening a fridge or something? Yeah. You can just be stuck to the fridge the whole time.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.340
 Absolutely. Well, unfortunately, you buy the fridge, so you're right.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.620
 So these implants are quite weak. You wouldn't actually stick to your fridge, but people are

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.140
 getting them biohackers, and there's a lot of interviews with these people saying they really

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.380
 don't regret it. They think it's fantastic, because you're finally able to pick up tiny metal

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.860
 objects and determine whether metals are ferrous, which is something that we've always wanted to be

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.900
 able to do. And you can feel electric fields if you have one of these little implants. So if you go

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.580
 near a microwave, then your finger starts vibrating. I think I also can tell when I'm near a microwave.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.580
 You have visual clues, don't you? It's true. It's only useful if you're worried about being

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.700
 near a microwave, and you have hidden microwaves in this environment. Or if you don't know if it's a

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.620
 prop microwave, like if your house is also a film set, and so it is a useful implant to get.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.300
 Unfortunately, it has to be done by like a tattoo artist or something, so you can't get an

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.740
 anesthetic to have it done, and it is relatively painful, according to one of the people who's got

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.140
 it done. They put a massive syringe in your finger, and then they fire a magnet into it.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.060
 What? Is it in the finger tip? Yeah. Or is it? They could put it anywhere in your body, I guess.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.300
 No, James. I'm just saying they could. I'm not saying they would.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.220
 If you're suggesting a word of which, my magical penis tells me where the microwave is.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.300
 Like a pointer.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.380
 It would be like dalsing for water, wouldn't it?

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.580
 Dalsing for microwaves. Imagine being near a branch of curries.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.820
 There are people who claim to be magnetic, but who aren't really?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.500
 Yeah. You know, you see pitches off them online, and they've got spoons attached to them.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.460
 Yes, like circus performery type tricks. Well, often it's just people, and they get into like the

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.420
 local tabloids, don't they? Yeah. Because they're magnetic, but they never are. Like a lot of the

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.220
 skeptics kind of go there and try them out, and it turns out a lot of people are leaning back in the

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:54.100
 pictures, and if they lean forwards, the spoons would just fall off. Also, if you got kind of greasy

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:00.260
 skin, then it will stick to the kind of sebum in your skin, so that everyone's kind of sticky in a

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.100
 way. So not only are you a liar, but you're kind of a greasy, sweaty liar.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.740
 Yeah. James Randi, the famous skeptic from Australia, he would douse people in telecompowder,

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.900
 and suddenly they would not be magnetic anymore. But surely you could just disprove it by

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:21.940
 putting a magnet next to them and proving it didn't stick. Yeah, although they would be able to

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.540
 make it stick. How sweaty are these people that random fridge magnets?

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.460
 So I've got a little pen here, and I can kind of stick it on my head if I kind of lean back a

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.820
 little bit. Yeah, we do need to get aircon in this room, don't you say?

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:40.260
 I'm remembering that humans have magnets in their nose that maybe we once used to navigate,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.420
 so they found magnetite in our esnoid bone in our nose. Not sure. And so there's lots of speculation

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.300
 about the fact that we might have been able to use this at some point to navigate, isn't there?

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.540
 Yeah, I think the theory about there being magnetic stuff in the nose was disproven by a guy

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.940
 called Joe Kirschwink, or something I can't pronounce his surname, a Caltech, who is the biggest

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:08.420
 critic of Baker's work, and he has just I had an experience last year where he set up a big Faraday

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.940
 cage and a Caltech basement to block out other magnetic waves of sorts and put people in it,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.540
 and then subjected them to magnetic fields from different directions. And he has actually shown

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.740
 that when you have magnetic waves coming from one direction, there is a massive change in your

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.020
 EEG spec, so your brain waves, so it does show that there is something in your brain that is responding

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.740
 to the direction of magnetic fields you're exposed to, which is really interesting. Does it have any

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.660
 effect on not your thoughts, but is it? It's not mind control, Andy. It's not mind control,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.620
 but I'm just trying to work out how that could have been useful. I think in the past, when we were

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.700
 maybe migrating over larger distances, it was something we could have relied on, but now we don't

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.460
 really need it. So maybe in the past we could sense magnetism. Perhaps, yeah. We'll also the

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.460
 cryptochromes we have in our eyes, because they're in our eyes, which is the same as with birds and

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:03.540
 other animals, suggests that at one point we did use it to see magnetic fields. Okay, and basically

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:09.060
 what we're saying is loads of animals can see magnetic fields and can sense magnetic fields,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.820
 but we just can't, right? Yeah, maybe. Do you know which animal has some magnetite in its tongue?

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:22.100
 It's a little mollus, isn't it? It is, it's a mollusk. Mollusks have magnetite-capped teeth,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:27.860
 but when I say teeth, their tongue is made of teeth. Radula. Radula, exactly. Yeah, yeah. So they can do that,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.340
 and this is very cool. There are some bacteria which contain magnetite in them,

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:38.980
 and a bake at the scientists we're talking about. I see the him or someone else. There is a theory

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:44.900
 that the very earliest bacteria were magnetic, but get this. Some bacteria are aligned towards the

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.780
 north pole, and some bacteria in the southern hemisphere are aligned towards the south pole.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.780
 Do you know what I found about bacteria actually looking this up, which I think is quite cool,

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.020
 is that one of the things is when bacteria multiply, then they split in half, and they keep spreading

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.060
 in half, and when they're magnetic, that's really hard to do. And the reason is that normally the

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:08.740
 way they do that is by belt tightening. So literally when a bacteria splits in half, it just tightens.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.820
 They spend a bit less money that month or? Yeah, absolutely. They just cut down

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.780
 until a bit of them starve to death, and it falls off. No, they literally around their middle,

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:24.660
 they squeeze their membranes, tighter and tighter and tighter, until it just kind of chops them in half.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.860
 Oh, that's terrible, because if a bacteria family thinks, "Oh, we have too many kids,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.060
 we're going to have to tighten our belts," then suddenly they've got twice as many children on the

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:40.340
 southern. Another animal that has magnets in it very often. Your children. Possibly also cows.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:46.020
 So cows, there's this problem that they don't actually chew their food. So what are they doing when

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.900
 they're doing that chewing thing that they do? I think they're chewing their previous meal, aren't they?

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.700
 They're chewing a meal that they've regurgitated, I think. So first time around, don't chew. And often

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.420
 there's a little bit of barbed wire or metal or nails in the grass, until they swallow them. They end

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.180
 up in their stomachs. They usually go to their second stomach, their reticular, and I think it is.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.380
 And then that's really bad for them, because it can poke through the stomach lining and damage

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:13.940
 them in various ways. And so you tend to have to feed a magnet to a cow. And so this is very common,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.260
 a lot of farmers give their cows magnets when they've got what's called hardware disease, which is

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.060
 literally when they've swallowed a nail. And you just literally feed it to the cow on a little tube,

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:28.020
 and it sits in your second stomach, and it will attract all the metallic stuff to it. And then it

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.020
 stays there for the rest of the cow's life, and it stops. But doesn't it just end up with a cow with

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.500
 a large lump of metal in it, a large lump of barbed wire and stuff like that? I guess it's not floating

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:41.380
 around. Exactly. But if it gets big enough, surely it would sort of form a blockage. I think that

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.580
 comes a point where that cow deserves to die once it's eaten, you know, a hundred coils of barbed wire

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:52.660
 in a row. But the way they check as well that the magnets still in place is they use a compass,

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.540
 and then they can work out that way, whether there's a magnet in their stomach.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.420
 So what we're saying is actually quite a lot of cows are magnetic, and you could stick like children's

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:06.820
 drawings on them, like a fridge, right? Yeah, absolutely. God, why don't we try that? And presumably,

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.060
 if we actually could sense magnetic fields, we'd get incredibly disturbed and disrupted by

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.260
 large fields of magnetic cows. Yeah, whenever Andy Walt passed a field of cows with his penis magnum,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:25.380
 he immediately arrested. But I'd have a cast iron case. But then you'd be attracted to that cast iron case

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:38.580
 as well. Now, on to fact number two, that is my fact, and my fact is that the army has tanks that

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:44.740
 carry fold-out bridges for when they meet a river that they can't cross. And I think this is so

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:50.980
 cool. I saw this on popular mechanics website this week, which is a great website. And there's been

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:56.180
 an exercise that's been done in America, in California, over the Colorado River, where the army's

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:01.540
 built a temporary bridge over the Colorado River. And I didn't know that they did this, and this is a

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.660
 crucial part of being in the army, is that you have to have these, you have to get these tanks,

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:12.980
 which don't carry any weapons, they just carry a little foldable river. And then another tank

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.540
 carries a bridge to go over that foldable river. Yeah, sorry, they carry a foldable tank.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.940
 They carry a foldable tank. And inside that tank is another tank. They're actually Russian tanks.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:29.540
 Inside them, they have a foldable bridge, and when they get to a river, then they unfold the bridge,

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.500
 pops out, and they cross it. So when you cross over the bridge that you've been carrying,

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.340
 then do you pick it up back up and put it on top of your tank again, or is it there forever?

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:43.140
 Um, it's not there forever. It's temporary. So the last vehicle to cross over the bridge is the one

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.980
 that was carrying the bridge, and that is attached to the bridge. And when it's crossed over itself,

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:53.140
 as it were, it rolls itself back up into its body and goes on. It's amazing. It's so cool. And the

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.340
 US Army has one of these things that can make a bridge in what was it? They were saying 98 seconds.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.100
 Yeah. And they can still travel at about 30 miles an hour. It can't.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.580
 Well, the bridge. No, yes. No, it can't travel at 30 miles an hour while it's doing it.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.380
 But it is awesome. It is. And if you watch, you should watch the video on it because it shows exactly

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.860
 how they do it. So there are lots of different types. But this one across the Colorado river,

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:22.260
 tank goes up to the edge of it, and these folded lumps of bridge kind of spurred out of the tank,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:27.460
 like a projectile. They spur into the water. And then they pop open. It's like one of those blow-up

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.580
 tent things. It like pops open in the river and then boats hook onto the popped open bits of bridge.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:37.140
 And then they tow them into the right place and they slot together like Lego. And then everyone

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.900
 slides over it. So wait, they have boats. Why are they not going over on the boats?

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.900
 Because they need to carry like huge nubs of tanks and like a whole battalion across.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.220
 That was a problem with tanks for a long time, wasn't it? They just kept getting stuck in holes.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:54.260
 Yeah. Like in the early days of tanks in World War One, you get loads of pitches of them just stuck

00:13:54.260 --> 00:14:02.420
 in a trench. Yeah, you do. There was one that was designed so that it could go into a trench,

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.660
 and then it would spur little spurs. Why is everything sparse at all the time?

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.100
 Thanks. It's very perfect. Have you heard of Hobart's Funnies?

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:18.740
 No. Good. Great. So these were tanks that we used in D-Day. And there was this whole range.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.220
 Like a range of super heroes, basically. They're all each had their own special super power.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:28.100
 Everyone's rolling their eyes, but it's true. So there was one called the Swimming Sherman,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.260
 right? This was an amphibious tank which could operate in in water and on land.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.460
 It had a massive canvas screen all around its middle like a skirt. And it would just inflate

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.940
 the skirt when it was in water. And that would boil it up enough for it to go with the propeller.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:46.420
 And then as it got out of the water, it would just drop its skirt to the ground and then roll off

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.060
 onto land. Wow. That's really impressive. It was very cool. Other were loads. There was the crab,

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:56.420
 there was the bobbin. So the crab could go sideways. The crab could not go sideways. It was a terrible

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.420
 crab. I had a massive flail on the end of it. It was used for clearing mines on beaches and things

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:06.820
 like that. Oh, like crabs do. Exactly. They're all perfectly named, right? What about the bobbin,

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:11.460
 what did that do? The bobbin, well, it was a bit like a bridge one and it's got something on

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.740
 its front, this massive rig on its front. But instead of a bridge, it's matting. It's like

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:22.180
 rush matting. It sort of lays down a path up the beach. So if the ground is too soft or if the sand

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:27.540
 is too spongy or something, you just have this one track laying tank which makes a road as it goes.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:35.060
 I couldn't find if they used it. We'll see him say. You wouldn't go to the expense of building it

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.740
 and not use it. Even in fact, after the invasion was over, you'd probably still say, can we just

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.140
 use that to see if it works? And the other thing is you don't lose anything by using it. Do you?

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:47.380
 Even if there's no sinking sand, at least you've got a nice little path to drive it.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.820
 Yeah, he designed the flamethrower one, I think, as well, didn't he? The Churchill crocodile flamethrower.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:58.660
 Yeah, the crocodiles don't throw flamethrower. So he wasn't great at naming things.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.140
 You know, that wasn't the focus in the Second World War. No, the flamethrower could fire flamethrowers

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:09.380
 100 metres over 100 metres. And it looks incredible. It's like robot wars. It had a genuine

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.900
 years like a real life robot wars. I can't believe it took so long after this to make robot wars, I think.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.460
 You would have thought that the TV commissioners who are watching a Normandy life thing sort of

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:24.260
 but the Imperial War Museum has an amazing page all about the various different Hobart's

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.980
 fanatics and all about the different weird things they could do. It's very cool.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:33.300
 Hey, I read about another bridge. I know one seems to know about it except beach combing,

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.460
 which is this, like, weird block. But I mean, literally no one else has picked up on this thing

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:44.420
 they found, which is in 1850, there's an article that I found it in the English Civil Engineer

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:50.180
 and Architects Journal and it states that the Academy of Sciences in France was considering an

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:56.100
 idea for a suspension bridge between England and France, so going from Dove to Calais. And the idea

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:02.420
 was that it would be four barges, would be sunk at equal distances apart across the channel.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.140
 And then they'd have chains going up from the barges to the surface and then the chains would be

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:12.260
 fixed to the bridge, which would run from England to France. And then above the bridge would be

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:18.180
 these huge balloons. It described them as giant balloons of elliptical form and firmly secured,

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:23.460
 which would support in the air the extremity of these chains. And so it would have these balloons

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:29.060
 floating in the air, attached to the chains and then also attached to the abutments at the end

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.140
 of the bridge. That would keep the bridge over the channel. I think I can see why no one else

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:38.260
 has picked up on this because it's a pretty stupid idea. Do the balloons have to stay in the air forever?

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.580
 Yeah, of course they're doing that. There's problem one. Yeah. Why? I think these are these puncture

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:48.180
 safe balloons. Entropy, that's a problem. That's what you always say, James. Whenever anyone

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:54.340
 proposes any idea, do you want to cap a T-chance? Well, what's the point? All to be cold by the end of the

00:17:54.340 --> 00:18:07.220
 universe. Okay, moving on to fact number three and that is James's fact. Okay, my fact this week is

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:14.020
 that a new law in Oregon has banned the game called Big Engine. There is no evidence anyone has

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:21.060
 played Big Engine since the 1950s and no living person appears to know the rules. Sorry, they have

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.580
 just banned this. Yeah, they banned it this year. Sorry, I didn't think that. I just thought you were

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.940
 saying that there's this crazy old law that bans again that we don't know about. This year they have

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:34.580
 banned it. So this year they had a new gambling rule that came in and they had a whole list of things

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:41.220
 you're not allowed to play, including things like Chinese chuk-a-lok and Wheel of Fortune,

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:49.140
 Shemin Defeh, I don't know what that is, Pankwing Quay, Red Dog, AC Juicy and one of them is this thing which

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:54.020
 is called Big Engine and as far as we can see no one has ever played this in the last 50 years

00:18:54.020 --> 00:19:00.500
 and I found this in an article on Williamette Week which seems to be a local newspaper in America

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.580
 and they have a column called Doctor No and he looked into it and he couldn't find any evidence

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:09.700
 of it either. Well, I mean it's good to take the precaution, isn't it? Exactly, so he says quite

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:14.580
 rightly in this column, if they did decide to get rid of it then it's just going to set up a load

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:20.660
 of Big Engine kind of card games in the whole state and everyone will just start gambling on it,

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:25.140
 won't they? That's actually a loophole. Oh, it'll be a loophole, but we don't know the rules.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.300
 Yeah, but they could just make them up. Well, can't you just make up another game and play for money

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.380
 on that? Yeah, that's true. Actually, it does say any other gambling based game is banned, so I don't

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:39.300
 even know why they did that whole list. Why did they include Shemin Defeh, for example. But do you

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.020
 remember at school when you weren't allowed to play British Bulldog anymore, you would just give it

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:48.820
 another name and play it? I don't remember that. No, we always do that. We were always allowed to

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:54.100
 play it. Did you ask a bit out of hand? Oh, yeah, it's very violent game British Bulldog. Yeah,

00:19:54.100 --> 00:20:00.020
 I think they like us to pick each other off sometimes if they keep the numbers down. So where have

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:06.500
 they got these game names from? So it appears to be that they were in an old, very, very old law,

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.580
 maybe in Nevada or something like that, and then they've been picked up by the next law and

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:16.740
 picked up by the next law, and they just basically copy paste the rules from another law. Okay. That's

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:25.780
 really slag. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I want to bespoke artisan laws crafted by masters. Just for you,

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:32.260
 for the state game. Yeah. Do you really want to allow to gamble in libraries until 2005, and we've

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:36.740
 just relegalyzed it? Are you really allowed to? We know. We've legalized gambling in libraries. We

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:42.420
 sure have. So at 1890, what book is going to go out next or what? You could do whatever you like, James.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.540
 That's a really good idea for a bad. Because the odds of you winning are astronomical.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.620
 You could have a lottery, frankly, at those odds. Well, you would just go for a popular one,

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:56.580
 like 50 Shades of Grey or something, wouldn't you? True. You wouldn't choose the extremely rare book.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.140
 If I got better odds, I would. Would you? But then I'd try and game it somehow. It's too

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.420
 open to corruption, James, because you could just ask your friend to go in and get out, you know,

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.580
 book about the Meravindrian dynasty or whatever. I think you could clamp down on that kind of thing,

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.660
 and I'm sure they have now that they've legalized it. You see a lot of armed guards outside libraries

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:18.660
 these days, but it was banned in libraries in 1898. And when was it legalized? 2005. You're not

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.820
 allowed to like put a casino in a library, I think. I don't think if you walked and drunken a

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:27.540
 slot machine behind you. It's going to be more like just playing Cribbitch or something, is it?

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:32.580
 I think it's just poker, yeah. But if there were more slot machines based on 19th century novels,

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.980
 I would certainly gamble more. You could have to get all three Bronte sisters in a row. That would

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:42.980
 be fun. And would you lose if you got Bramwell? Yes, you would. You lose everything. This is very

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:50.980
 niche fantasy. What a niche over there. Fourth Bronte. So on things being banned. Oh, yeah. I was looking

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:57.380
 into computer games being banned. And there was a game in Australia called Getting Up, and it was

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:04.740
 banned for the reason that it glorified Graffiti. Because it was again involved with Graffiti?

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:11.700
 Well, it was. It wasn't that mad at it, does it? But is it a bit like Grand Theft Auto for Graffiti?

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.980
 Not really. It's a really wholesome Graffiti game. Basically, it's about a youth who

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:20.100
 used the street art to take down a corrupt mayor who murdered his father. And then the mayor

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:25.060
 launched as an anti-graffiti campaign to try and cover up the fact that he killed his kid's father.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:30.260
 But the authorities thought, oh, this will encourage tagging and Graffiti, so they banned the game.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.500
 It's like streetpictionary. They should call Graffiti, you know, that actually, and I think

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.460
 people wouldn't get so much trouble. Is it Carcamboles? Yes, it's Carcamboles.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:48.100
 South Korea banned video games between midnight and 6am. It's a very short ban.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:54.100
 They woke up and they immediately repented. What are we thinking?

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:59.860
 Back to the chamber before anyone finds out that we don't have them.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:06.420
 What was it, midnight to 4am? Midnight to 6am every day. Every day you weren't allowed to play

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.660
 a video games from midnight to 6am. And it was to combat the video gaming problem,

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.020
 which is kind of a thing in South Korea because a lot of people are addicted to it. It's called

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.660
 the shutdown law. And it was under 16, so you couldn't do it because they were staying up all night

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:25.220
 and playing. But they've recently, sweetly, they amended it in 2014, and the law can be lifted

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.860
 as per request of the children's parents. So I guess you call up the government and you say,

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:35.860
 my kid's fine, he just needs it to concentrate. It just hasn't finished level 4 yet. He needs to finish it.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:42.020
 So I've got something here about porn star Ron Jeremy. It says that Nintendo bought the rights

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:47.940
 to two adult film parodies, Super Horny O Brothers and Super Horny O Brothers 2 in the hopes that they

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.900
 would never see the light of screen. So they made the movies. And they didn't make the movies.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:58.420
 Well, the movies were made. Yeah. This is where these exist, but they were never really.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.420
 Well, I do have the plots of Super Horny O Brothers, and it's shockingly unsexy. I'm not going to

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:08.660
 read out the whole thing. But basically it stars Squeegee Hornyo, who's Ron Jeremy and his brother

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.300
 Hornyo Hornyo, and they're trying to save Princess Polina from King Pooper.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.900
 Well, my wife's called Polina. My pet name is Pooper. What was it?

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:24.500
 King Pooper. King Pooper. Your love interest is hornyo hornyo.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.860
 Oh, hornyo hornyo, yeah. Yeah.

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:32.500
 Wow. Also on Nintendo, I learned that Nintendo was very close to releasing an accessory

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.860
 and game that let players create their own knitting patterns. During its market research period,

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.820
 all seven of the beta test volunteers died of old age.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:52.740
 Okay, on to the final fact, and that is Andy's facts.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:57.140
 My fact is that African wild dogs have a sneeze-based voting system.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:03.540
 I swear to God. It doesn't sound particularly true, does it?

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:08.500
 It doesn't, but researchers from Brown University have looked into this, and so African wild dogs,

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:16.740
 they're a kind of dog they live, any guesses? No, in the wild. In Rua, they live in Africa,

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:21.700
 Southern Africa, and they live in packs of between about 10 and 40 animals, and there are not

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.220
 many left. There are only about 1,400 left in the wild. And basically, they have these,

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:29.780
 what they call rallies, where they just spend all day sleeping. So, what they, the dogs call rallies?

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:38.980
 They, the dogs, they call them, they, the dogs have what they, the researchers call rallies.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.820
 Basically, it just means they spend all day sleeping next to each other, but

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:51.060
 they get up after a while, and they sort of say, shall we go hunting? And they get up and sneeze,

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:55.940
 and if the more sneezes there are, the likelihood is that the pack will go hunting.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.660
 Wow. And it's then basically voting to do it. And also, different votes carry different

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:06.100
 weight. So, every pack has an alpha pair who are in charge. If those two sneeze, it's much

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:13.860
 likelier that the pack will go off hunting than if two junior dogs sneeze. That is so weird.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:19.460
 Yeah. Do they know, have any idea why they do this? To decide whether to go out and sneeze,

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:24.900
 yeah, but they're wrong. Yeah, there are other ways of making noise. I guess, it's, yeah,

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.300
 it's the option to limited when you're a dog. They can't bark, actually, can they? Come

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.780
 in. Ah, there we go. I don't think so. They can kind of scream.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:37.460
 That would be a very upsetting voting system. I don't know if you went into the voting vote,

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:44.180
 if you had to just scream. I always do that. Oh my god, these guys are good. Especially the

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.660
 recent election. It's been a tough time. I always thought that sneezing was a thing that you

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:54.260
 did without doing it on purpose, as in you can't make yourself sneeze, you have to have some kind

00:26:54.260 --> 00:27:00.580
 of input. I think these guys can. Yeah. Yeah. That would make sense. I guess so. Otherwise, just

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.420
 like a little bit of pepper goes across the African plates. Yeah. Suddenly they're all

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.980
 off somewhere. Or never goes across and they all starve to death. Yeah. Where's the pepper, guys?

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:15.060
 They're very cool animals. They're amazing. Yeah. So they're, they might be the nicest animals

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:24.100
 that I've ever studied. They speak, somebody's not a zebra. They're very altruistic, aren't they?

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:29.860
 So the way they operate is that they really care for each other. So for instance,

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:34.900
 if a wild dog becomes ill or injured or gets older, the rest of the pack really cares for them and

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:40.980
 will sacrifice a lot of food for them. And similarly, if there are a lot of young wild dogs around,

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:45.780
 African wild dogs around, then the older members of the pack will bring them food and sacrifice

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.500
 food for them. And sometimes the older members of the pack will die prematurely because they've

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:56.980
 starved themselves in order that younger members can thrive. And they regurgitate meat into each other's

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:02.020
 mouths throughout. So some animals do this to their young, they go in. So when they do it, they're

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:11.060
 altruistic. And yeah, when I do that, I'm apparently a really creepy boyfriend. Your girlfriend's vegan.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:20.500
 It really is unfair. So they'll go and hunt and then they'll bring back some food in their stomachs

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.740
 and then they'll vomit it up into their fellow pack members' mouths if the other pack members

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:30.260
 were just too lazy to hunt. We have previously mentioned, I think, that Buffalo vote

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:37.540
 with a sort of standing up and sitting down system. But loads of animals vote. Go on.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.740
 Cockroaches. Do they? How do they vote?

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:50.820
 Mostly lived out. At least someone votes for them. At least when the whole of the planet is blown

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.140
 up by the nuclear war, the lived out will be the... They'll have a majority. Exactly.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:29:03.780
 No, so they vote by movement. And there was a scientist called Jose Halloy from Brussels

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:12.020
 and he did an experiment with robot cockroaches in 2007 and he made robot cockroaches, which would not

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.860
 what you think of robots with sort of implants in them as they started doing these days. He just made

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:21.060
 little machines which could move around. They just lot like cockroaches. No, they didn't even look

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:26.100
 like cockroaches. So why are they called robot cockroaches? Because he covered them in paper, which

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:32.740
 was infused with robot a pheromone. He covered the paper infused with cockroach pheromones.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.260
 So they smelt like cockroaches. Honestly, they look nothing like cockroaches. They're just

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:41.300
 little white boxes of wheels. And then so he infiltrated their society and got them to be accepted

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:49.620
 by the cockroaches, right? And then he managed to screw the cockroach election by moving all his robot

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:55.300
 cockroaches to the wrong place where they were going to build their home and they were all voting

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:59.140
 to build their home over here, even though the actual cockroaches are previously considered and

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.180
 rejected that site. I tell you what, if the Kremlin they're listening to this.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:11.700
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thanks so much for listening. If you want to get in touch
