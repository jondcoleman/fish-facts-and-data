00:00:00,00:00:19,"Oh hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Things A Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:27,"to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden. My name's Anna, I'm here today with Andy,"
00:00:27,00:00:33,"James and fellow QIL Alice Campbell Davies, and once again, we've gathered around the mics"
00:00:33,00:00:37,"with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here"
00:00:37,00:00:44,"we go, starting with you, Alice. So my fact is humans should be able to sense magnetic"
00:00:44,00:00:50,"fields, should be, should be. So there's been a little bit of research into this, not that"
00:00:50,00:00:55,"much actually, but we have Cryptochrome in our retinal cells, which is what's responsible"
00:00:55,00:01:00,"for pigeons, migration and that kind of thing. And we also have Magnetite in our brains,"
00:01:00,00:01:04,"which is a magnetic nanoparticle, which helps direct other animals like bacteria."
00:01:04,00:01:11,"So why the disappointing lack, why can't I say where I live from here? Well Andy, can"
00:01:11,00:01:15,you point south from here? Yes I can actually. But only because you know where the river is.
00:01:15,00:01:18,I know where the river is. Well they have actually done some studies
00:01:18,00:01:23,on this. There's a really controversial study from the 1980s done by a guy called Robin
00:01:23,00:01:29,"Baker, where he took a bunch of students out on a minibus, drove them on a really security"
00:01:29,00:01:35,"route all around Manchester, and then blindfolded them and told them to point to home. A bunch"
00:01:35,00:01:38,of them that didn't have Magnetite strapped to their heads could point home and a bunch of
00:01:38,00:01:42,"them with Magnetite strapped to their heads couldn't, which suggests that magnetic fields"
00:01:42,00:01:47,were interrupting their ability to point home. But then no one else has managed to replicate
00:01:47,00:01:53,"this study. No, in fact it's been disproven multiple times. But he has replicated the"
00:01:53,00:01:57,"study. So in a sense, maybe all of these people lived in that massive tower on Deensgate"
00:01:57,00:02:02,"in Manchester, which you can see from pretty much the whole setting. I think they were blindfolded"
00:02:02,00:02:06,"on the journey, weren't they? Yeah, I'm not sure if they were blindfolded on the way home."
00:02:06,00:02:09,"That might have... It takes it too far. It's an amazing beginning for a horror story though,"
00:02:09,00:02:13,where you have to put on a blindfold and get on the professor's bus and then it goes away
00:02:13,00:02:16,"and you don't know where you're going. I thought, I mean, I would have assumed that there"
00:02:16,00:02:20,"was a really exciting surprise awaiting me, like a head and parcel, you know, a big champagne"
00:02:20,00:02:24,picnic if I was blindfolded and put on a bus. If I was just strapped to a magnet and told
00:02:24,00:02:28,the point at something. Would you not think you were being kidnapped maybe? By my professor.
00:02:28,00:02:34,"I don't know, I had perfectly normal professors. What normal professors who take you on head parties?"
00:02:34,00:02:43,"So there were two people who tried to replicate this called Max Westby and Karen Partridge,"
00:02:43,00:02:47,"and they were at the University of Sheffield, and they were unable to do it, and they quite"
00:02:47,00:02:53,"sniffly said, ""Maybe it depends which side of the penine hills you're on. That's an academic"
00:02:53,00:02:57,"slam in a half."" It is, but I think maybe people from Yorkshire just aren't as good."
00:02:57,00:03:04,"Um, it's ironic considering that a Partridge, a real Partridge, probably would be able to sense"
00:03:04,00:03:10,"which side of the penines it was on. That's irony for you, right there. There are a lot of different"
00:03:10,00:03:14,"kinds of manner, and sometimes actually weak jokes can just qualify as irony."
00:03:15,00:03:19,Are you being particularly appropriate because they use iron to sense where they're going?
00:03:19,00:03:29,"No, that's ironic. It's still not ironic. So some humans are magnetic, and they can literally"
00:03:29,00:03:38,"pick things up. I can literally pick things up. With my hands. I can't, that's why I always have to"
00:03:38,00:03:44,ask you to do it for me. You can pour that coffee into my mouth. Do you mean they can just hold
00:03:44,00:03:48,"their hand hovering over a magnet, and the magnet will fly towards the hand? They are people who've"
00:03:48,00:03:53,"had magnetic implants in their fingertips. Wouldn't that get very problematic, though, you know,"
00:03:53,00:03:56,opening a fridge or something? Yeah. You can just be stuck to the fridge the whole time.
00:03:56,00:04:00,"Absolutely. Well, unfortunately, you buy the fridge, so you're right."
00:04:00,00:04:03,"So these implants are quite weak. You wouldn't actually stick to your fridge, but people are"
00:04:03,00:04:07,"getting them biohackers, and there's a lot of interviews with these people saying they really"
00:04:07,00:04:11,"don't regret it. They think it's fantastic, because you're finally able to pick up tiny metal"
00:04:11,00:04:15,"objects and determine whether metals are ferrous, which is something that we've always wanted to be"
00:04:15,00:04:20,able to do. And you can feel electric fields if you have one of these little implants. So if you go
00:04:20,00:04:26,"near a microwave, then your finger starts vibrating. I think I also can tell when I'm near a microwave."
00:04:26,00:04:32,"You have visual clues, don't you? It's true. It's only useful if you're worried about being"
00:04:32,00:04:37,"near a microwave, and you have hidden microwaves in this environment. Or if you don't know if it's a"
00:04:37,00:04:43,"prop microwave, like if your house is also a film set, and so it is a useful implant to get."
00:04:43,00:04:47,"Unfortunately, it has to be done by like a tattoo artist or something, so you can't get an"
00:04:47,00:04:52,"anesthetic to have it done, and it is relatively painful, according to one of the people who's got"
00:04:52,00:04:57,"it done. They put a massive syringe in your finger, and then they fire a magnet into it."
00:04:57,00:05:01,"What? Is it in the finger tip? Yeah. Or is it? They could put it anywhere in your body, I guess."
00:05:01,00:05:05,"No, James. I'm just saying they could. I'm not saying they would."
00:05:05,00:05:09,"If you're suggesting a word of which, my magical penis tells me where the microwave is."
00:05:09,00:05:11,Like a pointer.
00:05:11,00:05:15,"It would be like dalsing for water, wouldn't it?"
00:05:15,00:05:20,Dalsing for microwaves. Imagine being near a branch of curries.
00:05:20,00:05:26,"There are people who claim to be magnetic, but who aren't really?"
00:05:26,00:05:30,"Yeah. You know, you see pitches off them online, and they've got spoons attached to them."
00:05:31,00:05:37,"Yes, like circus performery type tricks. Well, often it's just people, and they get into like the"
00:05:37,00:05:42,"local tabloids, don't they? Yeah. Because they're magnetic, but they never are. Like a lot of the"
00:05:42,00:05:47,"skeptics kind of go there and try them out, and it turns out a lot of people are leaning back in the"
00:05:47,00:05:54,"pictures, and if they lean forwards, the spoons would just fall off. Also, if you got kind of greasy"
00:05:54,00:06:00,"skin, then it will stick to the kind of sebum in your skin, so that everyone's kind of sticky in a"
00:06:00,00:06:04,"way. So not only are you a liar, but you're kind of a greasy, sweaty liar."
00:06:04,00:06:10,"Yeah. James Randi, the famous skeptic from Australia, he would douse people in telecompowder,"
00:06:10,00:06:14,and suddenly they would not be magnetic anymore. But surely you could just disprove it by
00:06:14,00:06:21,"putting a magnet next to them and proving it didn't stick. Yeah, although they would be able to"
00:06:21,00:06:25,make it stick. How sweaty are these people that random fridge magnets?
00:06:25,00:06:29,"So I've got a little pen here, and I can kind of stick it on my head if I kind of lean back a"
00:06:29,00:06:32,"little bit. Yeah, we do need to get aircon in this room, don't you say?"
00:06:32,00:06:40,"I'm remembering that humans have magnets in their nose that maybe we once used to navigate,"
00:06:40,00:06:46,so they found magnetite in our esnoid bone in our nose. Not sure. And so there's lots of speculation
00:06:46,00:06:51,"about the fact that we might have been able to use this at some point to navigate, isn't there?"
00:06:51,00:06:55,"Yeah, I think the theory about there being magnetic stuff in the nose was disproven by a guy"
00:06:55,00:07:01,"called Joe Kirschwink, or something I can't pronounce his surname, a Caltech, who is the biggest"
00:07:01,00:07:08,"critic of Baker's work, and he has just I had an experience last year where he set up a big Faraday"
00:07:08,00:07:13,"cage and a Caltech basement to block out other magnetic waves of sorts and put people in it,"
00:07:13,00:07:19,and then subjected them to magnetic fields from different directions. And he has actually shown
00:07:19,00:07:24,"that when you have magnetic waves coming from one direction, there is a massive change in your"
00:07:24,00:07:30,"EEG spec, so your brain waves, so it does show that there is something in your brain that is responding"
00:07:30,00:07:34,"to the direction of magnetic fields you're exposed to, which is really interesting. Does it have any"
00:07:34,00:07:40,"effect on not your thoughts, but is it? It's not mind control, Andy. It's not mind control,"
00:07:40,00:07:45,"but I'm just trying to work out how that could have been useful. I think in the past, when we were"
00:07:45,00:07:49,"maybe migrating over larger distances, it was something we could have relied on, but now we don't"
00:07:49,00:07:53,"really need it. So maybe in the past we could sense magnetism. Perhaps, yeah. We'll also the"
00:07:53,00:07:57,"cryptochromes we have in our eyes, because they're in our eyes, which is the same as with birds and"
00:07:57,00:08:03,"other animals, suggests that at one point we did use it to see magnetic fields. Okay, and basically"
00:08:03,00:08:09,"what we're saying is loads of animals can see magnetic fields and can sense magnetic fields,"
00:08:09,00:08:14,"but we just can't, right? Yeah, maybe. Do you know which animal has some magnetite in its tongue?"
00:08:14,00:08:22,"It's a little mollus, isn't it? It is, it's a mollusk. Mollusks have magnetite-capped teeth,"
00:08:22,00:08:27,"but when I say teeth, their tongue is made of teeth. Radula. Radula, exactly. Yeah, yeah. So they can do that,"
00:08:27,00:08:32,"and this is very cool. There are some bacteria which contain magnetite in them,"
00:08:32,00:08:38,and a bake at the scientists we're talking about. I see the him or someone else. There is a theory
00:08:38,00:08:44,"that the very earliest bacteria were magnetic, but get this. Some bacteria are aligned towards the"
00:08:44,00:08:49,"north pole, and some bacteria in the southern hemisphere are aligned towards the south pole."
00:08:49,00:08:53,"Do you know what I found about bacteria actually looking this up, which I think is quite cool,"
00:08:53,00:08:58,"is that one of the things is when bacteria multiply, then they split in half, and they keep spreading"
00:08:58,00:09:03,"in half, and when they're magnetic, that's really hard to do. And the reason is that normally the"
00:09:03,00:09:08,"way they do that is by belt tightening. So literally when a bacteria splits in half, it just tightens."
00:09:08,00:09:12,"They spend a bit less money that month or? Yeah, absolutely. They just cut down"
00:09:12,00:09:17,"until a bit of them starve to death, and it falls off. No, they literally around their middle,"
00:09:17,00:09:24,"they squeeze their membranes, tighter and tighter and tighter, until it just kind of chops them in half."
00:09:24,00:09:27,"Oh, that's terrible, because if a bacteria family thinks, ""Oh, we have too many kids,"
00:09:27,00:09:31,"we're going to have to tighten our belts,"" then suddenly they've got twice as many children on the"
00:09:31,00:09:40,southern. Another animal that has magnets in it very often. Your children. Possibly also cows.
00:09:40,00:09:46,"So cows, there's this problem that they don't actually chew their food. So what are they doing when"
00:09:46,00:09:50,"they're doing that chewing thing that they do? I think they're chewing their previous meal, aren't they?"
00:09:50,00:09:55,"They're chewing a meal that they've regurgitated, I think. So first time around, don't chew. And often"
00:09:55,00:10:00,"there's a little bit of barbed wire or metal or nails in the grass, until they swallow them. They end"
00:10:00,00:10:04,"up in their stomachs. They usually go to their second stomach, their reticular, and I think it is."
00:10:04,00:10:07,"And then that's really bad for them, because it can poke through the stomach lining and damage"
00:10:07,00:10:13,"them in various ways. And so you tend to have to feed a magnet to a cow. And so this is very common,"
00:10:13,00:10:18,"a lot of farmers give their cows magnets when they've got what's called hardware disease, which is"
00:10:18,00:10:23,"literally when they've swallowed a nail. And you just literally feed it to the cow on a little tube,"
00:10:23,00:10:28,"and it sits in your second stomach, and it will attract all the metallic stuff to it. And then it"
00:10:28,00:10:32,"stays there for the rest of the cow's life, and it stops. But doesn't it just end up with a cow with"
00:10:32,00:10:36,"a large lump of metal in it, a large lump of barbed wire and stuff like that? I guess it's not floating"
00:10:36,00:10:41,"around. Exactly. But if it gets big enough, surely it would sort of form a blockage. I think that"
00:10:41,00:10:46,"comes a point where that cow deserves to die once it's eaten, you know, a hundred coils of barbed wire"
00:10:46,00:10:52,"in a row. But the way they check as well that the magnets still in place is they use a compass,"
00:10:52,00:10:55,"and then they can work out that way, whether there's a magnet in their stomach."
00:10:55,00:11:00,"So what we're saying is actually quite a lot of cows are magnetic, and you could stick like children's"
00:11:00,00:11:06,"drawings on them, like a fridge, right? Yeah, absolutely. God, why don't we try that? And presumably,"
00:11:06,00:11:11,"if we actually could sense magnetic fields, we'd get incredibly disturbed and disrupted by"
00:11:11,00:11:16,"large fields of magnetic cows. Yeah, whenever Andy Walt passed a field of cows with his penis magnum,"
00:11:16,00:11:25,he immediately arrested. But I'd have a cast iron case. But then you'd be attracted to that cast iron case
00:11:25,00:11:38,"as well. Now, on to fact number two, that is my fact, and my fact is that the army has tanks that"
00:11:38,00:11:44,carry fold-out bridges for when they meet a river that they can't cross. And I think this is so
00:11:44,00:11:50,"cool. I saw this on popular mechanics website this week, which is a great website. And there's been"
00:11:50,00:11:56,"an exercise that's been done in America, in California, over the Colorado River, where the army's"
00:11:56,00:12:01,"built a temporary bridge over the Colorado River. And I didn't know that they did this, and this is a"
00:12:01,00:12:06,"crucial part of being in the army, is that you have to have these, you have to get these tanks,"
00:12:06,00:12:12,"which don't carry any weapons, they just carry a little foldable river. And then another tank"
00:12:12,00:12:17,"carries a bridge to go over that foldable river. Yeah, sorry, they carry a foldable tank."
00:12:17,00:12:21,They carry a foldable tank. And inside that tank is another tank. They're actually Russian tanks.
00:12:21,00:12:29,"Inside them, they have a foldable bridge, and when they get to a river, then they unfold the bridge,"
00:12:29,00:12:34,"pops out, and they cross it. So when you cross over the bridge that you've been carrying,"
00:12:34,00:12:38,"then do you pick it up back up and put it on top of your tank again, or is it there forever?"
00:12:38,00:12:43,"Um, it's not there forever. It's temporary. So the last vehicle to cross over the bridge is the one"
00:12:43,00:12:46,"that was carrying the bridge, and that is attached to the bridge. And when it's crossed over itself,"
00:12:46,00:12:53,"as it were, it rolls itself back up into its body and goes on. It's amazing. It's so cool. And the"
00:12:53,00:12:58,US Army has one of these things that can make a bridge in what was it? They were saying 98 seconds.
00:12:58,00:13:02,Yeah. And they can still travel at about 30 miles an hour. It can't.
00:13:02,00:13:06,"Well, the bridge. No, yes. No, it can't travel at 30 miles an hour while it's doing it."
00:13:06,00:13:11,"But it is awesome. It is. And if you watch, you should watch the video on it because it shows exactly"
00:13:11,00:13:15,"how they do it. So there are lots of different types. But this one across the Colorado river,"
00:13:15,00:13:22,"tank goes up to the edge of it, and these folded lumps of bridge kind of spurred out of the tank,"
00:13:22,00:13:27,like a projectile. They spur into the water. And then they pop open. It's like one of those blow-up
00:13:27,00:13:32,tent things. It like pops open in the river and then boats hook onto the popped open bits of bridge.
00:13:32,00:13:37,And then they tow them into the right place and they slot together like Lego. And then everyone
00:13:37,00:13:40,"slides over it. So wait, they have boats. Why are they not going over on the boats?"
00:13:40,00:13:44,Because they need to carry like huge nubs of tanks and like a whole battalion across.
00:13:44,00:13:49,"That was a problem with tanks for a long time, wasn't it? They just kept getting stuck in holes."
00:13:49,00:13:54,"Yeah. Like in the early days of tanks in World War One, you get loads of pitches of them just stuck"
00:13:54,00:14:02,"in a trench. Yeah, you do. There was one that was designed so that it could go into a trench,"
00:14:02,00:14:06,and then it would spur little spurs. Why is everything sparse at all the time?
00:14:06,00:14:10,Thanks. It's very perfect. Have you heard of Hobart's Funnies?
00:14:10,00:14:18,No. Good. Great. So these were tanks that we used in D-Day. And there was this whole range.
00:14:18,00:14:23,"Like a range of super heroes, basically. They're all each had their own special super power."
00:14:23,00:14:28,"Everyone's rolling their eyes, but it's true. So there was one called the Swimming Sherman,"
00:14:28,00:14:32,right? This was an amphibious tank which could operate in in water and on land.
00:14:32,00:14:37,It had a massive canvas screen all around its middle like a skirt. And it would just inflate
00:14:37,00:14:41,the skirt when it was in water. And that would boil it up enough for it to go with the propeller.
00:14:41,00:14:46,"And then as it got out of the water, it would just drop its skirt to the ground and then roll off"
00:14:46,00:14:51,"onto land. Wow. That's really impressive. It was very cool. Other were loads. There was the crab,"
00:14:51,00:14:56,there was the bobbin. So the crab could go sideways. The crab could not go sideways. It was a terrible
00:14:56,00:15:00,crab. I had a massive flail on the end of it. It was used for clearing mines on beaches and things
00:15:00,00:15:06,"like that. Oh, like crabs do. Exactly. They're all perfectly named, right? What about the bobbin,"
00:15:06,00:15:11,"what did that do? The bobbin, well, it was a bit like a bridge one and it's got something on"
00:15:11,00:15:16,"its front, this massive rig on its front. But instead of a bridge, it's matting. It's like"
00:15:16,00:15:22,rush matting. It sort of lays down a path up the beach. So if the ground is too soft or if the sand
00:15:22,00:15:27,"is too spongy or something, you just have this one track laying tank which makes a road as it goes."
00:15:27,00:15:35,I couldn't find if they used it. We'll see him say. You wouldn't go to the expense of building it
00:15:35,00:15:38,"and not use it. Even in fact, after the invasion was over, you'd probably still say, can we just"
00:15:38,00:15:43,use that to see if it works? And the other thing is you don't lose anything by using it. Do you?
00:15:43,00:15:47,"Even if there's no sinking sand, at least you've got a nice little path to drive it."
00:15:47,00:15:52,"Yeah, he designed the flamethrower one, I think, as well, didn't he? The Churchill crocodile flamethrower."
00:15:52,00:15:58,"Yeah, the crocodiles don't throw flamethrower. So he wasn't great at naming things."
00:15:58,00:16:03,"You know, that wasn't the focus in the Second World War. No, the flamethrower could fire flamethrowers"
00:16:03,00:16:09,100 metres over 100 metres. And it looks incredible. It's like robot wars. It had a genuine
00:16:09,00:16:14,"years like a real life robot wars. I can't believe it took so long after this to make robot wars, I think."
00:16:14,00:16:19,You would have thought that the TV commissioners who are watching a Normandy life thing sort of
00:16:19,00:16:24,but the Imperial War Museum has an amazing page all about the various different Hobart's
00:16:24,00:16:26,fanatics and all about the different weird things they could do. It's very cool.
00:16:26,00:16:33,"Hey, I read about another bridge. I know one seems to know about it except beach combing,"
00:16:33,00:16:37,"which is this, like, weird block. But I mean, literally no one else has picked up on this thing"
00:16:37,00:16:44,"they found, which is in 1850, there's an article that I found it in the English Civil Engineer"
00:16:44,00:16:50,and Architects Journal and it states that the Academy of Sciences in France was considering an
00:16:50,00:16:56,"idea for a suspension bridge between England and France, so going from Dove to Calais. And the idea"
00:16:56,00:17:02,"was that it would be four barges, would be sunk at equal distances apart across the channel."
00:17:02,00:17:07,And then they'd have chains going up from the barges to the surface and then the chains would be
00:17:07,00:17:12,"fixed to the bridge, which would run from England to France. And then above the bridge would be"
00:17:12,00:17:18,"these huge balloons. It described them as giant balloons of elliptical form and firmly secured,"
00:17:18,00:17:23,which would support in the air the extremity of these chains. And so it would have these balloons
00:17:23,00:17:29,"floating in the air, attached to the chains and then also attached to the abutments at the end"
00:17:29,00:17:33,of the bridge. That would keep the bridge over the channel. I think I can see why no one else
00:17:33,00:17:38,has picked up on this because it's a pretty stupid idea. Do the balloons have to stay in the air forever?
00:17:38,00:17:42,"Yeah, of course they're doing that. There's problem one. Yeah. Why? I think these are these puncture"
00:17:42,00:17:48,"safe balloons. Entropy, that's a problem. That's what you always say, James. Whenever anyone"
00:17:48,00:17:54,"proposes any idea, do you want to cap a T-chance? Well, what's the point? All to be cold by the end of the"
00:17:54,00:18:07,"universe. Okay, moving on to fact number three and that is James's fact. Okay, my fact this week is"
00:18:07,00:18:14,that a new law in Oregon has banned the game called Big Engine. There is no evidence anyone has
00:18:14,00:18:21,"played Big Engine since the 1950s and no living person appears to know the rules. Sorry, they have"
00:18:21,00:18:24,"just banned this. Yeah, they banned it this year. Sorry, I didn't think that. I just thought you were"
00:18:24,00:18:27,saying that there's this crazy old law that bans again that we don't know about. This year they have
00:18:27,00:18:34,banned it. So this year they had a new gambling rule that came in and they had a whole list of things
00:18:34,00:18:41,"you're not allowed to play, including things like Chinese chuk-a-lok and Wheel of Fortune,"
00:18:41,00:18:49,"Shemin Defeh, I don't know what that is, Pankwing Quay, Red Dog, AC Juicy and one of them is this thing which"
00:18:49,00:18:54,is called Big Engine and as far as we can see no one has ever played this in the last 50 years
00:18:54,00:19:00,and I found this in an article on Williamette Week which seems to be a local newspaper in America
00:19:00,00:19:04,and they have a column called Doctor No and he looked into it and he couldn't find any evidence
00:19:04,00:19:09,"of it either. Well, I mean it's good to take the precaution, isn't it? Exactly, so he says quite"
00:19:09,00:19:14,"rightly in this column, if they did decide to get rid of it then it's just going to set up a load"
00:19:14,00:19:20,"of Big Engine kind of card games in the whole state and everyone will just start gambling on it,"
00:19:20,00:19:25,"won't they? That's actually a loophole. Oh, it'll be a loophole, but we don't know the rules."
00:19:25,00:19:29,"Yeah, but they could just make them up. Well, can't you just make up another game and play for money"
00:19:29,00:19:33,"on that? Yeah, that's true. Actually, it does say any other gambling based game is banned, so I don't"
00:19:33,00:19:39,"even know why they did that whole list. Why did they include Shemin Defeh, for example. But do you"
00:19:39,00:19:44,"remember at school when you weren't allowed to play British Bulldog anymore, you would just give it"
00:19:44,00:19:48,"another name and play it? I don't remember that. No, we always do that. We were always allowed to"
00:19:48,00:19:54,"play it. Did you ask a bit out of hand? Oh, yeah, it's very violent game British Bulldog. Yeah,"
00:19:54,00:20:00,I think they like us to pick each other off sometimes if they keep the numbers down. So where have
00:20:00,00:20:06,"they got these game names from? So it appears to be that they were in an old, very, very old law,"
00:20:06,00:20:10,"maybe in Nevada or something like that, and then they've been picked up by the next law and"
00:20:10,00:20:16,"picked up by the next law, and they just basically copy paste the rules from another law. Okay. That's"
00:20:16,00:20:25,"really slag. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I want to bespoke artisan laws crafted by masters. Just for you,"
00:20:25,00:20:32,"for the state game. Yeah. Do you really want to allow to gamble in libraries until 2005, and we've"
00:20:32,00:20:36,just relegalyzed it? Are you really allowed to? We know. We've legalized gambling in libraries. We
00:20:36,00:20:42,"sure have. So at 1890, what book is going to go out next or what? You could do whatever you like, James."
00:20:42,00:20:47,That's a really good idea for a bad. Because the odds of you winning are astronomical.
00:20:47,00:20:51,"You could have a lottery, frankly, at those odds. Well, you would just go for a popular one,"
00:20:51,00:20:56,"like 50 Shades of Grey or something, wouldn't you? True. You wouldn't choose the extremely rare book."
00:20:56,00:21:01,"If I got better odds, I would. Would you? But then I'd try and game it somehow. It's too"
00:21:01,00:21:04,"open to corruption, James, because you could just ask your friend to go in and get out, you know,"
00:21:04,00:21:08,"book about the Meravindrian dynasty or whatever. I think you could clamp down on that kind of thing,"
00:21:08,00:21:12,and I'm sure they have now that they've legalized it. You see a lot of armed guards outside libraries
00:21:12,00:21:18,"these days, but it was banned in libraries in 1898. And when was it legalized? 2005. You're not"
00:21:18,00:21:22,"allowed to like put a casino in a library, I think. I don't think if you walked and drunken a"
00:21:22,00:21:27,"slot machine behind you. It's going to be more like just playing Cribbitch or something, is it?"
00:21:27,00:21:32,"I think it's just poker, yeah. But if there were more slot machines based on 19th century novels,"
00:21:32,00:21:36,I would certainly gamble more. You could have to get all three Bronte sisters in a row. That would
00:21:36,00:21:42,"be fun. And would you lose if you got Bramwell? Yes, you would. You lose everything. This is very"
00:21:42,00:21:50,"niche fantasy. What a niche over there. Fourth Bronte. So on things being banned. Oh, yeah. I was looking"
00:21:50,00:21:57,"into computer games being banned. And there was a game in Australia called Getting Up, and it was"
00:21:57,00:22:04,banned for the reason that it glorified Graffiti. Because it was again involved with Graffiti?
00:22:04,00:22:11,"Well, it was. It wasn't that mad at it, does it? But is it a bit like Grand Theft Auto for Graffiti?"
00:22:11,00:22:14,"Not really. It's a really wholesome Graffiti game. Basically, it's about a youth who"
00:22:14,00:22:20,used the street art to take down a corrupt mayor who murdered his father. And then the mayor
00:22:20,00:22:25,launched as an anti-graffiti campaign to try and cover up the fact that he killed his kid's father.
00:22:25,00:22:30,"But the authorities thought, oh, this will encourage tagging and Graffiti, so they banned the game."
00:22:30,00:22:34,"It's like streetpictionary. They should call Graffiti, you know, that actually, and I think"
00:22:34,00:22:39,"people wouldn't get so much trouble. Is it Carcamboles? Yes, it's Carcamboles."
00:22:39,00:22:48,South Korea banned video games between midnight and 6am. It's a very short ban.
00:22:48,00:22:54,They woke up and they immediately repented. What are we thinking?
00:22:54,00:22:59,Back to the chamber before anyone finds out that we don't have them.
00:22:59,00:23:06,"What was it, midnight to 4am? Midnight to 6am every day. Every day you weren't allowed to play"
00:23:06,00:23:10,"a video games from midnight to 6am. And it was to combat the video gaming problem,"
00:23:10,00:23:14,which is kind of a thing in South Korea because a lot of people are addicted to it. It's called
00:23:14,00:23:18,"the shutdown law. And it was under 16, so you couldn't do it because they were staying up all night"
00:23:18,00:23:25,"and playing. But they've recently, sweetly, they amended it in 2014, and the law can be lifted"
00:23:25,00:23:29,"as per request of the children's parents. So I guess you call up the government and you say,"
00:23:29,00:23:35,"my kid's fine, he just needs it to concentrate. It just hasn't finished level 4 yet. He needs to finish it."
00:23:35,00:23:42,So I've got something here about porn star Ron Jeremy. It says that Nintendo bought the rights
00:23:42,00:23:47,"to two adult film parodies, Super Horny O Brothers and Super Horny O Brothers 2 in the hopes that they"
00:23:47,00:23:52,would never see the light of screen. So they made the movies. And they didn't make the movies.
00:23:52,00:23:58,"Well, the movies were made. Yeah. This is where these exist, but they were never really."
00:23:58,00:24:02,"Well, I do have the plots of Super Horny O Brothers, and it's shockingly unsexy. I'm not going to"
00:24:02,00:24:08,"read out the whole thing. But basically it stars Squeegee Hornyo, who's Ron Jeremy and his brother"
00:24:08,00:24:13,"Hornyo Hornyo, and they're trying to save Princess Polina from King Pooper."
00:24:14,00:24:18,"Well, my wife's called Polina. My pet name is Pooper. What was it?"
00:24:18,00:24:24,King Pooper. King Pooper. Your love interest is hornyo hornyo.
00:24:24,00:24:25,"Oh, hornyo hornyo, yeah. Yeah."
00:24:25,00:24:32,"Wow. Also on Nintendo, I learned that Nintendo was very close to releasing an accessory"
00:24:32,00:24:37,"and game that let players create their own knitting patterns. During its market research period,"
00:24:37,00:24:40,all seven of the beta test volunteers died of old age.
00:24:40,00:24:52,"Okay, on to the final fact, and that is Andy's facts."
00:24:52,00:24:57,My fact is that African wild dogs have a sneeze-based voting system.
00:24:57,00:25:03,"I swear to God. It doesn't sound particularly true, does it?"
00:25:03,00:25:08,"It doesn't, but researchers from Brown University have looked into this, and so African wild dogs,"
00:25:08,00:25:16,"they're a kind of dog they live, any guesses? No, in the wild. In Rua, they live in Africa,"
00:25:16,00:25:21,"Southern Africa, and they live in packs of between about 10 and 40 animals, and there are not"
00:25:21,00:25:25,"many left. There are only about 1,400 left in the wild. And basically, they have these,"
00:25:25,00:25:29,"what they call rallies, where they just spend all day sleeping. So, what they, the dogs call rallies?"
00:25:31,00:25:38,"They, the dogs, they call them, they, the dogs have what they, the researchers call rallies."
00:25:38,00:25:42,"Basically, it just means they spend all day sleeping next to each other, but"
00:25:42,00:25:51,"they get up after a while, and they sort of say, shall we go hunting? And they get up and sneeze,"
00:25:51,00:25:55,"and if the more sneezes there are, the likelihood is that the pack will go hunting."
00:25:55,00:26:00,"Wow. And it's then basically voting to do it. And also, different votes carry different"
00:26:00,00:26:06,"weight. So, every pack has an alpha pair who are in charge. If those two sneeze, it's much"
00:26:06,00:26:13,likelier that the pack will go off hunting than if two junior dogs sneeze. That is so weird.
00:26:13,00:26:19,"Yeah. Do they know, have any idea why they do this? To decide whether to go out and sneeze,"
00:26:19,00:26:24,"yeah, but they're wrong. Yeah, there are other ways of making noise. I guess, it's, yeah,"
00:26:24,00:26:29,"it's the option to limited when you're a dog. They can't bark, actually, can they? Come"
00:26:29,00:26:31,"in. Ah, there we go. I don't think so. They can kind of scream."
00:26:31,00:26:37,"That would be a very upsetting voting system. I don't know if you went into the voting vote,"
00:26:37,00:26:44,"if you had to just scream. I always do that. Oh my god, these guys are good. Especially the"
00:26:44,00:26:48,recent election. It's been a tough time. I always thought that sneezing was a thing that you
00:26:48,00:26:54,"did without doing it on purpose, as in you can't make yourself sneeze, you have to have some kind"
00:26:54,00:27:00,"of input. I think these guys can. Yeah. Yeah. That would make sense. I guess so. Otherwise, just"
00:27:00,00:27:04,like a little bit of pepper goes across the African plates. Yeah. Suddenly they're all
00:27:04,00:27:08,"off somewhere. Or never goes across and they all starve to death. Yeah. Where's the pepper, guys?"
00:27:08,00:27:15,"They're very cool animals. They're amazing. Yeah. So they're, they might be the nicest animals"
00:27:15,00:27:24,"that I've ever studied. They speak, somebody's not a zebra. They're very altruistic, aren't they?"
00:27:24,00:27:29,"So the way they operate is that they really care for each other. So for instance,"
00:27:29,00:27:34,"if a wild dog becomes ill or injured or gets older, the rest of the pack really cares for them and"
00:27:34,00:27:40,"will sacrifice a lot of food for them. And similarly, if there are a lot of young wild dogs around,"
00:27:40,00:27:45,"African wild dogs around, then the older members of the pack will bring them food and sacrifice"
00:27:45,00:27:50,food for them. And sometimes the older members of the pack will die prematurely because they've
00:27:50,00:27:56,starved themselves in order that younger members can thrive. And they regurgitate meat into each other's
00:27:56,00:28:02,"mouths throughout. So some animals do this to their young, they go in. So when they do it, they're"
00:28:02,00:28:11,"altruistic. And yeah, when I do that, I'm apparently a really creepy boyfriend. Your girlfriend's vegan."
00:28:13,00:28:20,It really is unfair. So they'll go and hunt and then they'll bring back some food in their stomachs
00:28:20,00:28:24,and then they'll vomit it up into their fellow pack members' mouths if the other pack members
00:28:24,00:28:30,"were just too lazy to hunt. We have previously mentioned, I think, that Buffalo vote"
00:28:30,00:28:37,with a sort of standing up and sitting down system. But loads of animals vote. Go on.
00:28:37,00:28:40,Cockroaches. Do they? How do they vote?
00:28:40,00:28:50,Mostly lived out. At least someone votes for them. At least when the whole of the planet is blown
00:28:50,00:28:55,"up by the nuclear war, the lived out will be the... They'll have a majority. Exactly."
00:28:55,00:29:03,"No, so they vote by movement. And there was a scientist called Jose Halloy from Brussels"
00:29:03,00:29:12,"and he did an experiment with robot cockroaches in 2007 and he made robot cockroaches, which would not"
00:29:12,00:29:15,what you think of robots with sort of implants in them as they started doing these days. He just made
00:29:15,00:29:21,"little machines which could move around. They just lot like cockroaches. No, they didn't even look"
00:29:21,00:29:26,"like cockroaches. So why are they called robot cockroaches? Because he covered them in paper, which"
00:29:26,00:29:32,was infused with robot a pheromone. He covered the paper infused with cockroach pheromones.
00:29:32,00:29:36,"So they smelt like cockroaches. Honestly, they look nothing like cockroaches. They're just"
00:29:36,00:29:41,little white boxes of wheels. And then so he infiltrated their society and got them to be accepted
00:29:41,00:29:49,"by the cockroaches, right? And then he managed to screw the cockroach election by moving all his robot"
00:29:49,00:29:55,cockroaches to the wrong place where they were going to build their home and they were all voting
00:29:55,00:29:59,"to build their home over here, even though the actual cockroaches are previously considered and"
00:29:59,00:30:02,"rejected that site. I tell you what, if the Kremlin they're listening to this."
00:30:02,00:30:11,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thanks so much for listening. If you want to get in touch"
00:30:11,00:30:17,"with any of us, these guys can be found on Twitter. James is on. At James Harkin. Alice is on. At Alice"
