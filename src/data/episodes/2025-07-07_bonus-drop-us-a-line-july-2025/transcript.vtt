00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.720
 - Hey, Club Fish members.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.320
 Welcome to your secret bonus bit of content.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.080
 We've got a compilation for you today.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.280
 This is the best of the outtakes

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.480
 of things that didn't make it to the main show.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.120
 It features me, James, Andy, and Anna,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.000
 but you've got some bonus voices joining us this week.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.800
 We've got Reese Darby, the brilliant Reese,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.600
 and of course, the excellent Miles Jump.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.480
 You will have heard them on recent episodes,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.160
 and this is all the stuff that didn't quite fit

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.120
 into the main episodes.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.800
 Oh, and quickly before we get into it,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.240
 just a quick thank you to everyone

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.680
 who came to the CrossWires Festival.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.160
 We had such a fun gig.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.600
 There was an awesome ending to it,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.040
 where we did a quiz with members from the audience.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.480
 It was just so much fun.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 So thank you everyone who came there.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.780
 Some people traveled all the way from America

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.440
 to come see the show.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.480
 Hope you enjoyed it.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.800
 And if anyone else wants to come and see us

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.240
 do another live show,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.000
 we're returning to the London Podcast Festival.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.080
 We're gonna be there on the 5th and 6th of September.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.640
 We've got a couple of great guests

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.480
 lined up to join us on stage.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.480
 Go to knowsuchthingasafish.com.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.800
 You'll find the links there.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.480
 Come and see us live.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.360
 And I believe that there's gonna be

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.960
 online streaming as well.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.480
 So if you are overseas and you wanna watch it,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.200
 do check it out and buy your tickets

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.560
 to watch it online as it happens live.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.200
 Last thing to mention is if you missed last week's,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.420
 drop us a line just to let you know

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.000
 that the price of club fish is going up by one pound.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.680
 So it is gonna be three pounds 99 going forward.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.880
 Hope that's okay with you all.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.840
 We promise that we're gonna continue

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.720
 to put out really fun formats.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.360
 So don't go anywhere.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.640
 And don't go anywhere right now.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.480
 'Cause here we go.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.600
 It's the compilation.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.120
 The four fishers recent miles on with the outtakes.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.720
 (upbeat music)

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.640
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:06.540
 There's a World War I connection

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.980
 as well as World War II connection in ugly,

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.740
 which is really cool actually.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.260
 So in World War I, there was an understandable fear

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.940
 that the Germans were gonna invade via Essex.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.300
 And a plan was drawn up to evacuate

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.580
 the whole of Essex to Oxfordshire.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.060
 1.4 million people.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.120
 I don't think they told the people of Oxfordshire,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.960
 but this plan--

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.800
 - Yeah, you wouldn't, would you?

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.780
 - You wouldn't mention it.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.860
 - There's gotta be some stuff happening.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.260
 Just don't worry about it.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.840
 - Just keep your doors shut.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.540
 But they all got these things from the council

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.500
 saying this is what to do.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.700
 - Councils have really diminished, haven't they?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.720
 Now they sometimes can't collect glass.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.340
 - Well, it's the underfunding, isn't it?

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.380
 We don't get the war warnings anymore.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.020
 And the information said,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.000
 when ugly church bells ring incessantly,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.920
 that's your sign, get out, go to Oxfordshire.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.380
 And they also, and they were told,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.820
 destroy all alcohol because if the Germans arrive

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.260
 and they're invading and they get drunk,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.580
 that's even worse than a sober invading Nazi,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.420
 which is quite weird.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.260
 - Really, that is weird.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.620
 'Cause it wasn't the Battle of Fishguard

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.820
 when the French came over in the 18th century.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.860
 The last time Britain was invaded at all, they arrived,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.940
 they all got drunk and couldn't do anything.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.180
 - Well, I think it's really on the fence.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.380
 Yes, will alcohol make the invaders worse or better?

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.380
 And maybe it depends on whether they're French or German.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.240
 - Oh, yeah, maybe.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.420
 - But anyway, it's really cool

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.080
 'cause everyone was given these evacuation routes

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.720
 and it meant you had to take all the back roads

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.840
 'cause the army would be using the main roads.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.000
 So they had these maps and there were arrows all over Essex,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.240
 painted on walls and trees and lamp posts

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.960
 and big white arrows showing people the way.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.640
 And the only remnant that remains now is in ugly.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.120
 There's a wall which just has now only the little plaque left

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.200
 saying this is where the big white arrow was saying,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.380
 get out of dodge.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.740
 - Imagine arriving as a Nazi going, where is everyone?

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.540
 And then seeing giant arrows pointing towards

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.000
 where you needed to go.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.500
 - We haven't got this through Winston.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.620
 Protestants have some good gear.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.140
 Like I was looking at Stanstead protests.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.740
 So there was a protest in Stanstead a few years ago

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.540
 over a bunch of migrants who were being sent away

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.940
 and that one of those taken in the dead of night,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.420
 stuck on a charter plane,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.100
 sent back to the country from which they'd come

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.640
 from a while ago.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.340
 Big protest about that.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.620
 But the way they did it was they formed a circle

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.460
 around the plane.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.960
 So they got bolt cutters, they got into Stanstead airport.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.900
 They formed a circle around the plane

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.280
 and they'd locked themselves in this circle

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.840
 by putting their arms in pipes filled with expanding foam

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.280
 and like attaching their arms to each other.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.880
 So I put my arm in one end of the type

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.520
 and he puts his arm in the other.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.360
 Well, you get it.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.200
 What is expanding foam?

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.300
 You know those Chinese finger traps

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.580
 that you put your fingers in

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.940
 but like a super big version of that.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.780
 Yeah, exactly.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.620
 It's a giant one of those.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.220
 What if I need a piss?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.700
 Well, you can't, you just have to go loose.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.260
 You can't hold your willy.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.580
 So sorry, you're in a big circle

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.360
 with your arms in the pipes or our fingers touching.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.060
 If you want them to be happy.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.980
 Possibly not.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.460
 I don't think they, I think you don't want them touching

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.460
 because you could have a wider circumference

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.540
 if you're not touching.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.380
 I guess so.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.220
 Oh yeah, true.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.140
 But what if I feel lonely or scared?

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.680
 And I do want to be holding hands with someone.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.680
 They're the sacrifices you make to save.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.120
 Someone else can't even help me have a piss

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.200
 'cause they've got their arms in the tube as well.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.800
 That's got to be, I've got it.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.120
 There's got to be an external agent

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.240
 who's free to go around helping people have a piss.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.720
 There was one piss helper, yes.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.400
 But all you need to do then is arrest the piss assistant

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.360
 and then the whole protest falls apart.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.120
 (laughing)

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.800
 Yeah, they all wet themselves and it's over.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.880
 That's how all protests tend.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.000
 I need the toilet, let's go.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 I've wet myself, all right, we're done for the day.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.020
 How did it end then?

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.260
 How did they actually untube them?

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.100
 They're still there.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.920
 They're still there.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.760
 Eight years.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.760
 That plane's stuck in the middle.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.180
 They tried to prosecute them on some,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.660
 actually anti-terrorism charges

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.980
 before I judge a couple of years later.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.220
 They said that's fucking ridiculous

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.420
 these guys aren't terrorists.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.900
 But they were extracted from the pipes first.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.140
 I don't think anyone's still walking around

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.660
 with the pipe attached to their arms.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.580
 (laughing)

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.060
 If you are writing, or you can't, probably.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.140
 (laughing)

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.820
 If your piss helper is free,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.680
 we ask if they can drop us a line.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.140
 (laughing)

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.280
 Is it Stanstead or Gatwick

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.160
 that's won the award for best toilet, like multiple years?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.360
 I can't be Stanstead.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.200
 No?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.500
 No, unless they're talking about the entire airport,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.480
 it's being the toilet.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.200
 Is it, can I ask that, is it an individual cubicle

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.560
 or is it a design of toilets?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.640
 No, no, it's the whole toilets, the cleanliness,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.680
 it's in the window as you go down into the toilets.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.680
 You know, you walked in and you go,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.520
 wow, about to pee.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.760
 Wait, there's a window as you go down?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.240
 Yeah, it's a little cabinet where they keep it.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.060
 You can see it.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.100
 Does your toilet not have a viewing window?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.940
 It should.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.900
 (laughing)

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.460
 Can I give you a music recommendation

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.980
 related to this fact?

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.900
 It's my favorite song I found recently.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.380
 So in 1978, I'm sure some listeners remember,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.580
 there was the big frequency change

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.540
 where all of the radio stations in the UK,

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.620
 all the big BBC ones,

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.060
 hopped to a different frequency

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.860
 because of EU regulations

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.220
 and no one had the internet then.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.980
 So it was like, how are they gonna know

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.040
 that their station is at a different frequency?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.440
 Especially given that, I believe Radio 3

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.120
 hopped to the frequency that used to be Radio 1.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.920
 So you'd tune in hoping for Tony Blackburn

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.120
 and you'd get, in certain name of famous Radio 3 presenter

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.920
 in the 1970s.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.480
 I honestly thought that Tony Blackburn

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.020
 was currently on Radio 3.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.320
 (laughing)

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.160
 He might be.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.000
 He might be.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.720
 And the only reason I know it's him is because

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.440
 one of the things they did to tell people was

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.280
 Tony Blackburn stayed at Radio 3

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.060
 for the day to tell people.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.340
 A bit like if you move house,

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.660
 you stay at the house that you've just moved out of.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.540
 So when your mates come around, you can go,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.860
 I don't live here anymore.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.420
 So if you tuned in, he'd be like,

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.540
 hello, it's me, Tony.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.900
 I'm not here anymore, though.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.940
 - That's not confusing at all.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.800
 - Go to the other station.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.900
 - Why can't they get someone else to say,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.380
 Tony doesn't live here anymore?

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.860
 If you want him, he's on Radio 1.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.220
 - He's just a dedicated guy.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.060
 - That's great.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.900
 That's so good.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.980
 - There was also this incredible song

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.140
 by the King singers who were very famous

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.680
 at the time, acapella group from King's College, Cambridge.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.920
 They released a single to help people remember

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.800
 all the new frequencies and you've got to look it up.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.880
 It's beautiful.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.640
 It starts just, I'll just give you the first line.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.440
 A new international agreement comes into effect

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.360
 and many of the frequencies used for the BBC

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.120
 will be changed at a time.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.920
 And it goes on like that.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.880
 - Is that the tune or have you just riffed that?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.560
 - It's a bit like that, you know?

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.160
 So it's like acapella church music.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.080
 - Wow.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.040
 - But it told everyone what frequencies to go to.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.700
 - I reckon 'cause it said at a time,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.180
 that was a really weird way of saying it,

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.540
 but the frequency for Radio 1 was 97 to 99.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.880
 So it was a rhyme if that was it.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.060
 - They were actually different frequencies at the time.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.760
 And so it's, and there wasn't that much rhyming in this,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.360
 I must say, much like a lot of Psalms.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.300
 - Do you remember the whole point of putting things

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.240
 in a song to help you remember?

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.400
 Did you make them rhyme?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.740
 - There's no way it makes it easier whatsoever.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.060
 - It's just a string of numbers,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.660
 sung by a bunch of choir boys.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:15.460
 - There were two, in fact, the world's only two

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.080
 female fighter pilot aces, which I think to be an ace,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.580
 you sort of had to shoot down five planes or more,

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.580
 vaguely varied.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.340
 But one of them was this woman called Lilia Litviak,

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.680
 who was in one of the other regiments

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.060
 that were flying for the Soviets in the Second World War.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.740
 And there was just an account where she recounted,

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.580
 and people who were in the same regiment as her recounted,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.340
 which sounds really fun, where she was in this dogfight

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.500
 with a German called Erwin Meyer,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.340
 and he'd shot down 12 planes before.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.660
 So he was well up there in ace territory.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.980
 And she defeated him really resoundingly.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.700
 And then it sounds like there's one of those nice moments

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.660
 where he came right down, but he was okay.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.140
 But he was like, who the hell defeats me?

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.540
 Introduce me to the man who just bested me.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.220
 And so they trotted him up.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.260
 Yeah, did you read about this?

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.540
 - No, I'm just excited.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.220
 - You just, yeah, go on.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.580
 - So he got shot down, but he landed okay.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.100
 - He landed okay, and that way people

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.500
 seemed to sometimes survive.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.060
 And demanded to be taken to the man who'd shot him down,

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.740
 and was furious. - So presumptuous.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.980
 - I know, I know.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.980
 - I just think you don't automatically get to meet

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.300
 the person who shot you down.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.300
 That's not, that's not my voice for you.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.140
 - What have you got to do?

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.140
 - So follow themselves.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.860
 - Yeah, he was pissed off.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.260
 He was introduced to a woman, he said,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.380
 bugger off guys, come on,

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.260
 where's the real guy, stop taking the piss.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.460
 - Very funny, okay, yeah.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.500
 - That happened to Mary Ellis,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.580
 who was another of the 88 girls.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.940
 She landed a Wellington bomber,

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.860
 which was like a huge plane at the time,

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.180
 at an RAF base.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.380
 And the staff said, oh, great, so where's the pilot?

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.900
 And she said, oh, I'm the pilot.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.780
 And they point blank, refused to believe it,

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.820
 to the extent of searching the plane,

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.380
 'cause they thought they were being pranked.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.700
 Like there's no way this small one--

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.820
 - And he also does that on like just normal domestic flights.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.980
 If it's a woman who comes up to Tammai,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.380
 he's like, come on, let's get the real one on.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.700
 - Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.060
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:02.900
 - And then to Laura's mortgage,

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.140
 she became a pilot after the war,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.980
 and she wasn't allowed to say,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.260
 this is your captain speaking.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.100
 - What?

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.940
 - Because people would freak out

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.460
 and presumably, you know,

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.180
 storm the cockpit or whatever.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.020
 - Yes.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.660
 - Can I just say, I'm never quite sure on aeroplanes though,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.220
 when they say this is your captain,

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.180
 I'm never sure if it's the person who's piloting

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.020
 the plane speaking,

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.340
 or the head of these steward and stewardessing staff.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.180
 - I think it's the captain.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.020
 - Yeah.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:23.860
 - This is the person piloting.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.260
 - When they say, this is the captain speaking,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.220
 generally speaking, it's the captain.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:28.780
 It's not the steward--

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.500
 - Unless they say, this is the captain of catering speaking.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.340
 (laughing)

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.100
 - You will receive your cups of tea very shortly.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.220
 I'm just texting at the moment to the airport actually.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.580
 - There's gonna be a little bit of turbulence

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.980
 on the trolley this afternoon,

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.860
 but we're gonna get your drinks to you.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.180
 - Yeah.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.940
 - Know who invented "Lost and Found" offices?

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.380
 - Is it someone famous?

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.220
 - Someone you've heard of.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.140
 - Conan Doyle, it's always Conan Doyle.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.380
 - Neither of those two,

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.260
 but it's someone more famous, in fact,

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.660
 than either of those two, I would say.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.220
 - Famous to Winston Churchill, Genghis Khan.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.060
 - Jesus.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.900
 - John Wayne.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.420
 - It was Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.260
 - Oh, that's a good one.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.340
 - Oh, wow.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.300
 - Sorry, Andy.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.260
 - Napoleon won?

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.100
 - Yeah.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.940
 - Cool.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.780
 - I can't remember what you're saying he invented now.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:07.620
 What, "Lost and Found"?

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.660
 - "Lost and Found", yeah.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.500
 - It's been so long.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.740
 - So part of his thing, like,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:14.260
 Napoleon was bringing everything to Paris kind of thing,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.100
 like centralizing the whole country.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:17.940
 And as part of that,

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.620
 he set up an office on the Île de Cité

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.980
 for lost objects, and it still exists.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:23.940
 - Cool.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.100
 - And they have a cabinet of curiosities

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.820
 that includes several human skulls,

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.140
 a wooden leg, and two chunks of masonry

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.780
 from the World Trade Center.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.620
 - Wow.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.460
 - Gosh.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.300
 - And can you believe that?

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.580
 - Well, that's somehow got lost there.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.420
 - Well, that's the thing with "Lost and Found",

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:40.940
 you don't know how it got there, right?

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.060
 - How do they know the masonry

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.180
 is from the World Trade Center?

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.740
 - There must be clues.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.700
 - They've properly analyzed that, wow.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.540
 - I guess so.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.380
 - That was amazing.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.220
 - Yeah.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.020
 - And the modern system there was organized

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.820
 by a guy called Louis Lapine,

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.780
 who was known as the little man with a big stick.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.540
 And he was a French policeman,

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.700
 and he was well known for sort of handling the crowds

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.460
 in Paris whenever there was riots and stuff.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.380
 But he was also famous for accusing

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.740
 friend of the podcast, Apollinaire,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.940
 of stealing the Mona Lisa.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.980
 Do you remember that story?

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.420
 - Yeah, I'm sure you're very familiar.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.220
 - Yes, this was episode 352.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.780
 That was a very good one.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.620
 - Mm-hmm, thank you.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.460
 - I enjoyed that.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.500
 I think I was driving from Patney.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.980
 (all laughing)

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.220
 - And had an accident.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.540
 It was very entertaining.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.500
 - But yeah, he was like really famous

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.260
 and really like well respected.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.340
 But when this Mona Lisa--

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.380
 - And a big stick.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.140
 - But you had a big stick, they had to respect him, yeah.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.660
 But when this Mona Lisa thing happened,

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.660
 he lost all of his credibility, really.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.500
 - Mm-hmm.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.340
 - The police officer, Lapine.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.900
 - They say when you've got with the Mona Lisa,

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.300
 'cause it's been stolen quite a few times,

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.100
 but every time,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.460
 doesn't matter where you're coming from to steal it,

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.500
 the painting can see you.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.580
 (all laughing)

00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.580
 - And this is actually a good hint.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.220
 The only way to get it without her seeing you

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.780
 is going from behind.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.020
 - Oh, mm-hmm, yeah.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.020
 - Through the wall.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:07.940
 (all laughing)

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.780
 - Don't take that advice out of context, please.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.360
 (all laughing)

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.980
 - Just on like early trends in general,

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.860
 have you heard about Railway Mad Men?

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.620
 - This was a--

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.460
 - Oh, was that spin-off?

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.300
 - Yeah.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.300
 (all laughing)

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.140
 - Yeah.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.720
 (all laughing)

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.180
 - What was that?

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.540
 - It was the opening theme.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.380
 - I was scared.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.780
 (all laughing)

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:38.620
 - This was the thing,

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.780
 like when trains were introduced and growing,

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.700
 there was Railway Mania,

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.860
 which was when everyone was just building trains,

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.980
 across the UK in particular,

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.580
 with no thought of whether they needed

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.900
 to be a train, basically.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.700
 - No, they got given huge subsidies

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.340
 for building train tracks and stuff.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.740
 - For a while, it was the most profitable thing you could do.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.820
 So people were just building mad little railways

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.340
 out everywhere, thousands of miles.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.500
 But Railway Mad Men was a different thing.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.540
 People were worried, you know,

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.740
 it's time of social change, blah, blah, blah.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.140
 And you were locked in the compartments,

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.060
 that was another thing.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.580
 So people really freaked out at the prospect of train travel,

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.940
 making people lose their wits,

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.580
 specifically men as well,

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.420
 and just go bananas and berserk, basically.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.260
 - Yeah, 'cause of the speed you were going?

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.540
 - 'Cause of the speed.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.660
 - Also, it enclosed in tunnels a lot.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.940
 I think that was a problem.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.060
 - There was a lot of, yeah,

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.940
 there's a historian called Amy Milne Smith,

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.180
 and she did a fantastic report on this,

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.740
 like a thesis about it.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.780
 So it was normal men who were completely fine,

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.620
 but it was partly all the stuff you said, James,

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.460
 and partly stress and overwork and anxiety of,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.900
 like just modern life, the modern condition,

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.980
 meant that, you know, in 1869,

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.940
 a gentleman suddenly took off all his clothing

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.940
 and leaned out of the windows

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.980
 of his carriage talking nonsense, you know.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.980
 And it was just apparently as soon as the train stopped,

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.820
 or they got off the train,

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.500
 they completely recovered their wits and they were fine.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.540
 It was literally the act of being on a moving train.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.260
 - Now, hang on, can I butt in with,

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.660
 is there anything to do with sitting backwards on a train?

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.500
 - Oh, don't know.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.020
 - 'Cause they looked into that scientific issue

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.860
 whereby it could drive you mad

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.020
 if you're always facing the wrong way

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.460
 and going in a certain direction.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.540
 - Yeah, I know hate going backwards on a train.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.380
 - Feel sick, yeah, yeah.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.220
 - Do you?

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.380
 - Yeah, none of you guys?

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.220
 - I love it.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.460
 - Well, yeah, I don't, I'm not a fan of it.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.940
 So I think it could be linked to

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.380
 a bit of madness that might come.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.220
 - I prefer it, I prefer sitting backwards on my--

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.060
 - Do you?

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:22.900
 - I actually prefer as well,

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.740
 'cause if you crash head on to something,

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.460
 then you have something to stop you from--

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.300
 - Oh, y'all crash theory.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.140
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:28.980
 And don't--

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.820
 - You're backwards crash theory.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.860
 - Yeah, yeah, that's interesting.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.740
 - So you think, James,

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.300
 that they should put all the seats in a car

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.140
 backwards presumably?

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.660
 - Well, I think I'm not the only person who thinks that.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:38.500
 - Really?

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.340
 - I mean, that is safer.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.580
 - Except the driver's seat presumably.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.900
 (laughing)

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.180
 - Just then all the cars reverse everywhere.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.340
 - Yeah, that's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.180
 You just lean around,

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.460
 your arm over the other seat,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.500
 you do that classic move.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.340
 - Yeah, it's fine. - It's fine.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.160
 - Nice, nice.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.660
 - Yeah, everyone would drive a lot more slowly.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.580
 - Yes. - I'm safer.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.900
 - Do you guys know a right-handed bazaar called

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.660
 Lasarusa, Talibula, Mina,

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.380
 Verleni, Vavaca, Bulaima,

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.900
 Kula, Kala, Kebalau?

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.740
 - Yes, of course.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.720
 - Yeah, I have his shirt,

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.020
 but it cuffs me a fortune to get his name on the pack.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.860
 (laughing)

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.700
 - I do know him.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.140
 - Is it a real name of someone we have heard of?

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.980
 - No, no, it's not.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.380
 It's just the longest cricketer's name ever,

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.060
 but he's just a Pacific cricketer from Fiji.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.460
 He sounds like a great guy, largely 'cause of his long name.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.660
 His surname means returned alive

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.580
 from Nankula Hospital at Lakemba Island in the Laugroup,

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.780
 which is easier to pronounce if you want to do it that way.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.580
 - Last members for the Laugroup, please.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.060
 Last members for the Laugroup.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.900
 (laughing)

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.460
 The bus is departing shortly.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.980
 - But yeah, he was great.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.860
 He used to, they played one international game,

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.860
 Fiji, against New Zealand in the 1940s and '50s,

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.540
 when he played and they made him serenade them

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.220
 with South Sea songs after the match,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.700
 which he did, a game, a man, I know.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.500
 - You know that it took 120 years

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.740
 after the invention of the cricket box

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.260
 to event the cricket helmet.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.620
 - Okay, well I suppose that shows

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.420
 where people's priorities lie, doesn't it?

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.940
 Would you agree with that?

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.220
 - I'd have thought, yeah, in terms of what you're keen on.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.540
 I suppose it, you've got a skull.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.100
 You don't have a penis skull.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.540
 - You don't have a genital exoskeleton.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.860
 - Exactly.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.700
 - Yes.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.700
 - We're hoping B's awesome, the guys can do something.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.540
 - It was 1850s.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.940
 - And the ball is generally going to be

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.740
 in the lower part of your body.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.220
 - Amidships, yes.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.220
 - Well, it's to do with how bouncy the surface is,

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.060
 as well, isn't it?

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.100
 These days, it's very bouncy

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.060
 because they're protected and stuff,

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.580
 but if it was open to the elements all the time,

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.380
 the bounce could be variable.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.740
 It's more likely to be lower and slower,

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.500
 so you'd be more likely to take one in the plums

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.340
 than in the noggin.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.660
 (laughing)

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.780
 - Yeah, about 1850s was the Palmer's patent groin protector,

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:54.620
 as it was called,

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.180
 before that you'd just stuff a hanky down there

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.580
 to sort of improvise it.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.060
 But it was only in the 1970s.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.100
 - Was your hanky made out of Kevlar or what?

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.420
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.300
 - If it's a very well-used hanky,

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.500
 I think that can actually...

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.740
 (laughing)

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.580
 - By some point.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.620
 - Well, it's hard to fold.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.460
 (laughing)

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.740
 A heavy head cold actually does protect you

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.300
 in unpredictable ways, yeah.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.700
 - I suppose then you could have a sort of use the same one

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.700
 as a kind of gumby hanky as the first crooked helmet.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.540
 (laughing)

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.980
 It's very sort of snappy hanky tied in each corner.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.700
 - Would you ever commentate on cricket?

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.540
 Well, have you done?

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.820
 - I think I have done online, just briefly.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.780
 Yeah, it's quite an awesome responsibility,

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.620
 to be perfectly honest.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.900
 If you're thinking other people can't see it,

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.860
 then I've really got to.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:36.700
 - Yeah.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:37.540
 - You know, a bit like when you said it,

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.380
 the drive in the left side,

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.220
 I can't see it over my left shoulder.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.660
 Can you tell me if there's anything coming down that hill?

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.500
 (laughing)

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.420
 It's that sort of pressure, but for hours.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.260
 (laughing)

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.100
 - It's days.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.820
 - You know, there could be several countries where,

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.620
 and I've got to describe what's going on.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.980
 I think it's more high pressure work

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.820
 than people imagine.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.180
 - I did read a description of what it's like

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.580
 commentating on something like Test Match Special.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.620
 I can't remember who it was who,

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.220
 well, like one of the famous commentators said,

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.540
 look, this is the apex of human civilization.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.500
 You are sitting observing a nice cricket match happening.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.220
 People are sending in homemade cakes to you,

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.260
 which you can then review on there

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.380
 during a lull in play, basically.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.980
 - That the whole play is a lull.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.100
 - Yeah, it's sort of breathing space.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.060
 It's not like commentating on tennis or something like that,

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.900
 which must be, you know, if you're a radio commentator

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.580
 for tennis, that's horse racing or whatever.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.580
 - Exactly, you know, your word per minute is just--

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.340
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.860
 But this is, he was saying, I think, I think it was a he,

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.420
 you are either, having to describe the immediate play,

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.100
 which like, if there's something going on,

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.020
 you need to explain that really clearly to the listener,

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.860
 like you was saying, Miles.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.660
 And then during the quieter bits,

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.700
 you're talking more about the overall shape of the game.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.780
 And during the really quiet bits,

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.460
 you start talking about the grounds

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.180
 and the whole history of cricket.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.540
 And so you've got three different modes

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.100
 that you can switch between depending on what's going on.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.180
 - Oh, you've got mode full,

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.060
 which is something completely unrelated.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.900
 Have you guys ever seen the clip of,

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.220
 it's the Australian commentator,

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.620
 and he tells the joke that ends,

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.380
 it's a knick-knack, paddy-whack, give the frog a loan?

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.740
 Right, look at Google.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.740
 - It's O'Keefe.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.740
 - It's O'Keefe, it's Kerio Keefe.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.140
 And he's, and I can't remember who he's commentating with,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.180
 but there's always a straight man

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.540
 who's actually commentating on the cricket,

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.980
 and then, you know, someone more jokey.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.220
 And he's trying to tell this very long joke.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.700
 And the other commentator is trying to get in the way

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.220
 and explain what's happening in the cricket.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.900
 - And then every two minutes, he says, "And there's no run."

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.700
 (all laughing)

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.060
 - That's where you use your elbow

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.860
 to test the temperature of bath water, for instance,

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.940
 rather than your fingers aren't actually very sensitive

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.260
 to people with their hands and go, "That's okay."

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.540
 But it's not actually...

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.660
 - I feel like my hands are sensitive to temperature.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.660
 I thought it was that your elbow

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.060
 is the bit of you that's most like a baby.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.980
 - 'Cause I always wear gloves when it's cold,

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.980
 I don't wear elbow patches, for instance.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:37.940
 - Oh, well, you should, Joe.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.660
 You lose so much heat through your elbows.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.180
 Yeah, yeah, but you're only,

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.660
 but also you're down the skate park a lot,

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.620
 with full protective equipment.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.820
 So they're elbow guards,

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.140
 you just don't think of them as gloves.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.980
 - Of course.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.700
 - What's the sport where it's two villages versus another

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.700
 and it is, there doesn't seem to be a limit on number,

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.260
 it is basically getting a ball from...

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.100
 - Yeah.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.940
 - There are two posts or something,

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:57.780
 and it's going from one to...

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.220
 - It's the oppies versus the downies,

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.620
 or it's the uppers versus the downers,

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.820
 and it's just like village football, really.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.660
 It's like old style.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.020
 - But there's no limit on numbers, are there?

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:05.860
 - No, no.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.300
 Well, I think these days, the police limit, who can go.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.380
 (all laughing)

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.220
 - Boo.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.060
 - Yeah.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.140
 - That's with, I mean, the sort of sports

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.700
 where there's a flexibility, like I didn't realise,

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.980
 lacrosse, there's a sort of set length,

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.500
 or parameters where they went to the length

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.500
 of the lacrosse pitch must be,

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.140
 but actually there is no side boundary

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.580
 that's entirely based on where you happen to be playing.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.420
 - Yeah.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.260
 - So you can set off running in one direction,

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.900
 and you can just keep going until there's an obstacle,

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.420
 essentially, that doesn't get out.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.260
 - Yeah, you know, yeah.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.100
 - We used to do that at school,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.340
 when I played football in the playground,

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.580
 you would have one goal,

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:38.100
 and you'd have two teams shooting towards the same goal,

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.900
 and you would just get someone who would get the ball

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.100
 and just run in the complete opposite direction

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.780
 with the ball, so everyone had to chase after them.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.620
 - It's quite long routes.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.380
 - 'Cause there's no boundaries.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.300
 - But that is true in official lacrosse rules.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.580
 I think it's just women's lacrosse.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.900
 Weirdly, I think men's lacrosse does have boundaries,

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:54.740
 but women's lacrosse--

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.700
 - Men need boundaries to explain to them.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.100
 - Wasn't it something about, like,

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.900
 the earliest games of lacrosse had an insane number of people?

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.300
 - The American Lacrosse Foundation claims

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.900
 the earliest games could have over 100,000 players.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.740
 - Stop it.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.140
 (laughing)

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.900
 - And try commentating on that.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.740
 - State of those changing rooms, as well.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.500
 (laughing)

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.980
 - It's like the handshake before the game is gonna take--

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.300
 (laughing)

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.580
 - It's a sort of roughy-toughy sport in America,

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.940
 I think, isn't it, lacrosse?

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.140
 We might associate lacrosse with girls' boarding school.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.980
 - Yeah, oh yeah.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.100
 - In America, they'd be surprised if men played rugby.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.100
 - Yeah, 'cause women's lacrosse and men's lacrosse

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.980
 are just different games, aren't they?

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.820
 They have different rules.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.660
 - Yeah, very different.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.500
 - Yeah, totally different.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.340
 - But you wouldn't hear phrases

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.180
 like roughy-toughy in the men's lacrosse

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.860
 that they play in America, for instance,

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.140
 whereas you might in the female boarding school

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.620
 lacrosse that you play here.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.140
 I've never heard roughy-toughy before.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.500
 - It might not exist as a phrase.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.820
 - Not a phrase, yeah.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.620
 - It might be some sort of post-surgery.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.460
 (laughing)

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.900
 Think you should have bubbled up to the surface.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.220
 - On animals, golden hamsters can navigate their way home,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.700
 even when blindfolded and led in a complicated route

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.900
 away from their nests.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.740
 - Can they?

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.540
 How do they do it, do we know?

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.260
 - No, I don't think we do know.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.380
 And it's really mysterious, isn't it?

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.220
 'Cause some of these senses are not,

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.340
 we don't fully understand.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.100
 So there's a thing called, what's it called,

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.180
 the reed warbler bird.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.020
 And scientists wanted to disrupt,

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.180
 they thought they must be using the Earth's magnetic field.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.780
 Okay, so we'll disrupt it.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.020
 So they attached small magnets

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.860
 to these birds' foreheads in an experiment,

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.660
 and they also blocked their view of the stars.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.580
 And, obviously, they couldn't navigate.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.420
 (laughing)

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.420
 I don't really know what that proves.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.540
 - I mean, you see, the homing pigeons,

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.460
 they used to use in the war to work out

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.540
 where sort of various ships were in things.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.020
 Because they'd have their homing instincts

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.460
 and they would know that they would fly

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.180
 at a very particular pace.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.820
 And they would know what time they were released.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.300
 And so therefore, in the angle

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.660
 from which they basically arrived,

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.860
 they could work out how far away from that distance.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:51.700
 - Really?

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.740
 - You'd work out the mass backwards.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.260
 So, right, they've arrived from over there.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.580
 They set off at this time, so they must be there for that.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.340
 - I usually travel 20 miles an hour.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.740
 - But how do they know where they set off from?

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.780
 'Cause they've got a note on them.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.780
 Or what time they set off?

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.540
 - Well, that information must be,

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.780
 yes, I was gonna say that must be radio,

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.820
 but then presumably the people were radioing

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.060
 and say where they were.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.980
 But maybe there's so many,

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.700
 maybe everything, any radio signal you send

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.140
 can be intercepted, but not.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:15.980
 - I'm not gonna tell you where we are,

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.780
 but it's 7.58 and I'm releasing the pigeons.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.580
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, make of that what you will.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:21.660
 (laughing)

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.900
 - Good luck with that, Hitler, yeah.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.100
 Oh dear, Keith has gone off on one.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.140
 (laughing)

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.140
 They were genuinely useful.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.300
 And they were sort of called up.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.460
 People that were sort of looked after pigeons

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.980
 would suddenly, they would hide him on for them.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.460
 - Yeah, suddenly went from being complete weirdo loners

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.500
 to very sought after people.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.820
 I'm so sorry.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.660
 - Oh my God.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.100
 - That's not how I feel about pigeon fancies, really.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.220
 - Half our audience are in the pigeon loft at the moment.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.060
 - I know.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:49.820
 I've got on satire, you know, Tatler,

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.140
 we're all subscribers.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.780
 - Of course, yeah.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.380
 - That was meant to be satirical.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.340
 (laughing)

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.540
 It was meant to be taking the piss.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:57.900
 - Can you explain what it is, sorry,

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.460
 for those of us who grew up in Bolton?

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.980
 - Sorry.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.580
 It's really not your area.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.540
 - It's not the world of interiors, but about people.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.980
 (laughing)

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.620
 - So yes, Tatler for International Listeners

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.900
 and anyone who's more civilized

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.900
 is basically a magazine for high society.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.300
 It's like photographs of people

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.740
 who aren't quite the royal family

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.180
 'cause they probably can't get access to them,

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.820
 but who are mates with the royal family having weddings.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.340
 - Is it Tatler that's got on the,

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.540
 it's sort of on the back page.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.780
 There's always like a, it's not a high street honey,

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.500
 but it's kind of a, it's like an eligible young lady

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.300
 who is engaged.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.300
 I think maybe that's it is like,

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.300
 look at this beautiful young woman.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.140
 She's just gone engaged.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.100
 You can't get together with her.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:36.940
 - Oh, right.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.780
 - Is that it?

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.620
 - Probably that's it.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.460
 - I mean, it doesn't sound like

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.300
 any other magazine would have that.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.260
 - Yeah, like Country Life has a sort of,

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.100
 - Yeah.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.140
 - Made in the month.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.820
 - Maybe it's Country Life, I'm thinking of that,

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.340
 but yes, it's a sort of an arty black and white photo.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.180
 - Yes.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.820
 - And sometimes I think it's like single and looking.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.660
 - Really?

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.260
 - And free, available in your area,

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.580
 all that kind of thing.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.700
 - This is the page three of--

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.260
 - Except it's page like 128

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.020
 'cause of all the adverts for posh watches in between.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.700
 - And it's a monthly publication.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.460
 So it doesn't work in the way that sort of Metro used to have

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.980
 I saw yesterday on the 802 Convox Law or something.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.060
 But it'd be like, I think I saw you back,

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.700
 it must have been about four months ago.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.060
 (all laughing)

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.500
 I think you admired my plowing.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.980
 (all laughing)

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:14.820
 - That's disgusting.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.660
 - My else.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.500
 (all laughing)

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.340
 - Rude of me.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.180
 Yeah.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.020
 (all laughing)

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:19.860
 - Yeah, so what about--

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:20.700
 - Anyway, well, oh yeah, sorry.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.620
 It was founded by a guy called Richard Steele,

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.340
 who called himself Isaac Bickerstaff when he edited Tatler.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.180
 And Isaac Bickerstaff, actually,

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.460
 you'll remember the name, James.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.700
 - I do know the name, but why?

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.060
 - It was because Jonathan Swift once published in 1708,

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.580
 so another great, the other great probably satirist

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.420
 of the time, published the Almanac Predictions of the Year

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.580
 writing as Isaac Bickerstaff.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.540
 And he predicted the death of this astrologer

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.580
 and society person called John Partridge.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.980
 And he predicted it on April the 1st.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.100
 It was an April Fool's joke.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.780
 And this poor guy, John Partridge,

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.380
 who was a bit of a butt of jokes,

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.740
 spent the rest of his life trying to convince people

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:57.820
 he wasn't dead.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.500
 And Norm was turned up.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.540
 And he wrote a letter saying, "I'm not dead."

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.420
 And Jonathan Swift said, "Well, that's a hoax,

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.900
 'cause he is, you know, I've seen the body made."

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.300
 - Oh, it was an unkind time.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.220
 A lot of sick burns being dished out all over the place.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.900
 Like saying, "One of the Irish are so hungry,

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.260
 "why don't they just eat their babies?"

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.100
 Which was during the famine.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.860
 And it was incredibly harsh satire.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.980
 - Imagine that, 'cause it sounds bad now,

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.100
 but in the middle of the famine, it's actually even worse.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:25.940
 - It was bad.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:26.780
 - It's pitch black satire.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.100
 - I kind of draw attention to the famine,

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.060
 and you know, the awful cruelty that has caused it.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.340
 But he's, you know, he's doing so through grief.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.860
 - These days, there's not enough nuance on Twitter

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:35.860
 for people to get that.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.340
 I don't think if he'd have done it today.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.260
 - It's been sort of foremost satirist of your time,

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.300
 just to be considered an edgelord,

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.860
 with the absolute sort of brute force.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.660
 It's nuanced for heavens sake.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.300
 - One of you try, we're doing down the people.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.020
 I want one of you to tweet something

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.100
 about a group of people eating babies today

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.340
 and see what happens to you.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.300
 - I'm not on Twitter.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.340
 - So one of you two.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.100
 - On Twitter, it'll go down a storm these days.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.100
 I can show you that.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.340
 (all laughing)

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.940
 - I could put it in a WhatsApp group.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.340
 (all laughing)

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.180
 - Just see.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.020
 - Yes.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.280
 - The Christmas one's gone quiet.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.660
 (all laughing)

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.900
 - Just out of the blue.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.380
 Oh, what's Mars up to?

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.220
 Oh.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.460
 - What are we thinking this year?

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.260
 - Another pseudonym, John Barron.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.460
 Do you know this one?

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.420
 - No. - John Barron, no.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.020
 - How do you know the name Barron?

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:22.860
 - Barron.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.140
 - Is it Barron, or Barron, like, childless?

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.620
 B-A-D-R-O-N.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.460
 - The Barron Knights.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.940
 - Who's a famous Barron these days.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:29.780
 - Barron Trump.

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:30.620
 - Yes.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.940
 So Donald Trump's pseudonym, John Barron.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.700
 So when Forbes were doing the richest people list,

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.140
 John Barron wrote to them saying,

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.420
 oh, you've got to put Trump in here.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.700
 He's a billionaire.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:42.540
 - No.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.860
 - Yeah, and he's got a few others.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.140
 There's a guy called John Miller,

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.140
 who once wrote to People magazine

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.140
 who'd said something about Trump saying,

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.740
 "Actually, Trump is a very compassionate husband,

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.260
 and lots of beautiful women

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.780
 are always asking to go out with him.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.980
 In fact, Madonna called and wanted to go out with him.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.500
 That, I could tell you."

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.380
 - But what makes you think that's one of his pseudonyms?

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.260
 - We, it came out in court later.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:05.100
 (laughing)

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.620
 - Oh, that's devastating, mate.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:13.460
 - Okay, that's it.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.420
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.540
 If you have anything to say about them,

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.500
 if you want to share any extra juicy bits of detail

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.420
 that you know about them,

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.260
 you can message us on podcast@qi.com.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.020
 Those emails go through to Andy,

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.700
 and a lot of those emails then get taken over

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.580
 to Drop Us a Line where we discuss them.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.700
 So send us your favorite facts, send us an anecdote,

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.340
 send us anything that you think is worth sharing,

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.620
 and hopefully it can make it onto Drop Us a Line.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.820
 Just a reminder, no such thing as a fish.com.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.020
 You got the ticket link for all of our upcoming gigs,

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.100
 and two in particular,

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.620
 which is the London Podcast Festival

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.540
 that's gonna be happening near King's Cross at King's Place,

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.220
 and that is the 5th and 6th of September.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.380
 So get your tickets now, and that's it.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.460
 We're gonna be back again with another episode

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.860
 in a fortnight's time.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.100
 We'll see you then.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:01.940
 Goodbye.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.640
 (upbeat music)

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.220
 (upbeat music)

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.800
 (upbeat music)
