1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,720
 - Hey, Club Fish members.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,320
 Welcome to your secret bonus bit of content.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,080
 We've got a compilation for you today.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,280
 This is the best of the outtakes

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,480
 of things that didn't make it to the main show.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,120
 It features me, James, Andy, and Anna,

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,000
 but you've got some bonus voices joining us this week.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,800
 We've got Reese Darby, the brilliant Reese,

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,600
 and of course, the excellent Miles Jump.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,480
 You will have heard them on recent episodes,

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,160
 and this is all the stuff that didn't quite fit

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,120
 into the main episodes.

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,800
 Oh, and quickly before we get into it,

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,240
 just a quick thank you to everyone

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,680
 who came to the CrossWires Festival.

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,160
 We had such a fun gig.

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,600
 There was an awesome ending to it,

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,040
 where we did a quiz with members from the audience.

20
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,480
 It was just so much fun.

21
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,480
 So thank you everyone who came there.

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,780
 Some people traveled all the way from America

23
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,440
 to come see the show.

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,480
 Hope you enjoyed it.

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,800
 And if anyone else wants to come and see us

26
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,240
 do another live show,

27
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,000
 we're returning to the London Podcast Festival.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,080
 We're gonna be there on the 5th and 6th of September.

29
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,640
 We've got a couple of great guests

30
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,480
 lined up to join us on stage.

31
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,480
 Go to knowsuchthingasafish.com.

32
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,800
 You'll find the links there.

33
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,480
 Come and see us live.

34
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,360
 And I believe that there's gonna be

35
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,960
 online streaming as well.

36
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,480
 So if you are overseas and you wanna watch it,

37
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,200
 do check it out and buy your tickets

38
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,560
 to watch it online as it happens live.

39
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,200
 Last thing to mention is if you missed last week's,

40
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,420
 drop us a line just to let you know

41
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,000
 that the price of club fish is going up by one pound.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,680
 So it is gonna be three pounds 99 going forward.

43
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,880
 Hope that's okay with you all.

44
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,840
 We promise that we're gonna continue

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,720
 to put out really fun formats.

46
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,360
 So don't go anywhere.

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,640
 And don't go anywhere right now.

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,480
 'Cause here we go.

49
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,600
 It's the compilation.

50
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,120
 The four fishers recent miles on with the outtakes.

51
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,720
 (upbeat music)

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:06,540
 There's a World War I connection

54
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,980
 as well as World War II connection in ugly,

55
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,740
 which is really cool actually.

56
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,260
 So in World War I, there was an understandable fear

57
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,940
 that the Germans were gonna invade via Essex.

58
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,300
 And a plan was drawn up to evacuate

59
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,580
 the whole of Essex to Oxfordshire.

60
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,060
 1.4 million people.

61
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,120
 I don't think they told the people of Oxfordshire,

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,960
 but this plan--

63
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
 - Yeah, you wouldn't, would you?

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,780
 - You wouldn't mention it.

65
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,860
 - There's gotta be some stuff happening.

66
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,260
 Just don't worry about it.

67
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,840
 - Just keep your doors shut.

68
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,540
 But they all got these things from the council

69
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,500
 saying this is what to do.

70
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,700
 - Councils have really diminished, haven't they?

71
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,720
 Now they sometimes can't collect glass.

72
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,340
 - Well, it's the underfunding, isn't it?

73
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,380
 We don't get the war warnings anymore.

74
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,020
 And the information said,

75
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,000
 when ugly church bells ring incessantly,

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,920
 that's your sign, get out, go to Oxfordshire.

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,380
 And they also, and they were told,

78
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,820
 destroy all alcohol because if the Germans arrive

79
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,260
 and they're invading and they get drunk,

80
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,580
 that's even worse than a sober invading Nazi,

81
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,420
 which is quite weird.

82
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,260
 - Really, that is weird.

83
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,620
 'Cause it wasn't the Battle of Fishguard

84
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,820
 when the French came over in the 18th century.

85
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,860
 The last time Britain was invaded at all, they arrived,

86
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,940
 they all got drunk and couldn't do anything.

87
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,180
 - Well, I think it's really on the fence.

88
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,380
 Yes, will alcohol make the invaders worse or better?

89
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,380
 And maybe it depends on whether they're French or German.

90
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,240
 - Oh, yeah, maybe.

91
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,420
 - But anyway, it's really cool

92
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,080
 'cause everyone was given these evacuation routes

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,720
 and it meant you had to take all the back roads

94
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,840
 'cause the army would be using the main roads.

95
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,000
 So they had these maps and there were arrows all over Essex,

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,240
 painted on walls and trees and lamp posts

97
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,960
 and big white arrows showing people the way.

98
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,640
 And the only remnant that remains now is in ugly.

99
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,120
 There's a wall which just has now only the little plaque left

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,200
 saying this is where the big white arrow was saying,

101
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,380
 get out of dodge.

102
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,740
 - Imagine arriving as a Nazi going, where is everyone?

103
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,540
 And then seeing giant arrows pointing towards

104
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,000
 where you needed to go.

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,500
 - We haven't got this through Winston.

106
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,620
 Protestants have some good gear.

107
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,140
 Like I was looking at Stanstead protests.

108
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,740
 So there was a protest in Stanstead a few years ago

109
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,540
 over a bunch of migrants who were being sent away

110
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,940
 and that one of those taken in the dead of night,

111
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,420
 stuck on a charter plane,

112
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,100
 sent back to the country from which they'd come

113
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,640
 from a while ago.

114
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,340
 Big protest about that.

115
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,620
 But the way they did it was they formed a circle

116
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,460
 around the plane.

117
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,960
 So they got bolt cutters, they got into Stanstead airport.

118
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,900
 They formed a circle around the plane

119
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,280
 and they'd locked themselves in this circle

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,840
 by putting their arms in pipes filled with expanding foam

121
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,280
 and like attaching their arms to each other.

122
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,880
 So I put my arm in one end of the type

123
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,520
 and he puts his arm in the other.

124
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,360
 Well, you get it.

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,200
 What is expanding foam?

126
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,300
 You know those Chinese finger traps

127
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,580
 that you put your fingers in

128
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,940
 but like a super big version of that.

129
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,780
 Yeah, exactly.

130
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,620
 It's a giant one of those.

131
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,220
 What if I need a piss?

132
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,700
 Well, you can't, you just have to go loose.

133
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,260
 You can't hold your willy.

134
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,580
 So sorry, you're in a big circle

135
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,360
 with your arms in the pipes or our fingers touching.

136
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,060
 If you want them to be happy.

137
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,980
 Possibly not.

138
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,460
 I don't think they, I think you don't want them touching

139
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
 because you could have a wider circumference

140
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,540
 if you're not touching.

141
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,380
 I guess so.

142
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,220
 Oh yeah, true.

143
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,140
 But what if I feel lonely or scared?

144
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,680
 And I do want to be holding hands with someone.

145
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
 They're the sacrifices you make to save.

146
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,120
 Someone else can't even help me have a piss

147
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,200
 'cause they've got their arms in the tube as well.

148
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,800
 That's got to be, I've got it.

149
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,120
 There's got to be an external agent

150
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,240
 who's free to go around helping people have a piss.

151
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,720
 There was one piss helper, yes.

152
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,400
 But all you need to do then is arrest the piss assistant

153
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,360
 and then the whole protest falls apart.

154
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
 (laughing)

155
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,800
 Yeah, they all wet themselves and it's over.

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,880
 That's how all protests tend.

157
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,000
 I need the toilet, let's go.

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I've wet myself, all right, we're done for the day.

159
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,020
 How did it end then?

160
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,260
 How did they actually untube them?

161
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,100
 They're still there.

162
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,920
 They're still there.

163
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,760
 Eight years.

164
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
 That plane's stuck in the middle.

165
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,180
 They tried to prosecute them on some,

166
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,660
 actually anti-terrorism charges

167
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,980
 before I judge a couple of years later.

168
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,220
 They said that's fucking ridiculous

169
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,420
 these guys aren't terrorists.

170
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,900
 But they were extracted from the pipes first.

171
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,140
 I don't think anyone's still walking around

172
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,660
 with the pipe attached to their arms.

173
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,580
 (laughing)

174
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,060
 If you are writing, or you can't, probably.

175
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,140
 (laughing)

176
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,820
 If your piss helper is free,

177
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,680
 we ask if they can drop us a line.

178
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,140
 (laughing)

179
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,280
 Is it Stanstead or Gatwick

180
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,160
 that's won the award for best toilet, like multiple years?

181
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
 I can't be Stanstead.

182
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,200
 No?

183
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,500
 No, unless they're talking about the entire airport,

184
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,480
 it's being the toilet.

185
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,200
 Is it, can I ask that, is it an individual cubicle

186
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,560
 or is it a design of toilets?

187
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,640
 No, no, it's the whole toilets, the cleanliness,

188
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,680
 it's in the window as you go down into the toilets.

189
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
 You know, you walked in and you go,

190
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,520
 wow, about to pee.

191
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,760
 Wait, there's a window as you go down?

192
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,240
 Yeah, it's a little cabinet where they keep it.

193
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,060
 You can see it.

194
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,100
 Does your toilet not have a viewing window?

195
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,940
 It should.

196
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,900
 (laughing)

197
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,460
 Can I give you a music recommendation

198
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,980
 related to this fact?

199
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,900
 It's my favorite song I found recently.

200
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,380
 So in 1978, I'm sure some listeners remember,

201
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,580
 there was the big frequency change

202
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,540
 where all of the radio stations in the UK,

203
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,620
 all the big BBC ones,

204
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,060
 hopped to a different frequency

205
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,860
 because of EU regulations

206
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,220
 and no one had the internet then.

207
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,980
 So it was like, how are they gonna know

208
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,040
 that their station is at a different frequency?

209
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,440
 Especially given that, I believe Radio 3

210
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,120
 hopped to the frequency that used to be Radio 1.

211
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,920
 So you'd tune in hoping for Tony Blackburn

212
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,120
 and you'd get, in certain name of famous Radio 3 presenter

213
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,920
 in the 1970s.

214
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
 I honestly thought that Tony Blackburn

215
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,020
 was currently on Radio 3.

216
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,320
 (laughing)

217
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,160
 He might be.

218
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,000
 He might be.

219
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,720
 And the only reason I know it's him is because

220
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,440
 one of the things they did to tell people was

221
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,280
 Tony Blackburn stayed at Radio 3

222
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,060
 for the day to tell people.

223
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,340
 A bit like if you move house,

224
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,660
 you stay at the house that you've just moved out of.

225
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,540
 So when your mates come around, you can go,

226
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,860
 I don't live here anymore.

227
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,420
 So if you tuned in, he'd be like,

228
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,540
 hello, it's me, Tony.

229
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,900
 I'm not here anymore, though.

230
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,940
 - That's not confusing at all.

231
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,800
 - Go to the other station.

232
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,900
 - Why can't they get someone else to say,

233
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,380
 Tony doesn't live here anymore?

234
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,860
 If you want him, he's on Radio 1.

235
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,220
 - He's just a dedicated guy.

236
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,060
 - That's great.

237
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,900
 That's so good.

238
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,980
 - There was also this incredible song

239
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,140
 by the King singers who were very famous

240
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,680
 at the time, acapella group from King's College, Cambridge.

241
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,920
 They released a single to help people remember

242
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,800
 all the new frequencies and you've got to look it up.

243
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,880
 It's beautiful.

244
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,640
 It starts just, I'll just give you the first line.

245
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,440
 A new international agreement comes into effect

246
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,360
 and many of the frequencies used for the BBC

247
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,120
 will be changed at a time.

248
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,920
 And it goes on like that.

249
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,880
 - Is that the tune or have you just riffed that?

250
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,560
 - It's a bit like that, you know?

251
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,160
 So it's like acapella church music.

252
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,080
 - Wow.

253
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,040
 - But it told everyone what frequencies to go to.

254
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,700
 - I reckon 'cause it said at a time,

255
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,180
 that was a really weird way of saying it,

256
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,540
 but the frequency for Radio 1 was 97 to 99.

257
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,880
 So it was a rhyme if that was it.

258
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,060
 - They were actually different frequencies at the time.

259
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,760
 And so it's, and there wasn't that much rhyming in this,

260
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,360
 I must say, much like a lot of Psalms.

261
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,300
 - Do you remember the whole point of putting things

262
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,240
 in a song to help you remember?

263
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,400
 Did you make them rhyme?

264
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,740
 - There's no way it makes it easier whatsoever.

265
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,060
 - It's just a string of numbers,

266
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,660
 sung by a bunch of choir boys.

267
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,460
 - There were two, in fact, the world's only two

268
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,080
 female fighter pilot aces, which I think to be an ace,

269
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,580
 you sort of had to shoot down five planes or more,

270
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,580
 vaguely varied.

271
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,340
 But one of them was this woman called Lilia Litviak,

272
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,680
 who was in one of the other regiments

273
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,060
 that were flying for the Soviets in the Second World War.

274
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,740
 And there was just an account where she recounted,

275
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,580
 and people who were in the same regiment as her recounted,

276
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,340
 which sounds really fun, where she was in this dogfight

277
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,500
 with a German called Erwin Meyer,

278
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,340
 and he'd shot down 12 planes before.

279
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,660
 So he was well up there in ace territory.

280
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,980
 And she defeated him really resoundingly.

281
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,700
 And then it sounds like there's one of those nice moments

282
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,660
 where he came right down, but he was okay.

283
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,140
 But he was like, who the hell defeats me?

284
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,540
 Introduce me to the man who just bested me.

285
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,220
 And so they trotted him up.

286
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,260
 Yeah, did you read about this?

287
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,540
 - No, I'm just excited.

288
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,220
 - You just, yeah, go on.

289
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,580
 - So he got shot down, but he landed okay.

290
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,100
 - He landed okay, and that way people

291
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,500
 seemed to sometimes survive.

292
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,060
 And demanded to be taken to the man who'd shot him down,

293
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,740
 and was furious. - So presumptuous.

294
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,980
 - I know, I know.

295
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,980
 - I just think you don't automatically get to meet

296
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,300
 the person who shot you down.

297
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,300
 That's not, that's not my voice for you.

298
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,140
 - What have you got to do?

299
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,140
 - So follow themselves.

300
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,860
 - Yeah, he was pissed off.

301
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,260
 He was introduced to a woman, he said,

302
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,380
 bugger off guys, come on,

303
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,260
 where's the real guy, stop taking the piss.

304
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,460
 - Very funny, okay, yeah.

305
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,500
 - That happened to Mary Ellis,

306
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,580
 who was another of the 88 girls.

307
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,940
 She landed a Wellington bomber,

308
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,860
 which was like a huge plane at the time,

309
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,180
 at an RAF base.

310
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,380
 And the staff said, oh, great, so where's the pilot?

311
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,900
 And she said, oh, I'm the pilot.

312
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,780
 And they point blank, refused to believe it,

313
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,820
 to the extent of searching the plane,

314
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,380
 'cause they thought they were being pranked.

315
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,700
 Like there's no way this small one--

316
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,820
 - And he also does that on like just normal domestic flights.

317
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,980
 If it's a woman who comes up to Tammai,

318
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,380
 he's like, come on, let's get the real one on.

319
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,700
 - Ha, ha, ha, ha.

320
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,060
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

321
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,900
 - And then to Laura's mortgage,

322
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,140
 she became a pilot after the war,

323
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,980
 and she wasn't allowed to say,

324
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,260
 this is your captain speaking.

325
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,100
 - What?

326
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,940
 - Because people would freak out

327
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,460
 and presumably, you know,

328
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,180
 storm the cockpit or whatever.

329
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,020
 - Yes.

330
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,660
 - Can I just say, I'm never quite sure on aeroplanes though,

331
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,220
 when they say this is your captain,

332
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,180
 I'm never sure if it's the person who's piloting

333
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,020
 the plane speaking,

334
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,340
 or the head of these steward and stewardessing staff.

335
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,180
 - I think it's the captain.

336
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,020
 - Yeah.

337
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,860
 - This is the person piloting.

338
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,260
 - When they say, this is the captain speaking,

339
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,220
 generally speaking, it's the captain.

340
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,780
 It's not the steward--

341
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,500
 - Unless they say, this is the captain of catering speaking.

342
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,340
 (laughing)

343
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,100
 - You will receive your cups of tea very shortly.

344
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,220
 I'm just texting at the moment to the airport actually.

345
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,580
 - There's gonna be a little bit of turbulence

346
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,980
 on the trolley this afternoon,

347
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,860
 but we're gonna get your drinks to you.

348
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,180
 - Yeah.

349
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,940
 - Know who invented "Lost and Found" offices?

350
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,380
 - Is it someone famous?

351
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,220
 - Someone you've heard of.

352
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,140
 - Conan Doyle, it's always Conan Doyle.

353
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,380
 - Neither of those two,

354
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,260
 but it's someone more famous, in fact,

355
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,660
 than either of those two, I would say.

356
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,220
 - Famous to Winston Churchill, Genghis Khan.

357
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,060
 - Jesus.

358
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,900
 - John Wayne.

359
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,420
 - It was Napoleon Bonaparte.

360
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,260
 - Oh, that's a good one.

361
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,340
 - Oh, wow.

362
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,300
 - Sorry, Andy.

363
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,260
 - Napoleon won?

364
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,100
 - Yeah.

365
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,940
 - Cool.

366
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,780
 - I can't remember what you're saying he invented now.

367
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,620
 What, "Lost and Found"?

368
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,660
 - "Lost and Found", yeah.

369
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,500
 - It's been so long.

370
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,740
 - So part of his thing, like,

371
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,260
 Napoleon was bringing everything to Paris kind of thing,

372
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,100
 like centralizing the whole country.

373
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,940
 And as part of that,

374
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,620
 he set up an office on the Île de Cité

375
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,980
 for lost objects, and it still exists.

376
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,940
 - Cool.

377
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,100
 - And they have a cabinet of curiosities

378
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,820
 that includes several human skulls,

379
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,140
 a wooden leg, and two chunks of masonry

380
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,780
 from the World Trade Center.

381
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,620
 - Wow.

382
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,460
 - Gosh.

383
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,300
 - And can you believe that?

384
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,580
 - Well, that's somehow got lost there.

385
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,420
 - Well, that's the thing with "Lost and Found",

386
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,940
 you don't know how it got there, right?

387
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,060
 - How do they know the masonry

388
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,180
 is from the World Trade Center?

389
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,740
 - There must be clues.

390
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,700
 - They've properly analyzed that, wow.

391
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,540
 - I guess so.

392
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,380
 - That was amazing.

393
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,220
 - Yeah.

394
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,020
 - And the modern system there was organized

395
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,820
 by a guy called Louis Lapine,

396
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,780
 who was known as the little man with a big stick.

397
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,540
 And he was a French policeman,

398
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,700
 and he was well known for sort of handling the crowds

399
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,460
 in Paris whenever there was riots and stuff.

400
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,380
 But he was also famous for accusing

401
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,740
 friend of the podcast, Apollinaire,

402
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,940
 of stealing the Mona Lisa.

403
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,980
 Do you remember that story?

404
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,420
 - Yeah, I'm sure you're very familiar.

405
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,220
 - Yes, this was episode 352.

406
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,780
 That was a very good one.

407
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,620
 - Mm-hmm, thank you.

408
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,460
 - I enjoyed that.

409
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,500
 I think I was driving from Patney.

410
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,980
 (all laughing)

411
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,220
 - And had an accident.

412
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,540
 It was very entertaining.

413
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,500
 - But yeah, he was like really famous

414
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,260
 and really like well respected.

415
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,340
 But when this Mona Lisa--

416
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,380
 - And a big stick.

417
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,140
 - But you had a big stick, they had to respect him, yeah.

418
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,660
 But when this Mona Lisa thing happened,

419
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,660
 he lost all of his credibility, really.

420
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,500
 - Mm-hmm.

421
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,340
 - The police officer, Lapine.

422
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

423
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,900
 - They say when you've got with the Mona Lisa,

424
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,300
 'cause it's been stolen quite a few times,

425
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,100
 but every time,

426
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,460
 doesn't matter where you're coming from to steal it,

427
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,500
 the painting can see you.

428
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,580
 (all laughing)

429
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,580
 - And this is actually a good hint.

430
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,220
 The only way to get it without her seeing you

431
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,780
 is going from behind.

432
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,020
 - Oh, mm-hmm, yeah.

433
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,020
 - Through the wall.

434
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,940
 (all laughing)

435
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,780
 - Don't take that advice out of context, please.

436
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,360
 (all laughing)

437
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,980
 - Just on like early trends in general,

438
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,860
 have you heard about Railway Mad Men?

439
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,620
 - This was a--

440
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,460
 - Oh, was that spin-off?

441
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,300
 - Yeah.

442
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
 (all laughing)

443
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,140
 - Yeah.

444
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,720
 (all laughing)

445
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,180
 - What was that?

446
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,540
 - It was the opening theme.

447
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,380
 - I was scared.

448
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,780
 (all laughing)

449
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,620
 - This was the thing,

450
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,780
 like when trains were introduced and growing,

451
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,700
 there was Railway Mania,

452
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,860
 which was when everyone was just building trains,

453
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,980
 across the UK in particular,

454
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,580
 with no thought of whether they needed

455
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,900
 to be a train, basically.

456
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,700
 - No, they got given huge subsidies

457
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,340
 for building train tracks and stuff.

458
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,740
 - For a while, it was the most profitable thing you could do.

459
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,820
 So people were just building mad little railways

460
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,340
 out everywhere, thousands of miles.

461
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,500
 But Railway Mad Men was a different thing.

462
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,540
 People were worried, you know,

463
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,740
 it's time of social change, blah, blah, blah.

464
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,140
 And you were locked in the compartments,

465
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,060
 that was another thing.

466
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,580
 So people really freaked out at the prospect of train travel,

467
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,940
 making people lose their wits,

468
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,580
 specifically men as well,

469
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,420
 and just go bananas and berserk, basically.

470
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,260
 - Yeah, 'cause of the speed you were going?

471
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,540
 - 'Cause of the speed.

472
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,660
 - Also, it enclosed in tunnels a lot.

473
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,940
 I think that was a problem.

474
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,060
 - There was a lot of, yeah,

475
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,940
 there's a historian called Amy Milne Smith,

476
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,180
 and she did a fantastic report on this,

477
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,740
 like a thesis about it.

478
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,780
 So it was normal men who were completely fine,

479
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,620
 but it was partly all the stuff you said, James,

480
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,460
 and partly stress and overwork and anxiety of,

481
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,900
 like just modern life, the modern condition,

482
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,980
 meant that, you know, in 1869,

483
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,940
 a gentleman suddenly took off all his clothing

484
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,940
 and leaned out of the windows

485
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,980
 of his carriage talking nonsense, you know.

486
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,980
 And it was just apparently as soon as the train stopped,

487
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,820
 or they got off the train,

488
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,500
 they completely recovered their wits and they were fine.

489
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,540
 It was literally the act of being on a moving train.

490
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,260
 - Now, hang on, can I butt in with,

491
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,660
 is there anything to do with sitting backwards on a train?

492
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,500
 - Oh, don't know.

493
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,020
 - 'Cause they looked into that scientific issue

494
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,860
 whereby it could drive you mad

495
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,020
 if you're always facing the wrong way

496
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,460
 and going in a certain direction.

497
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,540
 - Yeah, I know hate going backwards on a train.

498
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,380
 - Feel sick, yeah, yeah.

499
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,220
 - Do you?

500
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,380
 - Yeah, none of you guys?

501
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,220
 - I love it.

502
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,460
 - Well, yeah, I don't, I'm not a fan of it.

503
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,940
 So I think it could be linked to

504
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,380
 a bit of madness that might come.

505
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,220
 - I prefer it, I prefer sitting backwards on my--

506
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,060
 - Do you?

507
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,900
 - I actually prefer as well,

508
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,740
 'cause if you crash head on to something,

509
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,460
 then you have something to stop you from--

510
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,300
 - Oh, y'all crash theory.

511
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,140
 - Yeah, yeah.

512
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,980
 And don't--

513
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,820
 - You're backwards crash theory.

514
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,860
 - Yeah, yeah, that's interesting.

515
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,740
 - So you think, James,

516
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,300
 that they should put all the seats in a car

517
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,140
 backwards presumably?

518
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,660
 - Well, I think I'm not the only person who thinks that.

519
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,500
 - Really?

520
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,340
 - I mean, that is safer.

521
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,580
 - Except the driver's seat presumably.

522
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,900
 (laughing)

523
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,180
 - Just then all the cars reverse everywhere.

524
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,340
 - Yeah, that's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

525
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,180
 You just lean around,

526
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,460
 your arm over the other seat,

527
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,500
 you do that classic move.

528
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,340
 - Yeah, it's fine. - It's fine.

529
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,160
 - Nice, nice.

530
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,660
 - Yeah, everyone would drive a lot more slowly.

531
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,580
 - Yes. - I'm safer.

532
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,900
 - Do you guys know a right-handed bazaar called

533
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,660
 Lasarusa, Talibula, Mina,

534
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,380
 Verleni, Vavaca, Bulaima,

535
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,900
 Kula, Kala, Kebalau?

536
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,740
 - Yes, of course.

537
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,720
 - Yeah, I have his shirt,

538
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,020
 but it cuffs me a fortune to get his name on the pack.

539
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,860
 (laughing)

540
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,700
 - I do know him.

541
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,140
 - Is it a real name of someone we have heard of?

542
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,980
 - No, no, it's not.

543
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,380
 It's just the longest cricketer's name ever,

544
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,060
 but he's just a Pacific cricketer from Fiji.

545
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,460
 He sounds like a great guy, largely 'cause of his long name.

546
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,660
 His surname means returned alive

547
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,580
 from Nankula Hospital at Lakemba Island in the Laugroup,

548
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,780
 which is easier to pronounce if you want to do it that way.

549
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,580
 - Last members for the Laugroup, please.

550
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,060
 Last members for the Laugroup.

551
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,900
 (laughing)

552
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,460
 The bus is departing shortly.

553
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,980
 - But yeah, he was great.

554
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,860
 He used to, they played one international game,

555
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,860
 Fiji, against New Zealand in the 1940s and '50s,

556
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,540
 when he played and they made him serenade them

557
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,220
 with South Sea songs after the match,

558
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,700
 which he did, a game, a man, I know.

559
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,500
 - You know that it took 120 years

560
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,740
 after the invention of the cricket box

561
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,260
 to event the cricket helmet.

562
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,620
 - Okay, well I suppose that shows

563
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,420
 where people's priorities lie, doesn't it?

564
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,940
 Would you agree with that?

565
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,220
 - I'd have thought, yeah, in terms of what you're keen on.

566
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,540
 I suppose it, you've got a skull.

567
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,100
 You don't have a penis skull.

568
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,540
 - You don't have a genital exoskeleton.

569
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,860
 - Exactly.

570
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,700
 - Yes.

571
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,700
 - We're hoping B's awesome, the guys can do something.

572
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,540
 - It was 1850s.

573
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,940
 - And the ball is generally going to be

574
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,740
 in the lower part of your body.

575
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,220
 - Amidships, yes.

576
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,220
 - Well, it's to do with how bouncy the surface is,

577
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,060
 as well, isn't it?

578
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,100
 These days, it's very bouncy

579
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,060
 because they're protected and stuff,

580
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,580
 but if it was open to the elements all the time,

581
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,380
 the bounce could be variable.

582
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,740
 It's more likely to be lower and slower,

583
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,500
 so you'd be more likely to take one in the plums

584
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,340
 than in the noggin.

585
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,660
 (laughing)

586
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,780
 - Yeah, about 1850s was the Palmer's patent groin protector,

587
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,620
 as it was called,

588
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,180
 before that you'd just stuff a hanky down there

589
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,580
 to sort of improvise it.

590
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,060
 But it was only in the 1970s.

591
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,100
 - Was your hanky made out of Kevlar or what?

592
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,420
 - Yeah, yeah.

593
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,300
 - If it's a very well-used hanky,

594
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,500
 I think that can actually...

595
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,740
 (laughing)

596
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,580
 - By some point.

597
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,620
 - Well, it's hard to fold.

598
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,460
 (laughing)

599
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,740
 A heavy head cold actually does protect you

600
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,300
 in unpredictable ways, yeah.

601
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,700
 - I suppose then you could have a sort of use the same one

602
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
 as a kind of gumby hanky as the first crooked helmet.

603
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,540
 (laughing)

604
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,980
 It's very sort of snappy hanky tied in each corner.

605
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,700
 - Would you ever commentate on cricket?

606
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,540
 Well, have you done?

607
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,820
 - I think I have done online, just briefly.

608
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,780
 Yeah, it's quite an awesome responsibility,

609
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,620
 to be perfectly honest.

610
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,900
 If you're thinking other people can't see it,

611
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,860
 then I've really got to.

612
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,700
 - Yeah.

613
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,540
 - You know, a bit like when you said it,

614
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,380
 the drive in the left side,

615
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,220
 I can't see it over my left shoulder.

616
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,660
 Can you tell me if there's anything coming down that hill?

617
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,500
 (laughing)

618
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,420
 It's that sort of pressure, but for hours.

619
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,260
 (laughing)

620
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,100
 - It's days.

621
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,820
 - You know, there could be several countries where,

622
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,620
 and I've got to describe what's going on.

623
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,980
 I think it's more high pressure work

624
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,820
 than people imagine.

625
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,180
 - I did read a description of what it's like

626
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,580
 commentating on something like Test Match Special.

627
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,620
 I can't remember who it was who,

628
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,220
 well, like one of the famous commentators said,

629
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,540
 look, this is the apex of human civilization.

630
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,500
 You are sitting observing a nice cricket match happening.

631
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,220
 People are sending in homemade cakes to you,

632
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,260
 which you can then review on there

633
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,380
 during a lull in play, basically.

634
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,980
 - That the whole play is a lull.

635
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,100
 - Yeah, it's sort of breathing space.

636
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,060
 It's not like commentating on tennis or something like that,

637
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,900
 which must be, you know, if you're a radio commentator

638
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,580
 for tennis, that's horse racing or whatever.

639
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,580
 - Exactly, you know, your word per minute is just--

640
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,340
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

641
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,860
 But this is, he was saying, I think, I think it was a he,

642
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,420
 you are either, having to describe the immediate play,

643
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,100
 which like, if there's something going on,

644
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,020
 you need to explain that really clearly to the listener,

645
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,860
 like you was saying, Miles.

646
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,660
 And then during the quieter bits,

647
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,700
 you're talking more about the overall shape of the game.

648
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,780
 And during the really quiet bits,

649
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,460
 you start talking about the grounds

650
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,180
 and the whole history of cricket.

651
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,540
 And so you've got three different modes

652
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,100
 that you can switch between depending on what's going on.

653
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,180
 - Oh, you've got mode full,

654
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,060
 which is something completely unrelated.

655
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,900
 Have you guys ever seen the clip of,

656
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,220
 it's the Australian commentator,

657
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,620
 and he tells the joke that ends,

658
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,380
 it's a knick-knack, paddy-whack, give the frog a loan?

659
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,740
 Right, look at Google.

660
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
 - It's O'Keefe.

661
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
 - It's O'Keefe, it's Kerio Keefe.

662
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,140
 And he's, and I can't remember who he's commentating with,

663
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,180
 but there's always a straight man

664
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,540
 who's actually commentating on the cricket,

665
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,980
 and then, you know, someone more jokey.

666
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,220
 And he's trying to tell this very long joke.

667
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,700
 And the other commentator is trying to get in the way

668
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,220
 and explain what's happening in the cricket.

669
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,900
 - And then every two minutes, he says, "And there's no run."

670
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,700
 (all laughing)

671
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,060
 - That's where you use your elbow

672
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,860
 to test the temperature of bath water, for instance,

673
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,940
 rather than your fingers aren't actually very sensitive

674
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,260
 to people with their hands and go, "That's okay."

675
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,540
 But it's not actually...

676
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,660
 - I feel like my hands are sensitive to temperature.

677
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,660
 I thought it was that your elbow

678
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,060
 is the bit of you that's most like a baby.

679
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,980
 - 'Cause I always wear gloves when it's cold,

680
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,980
 I don't wear elbow patches, for instance.

681
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,940
 - Oh, well, you should, Joe.

682
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,660
 You lose so much heat through your elbows.

683
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,180
 Yeah, yeah, but you're only,

684
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,660
 but also you're down the skate park a lot,

685
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,620
 with full protective equipment.

686
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,820
 So they're elbow guards,

687
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,140
 you just don't think of them as gloves.

688
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,980
 - Of course.

689
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,700
 - What's the sport where it's two villages versus another

690
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
 and it is, there doesn't seem to be a limit on number,

691
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,260
 it is basically getting a ball from...

692
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,100
 - Yeah.

693
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,940
 - There are two posts or something,

694
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,780
 and it's going from one to...

695
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,220
 - It's the oppies versus the downies,

696
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,620
 or it's the uppers versus the downers,

697
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,820
 and it's just like village football, really.

698
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,660
 It's like old style.

699
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,020
 - But there's no limit on numbers, are there?

700
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,860
 - No, no.

701
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,300
 Well, I think these days, the police limit, who can go.

702
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,380
 (all laughing)

703
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,220
 - Boo.

704
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,060
 - Yeah.

705
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,140
 - That's with, I mean, the sort of sports

706
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,700
 where there's a flexibility, like I didn't realise,

707
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,980
 lacrosse, there's a sort of set length,

708
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,500
 or parameters where they went to the length

709
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
 of the lacrosse pitch must be,

710
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,140
 but actually there is no side boundary

711
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,580
 that's entirely based on where you happen to be playing.

712
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,420
 - Yeah.

713
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,260
 - So you can set off running in one direction,

714
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,900
 and you can just keep going until there's an obstacle,

715
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,420
 essentially, that doesn't get out.

716
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,260
 - Yeah, you know, yeah.

717
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,100
 - We used to do that at school,

718
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,340
 when I played football in the playground,

719
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,580
 you would have one goal,

720
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,100
 and you'd have two teams shooting towards the same goal,

721
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,900
 and you would just get someone who would get the ball

722
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,100
 and just run in the complete opposite direction

723
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,780
 with the ball, so everyone had to chase after them.

724
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,620
 - It's quite long routes.

725
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,380
 - 'Cause there's no boundaries.

726
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,300
 - But that is true in official lacrosse rules.

727
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,580
 I think it's just women's lacrosse.

728
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,900
 Weirdly, I think men's lacrosse does have boundaries,

729
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,740
 but women's lacrosse--

730
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,700
 - Men need boundaries to explain to them.

731
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,100
 - Wasn't it something about, like,

732
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,900
 the earliest games of lacrosse had an insane number of people?

733
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,300
 - The American Lacrosse Foundation claims

734
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,900
 the earliest games could have over 100,000 players.

735
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,740
 - Stop it.

736
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,140
 (laughing)

737
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,900
 - And try commentating on that.

738
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,740
 - State of those changing rooms, as well.

739
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,500
 (laughing)

740
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,980
 - It's like the handshake before the game is gonna take--

741
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,300
 (laughing)

742
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,580
 - It's a sort of roughy-toughy sport in America,

743
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,940
 I think, isn't it, lacrosse?

744
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,140
 We might associate lacrosse with girls' boarding school.

745
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,980
 - Yeah, oh yeah.

746
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,100
 - In America, they'd be surprised if men played rugby.

747
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
 - Yeah, 'cause women's lacrosse and men's lacrosse

748
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,980
 are just different games, aren't they?

749
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,820
 They have different rules.

750
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,660
 - Yeah, very different.

751
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,500
 - Yeah, totally different.

752
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,340
 - But you wouldn't hear phrases

753
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,180
 like roughy-toughy in the men's lacrosse

754
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,860
 that they play in America, for instance,

755
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,140
 whereas you might in the female boarding school

756
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,620
 lacrosse that you play here.

757
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,140
 I've never heard roughy-toughy before.

758
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,500
 - It might not exist as a phrase.

759
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,820
 - Not a phrase, yeah.

760
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,620
 - It might be some sort of post-surgery.

761
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,460
 (laughing)

762
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,900
 Think you should have bubbled up to the surface.

763
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,220
 - On animals, golden hamsters can navigate their way home,

764
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,700
 even when blindfolded and led in a complicated route

765
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,900
 away from their nests.

766
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,740
 - Can they?

767
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,540
 How do they do it, do we know?

768
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,260
 - No, I don't think we do know.

769
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,380
 And it's really mysterious, isn't it?

770
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,220
 'Cause some of these senses are not,

771
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,340
 we don't fully understand.

772
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,100
 So there's a thing called, what's it called,

773
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,180
 the reed warbler bird.

774
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,020
 And scientists wanted to disrupt,

775
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,180
 they thought they must be using the Earth's magnetic field.

776
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,780
 Okay, so we'll disrupt it.

777
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,020
 So they attached small magnets

778
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,860
 to these birds' foreheads in an experiment,

779
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,660
 and they also blocked their view of the stars.

780
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,580
 And, obviously, they couldn't navigate.

781
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,420
 (laughing)

782
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,420
 I don't really know what that proves.

783
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,540
 - I mean, you see, the homing pigeons,

784
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,460
 they used to use in the war to work out

785
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,540
 where sort of various ships were in things.

786
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,020
 Because they'd have their homing instincts

787
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,460
 and they would know that they would fly

788
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,180
 at a very particular pace.

789
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,820
 And they would know what time they were released.

790
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,300
 And so therefore, in the angle

791
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,660
 from which they basically arrived,

792
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,860
 they could work out how far away from that distance.

793
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,700
 - Really?

794
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,740
 - You'd work out the mass backwards.

795
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,260
 So, right, they've arrived from over there.

796
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,580
 They set off at this time, so they must be there for that.

797
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,340
 - I usually travel 20 miles an hour.

798
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,740
 - But how do they know where they set off from?

799
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,780
 'Cause they've got a note on them.

800
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,780
 Or what time they set off?

801
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,540
 - Well, that information must be,

802
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,780
 yes, I was gonna say that must be radio,

803
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,820
 but then presumably the people were radioing

804
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,060
 and say where they were.

805
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,980
 But maybe there's so many,

806
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,700
 maybe everything, any radio signal you send

807
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,140
 can be intercepted, but not.

808
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,980
 - I'm not gonna tell you where we are,

809
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,780
 but it's 7.58 and I'm releasing the pigeons.

810
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,580
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, make of that what you will.

811
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,660
 (laughing)

812
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,900
 - Good luck with that, Hitler, yeah.

813
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,100
 Oh dear, Keith has gone off on one.

814
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,140
 (laughing)

815
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
 They were genuinely useful.

816
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,300
 And they were sort of called up.

817
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,460
 People that were sort of looked after pigeons

818
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,980
 would suddenly, they would hide him on for them.

819
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,460
 - Yeah, suddenly went from being complete weirdo loners

820
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,500
 to very sought after people.

821
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,820
 I'm so sorry.

822
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,660
 - Oh my God.

823
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,100
 - That's not how I feel about pigeon fancies, really.

824
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,220
 - Half our audience are in the pigeon loft at the moment.

825
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,060
 - I know.

826
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,820
 I've got on satire, you know, Tatler,

827
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,140
 we're all subscribers.

828
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,780
 - Of course, yeah.

829
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,380
 - That was meant to be satirical.

830
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,340
 (laughing)

831
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,540
 It was meant to be taking the piss.

832
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,900
 - Can you explain what it is, sorry,

833
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,460
 for those of us who grew up in Bolton?

834
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,980
 - Sorry.

835
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,580
 It's really not your area.

836
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,540
 - It's not the world of interiors, but about people.

837
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,980
 (laughing)

838
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,620
 - So yes, Tatler for International Listeners

839
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,900
 and anyone who's more civilized

840
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,900
 is basically a magazine for high society.

841
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,300
 It's like photographs of people

842
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,740
 who aren't quite the royal family

843
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,180
 'cause they probably can't get access to them,

844
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,820
 but who are mates with the royal family having weddings.

845
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,340
 - Is it Tatler that's got on the,

846
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,540
 it's sort of on the back page.

847
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,780
 There's always like a, it's not a high street honey,

848
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,500
 but it's kind of a, it's like an eligible young lady

849
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,300
 who is engaged.

850
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
 I think maybe that's it is like,

851
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,300
 look at this beautiful young woman.

852
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,140
 She's just gone engaged.

853
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,100
 You can't get together with her.

854
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,940
 - Oh, right.

855
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,780
 - Is that it?

856
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,620
 - Probably that's it.

857
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,460
 - I mean, it doesn't sound like

858
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,300
 any other magazine would have that.

859
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,260
 - Yeah, like Country Life has a sort of,

860
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,100
 - Yeah.

861
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,140
 - Made in the month.

862
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,820
 - Maybe it's Country Life, I'm thinking of that,

863
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,340
 but yes, it's a sort of an arty black and white photo.

864
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,180
 - Yes.

865
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,820
 - And sometimes I think it's like single and looking.

866
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,660
 - Really?

867
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,260
 - And free, available in your area,

868
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,580
 all that kind of thing.

869
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,700
 - This is the page three of--

870
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,260
 - Except it's page like 128

871
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,020
 'cause of all the adverts for posh watches in between.

872
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

873
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,700
 - And it's a monthly publication.

874
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,460
 So it doesn't work in the way that sort of Metro used to have

875
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,980
 I saw yesterday on the 802 Convox Law or something.

876
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,060
 But it'd be like, I think I saw you back,

877
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,700
 it must have been about four months ago.

878
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,060
 (all laughing)

879
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,500
 I think you admired my plowing.

880
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,980
 (all laughing)

881
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,820
 - That's disgusting.

882
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,660
 - My else.

883
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,500
 (all laughing)

884
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,340
 - Rude of me.

885
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,180
 Yeah.

886
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,020
 (all laughing)

887
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,860
 - Yeah, so what about--

888
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,700
 - Anyway, well, oh yeah, sorry.

889
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,620
 It was founded by a guy called Richard Steele,

890
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,340
 who called himself Isaac Bickerstaff when he edited Tatler.

891
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,180
 And Isaac Bickerstaff, actually,

892
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,460
 you'll remember the name, James.

893
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,700
 - I do know the name, but why?

894
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,060
 - It was because Jonathan Swift once published in 1708,

895
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,580
 so another great, the other great probably satirist

896
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,420
 of the time, published the Almanac Predictions of the Year

897
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,580
 writing as Isaac Bickerstaff.

898
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,540
 And he predicted the death of this astrologer

899
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,580
 and society person called John Partridge.

900
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,980
 And he predicted it on April the 1st.

901
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,100
 It was an April Fool's joke.

902
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,780
 And this poor guy, John Partridge,

903
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,380
 who was a bit of a butt of jokes,

904
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,740
 spent the rest of his life trying to convince people

905
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,820
 he wasn't dead.

906
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,500
 And Norm was turned up.

907
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,540
 And he wrote a letter saying, "I'm not dead."

908
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,420
 And Jonathan Swift said, "Well, that's a hoax,

909
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,900
 'cause he is, you know, I've seen the body made."

910
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,300
 - Oh, it was an unkind time.

911
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,220
 A lot of sick burns being dished out all over the place.

912
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,900
 Like saying, "One of the Irish are so hungry,

913
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,260
 "why don't they just eat their babies?"

914
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,100
 Which was during the famine.

915
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,860
 And it was incredibly harsh satire.

916
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,980
 - Imagine that, 'cause it sounds bad now,

917
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,100
 but in the middle of the famine, it's actually even worse.

918
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,940
 - It was bad.

919
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,780
 - It's pitch black satire.

920
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,100
 - I kind of draw attention to the famine,

921
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,060
 and you know, the awful cruelty that has caused it.

922
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,340
 But he's, you know, he's doing so through grief.

923
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,860
 - These days, there's not enough nuance on Twitter

924
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,860
 for people to get that.

925
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,340
 I don't think if he'd have done it today.

926
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,260
 - It's been sort of foremost satirist of your time,

927
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,300
 just to be considered an edgelord,

928
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,860
 with the absolute sort of brute force.

929
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,660
 It's nuanced for heavens sake.

930
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,300
 - One of you try, we're doing down the people.

931
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,020
 I want one of you to tweet something

932
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,100
 about a group of people eating babies today

933
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,340
 and see what happens to you.

934
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,300
 - I'm not on Twitter.

935
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,340
 - So one of you two.

936
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,100
 - On Twitter, it'll go down a storm these days.

937
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,100
 I can show you that.

938
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,340
 (all laughing)

939
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,940
 - I could put it in a WhatsApp group.

940
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,340
 (all laughing)

941
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,180
 - Just see.

942
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,020
 - Yes.

943
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,280
 - The Christmas one's gone quiet.

944
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,660
 (all laughing)

945
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,900
 - Just out of the blue.

946
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,380
 Oh, what's Mars up to?

947
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,220
 Oh.

948
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,460
 - What are we thinking this year?

949
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,260
 - Another pseudonym, John Barron.

950
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,460
 Do you know this one?

951
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,420
 - No. - John Barron, no.

952
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,020
 - How do you know the name Barron?

953
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,860
 - Barron.

954
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,140
 - Is it Barron, or Barron, like, childless?

955
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,620
 B-A-D-R-O-N.

956
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,460
 - The Barron Knights.

957
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,940
 - Who's a famous Barron these days.

958
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,780
 - Barron Trump.

959
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,620
 - Yes.

960
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,940
 So Donald Trump's pseudonym, John Barron.

961
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,700
 So when Forbes were doing the richest people list,

962
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,140
 John Barron wrote to them saying,

963
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,420
 oh, you've got to put Trump in here.

964
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,700
 He's a billionaire.

965
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,540
 - No.

966
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,860
 - Yeah, and he's got a few others.

967
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,140
 There's a guy called John Miller,

968
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,140
 who once wrote to People magazine

969
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,140
 who'd said something about Trump saying,

970
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,740
 "Actually, Trump is a very compassionate husband,

971
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,260
 and lots of beautiful women

972
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,780
 are always asking to go out with him.

973
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,980
 In fact, Madonna called and wanted to go out with him.

974
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,500
 That, I could tell you."

975
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,380
 - But what makes you think that's one of his pseudonyms?

976
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,260
 - We, it came out in court later.

977
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,100
 (laughing)

978
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,620
 - Oh, that's devastating, mate.

979
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:13,460
 - Okay, that's it.

980
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,420
 That is all of our outtakes.

981
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,540
 If you have anything to say about them,

982
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,500
 if you want to share any extra juicy bits of detail

983
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,420
 that you know about them,

984
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,260
 you can message us on podcast@qi.com.

985
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,020
 Those emails go through to Andy,

986
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,700
 and a lot of those emails then get taken over

987
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,580
 to Drop Us a Line where we discuss them.

988
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,700
 So send us your favorite facts, send us an anecdote,

989
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,340
 send us anything that you think is worth sharing,

990
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,620
 and hopefully it can make it onto Drop Us a Line.

991
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,820
 Just a reminder, no such thing as a fish.com.

992
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,020
 You got the ticket link for all of our upcoming gigs,

993
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,100
 and two in particular,

994
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,620
 which is the London Podcast Festival

995
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,540
 that's gonna be happening near King's Cross at King's Place,

996
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,220
 and that is the 5th and 6th of September.

997
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,380
 So get your tickets now, and that's it.

998
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,460
 We're gonna be back again with another episode

999
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,860
 in a fortnight's time.

1000
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,100
 We'll see you then.

1001
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,940
 Goodbye.

1002
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,640
 (upbeat music)

1003
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,220
 (upbeat music)

1004
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,800
 (upbeat music)
