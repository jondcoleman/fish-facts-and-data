00:00:02,00:00:05,"- Hey, Club Fish members."
00:00:05,00:00:08,Welcome to your secret bonus bit of content.
00:00:08,00:00:10,We've got a compilation for you today.
00:00:10,00:00:12,This is the best of the outtakes
00:00:12,00:00:14,of things that didn't make it to the main show.
00:00:14,00:00:17,"It features me, James, Andy, and Anna,"
00:00:17,00:00:20,but you've got some bonus voices joining us this week.
00:00:20,00:00:22,"We've got Reese Darby, the brilliant Reese,"
00:00:22,00:00:25,"and of course, the excellent Miles Jump."
00:00:25,00:00:27,"You will have heard them on recent episodes,"
00:00:27,00:00:30,and this is all the stuff that didn't quite fit
00:00:30,00:00:32,into the main episodes.
00:00:32,00:00:33,"Oh, and quickly before we get into it,"
00:00:33,00:00:35,just a quick thank you to everyone
00:00:35,00:00:36,who came to the CrossWires Festival.
00:00:36,00:00:38,We had such a fun gig.
00:00:38,00:00:39,"There was an awesome ending to it,"
00:00:39,00:00:42,where we did a quiz with members from the audience.
00:00:42,00:00:43,It was just so much fun.
00:00:43,00:00:45,So thank you everyone who came there.
00:00:45,00:00:47,Some people traveled all the way from America
00:00:47,00:00:49,to come see the show.
00:00:49,00:00:50,Hope you enjoyed it.

00:01:35,00:01:37,So don't go anywhere.
00:01:37,00:01:38,And don't go anywhere right now.
00:01:38,00:01:39,'Cause here we go.
00:01:39,00:01:40,It's the compilation.
00:01:40,00:01:44,The four fishers recent miles on with the outtakes.
00:01:44,00:01:46,(upbeat music)
00:01:52,00:01:56,(speaking in foreign language)
00:01:56,00:02:06,There's a World War I connection
00:02:06,00:02:08,"as well as World War II connection in ugly,"
00:02:08,00:02:10,which is really cool actually.
00:02:10,00:02:13,"So in World War I, there was an understandable fear"
00:02:13,00:02:15,that the Germans were gonna invade via Essex.
00:02:15,00:02:18,And a plan was drawn up to evacuate
00:02:18,00:02:20,the whole of Essex to Oxfordshire.
00:02:20,00:02:22,1.4 million people.
00:02:22,00:02:24,"I don't think they told the people of Oxfordshire,"
00:02:24,00:02:24,but this plan--
00:02:24,00:02:25,"- Yeah, you wouldn't, would you?"
00:02:25,00:02:26,- You wouldn't mention it.
00:02:26,00:02:27,- There's gotta be some stuff happening.
00:02:27,00:02:29,Just don't worry about it.
00:02:29,00:02:30,- Just keep your doors shut.
00:02:30,00:02:33,But they all got these things from the council
00:02:33,00:02:35,saying this is what to do.
00:02:35,00:02:37,"- Councils have really diminished, haven't they?"
00:02:37,00:02:39,Now they sometimes can't collect glass.
00:02:39,00:02:41,"- Well, it's the underfunding, isn't it?"
00:02:41,00:02:43,We don't get the war warnings anymore.
00:02:43,00:02:46,"And the information said,"
00:02:46,00:02:49,"when ugly church bells ring incessantly,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,"that's your sign, get out, go to Oxfordshire."
00:02:51,00:02:53,"And they also, and they were told,"
00:02:53,00:02:57,destroy all alcohol because if the Germans arrive
00:02:57,00:03:00,"and they're invading and they get drunk,"
00:03:00,00:03:03,"that's even worse than a sober invading Nazi,"
00:03:03,00:03:04,which is quite weird.
00:03:04,00:03:05,"- Really, that is weird."
00:03:05,00:03:07,'Cause it wasn't the Battle of Fishguard
00:03:07,00:03:10,when the French came over in the 18th century.
00:03:10,00:03:13,"The last time Britain was invaded at all, they arrived,"
00:03:13,00:03:15,they all got drunk and couldn't do anything.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"- Well, I think it's really on the fence."
00:03:17,00:03:19,"Yes, will alcohol make the invaders worse or better?"
00:03:19,00:03:21,And maybe it depends on whether they're French or German.
00:03:21,00:03:22,"- Oh, yeah, maybe."
00:03:22,00:03:25,"- But anyway, it's really cool"
00:03:25,00:03:28,'cause everyone was given these evacuation routes
00:03:28,00:03:29,and it meant you had to take all the back roads
00:03:29,00:03:31,'cause the army would be using the main roads.
00:03:31,00:03:35,"So they had these maps and there were arrows all over Essex,"
00:03:35,00:03:37,painted on walls and trees and lamp posts
00:03:37,00:03:39,and big white arrows showing people the way.
00:03:39,00:03:43,And the only remnant that remains now is in ugly.
00:03:43,00:03:47,There's a wall which just has now only the little plaque left
00:03:47,00:03:50,"saying this is where the big white arrow was saying,"
00:03:50,00:03:51,get out of dodge.
00:03:51,00:03:53,"- Imagine arriving as a Nazi going, where is everyone?"
00:03:53,00:03:56,And then seeing giant arrows pointing towards
00:03:56,00:03:59,where you needed to go.
00:03:59,00:04:02,- We haven't got this through Winston.
00:04:02,00:04:06,Protestants have some good gear.
00:04:06,00:04:08,Like I was looking at Stanstead protests.
00:04:08,00:04:10,So there was a protest in Stanstead a few years ago
00:04:10,00:04:14,over a bunch of migrants who were being sent away
00:04:14,00:04:16,"and that one of those taken in the dead of night,"
00:04:16,00:04:18,"stuck on a charter plane,"
00:04:18,00:04:21,sent back to the country from which they'd come
00:04:21,00:04:22,from a while ago.
00:04:22,00:04:24,Big protest about that.
00:04:24,00:04:27,But the way they did it was they formed a circle
00:04:27,00:04:28,around the plane.
00:04:28,00:04:30,"So they got bolt cutters, they got into Stanstead airport."
00:04:30,00:04:32,They formed a circle around the plane
00:04:32,00:04:35,and they'd locked themselves in this circle
00:04:35,00:04:39,by putting their arms in pipes filled with expanding foam
00:04:39,00:04:41,and like attaching their arms to each other.
00:04:41,00:04:42,So I put my arm in one end of the type
00:04:42,00:04:44,and he puts his arm in the other.
00:04:44,00:04:45,"Well, you get it."
00:04:45,00:04:46,What is expanding foam?
00:04:46,00:04:48,You know those Chinese finger traps
00:04:48,00:04:49,that you put your fingers in
00:04:49,00:04:50,but like a super big version of that.
00:04:50,00:04:51,"Yeah, exactly."
00:04:51,00:04:52,It's a giant one of those.
00:04:52,00:04:54,What if I need a piss?
00:04:54,00:04:55,"Well, you can't, you just have to go loose."
00:04:55,00:04:57,You can't hold your willy.
00:04:57,00:04:58,"So sorry, you're in a big circle"
00:04:58,00:05:01,with your arms in the pipes or our fingers touching.
00:05:01,00:05:03,If you want them to be happy.
00:05:03,00:05:03,Possibly not.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"I don't think they, I think you don't want them touching"
00:05:06,00:05:08,because you could have a wider circumference
00:05:08,00:05:09,if you're not touching.
00:05:09,00:05:10,I guess so.
00:05:10,00:05:11,"Oh yeah, true."
00:05:11,00:05:14,But what if I feel lonely or scared?
00:05:14,00:05:16,And I do want to be holding hands with someone.
00:05:16,00:05:18,They're the sacrifices you make to save.
00:05:18,00:05:20,Someone else can't even help me have a piss
00:05:20,00:05:22,'cause they've got their arms in the tube as well.
00:05:22,00:05:23,"That's got to be, I've got it."
00:05:23,00:05:25,There's got to be an external agent
00:05:25,00:05:27,who's free to go around helping people have a piss.
00:05:27,00:05:29,"There was one piss helper, yes."
00:05:29,00:05:33,But all you need to do then is arrest the piss assistant
00:05:33,00:05:35,and then the whole protest falls apart.
00:05:35,00:05:37,(laughing)
00:05:37,00:05:38,"Yeah, they all wet themselves and it's over."
00:05:38,00:05:40,That's how all protests tend.
00:05:40,00:05:42,"I need the toilet, let's go."
00:05:42,00:05:44,"I've wet myself, all right, we're done for the day."
00:05:44,00:05:45,How did it end then?
00:05:45,00:05:47,How did they actually untube them?
00:05:47,00:05:48,They're still there.
00:05:48,00:05:48,They're still there.
00:05:48,00:05:49,Eight years.
00:05:49,00:05:51,That plane's stuck in the middle.
00:05:51,00:05:55,"They tried to prosecute them on some,"
00:05:55,00:05:56,actually anti-terrorism charges
00:05:56,00:05:57,before I judge a couple of years later.
00:05:57,00:05:59,They said that's fucking ridiculous
00:05:59,00:06:00,these guys aren't terrorists.
00:06:00,00:06:02,But they were extracted from the pipes first.
00:06:02,00:06:04,I don't think anyone's still walking around
00:06:04,00:06:05,with the pipe attached to their arms.
00:06:05,00:06:07,(laughing)
00:06:07,00:06:10,"If you are writing, or you can't, probably."
00:06:10,00:06:11,(laughing)
00:06:11,00:06:12,"If your piss helper is free,"
00:06:12,00:06:14,we ask if they can drop us a line.
00:06:14,00:06:17,(laughing)
00:06:17,00:06:18,Is it Stanstead or Gatwick
00:06:18,00:06:21,"that's won the award for best toilet, like multiple years?"
00:06:21,00:06:22,I can't be Stanstead.
00:06:22,00:06:23,No?
00:06:23,00:06:26,"No, unless they're talking about the entire airport,"
00:06:26,00:06:28,it's being the toilet.
00:06:28,00:06:31,"Is it, can I ask that, is it an individual cubicle"
00:06:31,00:06:32,or is it a design of toilets?
00:06:32,00:06:34,"No, no, it's the whole toilets, the cleanliness,"
00:06:34,00:06:37,it's in the window as you go down into the toilets.
00:06:37,00:06:38,"You know, you walked in and you go,"
00:06:38,00:06:39,"wow, about to pee."
00:06:39,00:06:40,"Wait, there's a window as you go down?"
00:06:40,00:06:42,"Yeah, it's a little cabinet where they keep it."
00:06:42,00:06:43,You can see it.
00:06:43,00:06:45,Does your toilet not have a viewing window?
00:06:45,00:06:45,It should.
00:06:45,00:06:48,(laughing)
00:06:48,00:06:51,Can I give you a music recommendation
00:06:51,00:06:52,related to this fact?
00:06:52,00:06:54,It's my favorite song I found recently.
00:06:54,00:06:57,"So in 1978, I'm sure some listeners remember,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,there was the big frequency change
00:06:59,00:07:01,"where all of the radio stations in the UK,"
00:07:01,00:07:02,"all the big BBC ones,"
00:07:02,00:07:05,hopped to a different frequency
00:07:05,00:07:06,because of EU regulations
00:07:06,00:07:09,and no one had the internet then.
00:07:09,00:07:10,"So it was like, how are they gonna know"
00:07:10,00:07:13,that their station is at a different frequency?
00:07:13,00:07:16,"Especially given that, I believe Radio 3"
00:07:16,00:07:19,hopped to the frequency that used to be Radio 1.
00:07:19,00:07:21,So you'd tune in hoping for Tony Blackburn
00:07:21,00:07:25,"and you'd get, in certain name of famous Radio 3 presenter"
00:07:25,00:07:26,in the 1970s.
00:07:26,00:07:28,I honestly thought that Tony Blackburn
00:07:28,00:07:30,was currently on Radio 3.
00:07:30,00:07:31,(laughing)
00:07:31,00:07:32,He might be.
00:07:32,00:07:33,He might be.
00:07:33,00:07:34,And the only reason I know it's him is because
00:07:34,00:07:36,one of the things they did to tell people was
00:07:36,00:07:39,Tony Blackburn stayed at Radio 3
00:07:39,00:07:41,for the day to tell people.
00:07:41,00:07:42,"A bit like if you move house,"
00:07:42,00:07:44,you stay at the house that you've just moved out of.
00:07:44,00:07:46,"So when your mates come around, you can go,"
00:07:46,00:07:47,I don't live here anymore.
00:07:47,00:07:49,"So if you tuned in, he'd be like,"
00:07:49,00:07:50,"hello, it's me, Tony."
00:07:50,00:07:51,"I'm not here anymore, though."
00:07:51,00:07:52,- That's not confusing at all.
00:07:52,00:07:54,- Go to the other station.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"- Why can't they get someone else to say,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,Tony doesn't live here anymore?
00:07:58,00:08:00,"If you want him, he's on Radio 1."
00:08:00,00:08:02,- He's just a dedicated guy.
00:08:02,00:08:03,- That's great.
00:08:03,00:08:03,That's so good.
00:08:03,00:08:05,- There was also this incredible song
00:08:05,00:08:08,by the King singers who were very famous
00:08:08,00:08:10,"at the time, acapella group from King's College, Cambridge."
00:08:10,00:08:12,They released a single to help people remember
00:08:12,00:08:16,all the new frequencies and you've got to look it up.
00:08:16,00:08:17,It's beautiful.
00:08:17,00:08:20,"It starts just, I'll just give you the first line."
00:08:20,00:08:23,A new international agreement comes into effect
00:08:23,00:08:26,and many of the frequencies used for the BBC
00:08:26,00:08:29,will be changed at a time.
00:08:29,00:08:30,And it goes on like that.
00:08:30,00:08:32,- Is that the tune or have you just riffed that?
00:08:32,00:08:34,"- It's a bit like that, you know?"
00:08:34,00:08:36,So it's like acapella church music.
00:08:36,00:08:37,- Wow.
00:08:37,00:08:40,- But it told everyone what frequencies to go to.
00:08:40,00:08:41,"- I reckon 'cause it said at a time,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,"that was a really weird way of saying it,"
00:08:43,00:08:46,but the frequency for Radio 1 was 97 to 99.
00:08:46,00:08:49,So it was a rhyme if that was it.
00:08:49,00:08:53,- They were actually different frequencies at the time.
00:08:53,00:08:56,"And so it's, and there wasn't that much rhyming in this,"
00:08:56,00:08:59,"I must say, much like a lot of Psalms."
00:08:59,00:09:01,- Do you remember the whole point of putting things
00:09:01,00:09:03,in a song to help you remember?
00:09:03,00:09:04,Did you make them rhyme?
00:09:04,00:09:06,- There's no way it makes it easier whatsoever.
00:09:06,00:09:08,"- It's just a string of numbers,"
00:09:08,00:09:09,sung by a bunch of choir boys.
00:09:09,00:09:15,"- There were two, in fact, the world's only two"
00:09:15,00:09:18,"female fighter pilot aces, which I think to be an ace,"
00:09:18,00:09:20,"you sort of had to shoot down five planes or more,"
00:09:20,00:09:21,vaguely varied.
00:09:21,00:09:24,"But one of them was this woman called Lilia Litviak,"
00:09:24,00:09:27,who was in one of the other regiments
00:09:27,00:09:30,that were flying for the Soviets in the Second World War.
00:09:30,00:09:32,"And there was just an account where she recounted,"
00:09:32,00:09:34,"and people who were in the same regiment as her recounted,"
00:09:34,00:09:37,"which sounds really fun, where she was in this dogfight"
00:09:37,00:09:40,"with a German called Erwin Meyer,"
00:09:40,00:09:42,and he'd shot down 12 planes before.
00:09:42,00:09:44,So he was well up there in ace territory.
00:09:44,00:09:47,And she defeated him really resoundingly.
00:09:47,00:09:49,And then it sounds like there's one of those nice moments
00:09:49,00:09:52,"where he came right down, but he was okay."
00:09:52,00:09:56,"But he was like, who the hell defeats me?"
00:09:56,00:09:59,Introduce me to the man who just bested me.
00:09:59,00:10:01,And so they trotted him up.
00:10:01,00:10:02,"Yeah, did you read about this?"
00:10:02,00:10:03,"- No, I'm just excited."
00:10:03,00:10:05,"- You just, yeah, go on."
00:10:05,00:10:08,"- So he got shot down, but he landed okay."
00:10:08,00:10:10,"- He landed okay, and that way people"
00:10:10,00:10:11,seemed to sometimes survive.
00:10:11,00:10:14,"And demanded to be taken to the man who'd shot him down,"
00:10:14,00:10:15,and was furious. - So presumptuous.
00:10:15,00:10:16,"- I know, I know."
00:10:16,00:10:18,- I just think you don't automatically get to meet
00:10:18,00:10:20,the person who shot you down.
00:10:20,00:10:23,"That's not, that's not my voice for you."
00:10:23,00:10:24,- What have you got to do?
00:10:24,00:10:25,- So follow themselves.
00:10:25,00:10:26,"- Yeah, he was pissed off."
00:10:26,00:10:28,"He was introduced to a woman, he said,"
00:10:28,00:10:29,"bugger off guys, come on,"
00:10:29,00:10:31,"where's the real guy, stop taking the piss."
00:10:31,00:10:32,"- Very funny, okay, yeah."
00:10:32,00:10:34,"- That happened to Mary Ellis,"
00:10:34,00:10:35,who was another of the 88 girls.
00:10:35,00:10:36,"She landed a Wellington bomber,"
00:10:36,00:10:38,"which was like a huge plane at the time,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,at an RAF base.
00:10:40,00:10:43,"And the staff said, oh, great, so where's the pilot?"
00:10:43,00:10:44,"And she said, oh, I'm the pilot."
00:10:44,00:10:46,"And they point blank, refused to believe it,"
00:10:46,00:10:48,"to the extent of searching the plane,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,'cause they thought they were being pranked.
00:10:50,00:10:51,Like there's no way this small one--
00:10:51,00:10:54,- And he also does that on like just normal domestic flights.
00:10:54,00:10:56,"If it's a woman who comes up to Tammai,"
00:10:56,00:10:59,"he's like, come on, let's get the real one on."
00:10:59,00:11:00,"- Ha, ha, ha, ha."
00:11:00,00:11:02,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:02,00:11:02,"- And then to Laura's mortgage,"
00:11:02,00:11:04,"she became a pilot after the war,"
00:11:04,00:11:04,"and she wasn't allowed to say,"
00:11:04,00:11:06,this is your captain speaking.
00:11:06,00:11:07,- What?
00:11:07,00:11:07,- Because people would freak out
00:11:07,00:11:09,"and presumably, you know,"
00:11:09,00:11:11,storm the cockpit or whatever.
00:11:11,00:11:12,- Yes.
00:11:12,00:11:14,"- Can I just say, I'm never quite sure on aeroplanes though,"
00:11:14,00:11:16,"when they say this is your captain,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,I'm never sure if it's the person who's piloting
00:11:18,00:11:19,"the plane speaking,"
00:11:19,00:11:21,or the head of these steward and stewardessing staff.
00:11:21,00:11:22,- I think it's the captain.
00:11:22,00:11:23,- Yeah.
00:11:23,00:11:23,- This is the person piloting.
00:11:23,00:11:25,"- When they say, this is the captain speaking,"
00:11:25,00:11:27,"generally speaking, it's the captain."
00:11:27,00:11:28,It's not the steward--
00:11:28,00:11:31,"- Unless they say, this is the captain of catering speaking."
00:11:31,00:11:32,(laughing)
00:11:32,00:11:35,- You will receive your cups of tea very shortly.
00:11:35,00:11:38,I'm just texting at the moment to the airport actually.
00:11:38,00:11:39,- There's gonna be a little bit of turbulence
00:11:39,00:11:40,"on the trolley this afternoon,"
00:11:40,00:11:42,but we're gonna get your drinks to you.
00:11:42,00:11:44,- Yeah.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"- Know who invented ""Lost and Found"" offices?"
00:11:46,00:11:48,- Is it someone famous?
00:11:48,00:11:49,- Someone you've heard of.
00:11:49,00:11:51,"- Conan Doyle, it's always Conan Doyle."
00:11:51,00:11:52,"- Neither of those two,"
00:11:52,00:11:54,"but it's someone more famous, in fact,"
00:11:54,00:11:55,"than either of those two, I would say."
00:11:55,00:11:57,"- Famous to Winston Churchill, Genghis Khan."
00:11:57,00:11:58,- Jesus.
00:11:58,00:11:58,- John Wayne.
00:11:58,00:12:00,- It was Napoleon Bonaparte.
00:12:00,00:12:01,"- Oh, that's a good one."
00:12:01,00:12:02,"- Oh, wow."
00:12:02,00:12:03,"- Sorry, Andy."
00:12:03,00:12:04,- Napoleon won?
00:12:04,00:12:05,- Yeah.
00:12:05,00:12:05,- Cool.
00:12:05,00:12:06,- I can't remember what you're saying he invented now.
00:12:06,00:12:07,"What, ""Lost and Found""?"
00:12:07,00:12:08,"- ""Lost and Found"", yeah."
00:12:08,00:12:09,- It's been so long.
00:12:09,00:12:10,"- So part of his thing, like,"
00:12:10,00:12:14,"Napoleon was bringing everything to Paris kind of thing,"
00:12:14,00:12:17,like centralizing the whole country.
00:12:17,00:12:17,"And as part of that,"
00:12:17,00:12:20,he set up an office on the Île de Cité
00:12:20,00:12:22,"for lost objects, and it still exists."
00:12:22,00:12:23,- Cool.
00:12:23,00:12:26,- And they have a cabinet of curiosities
00:12:26,00:12:28,"that includes several human skulls,"
00:12:28,00:12:31,"a wooden leg, and two chunks of masonry"
00:12:31,00:12:32,from the World Trade Center.
00:12:32,00:12:33,- Wow.
00:12:33,00:12:34,- Gosh.
00:12:34,00:12:35,- And can you believe that?
00:12:35,00:12:37,"- Well, that's somehow got lost there."
00:12:37,00:12:39,"- Well, that's the thing with ""Lost and Found"","
00:12:39,00:12:40,"you don't know how it got there, right?"
00:12:40,00:12:42,- How do they know the masonry
00:12:42,00:12:44,is from the World Trade Center?
00:12:44,00:12:45,- There must be clues.
00:12:45,00:12:47,"- They've properly analyzed that, wow."
00:12:47,00:12:48,- I guess so.
00:12:48,00:12:49,- That was amazing.
00:12:49,00:12:50,- Yeah.
00:12:50,00:12:52,- And the modern system there was organized
00:12:52,00:12:54,"by a guy called Louis Lapine,"
00:12:54,00:12:57,who was known as the little man with a big stick.
00:12:57,00:13:00,"And he was a French policeman,"
00:13:00,00:13:03,and he was well known for sort of handling the crowds
00:13:03,00:13:06,in Paris whenever there was riots and stuff.
00:13:06,00:13:10,But he was also famous for accusing
00:13:10,00:13:12,"friend of the podcast, Apollinaire,"
00:13:12,00:13:14,of stealing the Mona Lisa.
00:13:14,00:13:15,Do you remember that story?
00:13:15,00:13:18,"- Yeah, I'm sure you're very familiar."
00:13:18,00:13:21,"- Yes, this was episode 352."
00:13:21,00:13:22,That was a very good one.
00:13:22,00:13:23,"- Mm-hmm, thank you."
00:13:23,00:13:24,- I enjoyed that.
00:13:24,00:13:26,I think I was driving from Patney.
00:13:26,00:13:27,(all laughing)
00:13:27,00:13:29,- And had an accident.
00:13:29,00:13:30,It was very entertaining.
00:13:30,00:13:32,"- But yeah, he was like really famous"
00:13:32,00:13:34,and really like well respected.
00:13:34,00:13:35,But when this Mona Lisa--
00:13:35,00:13:36,- And a big stick.
00:13:36,00:13:39,"- But you had a big stick, they had to respect him, yeah."
00:13:39,00:13:40,"But when this Mona Lisa thing happened,"
00:13:40,00:13:42,"he lost all of his credibility, really."
00:13:42,00:13:43,- Mm-hmm.
00:13:43,00:13:44,"- The police officer, Lapine."
00:13:44,00:13:45,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:13:45,00:13:46,"- They say when you've got with the Mona Lisa,"
00:13:46,00:13:49,"'cause it's been stolen quite a few times,"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"but every time,"
00:13:51,00:13:53,"doesn't matter where you're coming from to steal it,"
00:13:53,00:13:55,the painting can see you.
00:13:55,00:13:58,(all laughing)
00:13:58,00:13:59,- And this is actually a good hint.
00:13:59,00:14:03,The only way to get it without her seeing you
00:14:03,00:14:04,is going from behind.
00:14:04,00:14:06,"- Oh, mm-hmm, yeah."
00:14:06,00:14:07,- Through the wall.
00:14:07,00:14:07,(all laughing)
00:14:07,00:14:09,"- Don't take that advice out of context, please."
00:14:09,00:14:12,(all laughing)
00:14:12,00:14:15,"- Just on like early trends in general,"
00:14:15,00:14:19,have you heard about Railway Mad Men?
00:14:19,00:14:21,- This was a--
00:14:21,00:14:22,"- Oh, was that spin-off?"
00:14:22,00:14:23,- Yeah.
00:14:23,00:14:25,(all laughing)
00:14:25,00:14:26,- Yeah.
00:14:26,00:14:28,(all laughing)
00:14:28,00:14:32,- What was that?
00:14:32,00:14:34,- It was the opening theme.
00:14:34,00:14:35,- I was scared.
00:14:35,00:14:37,(all laughing)
00:14:37,00:14:38,"- This was the thing,"
00:14:38,00:14:40,"like when trains were introduced and growing,"
00:14:40,00:14:41,"there was Railway Mania,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,"which was when everyone was just building trains,"
00:14:43,00:14:44,"across the UK in particular,"
00:14:44,00:14:46,with no thought of whether they needed
00:14:46,00:14:47,"to be a train, basically."
00:14:47,00:14:49,"- No, they got given huge subsidies"
00:14:49,00:14:51,for building train tracks and stuff.
00:14:51,00:14:53,"- For a while, it was the most profitable thing you could do."
00:14:53,00:14:55,So people were just building mad little railways
00:14:55,00:14:57,"out everywhere, thousands of miles."
00:14:57,00:14:59,But Railway Mad Men was a different thing.
00:14:59,00:15:00,"People were worried, you know,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,"it's time of social change, blah, blah, blah."
00:15:02,00:15:05,"And you were locked in the compartments,"
00:15:05,00:15:06,that was another thing.
00:15:06,00:15:09,"So people really freaked out at the prospect of train travel,"
00:15:09,00:15:10,"making people lose their wits,"
00:15:10,00:15:12,"specifically men as well,"
00:15:12,00:15:15,"and just go bananas and berserk, basically."
00:15:15,00:15:17,"- Yeah, 'cause of the speed you were going?"
00:15:17,00:15:18,- 'Cause of the speed.
00:15:18,00:15:20,"- Also, it enclosed in tunnels a lot."
00:15:20,00:15:21,I think that was a problem.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"- There was a lot of, yeah,"
00:15:23,00:15:24,"there's a historian called Amy Milne Smith,"
00:15:24,00:15:28,"and she did a fantastic report on this,"
00:15:28,00:15:29,like a thesis about it.
00:15:29,00:15:32,"So it was normal men who were completely fine,"
00:15:32,00:15:34,"but it was partly all the stuff you said, James,"
00:15:34,00:15:37,"and partly stress and overwork and anxiety of,"
00:15:37,00:15:39,"like just modern life, the modern condition,"
00:15:39,00:15:41,"meant that, you know, in 1869,"
00:15:41,00:15:43,a gentleman suddenly took off all his clothing
00:15:43,00:15:44,and leaned out of the windows
00:15:44,00:15:46,"of his carriage talking nonsense, you know."
00:15:46,00:15:49,"And it was just apparently as soon as the train stopped,"
00:15:49,00:15:50,"or they got off the train,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,they completely recovered their wits and they were fine.
00:15:52,00:15:54,It was literally the act of being on a moving train.
00:15:54,00:15:57,"- Now, hang on, can I butt in with,"
00:15:57,00:16:00,is there anything to do with sitting backwards on a train?
00:16:00,00:16:01,"- Oh, don't know."
00:16:01,00:16:03,- 'Cause they looked into that scientific issue
00:16:03,00:16:04,whereby it could drive you mad
00:16:04,00:16:07,if you're always facing the wrong way
00:16:07,00:16:08,and going in a certain direction.
00:16:08,00:16:10,"- Yeah, I know hate going backwards on a train."
00:16:10,00:16:11,"- Feel sick, yeah, yeah."
00:16:11,00:16:12,- Do you?
00:16:12,00:16:13,"- Yeah, none of you guys?"
00:16:13,00:16:14,- I love it.
00:16:14,00:16:16,"- Well, yeah, I don't, I'm not a fan of it."
00:16:16,00:16:17,So I think it could be linked to
00:16:17,00:16:19,a bit of madness that might come.
00:16:19,00:16:21,"- I prefer it, I prefer sitting backwards on my--"
00:16:21,00:16:22,- Do you?
00:16:22,00:16:22,"- I actually prefer as well,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,"'cause if you crash head on to something,"
00:16:24,00:16:26,then you have something to stop you from--
00:16:26,00:16:27,"- Oh, y'all crash theory."
00:16:27,00:16:28,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:16:28,00:16:28,And don't--
00:16:28,00:16:29,- You're backwards crash theory.
00:16:29,00:16:31,"- Yeah, yeah, that's interesting."
00:16:31,00:16:32,"- So you think, James,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,that they should put all the seats in a car
00:16:34,00:16:35,backwards presumably?
00:16:35,00:16:37,"- Well, I think I'm not the only person who thinks that."
00:16:37,00:16:38,- Really?
00:16:38,00:16:39,"- I mean, that is safer."
00:16:39,00:16:40,- Except the driver's seat presumably.
00:16:40,00:16:42,(laughing)
00:16:42,00:16:45,- Just then all the cars reverse everywhere.
00:16:45,00:16:48,"- Yeah, that's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:48,00:16:49,"You just lean around,"
00:16:49,00:16:50,"your arm over the other seat,"
00:16:50,00:16:51,you do that classic move.
00:16:51,00:16:52,"- Yeah, it's fine. - It's fine."
00:16:52,00:16:53,"- Nice, nice."
00:16:53,00:16:54,"- Yeah, everyone would drive a lot more slowly."
00:16:54,00:16:55,- Yes. - I'm safer.
00:16:55,00:16:59,- Do you guys know a right-handed bazaar called
00:16:59,00:17:03,"Lasarusa, Talibula, Mina,"
00:17:03,00:17:07,"Verleni, Vavaca, Bulaima,"
00:17:07,00:17:09,"Kula, Kala, Kebalau?"
00:17:09,00:17:10,"- Yes, of course."
00:17:10,00:17:11,"- Yeah, I have his shirt,"
00:17:11,00:17:14,but it cuffs me a fortune to get his name on the pack.
00:17:14,00:17:15,(laughing)
00:17:15,00:17:16,- I do know him.
00:17:16,00:17:19,- Is it a real name of someone we have heard of?
00:17:19,00:17:19,"- No, no, it's not."
00:17:19,00:17:21,"It's just the longest cricketer's name ever,"
00:17:21,00:17:24,but he's just a Pacific cricketer from Fiji.
00:17:24,00:17:26,"He sounds like a great guy, largely 'cause of his long name."
00:17:26,00:17:28,His surname means returned alive
00:17:28,00:17:32,"from Nankula Hospital at Lakemba Island in the Laugroup,"
00:17:32,00:17:34,which is easier to pronounce if you want to do it that way.
00:17:34,00:17:36,"- Last members for the Laugroup, please."
00:17:36,00:17:38,Last members for the Laugroup.
00:17:38,00:17:39,(laughing)
00:17:39,00:17:41,The bus is departing shortly.
00:17:41,00:17:44,"- But yeah, he was great."
00:17:44,00:17:46,"He used to, they played one international game,"
00:17:46,00:17:49,"Fiji, against New Zealand in the 1940s and '50s,"
00:17:49,00:17:52,when he played and they made him serenade them
00:17:52,00:17:54,"with South Sea songs after the match,"
00:17:54,00:17:57,"which he did, a game, a man, I know."
00:17:57,00:18:01,- You know that it took 120 years
00:18:01,00:18:03,after the invention of the cricket box
00:18:03,00:18:05,to event the cricket helmet.
00:18:05,00:18:08,"- Okay, well I suppose that shows"
00:18:08,00:18:11,"where people's priorities lie, doesn't it?"
00:18:11,00:18:12,Would you agree with that?
00:18:12,00:18:15,"- I'd have thought, yeah, in terms of what you're keen on."
00:18:15,00:18:17,"I suppose it, you've got a skull."
00:18:17,00:18:19,You don't have a penis skull.
00:18:19,00:18:21,- You don't have a genital exoskeleton.
00:18:21,00:18:22,- Exactly.
00:18:22,00:18:23,- Yes.
00:18:23,00:18:28,"- We're hoping B's awesome, the guys can do something."
00:18:28,00:18:29,- It was 1850s.
00:18:29,00:18:30,- And the ball is generally going to be
00:18:30,00:18:32,in the lower part of your body.
00:18:32,00:18:34,"- Amidships, yes."
00:18:34,00:18:37,"- Well, it's to do with how bouncy the surface is,"
00:18:37,00:18:38,"as well, isn't it?"
00:18:38,00:18:39,"These days, it's very bouncy"
00:18:39,00:18:40,"because they're protected and stuff,"
00:18:40,00:18:41,"but if it was open to the elements all the time,"
00:18:41,00:18:43,the bounce could be variable.
00:18:43,00:18:44,"It's more likely to be lower and slower,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,so you'd be more likely to take one in the plums
00:18:46,00:18:47,than in the noggin.
00:18:47,00:18:49,(laughing)
00:18:49,00:18:53,"- Yeah, about 1850s was the Palmer's patent groin protector,"
00:18:53,00:18:54,"as it was called,"
00:18:54,00:18:56,before that you'd just stuff a hanky down there
00:18:56,00:18:57,to sort of improvise it.
00:18:57,00:18:59,But it was only in the 1970s.
00:18:59,00:19:01,- Was your hanky made out of Kevlar or what?
00:19:01,00:19:02,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:19:02,00:19:04,"- If it's a very well-used hanky,"
00:19:04,00:19:05,I think that can actually...
00:19:05,00:19:07,(laughing)
00:19:07,00:19:08,- By some point.
00:19:08,00:19:09,"- Well, it's hard to fold."
00:19:09,00:19:11,(laughing)
00:19:11,00:19:14,A heavy head cold actually does protect you
00:19:14,00:19:16,"in unpredictable ways, yeah."
00:19:16,00:19:17,- I suppose then you could have a sort of use the same one
00:19:17,00:19:19,as a kind of gumby hanky as the first crooked helmet.
00:19:19,00:19:20,(laughing)
00:19:20,00:19:22,It's very sort of snappy hanky tied in each corner.
00:19:22,00:19:25,- Would you ever commentate on cricket?
00:19:25,00:19:26,"Well, have you done?"
00:19:26,00:19:29,"- I think I have done online, just briefly."
00:19:29,00:19:32,"Yeah, it's quite an awesome responsibility,"
00:19:32,00:19:33,to be perfectly honest.
00:19:33,00:19:34,"If you're thinking other people can't see it,"
00:19:34,00:19:35,then I've really got to.
00:19:35,00:19:36,- Yeah.
00:19:36,00:19:37,"- You know, a bit like when you said it,"
00:19:37,00:19:38,"the drive in the left side,"
00:19:38,00:19:39,I can't see it over my left shoulder.
00:19:39,00:19:40,Can you tell me if there's anything coming down that hill?
00:19:40,00:19:41,(laughing)
00:19:41,00:19:43,"It's that sort of pressure, but for hours."
00:19:43,00:19:44,(laughing)
00:19:44,00:19:45,- It's days.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"- You know, there could be several countries where,"
00:19:46,00:19:48,and I've got to describe what's going on.
00:19:48,00:19:49,I think it's more high pressure work
00:19:49,00:19:50,than people imagine.
00:19:50,00:19:52,- I did read a description of what it's like
00:19:52,00:19:54,commentating on something like Test Match Special.
00:19:54,00:19:55,"I can't remember who it was who,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,"well, like one of the famous commentators said,"
00:19:57,00:20:00,"look, this is the apex of human civilization."
00:20:00,00:20:03,You are sitting observing a nice cricket match happening.
00:20:03,00:20:05,"People are sending in homemade cakes to you,"
00:20:05,00:20:06,which you can then review on there
00:20:06,00:20:08,"during a lull in play, basically."
00:20:08,00:20:09,- That the whole play is a lull.
00:20:09,00:20:12,"- Yeah, it's sort of breathing space."
00:20:12,00:20:14,"It's not like commentating on tennis or something like that,"
00:20:14,00:20:15,"which must be, you know, if you're a radio commentator"
00:20:15,00:20:18,"for tennis, that's horse racing or whatever."
00:20:18,00:20:21,"- Exactly, you know, your word per minute is just--"
00:20:21,00:20:23,"- Exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:20:23,00:20:26,"But this is, he was saying, I think, I think it was a he,"
00:20:26,00:20:30,"you are either, having to describe the immediate play,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,"which like, if there's something going on,"
00:20:32,00:20:34,"you need to explain that really clearly to the listener,"
00:20:34,00:20:34,"like you was saying, Miles."
00:20:34,00:20:36,"And then during the quieter bits,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,you're talking more about the overall shape of the game.
00:20:38,00:20:39,"And during the really quiet bits,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,you start talking about the grounds
00:20:41,00:20:43,and the whole history of cricket.
00:20:43,00:20:44,And so you've got three different modes
00:20:44,00:20:47,that you can switch between depending on what's going on.
00:20:47,00:20:48,"- Oh, you've got mode full,"
00:20:48,00:20:50,which is something completely unrelated.
00:20:50,00:20:51,"Have you guys ever seen the clip of,"
00:20:51,00:20:53,"it's the Australian commentator,"
00:20:53,00:20:54,"and he tells the joke that ends,"
00:20:54,00:20:57,"it's a knick-knack, paddy-whack, give the frog a loan?"
00:20:57,00:20:58,"Right, look at Google."
00:20:58,00:20:59,- It's O'Keefe.
00:20:59,00:21:01,"- It's O'Keefe, it's Kerio Keefe."
00:21:01,00:21:04,"And he's, and I can't remember who he's commentating with,"
00:21:04,00:21:05,but there's always a straight man
00:21:05,00:21:06,"who's actually commentating on the cricket,"
00:21:06,00:21:07,"and then, you know, someone more jokey."
00:21:07,00:21:10,And he's trying to tell this very long joke.
00:21:10,00:21:12,And the other commentator is trying to get in the way
00:21:12,00:21:14,and explain what's happening in the cricket.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"- And then every two minutes, he says, ""And there's no run."""
00:21:16,00:21:19,(all laughing)
00:21:19,00:21:21,- That's where you use your elbow
00:21:21,00:21:22,"to test the temperature of bath water, for instance,"
00:21:22,00:21:24,rather than your fingers aren't actually very sensitive
00:21:24,00:21:26,"to people with their hands and go, ""That's okay."""
00:21:26,00:21:27,But it's not actually...
00:21:27,00:21:29,- I feel like my hands are sensitive to temperature.
00:21:29,00:21:30,I thought it was that your elbow
00:21:30,00:21:32,is the bit of you that's most like a baby.
00:21:32,00:21:34,"- 'Cause I always wear gloves when it's cold,"
00:21:34,00:21:36,"I don't wear elbow patches, for instance."
00:21:36,00:21:37,"- Oh, well, you should, Joe."
00:21:37,00:21:39,You lose so much heat through your elbows.
00:21:39,00:21:41,"Yeah, yeah, but you're only,"
00:21:41,00:21:42,"but also you're down the skate park a lot,"
00:21:42,00:21:44,with full protective equipment.
00:21:44,00:21:45,"So they're elbow guards,"
00:21:45,00:21:47,you just don't think of them as gloves.
00:21:47,00:21:47,- Of course.
00:21:47,00:21:51,- What's the sport where it's two villages versus another
00:21:51,00:21:53,"and it is, there doesn't seem to be a limit on number,"
00:21:53,00:21:55,it is basically getting a ball from...
00:21:55,00:21:56,- Yeah.
00:21:56,00:21:56,"- There are two posts or something,"
00:21:56,00:21:57,and it's going from one to...
00:21:57,00:21:59,"- It's the oppies versus the downies,"
00:21:59,00:22:00,"or it's the uppers versus the downers,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,"and it's just like village football, really."
00:22:02,00:22:03,It's like old style.
00:22:03,00:22:05,"- But there's no limit on numbers, are there?"
00:22:05,00:22:05,"- No, no."
00:22:05,00:22:08,"Well, I think these days, the police limit, who can go."
00:22:08,00:22:09,(all laughing)
00:22:09,00:22:10,- Boo.
00:22:10,00:22:11,- Yeah.
00:22:11,00:22:13,"- That's with, I mean, the sort of sports"
00:22:13,00:22:15,"where there's a flexibility, like I didn't realise,"
00:22:15,00:22:18,"lacrosse, there's a sort of set length,"
00:22:18,00:22:20,or parameters where they went to the length
00:22:20,00:22:21,"of the lacrosse pitch must be,"
00:22:21,00:22:23,but actually there is no side boundary
00:22:23,00:22:25,that's entirely based on where you happen to be playing.
00:22:25,00:22:26,- Yeah.
00:22:26,00:22:27,"- So you can set off running in one direction,"
00:22:27,00:22:28,"and you can just keep going until there's an obstacle,"
00:22:28,00:22:30,"essentially, that doesn't get out."
00:22:30,00:22:31,"- Yeah, you know, yeah."
00:22:31,00:22:32,"- We used to do that at school,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,"when I played football in the playground,"
00:22:34,00:22:35,"you would have one goal,"
00:22:35,00:22:38,"and you'd have two teams shooting towards the same goal,"
00:22:38,00:22:39,and you would just get someone who would get the ball
00:22:39,00:22:42,and just run in the complete opposite direction
00:22:42,00:22:44,"with the ball, so everyone had to chase after them."
00:22:44,00:22:45,- It's quite long routes.
00:22:45,00:22:48,- 'Cause there's no boundaries.
00:22:48,00:22:50,- But that is true in official lacrosse rules.
00:22:50,00:22:51,I think it's just women's lacrosse.
00:22:51,00:22:53,"Weirdly, I think men's lacrosse does have boundaries,"
00:22:53,00:22:54,but women's lacrosse--
00:22:54,00:22:57,- Men need boundaries to explain to them.
00:22:57,00:22:59,"- Wasn't it something about, like,"
00:22:59,00:23:02,the earliest games of lacrosse had an insane number of people?
00:23:02,00:23:05,- The American Lacrosse Foundation claims
00:23:05,00:23:07,"the earliest games could have over 100,000 players."
00:23:07,00:23:08,- Stop it.
00:23:08,00:23:10,(laughing)
00:23:10,00:23:11,- And try commentating on that.
00:23:11,00:23:13,"- State of those changing rooms, as well."
00:23:13,00:23:15,(laughing)
00:23:15,00:23:17,- It's like the handshake before the game is gonna take--
00:23:17,00:23:19,(laughing)
00:23:19,00:23:21,"- It's a sort of roughy-toughy sport in America,"
00:23:21,00:23:22,"I think, isn't it, lacrosse?"
00:23:22,00:23:26,We might associate lacrosse with girls' boarding school.
00:23:26,00:23:26,"- Yeah, oh yeah."
00:23:26,00:23:31,"- In America, they'd be surprised if men played rugby."
00:23:31,00:23:33,"- Yeah, 'cause women's lacrosse and men's lacrosse"
00:23:33,00:23:34,"are just different games, aren't they?"
00:23:34,00:23:35,They have different rules.
00:23:35,00:23:36,"- Yeah, very different."
00:23:36,00:23:37,"- Yeah, totally different."
00:23:37,00:23:38,- But you wouldn't hear phrases
00:23:38,00:23:40,like roughy-toughy in the men's lacrosse
00:23:40,00:23:41,"that they play in America, for instance,"
00:23:41,00:23:44,whereas you might in the female boarding school
00:23:44,00:23:45,lacrosse that you play here.
00:23:45,00:23:47,I've never heard roughy-toughy before.
00:23:47,00:23:48,- It might not exist as a phrase.
00:23:48,00:23:49,"- Not a phrase, yeah."
00:23:49,00:23:51,- It might be some sort of post-surgery.
00:23:51,00:23:52,(laughing)
00:23:52,00:23:53,Think you should have bubbled up to the surface.
00:23:53,00:23:58,"- On animals, golden hamsters can navigate their way home,"
00:23:58,00:24:00,even when blindfolded and led in a complicated route
00:24:00,00:24:01,away from their nests.
00:24:01,00:24:02,- Can they?
00:24:02,00:24:04,"How do they do it, do we know?"
00:24:04,00:24:06,"- No, I don't think we do know."
00:24:06,00:24:07,"And it's really mysterious, isn't it?"
00:24:07,00:24:09,"'Cause some of these senses are not,"
00:24:09,00:24:10,we don't fully understand.
00:24:10,00:24:12,"So there's a thing called, what's it called,"
00:24:12,00:24:14,the reed warbler bird.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"And scientists wanted to disrupt,"
00:24:17,00:24:19,they thought they must be using the Earth's magnetic field.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"Okay, so we'll disrupt it."
00:24:20,00:24:23,So they attached small magnets
00:24:23,00:24:24,"to these birds' foreheads in an experiment,"
00:24:24,00:24:26,and they also blocked their view of the stars.
00:24:26,00:24:29,"And, obviously, they couldn't navigate."
00:24:29,00:24:30,(laughing)
00:24:30,00:24:32,I don't really know what that proves.
00:24:32,00:24:33,"- I mean, you see, the homing pigeons,"
00:24:33,00:24:35,they used to use in the war to work out
00:24:35,00:24:37,where sort of various ships were in things.
00:24:37,00:24:39,Because they'd have their homing instincts
00:24:39,00:24:41,and they would know that they would fly
00:24:41,00:24:43,at a very particular pace.
00:24:43,00:24:44,And they would know what time they were released.
00:24:44,00:24:46,"And so therefore, in the angle"
00:24:46,00:24:47,"from which they basically arrived,"
00:24:47,00:24:50,they could work out how far away from that distance.
00:24:50,00:24:51,- Really?
00:24:51,00:24:52,- You'd work out the mass backwards.
00:24:52,00:24:54,"So, right, they've arrived from over there."
00:24:54,00:24:56,"They set off at this time, so they must be there for that."
00:24:56,00:24:58,- I usually travel 20 miles an hour.
00:24:58,00:25:00,- But how do they know where they set off from?
00:25:00,00:25:02,'Cause they've got a note on them.
00:25:02,00:25:04,Or what time they set off?
00:25:04,00:25:06,"- Well, that information must be,"
00:25:06,00:25:07,"yes, I was gonna say that must be radio,"
00:25:07,00:25:08,but then presumably the people were radioing
00:25:08,00:25:10,and say where they were.
00:25:10,00:25:11,"But maybe there's so many,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,"maybe everything, any radio signal you send"
00:25:13,00:25:15,"can be intercepted, but not."
00:25:15,00:25:15,"- I'm not gonna tell you where we are,"
00:25:15,00:25:17,but it's 7.58 and I'm releasing the pigeons.
00:25:17,00:25:20,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, make of that what you will."
00:25:20,00:25:21,(laughing)
00:25:21,00:25:22,"- Good luck with that, Hitler, yeah."
00:25:22,00:25:25,"Oh dear, Keith has gone off on one."
00:25:25,00:25:26,(laughing)
00:25:26,00:25:27,They were genuinely useful.
00:25:27,00:25:29,And they were sort of called up.
00:25:29,00:25:31,People that were sort of looked after pigeons
00:25:31,00:25:33,"would suddenly, they would hide him on for them."
00:25:33,00:25:36,"- Yeah, suddenly went from being complete weirdo loners"
00:25:36,00:25:38,to very sought after people.
00:25:38,00:25:39,I'm so sorry.
00:25:39,00:25:40,- Oh my God.
00:25:40,00:25:42,"- That's not how I feel about pigeon fancies, really."
00:25:42,00:25:44,- Half our audience are in the pigeon loft at the moment.
00:25:44,00:25:45,- I know.
00:25:45,00:25:49,"I've got on satire, you know, Tatler,"
00:25:49,00:25:51,we're all subscribers.
00:25:51,00:25:52,"- Of course, yeah."
00:25:52,00:25:54,- That was meant to be satirical.
00:25:54,00:25:55,(laughing)
00:25:55,00:25:56,It was meant to be taking the piss.
00:25:56,00:25:57,"- Can you explain what it is, sorry,"
00:25:57,00:26:00,for those of us who grew up in Bolton?
00:26:00,00:26:01,- Sorry.
00:26:01,00:26:03,It's really not your area.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"- It's not the world of interiors, but about people."
00:26:05,00:26:07,(laughing)
00:26:07,00:26:09,"- So yes, Tatler for International Listeners"
00:26:09,00:26:11,and anyone who's more civilized
00:26:11,00:26:14,is basically a magazine for high society.
00:26:14,00:26:17,It's like photographs of people
00:26:17,00:26:18,who aren't quite the royal family
00:26:18,00:26:20,"'cause they probably can't get access to them,"
00:26:20,00:26:22,but who are mates with the royal family having weddings.
00:26:22,00:26:24,"- Is it Tatler that's got on the,"
00:26:24,00:26:25,it's sort of on the back page.
00:26:25,00:26:27,"There's always like a, it's not a high street honey,"
00:26:27,00:26:30,"but it's kind of a, it's like an eligible young lady"
00:26:30,00:26:32,who is engaged.
00:26:32,00:26:33,"I think maybe that's it is like,"
00:26:33,00:26:34,look at this beautiful young woman.
00:26:34,00:26:35,She's just gone engaged.
00:26:35,00:26:36,You can't get together with her.
00:26:36,00:26:36,"- Oh, right."
00:26:36,00:26:37,- Is that it?
00:26:37,00:26:38,- Probably that's it.
00:26:38,00:26:39,"- I mean, it doesn't sound like"
00:26:39,00:26:40,any other magazine would have that.
00:26:40,00:26:42,"- Yeah, like Country Life has a sort of,"
00:26:42,00:26:43,- Yeah.
00:26:43,00:26:44,- Made in the month.
00:26:44,00:26:45,"- Maybe it's Country Life, I'm thinking of that,"
00:26:45,00:26:48,"but yes, it's a sort of an arty black and white photo."
00:26:48,00:26:49,- Yes.
00:26:49,00:26:51,- And sometimes I think it's like single and looking.
00:26:51,00:26:52,- Really?
00:26:52,00:26:54,"- And free, available in your area,"
00:26:54,00:26:55,all that kind of thing.
00:26:55,00:26:57,- This is the page three of--
00:26:57,00:26:59,- Except it's page like 128
00:26:59,00:27:01,'cause of all the adverts for posh watches in between.
00:27:01,00:27:01,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:01,00:27:02,- And it's a monthly publication.
00:27:02,00:27:04,So it doesn't work in the way that sort of Metro used to have
00:27:04,00:27:06,I saw yesterday on the 802 Convox Law or something.
00:27:06,00:27:08,"But it'd be like, I think I saw you back,"
00:27:08,00:27:09,it must have been about four months ago.
00:27:09,00:27:11,(all laughing)
00:27:11,00:27:12,I think you admired my plowing.
00:27:12,00:27:13,(all laughing)
00:27:13,00:27:14,- That's disgusting.
00:27:14,00:27:15,- My else.
00:27:15,00:27:16,(all laughing)
00:27:16,00:27:17,- Rude of me.
00:27:17,00:27:18,Yeah.
00:27:18,00:27:19,(all laughing)
00:27:19,00:27:19,"- Yeah, so what about--"
00:27:19,00:27:20,"- Anyway, well, oh yeah, sorry."
00:27:20,00:27:23,"It was founded by a guy called Richard Steele,"
00:27:23,00:27:27,who called himself Isaac Bickerstaff when he edited Tatler.
00:27:27,00:27:29,"And Isaac Bickerstaff, actually,"
00:27:29,00:27:30,"you'll remember the name, James."
00:27:30,00:27:31,"- I do know the name, but why?"
00:27:31,00:27:36,"- It was because Jonathan Swift once published in 1708,"
00:27:36,00:27:38,"so another great, the other great probably satirist"
00:27:38,00:27:41,"of the time, published the Almanac Predictions of the Year"
00:27:41,00:27:43,writing as Isaac Bickerstaff.
00:27:43,00:27:46,And he predicted the death of this astrologer
00:27:46,00:27:48,and society person called John Partridge.
00:27:48,00:27:49,And he predicted it on April the 1st.
00:27:49,00:27:51,It was an April Fool's joke.
00:27:51,00:27:52,"And this poor guy, John Partridge,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,"who was a bit of a butt of jokes,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,spent the rest of his life trying to convince people
00:27:56,00:27:57,he wasn't dead.
00:27:57,00:27:59,And Norm was turned up.
00:27:59,00:28:02,"And he wrote a letter saying, ""I'm not dead."""
00:28:02,00:28:04,"And Jonathan Swift said, ""Well, that's a hoax,"
00:28:04,00:28:06,"'cause he is, you know, I've seen the body made."""
00:28:06,00:28:08,"- Oh, it was an unkind time."
00:28:08,00:28:11,A lot of sick burns being dished out all over the place.
00:28:11,00:28:12,"Like saying, ""One of the Irish are so hungry,"
00:28:12,00:28:14,"""why don't they just eat their babies?"""
00:28:14,00:28:15,Which was during the famine.
00:28:15,00:28:17,And it was incredibly harsh satire.
00:28:17,00:28:21,"- Imagine that, 'cause it sounds bad now,"
00:28:21,00:28:25,"but in the middle of the famine, it's actually even worse."
00:28:25,00:28:25,- It was bad.
00:28:25,00:28:26,- It's pitch black satire.
00:28:26,00:28:28,"- I kind of draw attention to the famine,"
00:28:28,00:28:30,"and you know, the awful cruelty that has caused it."
00:28:30,00:28:32,"But he's, you know, he's doing so through grief."
00:28:32,00:28:34,"- These days, there's not enough nuance on Twitter"
00:28:34,00:28:35,for people to get that.
00:28:35,00:28:37,I don't think if he'd have done it today.
00:28:37,00:28:39,"- It's been sort of foremost satirist of your time,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,"just to be considered an edgelord,"
00:28:41,00:28:42,with the absolute sort of brute force.
00:28:42,00:28:44,It's nuanced for heavens sake.
00:28:44,00:28:48,"- One of you try, we're doing down the people."
00:28:48,00:28:50,I want one of you to tweet something
00:28:50,00:28:53,about a group of people eating babies today
00:28:53,00:28:54,and see what happens to you.
00:28:54,00:28:56,- I'm not on Twitter.
00:28:56,00:28:57,- So one of you two.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"- On Twitter, it'll go down a storm these days."
00:28:59,00:29:00,I can show you that.
00:29:00,00:29:01,(all laughing)
00:29:01,00:29:02,- I could put it in a WhatsApp group.
00:29:02,00:29:05,(all laughing)
00:29:05,00:29:06,- Just see.
00:29:06,00:29:07,- Yes.
00:29:07,00:29:08,- The Christmas one's gone quiet.
00:29:08,00:29:10,(all laughing)
00:29:10,00:29:11,- Just out of the blue.
00:29:11,00:29:13,"Oh, what's Mars up to?"
00:29:13,00:29:14,Oh.
00:29:14,00:29:16,- What are we thinking this year?
00:29:16,00:29:18,"- Another pseudonym, John Barron."
00:29:18,00:29:19,Do you know this one?
00:29:19,00:29:20,"- No. - John Barron, no."
00:29:20,00:29:22,- How do you know the name Barron?
00:29:22,00:29:22,- Barron.
00:29:22,00:29:25,"- Is it Barron, or Barron, like, childless?"
00:29:25,00:29:26,B-A-D-R-O-N.
00:29:26,00:29:27,- The Barron Knights.
00:29:27,00:29:28,- Who's a famous Barron these days.
00:29:28,00:29:29,- Barron Trump.
00:29:29,00:29:30,- Yes.
00:29:30,00:29:32,"So Donald Trump's pseudonym, John Barron."
00:29:32,00:29:37,"So when Forbes were doing the richest people list,"
00:29:37,00:29:39,"John Barron wrote to them saying,"
00:29:39,00:29:40,"oh, you've got to put Trump in here."
00:29:40,00:29:41,He's a billionaire.
00:29:41,00:29:42,- No.
00:29:42,00:29:43,"- Yeah, and he's got a few others."
00:29:43,00:29:46,"There's a guy called John Miller,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,who once wrote to People magazine
00:29:48,00:29:50,"who'd said something about Trump saying,"
00:29:50,00:29:53,"""Actually, Trump is a very compassionate husband,"
00:29:53,00:29:55,and lots of beautiful women
00:29:55,00:29:56,are always asking to go out with him.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"In fact, Madonna called and wanted to go out with him."
00:29:58,00:30:00,"That, I could tell you."""
00:30:00,00:30:02,- But what makes you think that's one of his pseudonyms?
00:30:02,00:30:04,"- We, it came out in court later."
00:30:04,00:30:05,(laughing)
00:30:05,00:30:06,"- Oh, that's devastating, mate."
00:30:06,00:30:13,"- Okay, that's it."
00:30:13,00:30:15,That is all of our outtakes.
00:30:15,00:30:17,"If you have anything to say about them,"
00:30:17,00:30:20,if you want to share any extra juicy bits of detail
00:30:20,00:30:21,"that you know about them,"
00:30:21,00:30:25,you can message us on podcast@qi.com.
00:30:25,00:30:27,"Those emails go through to Andy,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,and a lot of those emails then get taken over
00:30:29,00:30:31,to Drop Us a Line where we discuss them.
00:30:31,00:30:34,"So send us your favorite facts, send us an anecdote,"
00:30:34,00:30:37,"send us anything that you think is worth sharing,"
00:30:37,00:30:40,and hopefully it can make it onto Drop Us a Line.
00:30:40,00:30:42,"Just a reminder, no such thing as a fish.com."
00:30:42,00:30:46,"You got the ticket link for all of our upcoming gigs,"
00:30:46,00:30:47,"and two in particular,"
00:30:47,00:30:48,which is the London Podcast Festival
00:30:48,00:30:51,"that's gonna be happening near King's Cross at King's Place,"
00:30:51,00:30:54,and that is the 5th and 6th of September.
00:30:54,00:30:56,"So get your tickets now, and that's it."
