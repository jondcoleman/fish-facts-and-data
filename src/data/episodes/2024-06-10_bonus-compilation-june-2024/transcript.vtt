00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.360
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's bit of bonus material.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.800
 Before we get into it, we have a very special announcement for the people of Sydney.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.280
 And that is that due to the unbelievable number of tickets that you bought for the Sydney Opera House,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.040
 we have announced another show and people of Club Fish get tickets first.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.040
 That's right, we are doing a pre-sale on Wednesday the 12th of June,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.080
 all the way to the morning of Friday the 14th of June,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.520
 whereby the tickets will then go on general sale, but if you want to get in quick,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.600
 head to knowsuchthingasoffish.com/sidney, head there on the 12th of June to get tickets.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.960
 We're going to be playing at the State Theatre and it's November the 10th.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.160
 And for those of you who are not in Sydney but are in, let's say, London,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.600
 you have also done an amazing job of selling out our show at the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.200
 And so we can't let you guys down, we have put another show on in London as well.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.440
 It's on the 24th of October at the Theatre Royal and Drury Lane,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.560
 and just like Sydney, pre-sale tickets will go on sale on Wednesday the 12th of June,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.920
 and you can access them by going to knowsuchthingasoffish.com/london.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.680
 You'll have until Friday the 14th of June before they go on general sale,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.200
 so once again, get in there quick and visit knowsuchthingasoffish.com/london

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.400
 on Wednesday the 12th of June to get your pre-sale tickets for our second show in London.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.800
 That's right. Okay, let's get on to this week's bonus compilation episode full of

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.160
 outtakes and bits that just didn't quite make it into the main episode.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.160
 You're going to hear a lot from Alex Bell, you're going to hear from Erica McAllister,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.720
 and of course you're going to hear from us four regular fishers.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.760
 So here we go, hope you enjoy it, and on with the show.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.880
 On with the podcast.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:02:05.200
 [Music]

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.120
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of knowsuchthingasoffish,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.120
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the Kiwai offices in Hoban.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.160
 My name is Alex Bell, and I'm joined by Anna Zhizinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.120
 James Hawkin, and once again, we are gathered round the microphone,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.480
 and once again, we are gathered round the microphone to share our four favourite

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.400
 facts from the last seven days, so in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.800
 I fucking nailed it. I mean, you can edit out the bits that I fumbled.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.440
 Yeah, you were annoyingly good at it.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.920
 Like, we only asked you to do this because we thought you'd fucking up.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.360
 Do we always say microphone singular now?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.640
 I think we say plural.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.320
 Sorry, gathered round the microphones.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.920
 If we're being precise, yeah.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.520
 Okay, I think you did pretty well, Alex.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.320
 I think it's sort of cuter if there's an image of us all gathered round one microphone.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.800
 Lady in the Tramps spaghetti.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.200
 My favourite part was where you almost forgot Andy's name.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.840
 Yeah, that was the best one for a few weeks, but...

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.040
 Ants are pretty extraordinary with how they use pheromones,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.840
 and how they mess up using pheromones, because they've...

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.840
 I don't think we've talked about antmills before.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.600
 But they... Ants basically army ants follow each other

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.840
 based on the pheromones that the bloke in front of them,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.600
 or the lady in front of them is releasing.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.080
 And so they'll follow each other to their food or wherever they're headed.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.800
 To the picnic.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.760
 To the picnic.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.480
 But sometimes the pheromone trail will get broken up,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.400
 and then they get very confused.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.400
 And so, you know, the leaders disappeared.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.760
 They don't know what direction they're going in,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.520
 and they all start following each other.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.520
 And they end up going round in this circle,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.360
 in this what is literally called a death spiral, until they die of exhaustion.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.280
 They just keep following each other round and round and round.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.640
 This happened to me a few weeks ago.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.760
 We were on a night out, and we were going from a bar to a bowling alley,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.080
 and no one was paying attention to who was following who,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.840
 and we went round Bloomsley Square like three times.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.480
 Following each other's smelly ounces.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.320
 No, we just kept following the person who was quite far in front of us,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.600
 we were all having our own conversations,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.840
 and then eventually someone was like, "Where are we going?"

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.400
 So, what was that woman in Iceland?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.440
 Do you remember where she went missing?

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.800
 And there was a load of people went out looking for her,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.360
 and then she didn't know that they were looking for her,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.400
 and she saw a load of people looking for someone as though she just joined.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.960
 And they said, "Who are you looking for?"

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.960
 They're like, "Oh, it looks, someone who looks a bit like you."

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.320
 She's like, "Oh, I'll keep my eyes open."

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.440
 I'm sure you read the medical report on Wasabi.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.440
 This was from about four years ago.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.320
 It's from 2019.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.360
 It was a woman, it was in the British Medical Journal case reports.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.120
 It was a woman who had been into wedding,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.120
 and had eaten a large quantity.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.160
 It said, it didn't specify how much, of green material,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.160
 which she naturally assumed was avocado, guacamole, something like that.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.520
 And it was actually Wasabi.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.320
 It doesn't specify whether it was horseradish Wasabi or proper Wasabi,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.640
 but it was too much to have.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.680
 And she began experiencing chest pains,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.560
 which remained for a few hours.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.640
 And eventually, I think, went to see a doctor,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.360
 and she was diagnosed with a serious stress-induced heart condition.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.160
 It's this, we've probably mentioned it.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.760
 It's called broken heart syndrome.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.400
 It's Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 It's where your heart muscles literally can't pump blood.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.160
 It's really, it can be really serious,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.120
 and it's caused because your body floods with stress hormones,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.200
 and it inhibits the proper functioning of your heart.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.520
 So was it caused by the Wasabi,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.320
 or was it just discovered because she'd gone to get it checked out?

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.960
 It seems that it was caused by the Wasabi causing a lot of stress hormones.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.080
 That seems to be the case.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.320
 It's not, obviously, it can't be proved beyond doubt.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.120
 She'd just been dumped,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.440
 so she was eating anything she could find in the fridge through her tears,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.480
 and that's why she had broken heart syndrome.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.680
 She was at a wedding at the time,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.920
 when she saw this huge mound of green matter.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.720
 And what would you think?

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.800
 You would just think that is clearly avocados.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.920
 I'm, as a single-

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.120
 She's sushi at the time.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.440
 Because for sugar, they don't just put Wasabi in the middle of a table.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.720
 It is, I do wonder how much she's just gozzling down,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.360
 going, "This avocado does, it's a bit tangy, isn't it?"

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.920
 Oh, come on, you're single, you're at a wedding, you're drunk.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.160
 You're like, "I'm not finding love here, I'm miserable,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.520
 I might as well make the most of this evening

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.880
 and get as much in the buffet as I can."

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.360
 Mice produce lots of pheromones,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.440
 and in their tears they do,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.120
 and mouse tears are a turn-on, sexually.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.920
 A two other mice.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.240
 To me.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.280
 Two other mice.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.480
 Yes, so they produce tears to wet their eyeballs,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.480
 and they almost...

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.520
 I'm so bad.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.560
 For internationalism, isn't it?

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.400
 Crying is when...

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.000
 I've got another pheromone use by...

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.160
 This is bees, specifically being tricked by pheromones.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.360
 You've got a burrowing bees.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.400
 There are loads of kinds of bees.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.200
 These ones, they burrow, live and burrow.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.840
 Anyway.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.120
 Or are you Mikaela Strachan?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.600
 Sweat down.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.000
 Again, it's an impeccably old brand mine,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.360
 there are these blister beetles, right,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.360
 which they're much smaller than bees,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.880
 and they're parasitic on them.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.720
 And they release a pheromone, the beetles,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.040
 designed to trick male burrowing bees

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.600
 into thinking that there is a hot lady bee

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.680
 in their area looking for sex.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.440
 This is a pop-up ad parasite, yeah?

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.560
 It's basically a pop-up ad.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.680
 So it's like, oh, like bees are near you,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.800
 and they want it.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.840
 And the male goes and looks, and the beetles,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.000
 the burrowing beetles, the very young ones,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.400
 they have climbed up a strand of grass,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.760
 and they have formed a ball

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.240
 the size of a female burrowing bee.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.800
 So the male turns up, sees, aha, there's my date.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.320
 It's not a date, it's a ball of parasitic beetles.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.240
 Oh my God, this is insane.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.120
 It's insane.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.200
 They all have grappling hook claws.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.480
 They wrestle the bee.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.680
 The bee falls to the ground.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.760
 He's now covered in these horrible parasites.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.680
 He's had an awful experience.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.360
 Then they're hitching a lift on him.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.720
 So he's now covered in these parasites.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.400
 Eventually, the male does find a female.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.160
 All the parasites latch onto her.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.440
 They ride off to a burrow.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.800
 Not very picky female.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.320
 Yeah, no.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.280
 So now she lays the eggs, she lays her egg or her eggs,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.800
 and she leaves a load of nice sugar and pollen and all of that,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.640
 you know, stuff for the egg to eat.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.400
 The beetles just eat all the food,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.960
 and the egg doesn't get its food.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.800
 These beetles can target their pheromones

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.840
 to different types of bee.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.440
 So clever.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.720
 What happens to the male bee?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.760
 I'm actually just carried on.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.760
 I'd love to do this again sometime.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.040
 I had a really nice evening.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.840
 Get some Uber.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.800
 Never knew it was three beetles in a trench coat.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.920
 Back down in the ocean, another nitrogen-related scheme,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.920
 in the 1970s, I was just looking up different uses for liquid nitrogen,

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.160
 which include many things like they're in crisp packets

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.240
 because they preserve freshness because they don't react to crisp.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.520
 That's not liquid, of course.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:39.920
 No, sorry.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.720
 This is what I'm just talking about.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.200
 Other different uses of nitrogen, all its forms.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.320
 It's also interestingly used.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.080
 I didn't know it was used in binoculars and telescopes

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.920
 because it stops fogging because there's no, you know,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.640
 you need to basically fill the void with something that's completely inert.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.640
 So you can't get any water vapor in there.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.360
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.680
 And it's also the gas that they use for the MMU,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.000
 which is basically the jet pack that astronauts used to zoom around in space.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.120
 They only used it a few times.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.680
 Really?

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.120
 But another used liquid nitrogen,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.280
 which obviously exists at a very low temperature.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.280
 There was a plan to go down to the wreck of the Titanic in the 1970s,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.720
 freeze it with liquid nitrogen, essentially turning it into a massive,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.320
 ironic iceberg itself and then floating it to the surface

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.960
 and so getting it by bringing it up in ice.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.800
 Oh, not then crashing another ship into it?

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.800
 No, no, I think, I mean, that would be awful.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.080
 A ship crashing into the Titanic.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.120
 We're going to need more nitrogen.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.080
 We're going to have to make a third iceberg to get the next one up.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.440
 Horrible Jane reaction.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.880
 Wow, that's a great idea.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.360
 Is it?

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.400
 Didn't happen.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.720
 Is it?

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.720
 The first example of narcolepsy in the medical records

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.080
 was a bookbinder in Cooper from Westphal in 1877.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.960
 And this was written up by a guy called Jean-Baptiste-Edouard Galinot.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.520
 And he said that this bookbinder had collapsed at the zoo

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.000
 after observing monkeys making faces.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.680
 So basically, and quite often this kind of,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.000
 this illness happens when you have,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.440
 when you're laughing or when you, you know, that kind of thing.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.800
 At times of heightened emotion.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.760
 Yeah, exactly that.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.560
 Interesting.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.440
 Right, you tell me a part of that next time you're in bed together.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.560
 Of course you had times of fight over the metal.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.760
 And I read a paper in the Journal of Pediatrics and Child Health

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.760
 that says Rip Van Winkle might have had narcolepsy.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.160
 He fell asleep under a tree for 20 years.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.160
 That's a long bat, isn't it?

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.280
 It seems unlikely, right?

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.560
 But they gave a lot of different fairy tales

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.320
 and maybe decided what illnesses they might have had.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.400
 What a waste of time.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.760
 I hate it when people do this.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.240
 Me too.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.200
 Well, you're not going to like the next 30 seconds.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.640
 So the giant in Jack and the Beanstalk.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.040
 Petuitary gland.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.680
 Exactly right.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.760
 He obviously has a pituitary tumour

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.160
 because it not only causes giganticism,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.080
 but it also affects his vision

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.160
 because he says he can smell the blood of the Englishman

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.600
 but he can't see the Englishman.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.120
 Okay.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.360
 Yeah.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.920
 The grandmother of Red Riding Hood.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.680
 This is in a cupboard or she's eaten by wolf?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.080
 Well, that's not a medical condition.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.000
 Maybe she has late stage lupus erythematosus.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.680
 Oh, well, we're saying that she looks like the wolf.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.320
 She is the wolf.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.200
 She looks like the wolf and probably would be in bed.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.640
 Because she's the wolf.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.440
 Because she's got lupus.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.160
 Fuck it, I'm sorry.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.000
 This is such a good argument for cutting funding

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.280
 from so many places.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.680
 Like, who is sitting like doing a paper on this?

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.600
 But Red Riding Hood is not about a grandmother

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.320
 who looks like a wolf.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:42.640
 No, it's not.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.080
 The wolf disguises itself as a grandmother.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.440
 That's what she thinks.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.680
 But actually, it perhaps it's the grandmother

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.800
 just looks like a wolf.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.920
 What's more likely that the grandmother has lupus

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.000
 or that the wolf has somehow anthropomorphised

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.760
 and decided to take over the grandmother's place?

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.480
 That's a good point.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.400
 No, it's really, these academics, they know what they're talking about.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.840
 The grandmother probably also has exophilmus

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.720
 vocal cord nodules and a pituitary tumour

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.080
 because what big eye she has,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.560
 what a deep voice she has and what big hand she has.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.280
 Doesn't the story end with her being alive

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.240
 inside the wolf and saying,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.000
 "Help, I'm inside," and then Red Riding Hood cuts her out.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Or the woodcutter comes along with a big accent.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.280
 Like, so how do you explain that?

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.040
 Well, the woodcutter obviously has gotten

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.000
 the wrong edge of a stick.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.680
 And this poor, sick grandmother has also been killed.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.960
 There'll be a grandmother somewhere in here.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.360
 I know it.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:35.440
 Can I just only think about the dust in the Amazon?

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:35.680
 Yeah.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.560
 This is amazing.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.840
 So I really love this.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.600
 Lots of the dust in the Amazon

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.080
 and that fertilises the Amazon comes from the Sahara

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.720
 and it fertilises the, it keeps the soil fertile basically.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.360
 It's about 40 million tonnes of dust a year,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.560
 if you can imagine that.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.800
 It's a huge, it's a lot.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.800
 This is the other amazing thing about it, right?

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.360
 There was a study in 2007 that found

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.120
 that more than half of this dust,

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.600
 56% of it, comes from one place in Chad.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.360
 It's called the Bodele Depression.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.840
 It's a tiny, it's a tiny place.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.240
 It's 0.2% of the Sahara produces 56% of the dust

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.760
 that keeps the Amazon fertile.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.040
 Just because of weather movements?

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.960
 It's because of weather and it's because of the shape of it.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.040
 So the depression is between two mountain ridges

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.040
 and it's basically a great big funnel.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.440
 And so it accelerates the flow of air through it.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.040
 It produces 700,000 tonnes of dust a day.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.760
 I imagine just having a house there

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.760
 and every day doing the hoovering.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.960
 Oh my god.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.040
 There's another 700,000 tonnes of dust.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.560
 But again, I mean this shows you all the connectivity.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.360
 So every year, four billion hoverflies turn up in the UK

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.120
 and they've migrated across.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.400
 So there's a lot of immigrants coming into the UK regularly.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.880
 Is that from France, like from Europe?

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.920
 North Africa?

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.000
 They even think in sub-Saharan African insects make it up.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.600
 And you're saying they've migrated just temporarily.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.720
 They've migrated seasonally.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.120
 Or they've come here to stay, they've got their visas.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.520
 They've come here, they've met the locals.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.680
 They've copulated, they've produced very fecund,

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.440
 well the ladies have been very fecund

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.880
 because of these immigrants.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.000
 And they're doing wonders over here, pollinating our crops,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.200
 getting rid of our pests.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.680
 Hoverflies.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.720
 How did they get here?

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.280
 Because there's not...

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:15.360
 Why?

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.800
 No, yes.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.520
 Okay, second question.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.320
 Okay, sorry.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.440
 I would have thought like they would need a prevailing wind.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.520
 Ah, so they do.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.120
 And so they are doing a lot of studies now

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.760
 on how they get here and which winds they take and whatever.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.960
 And they will angle themselves within these winds,

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.520
 sorry, to make sure they're going the right direction.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.520
 So you know those times every now and then,

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.440
 like every couple of years,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.280
 everyone gets loads of sand on their cars

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.680
 because there's a wind coming up from the Sahara.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.600
 And is that also full of these flies, you reckon?

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.480
 Everything will be, yeah.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.080
 So it'll be really...

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.120
 And again, this is what...

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.040
 So you think about the Amazon and things like that

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.360
 and how all these species are moved around.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.520
 It's really changing our understanding

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.920
 of how animals move, how things migrate.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.200
 And a lot of species we used to think were very...

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.400
 kept in very small areas.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:04.880
 And now we're like...

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.720
 Because I just...

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.680
 So my most exciting thing recently

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.720
 was collecting flies from the La Brea Tarpits in California.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.800
 Oh, that's cool. I've been there.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.600
 Oh, my God.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.440
 I don't really know what a tarpit is.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.960
 No, it's exactly what it sounds like.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.960
 Imagine a pit full of tarp.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.800
 Right, so a tarpit.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.680
 Yeah, and like...

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.280
 Are you a mispronouncing carpet?

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:25.520
 Yeah.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.680
 Oh, good news, you've got a flying tarpit.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.600
 Oh, disgusting, horrible.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.280
 These are the amazing...

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.960
 So this is like the La Brea Tarpits

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.680
 are where they found all loads and loads

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.840
 of Smilodon and things like that.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.160
 So they're like the same type of tigers.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.880
 Mammoths and...

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.800
 And mammoths, loads of mammoths and all sorts.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.640
 But there's also a fly that lives in them.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.000
 You always want the weird thing

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.840
 that lives on the huge thing, don't you?

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.400
 Yeah.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.720
 But no, so it's learned to live on tar.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.640
 So the larvae live in the tarpits.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.680
 Oh, I see.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.640
 But the only other places these tarpits are found

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.080
 are in Trinidad and I believe Peru.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.080
 And it's like, is this one species?

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.640
 Oh, wow.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.520
 Found that far with distribution.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.800
 So it's just bonded to some tar on holiday.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.920
 But this is it.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.840
 I mean, you know, no, I don't know yet.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.040
 The genetics haven't been done.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.720
 Are these isolated populations?

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.360
 Yeah.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.000
 Or is there more movement going on

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.280
 than we originally thought?

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.240
 That's really interesting.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.200
 I mean, I don't know.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.320
 I could be completely wrong.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.400
 I went to those tarpits and it said

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.800
 that almost all the animals in them were male.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.520
 And the reason being that males are more stupid

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.720
 than females and the males would go in

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.680
 and then get stuck.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.320
 Whereas the females would not go in and get stuck

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.560
 because they'd realized that there was a problem here.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.160
 And then what would happen is one animal

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.280
 would get stuck in there, like a gazelle or something.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.760
 And then all the other male animals would come along

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.960
 and go, oh, a gazelle, great.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.280
 And then they would go in and then they would get stuck.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.520
 And then someone else would go, oh, a smiley done, great.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.040
 And then they would get stuck.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.200
 It's the old woman who lived in a tarpit.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:57.440
 Yeah.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.080
 Do you know Captain Morgan?

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.160
 Not personally, but yeah.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.560
 He has a spiced and an ordinary rum.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:06.800
 Yes.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.320
 He has got loads of varieties of rum.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.440
 Well, do you know how he can save you

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.880
 if you have a dislocated hip?

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.240
 Drink enough rum.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.160
 You forget the hip.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.040
 Is that it?

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.520
 Not that.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.000
 Okay.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.600
 What do you know about Captain Morgan?

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.720
 Have you ever drank it, Erica?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.440
 I've drunk it.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.000
 Yeah.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.480
 Can you remember anything about it?

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.400
 About the bottle, for instance?

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.280
 He's wearing a hat.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.480
 He's got a wooden leg.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.600
 Yeah.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.440
 What stance is he in?

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.880
 Now, it's a podcast, so just you showing us.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.080
 Yeah, well, I know, I know.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:36.880
 But I'm like, okay.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.520
 So he hasn't even got his arms on his hips like that.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.800
 And jaunty.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.680
 He is very jaunty.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.880
 And his leg.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.800
 Yeah, he's got his little wooden low leg.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.160
 And another leg is standing on a barrel.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.720
 So he's kind of got one leg on a barrel

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.080
 and he's standing like that.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.040
 And apparently this Captain Morgan technique

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.800
 is a way, if someone's got a dislocated hip,

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.480
 you stand like Captain Morgan with your leg

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.960
 sort of slightly higher than the other one.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:10.560
 And you lift them up and you can sort of pop it back into place.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.760
 But you lift the leg up.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.160
 You put your leg onto a bed like Captain Morgan

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.440
 might be standing on a barrel.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.480
 And that's the patient.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.440
 No, you're doing that.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.320
 And then you drape the patient's leg over yours,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.800
 lift your leg up and it pops the hip into place.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.400
 Right.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.320
 And is that an improvement on the previous?

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.760
 I've no idea what the previous method of

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.600
 relocating your hip is.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.280
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.800
 I think what you would do is you would kind of

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.760
 crawl onto the bed and try and move it like that.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.920
 It sounds like an improvement.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.720
 It is an improvement.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.320
 Wow.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.360
 Okay, good to know.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.800
 Because it sounds like the position

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.720
 in which you'd give your children a smacked bottom

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.400
 that traditionally.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:46.960
 Yeah.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.320
 I've got that strange, like weird superpower

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.280
 where you can stretch.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.480
 It's the, you know, which I dislocate regularly.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.800
 And so I was born with dislocated hips.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.040
 And maybe that's, my parents would just,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.400
 yeah, just maybe I wasn't born with dislocated hips.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.320
 Maybe that's why you like rum so much.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.200
 Well, this is it.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.360
 I dislocated my shoulder and then popped it back in.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.440
 Yeah, I know, and hindsight.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:07.920
 Painful.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.920
 May have been some alcohol.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.560
 Oh, right.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.840
 But yes, it was not.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.800
 It's all of these.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.040
 So my knees used to dislocate everything.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.360
 So I should have just drunk rum from an early age.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.520
 You're like one of those puppets

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.840
 where you press a button and they collapse all the time.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.000
 So I always think it was a really bad superhero.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.040
 Like, a car would crash into me and I'd just go, yeah.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.840
 And it would be like that.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.160
 And I'd be like, oh, it's not really a lot I could do with it.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:35.920
 So in Dominica, we have several different types of rum.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.680
 Some of them have different potencies.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.920
 In terms of aphrodisiacs.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.360
 We don't think, I think it's just the advertising.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.560
 Do they add stuff to it?

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.640
 No, but there's just sexy women on the label.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.160
 Yeah, I thought I'd do it though.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.040
 Yeah, you know.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.880
 Probably the only proven aphrodisiac.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.480
 Drink rum and it improves your sex drive.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.560
 Mine all has either the Royal Navy flag or Captain Morgan,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.160
 neither of which I find especially.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.760
 You've had plenty of rum in your life,

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.520
 but very little sodomy or lash.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:13.600
 You can't be in a lift with liquid nitrogen.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.720
 No, walk it.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.080
 Because it's very awkward conversation.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.360
 That's true because we had some on QI

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.560
 and we had to send it up in the lift by itself

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.640
 and we were running up the stairs trying to get it.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.960
 Now you're not really supposed to do that either.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.000
 So anyone listening has ever taken any liquid nitrogen anywhere.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.720
 What you need to do is you need to put it in the lift,

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.880
 press the button, leg it out,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.440
 and then tell someone who's already on the next floor

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.480
 that it's on its way up.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.600
 But what if someone like halfway up presses the button

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.800
 and the lift stops in the way?

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.960
 I think you have to make sure that that doesn't happen as well.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.360
 But yeah, and the reason you don't run up

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.360
 is let's say you trip up on the way,

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.200
 then suddenly you've just got nitrogen.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.040
 An injury and a deadly lift.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.800
 But it's sealed.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.080
 Yeah, so I think it's in case of a leak.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.920
 And we should probably explain the reason why

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.920
 is because nitrogen is heavier than air.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.520
 If you release nitrogen, it will come out in a massive cloud,

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.360
 force all the air up and there'll be no breathable air.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.480
 And it's actually happened.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.800
 There was a party, I think it was like an event

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.720
 for an alcohol brand, I can't remember where it was,

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.280
 but they put loads of liquid nitrogen,

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.760
 sorry, dry ice basically,

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.360
 liquid nitrogen into the pool and it sort of steamed up

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.520
 and it looked really cool like a sort of thriller video.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.080
 But they put in way too much and this entire party

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.960
 suddenly filled with nitrogen gas

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.240
 and like all the oxygen was forced up above head level

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.280
 and loads of people were hospitalized.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.240
 I think someone maybe even died.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.080
 They did die when that happened.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.840
 It might been CO2.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.560
 Maybe it was dry ice, it was different then, maybe.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.440
 It was kind of the same principle.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.640
 Yeah, it was the same.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.080
 And what happens with the nitrogen is

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.880
 whenever it leaks out, it gets warmer,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.040
 and when it gets warmer, it gets much, much bigger.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.480
 And then it does the displacement.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.400
 I've done karaoke in Singapore with a live band.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.200
 Oh, wow.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.760
 Yeah, that's kind of a thing that they do out there.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:56.880
 That's very cool.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.120
 I have seen a British national treasurer

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.480
 taking part in karaoke.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.240
 Well, you don't need to call me that, Andy.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.000
 Who was it?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 I don't know, can we bleep then?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's bleep the name.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.120
 Was it?

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.640
 Really?

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.040
 Yeah.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.880
 How, were they any good?

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.960
 Good idea, save A, so no one knows who it was.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:17.840
 [BEEP]

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:25.440
 Do you know today if you've watched a movie in the cinema

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.000
 or if you've missed it in the cinema, what can you do?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.560
 I stream it.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.600
 You can stream it.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.080
 You could, before that, you could get a DVD.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.480
 Yeah.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.080
 Or even a VHS.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.400
 Yeah.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.920
 Well, what could you get?

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.320
 Keep talking.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.200
 Thanks, James.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.120
 Are you advertising for the post?

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.640
 What could you get in 1896?

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.600
 Flipbooks.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.160
 Exactly.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:44.640
 Really?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, cool.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.160
 They were known as folioscopes.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:54.480
 And there was a guy, a company called Bolio, who made--

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.520
 Bolio's folios.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.200
 Bolio's folios.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.320
 It's probably Bolia.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.560
 But yeah, they made these flipbooks based on the movies

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.280
 from 1895 to 1898.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.640
 So if you've been and enjoyed the movie,

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.400
 you could go home and enjoy it again.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.680
 It wasn't a whole film, was it?

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.760
 This only works for like two minutes long.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.080
 This only works for the when films are five seconds long.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.120
 She's trying to--

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.000
 Let's get across.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.360
 Trying to do dude two.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.960
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.320
 The flipbooks outside.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.160
 In fact, the flipbooks arrived at the whole street.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.200
 Yeah.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.320
 We're all up and down, flipping.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:30.240
 And then Michael Strange went out with, in fact,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.160
 Mary John Barrymore, who is the grandfather of Drew.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.680
 Oh.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.280
 John Barrymore was mega famous, wasn't he?

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.200
 Yeah, he was one of the most famous.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.880
 I sort of think of him as more famous than Drew Barrymore.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.040
 I know.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.880
 It was quite an amazing takedown of his career, to say.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.000
 Yeah, I know, it's tough.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.800
 It's tough.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.560
 Although I can't name a single thing he would have been in.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.200
 No, I think Drew Barrymore's more famous now, for sure.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:49.840
 Yeah.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.040
 She's in Spielberg movies.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.840
 Now she's more famous.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.640
 But in the '40s, John was more famous than Drew, definitely.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:54.880
 Yeah.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.480
 This is how these things progress, isn't it?

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.200
 Yeah.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.760
 Absolutely.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.760
 One quick thing on diving.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:06.720
 This is about Derek Langos from Illinois.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.040
 And he runs the Scuba Bear Diving Recovery Service,

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.280
 where if you've been in the area called the "Chain of Lakes,"

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.920
 which is like a lot of lakes where people do lots of diving,

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.960
 and you lose something in the water,

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.480
 he'll go and find it for you,

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.480
 and he will charge you a small amount of money.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.920
 Like a human dog.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.360
 Like a human diving underwater dog.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.240
 Yeah, okay.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.400
 And you've lost your phone.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.680
 There's important stuff on there.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.560
 He'll go and find it.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.240
 Before you've lost your watch, he'll find it.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.440
 But he often finds stuff that no one sent him for,

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.520
 and then he'll keep it.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.840
 And hope that someone gets in touch with him and says,

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.280
 "Oh, I lost this."

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.520
 What do you think is the most common thing that he finds

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.200
 underwater when scuba diving in Illinois?

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.080
 In Illinois.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.440
 Oh, that's a clue.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:55.920
 Is there a clue?

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.640
 There's not a clue, though.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.760
 The Keeney Bottoms.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.160
 When he's on his dive in and they come off.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.640
 Yeah.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.200
 Sure.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.040
 That this happens even more frequently than that happens,

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.000
 which I believe only happens in movies from the 1990s.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.840
 I'm going to say prosthetic legs.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.560
 The most common thing he finds here.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.680
 The most common thing.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.160
 Yeah.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.840
 No, it's something even more common than that.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.320
 Oh.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.680
 Oh.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.880
 Wedding ring.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.200
 No.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.480
 iPhones or watches.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.080
 Watches.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:26.640
 Watches.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.480
 Apparently it's Apple watches.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.720
 Those ones with the kind of sports bands that are plastic

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.600
 that go on, apparently they just don't steal people's wrists.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.800
 There was a picture of all the things that he's got

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.040
 and literally more than half of the things with these watches.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.000
 Wow, no way.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.160
 So not other watches straps, fine.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.840
 Apple has somehow made a watch strap

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.680
 that slips off as soon as you dive into the water.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.440
 That does appear to be the case.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.240
 Well done, Apple.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.200
 That's very cool.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.440
 Any more anecdotes about karaoke?

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.720
 I just, I had a, I didn't enjoy karaoke much when I did it.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.200
 What did you do?

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.400
 What did you sing, Andy?

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.920
 I think it's like Heartbreak Hotel,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.600
 which was a nice song and I love it,

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.680
 but it was not the sort of fun raucous Elvis,

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.200
 the other song, Heartbreak Hotel.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.560
 I'm not going to do it again.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.800
 I nearly fell for that.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.360
 That's great.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.520
 I don't know why anyone goes anywhere

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.480
 near liquid nitrogen.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.560
 It's just because it appears in cocktail bars

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.480
 and it appears on QI and all these people.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.680
 The two places you frequent most frequently.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.120
 The coolest places I've ever been.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.080
 It's just bouncing between the two.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.200
 I just think it's what, like minus 200 degrees or something.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.160
 It has an incredibly dangerous effect if you mishandle it.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:34.960
 I wouldn't.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.000
 It is crazy it's available.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.640
 And you just get a cocktail way to spring on your glass

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.880
 and it has led to some awful things happening.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.440
 One interesting thing about it is you're supposed to use specialist gloves,

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.920
 but don't use normal gloves with liquid nitrogen.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.880
 It's better to use your skin than normal gloves.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.920
 And the reason is due to something called the laden frost effect,

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.400
 where it's like when you pour water on a hot stove

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.480
 and it kind of runs around in little...

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.320
 Oh yeah, it looks hydrophobic as about.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.760
 Skittles about, yeah, yeah.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.240
 So that's what will happen with liquid nitrogen on your hand,

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.840
 because your hand's warm enough.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.400
 To liquid nitrogen, your hand is like a hot stove,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.600
 because it's so cold.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.360
 So it won't, there'll be a protective layer

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.720
 and it won't burn your hand.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.200
 If you put cloth on, like cloth gloves,

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.040
 then the cloth gloves will freeze

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.240
 and then you've got real problems

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.440
 because you've got freezing gloves on.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.880
 And no one's volunteering to take those off.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.560
 Absolutely no, no, you're done.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.920
 Your hand is no more and all the nitrogen is gone.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.360
 There was a story, which was quite fun, that was doing the rounds,

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.240
 which you might remember, doing the rounds in the 1880s.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.040
 And it came up.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.120
 I was reading the fan book at the time.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.720
 Of course, didn't get around to this.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.520
 Didn't see it, yeah.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.080
 It came up and it was told about a lot of different places.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.960
 I read a version from Canada, from Pennsylvania, from Liverpool.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.520
 And it went that there was a lady, she seated in a carriage,

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.280
 she's sitting between two men.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.240
 And one of the men slips his hand into her muff

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.680
 for a little bit of naughty.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.120
 Hand holding under there.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:07.200
 Just to confirm the meaning of the word 'muff' in this case is her...

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.360
 It's just her hand warmer, James, as, I think you know.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.880
 No, it's just from herming for the audience, that's all.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.000
 Yeah, yeah, thank you.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.840
 The gentleman slips his hand into her muff

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.440
 and she's not up for being handheld,

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.520
 so she slips her opposite hand out.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.280
 Then the gentleman on her other side slips his hand into her muff.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.080
 Lovely.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.680
 And she spends a good 10 or 15 minutes watching them

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.680
 as they both have a jolly good old time.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.680
 And both of the gentlemen occasionally looking around at her,

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.600
 giving her a bit of a wink and a nudge.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.800
 And then at the end of the journey...

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.720
 They're just rummaging around with each other's hands, basically.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.160
 They're just rummaging around with each other's hands.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.200
 And then at the end she says,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.600
 "If you gentlemen are done with my muff, I'll have it back now."

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.440
 And they both get very embarrassed.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.640
 I've had that done to me.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:52.480
 I've done it without the muff, like, as in, I've been in a pub.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.840
 And with my arm round my wife's shoulder.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:01.440
 And then one of my friends would put his hand there

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.840
 and just let me stroke his hand.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.040
 And let me allow me to think it was my wife's hand.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.440
 Did he do that to embarrassed or did he just really crave

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.040
 for human contact?

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.440
 Hey, you know, so these days, you do have,

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.280
 before the movie starts, it says,

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.440
 "Please turn your mobile phone to side.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.040
 Before the movie starts, it says,

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.200
 "Please turn your mobile phone to silent or off."

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.400
 Right? Let's not disturb.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.080
 But obviously in early days of cinema,

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.040
 we didn't have mobile phones.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.640
 So what do you think was one of the things

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.840
 that they had to say to people?

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.600
 "Please turn off your gramophone."

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.200
 Yeah, yeah, giant gramophone ordered in here.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.440
 To the owner of a horse who's outside,

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.600
 sort of done coloured horses.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.280
 It's done a big poo.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.840
 Please go and clean out the poo.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.480
 Is that it?

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.440
 No, that's not it.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.240
 It says, "Not turn off your phones."

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.160
 Yeah, no, but it would be something on you.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.640
 Ooh.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.080
 And so this was directed for women, specifically women.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.600
 Place your hat pins in the pockets provided.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.920
 Where would you see them?

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.200
 I'll tell you why you're close.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.520
 Remove your crinoline dresses because...

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.640
 Oh, remove your hats.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.320
 Remove your hats.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.160
 Yeah, they would have signs up saying,

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.280
 "Please remove your hats,"

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.440
 because pillbox hats got quite big

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.960
 during the Jackie Kennedy period.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.040
 Abraham Lincoln's furious in the front row, unrecognisable.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.640
 Well, he stored stuff in his hat, didn't he?

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.400
 So if he removed his, all of his notes come tumbling out.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.080
 That's true, that's where he keeps the popcorn.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.920
 On entomologists being useful,

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.000
 did you know that both bank holidays

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.800
 and daylight saving time were invented by entomologists?

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.120
 No.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.760
 Oh, right.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.560
 Oh, were they?

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.040
 Oh, did I?

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.280
 William Willett was scared on them.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.240
 Well, it's one of those things

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.920
 where I think where daylight saving,

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.120
 there are a few steps.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.400
 But the first person to suggest it

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.400
 was this Kiwi insect lover

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.640
 called George Hudson, who was an entomologist,

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.360
 and he came up with a concept in 1895,

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.120
 and it was because he wanted some extra daylight

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.760
 after his working hours to collect insects.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.560
 You're nodding, Erica,

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.320
 is it either as if you know that

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.680
 or as if you're like, "Yeah, I would have done that."

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.120
 No, no, I think I've heard it.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.520
 I've heard that story, and it was like, "Ah, yeah."

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.520
 And also, "Yeah, I totally get it."

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.120
 "Totally get it."

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.680
 Bank holidays used to be known, in fact,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.320
 as St. Lubbock's days in the Victorian time,

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.400
 because they were invented by John Lubbock,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.080
 who was a Liberal MP,

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.840
 and he wrote a book called "Ans, Bees and Wasps,"

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.520
 which was incredibly popular.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.000
 It ran to 18 editions, like 18 reprints,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.600
 because it kept selling out.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.400
 And he also had a pet wasp.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.080
 He tamed a wasp, and he presented it.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.760
 I didn't know who to know.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.040
 He did.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.080
 He presented it to him.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.120
 Tamed a wasp.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.520
 Mary and Rushyard used to keep fleas.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.280
 So you'd apparently turn up,

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.160
 and you'd have a little, like, a little dome of fleas.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.400
 So everyone would suck tea and watch the view.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.680
 Everyone watched the view.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.080
 Can I ask you a question about flea circuses, Erika?

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.280
 Are they real?

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:47.920
 Well, some...

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.240
 Because I'm used to the thing where the showman says,

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.840
 "Look, are there fleas doing the tightrope

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.960
 and the tightrope pings?"

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.400
 And I can't believe it's real.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.520
 I think there were some.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.800
 Were there not some real ones?

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.160
 I think there aren't a few,

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.160
 but most of them were completely fake.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.560
 So we've got the dress fleas on my desk at work.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.600
 I've got the dress fleas.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.480
 So these are in Mexico.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.080
 So they were the pugas.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:12.480
 These fleas were collected by local villagers,

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.240
 and they sold them as trinkets.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.040
 And so they make these tiny little outfits,

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.280
 and then they use the flea as the head.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.120
 So on my desk, I have two weddings and a mariachi dress.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.240
 Oh, that's lovely.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.440
 Oh, the little fleas.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.320
 How cute.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.480
 Wow, that must be absolutely tiny.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.160
 I've seen smaller.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.400
 The entomologists slam.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.280
 That's brilliant.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.160
 Every three months, the local haiku poets

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.240
 go to the post boxes, or they send an envoy,

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.520
 and they empty them out,

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.200
 and then they judge all the entries.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.160
 The winner gets a prize.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:48.960
 That's cool.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.360
 Yeah.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.800
 Yeah, so it won't disappear.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.560
 It's not like writing a letter to Father Christmas,

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.320
 where, you know, who knows who's getting that.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.640
 He reads it and then probably puts it in her pile somewhere.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.680
 Right, yeah, exactly.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.800
 But he doesn't give you a prize.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.680
 Well, he gives you presents.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.320
 Well, you get a letter.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.840
 You get a letter back from Santa.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.160
 Do you?

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:02.720
 What?

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.280
 You correspond with Santa multiple times.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.080
 Throughout the year.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.200
 Well, no, in the last six years,

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.480
 since I've had my eldest son.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.440
 Yeah, if you send a letter to Santa,

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.160
 a letter comes back to you.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.040
 I didn't know that.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.680
 Yeah.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.720
 Where are you sending it to?

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.080
 The North Pole.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.920
 That's just right, Santa the North Pole.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.960
 You get a letter back.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.440
 Yeah, no, so there is a UK system

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.120
 where you buy a response letter,

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.960
 so you send it, your kids write it,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.320
 and it comes back in the mail,

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.040
 and it's really nice to write it.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:27.520
 Get away.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.480
 No, it's a real thing.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.000
 But kids don't want a letter back.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.320
 No one, no kid writes RSVP at the bottom.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.440
 See, Santa?

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.360
 Stop sending me fucking letters.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.320
 You want an Xbox?

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:41.520
 OK, that's it.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.480
 That is all of our facts.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.760
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.600
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.800
 about the things that we've said

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.080
 over the course of this show,

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.040
 you can go to our website,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.560
 nosuchthingasafish.com.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.200
 There is the links to get you into the world of Clubfish,

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.960
 which is our secret members group,

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.960
 and there's a great Discord that you can join

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.240
 and lots of bonus content

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.760
 that we put out through Clubfish.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.800
 Or you can just get access

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.400
 to all of our previous episodes,

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.120
 as well as bitches.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.640
 As well as bitches.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.240
 All of our previous bitches live there.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.200
 All of our previous bitches.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.400
 The word "bitch" is also an offensive word for a woman.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.680
 Or those bits of merchandise

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.360
 so you can get your hands on there.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.720
 Otherwise, just come back here next week.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.160
 We're going to be back with another episode,

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.280
 and we'll see you then.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.000
 Goodbye.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.040
 Bitches.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:34.160
 All right, that is it.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.680
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.800
 Thanks, everyone, for listening.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.240
 You want to get in touch with any of us.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.400
 You can do it through our regular social media accounts,

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.760
 or you can email us at podcast@qi.com.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.440
 But again, just a reminder,

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.080
 if you would like to come see us live in Sydney

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.000
 for our extra show on November the 10th,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.120
 go to nosuchthingasafish.com/sidney

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.320
 on the 12th of June.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.840
 You'll have until the Friday

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.040
 to get your presale tickets

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.120
 before they go open to the rest of the world.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:34:59.920
 And that's right.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.440
 And for those of you who want to come

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.800
 to our additional show in London

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.400
 on the 24th of October,

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.440
 then you can visit

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.920
 nosuchthingasafish.com/london

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.040
 on the 12th of June

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.800
 to get those presale tickets for our show.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.680
 In the meantime, why not go to our Discord?

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.640
 What is a Discord?

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.440
 I hear you ask.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.160
 Well, a Discord is a place where

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.760
 like-minded individuals

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.160
 can discuss the things that they love.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.320
 And indeed, we have one.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.440
 It's called FishCord.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.800
 And the way to find that is to go to

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.920
 nosuchthingasafish.com/fishcord.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.040
 The fish, actually, we dip our toes in there every now and then

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.280
 to give you little bits of extra behind-the-scenes stuff.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.040
 So do go to FishCord.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.360
 So that's part of your secret society perk

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.200
 of being part of Club Fish.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:43.840
 That's it for now.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.280
 We're going to be back again in a couple of weeks

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.280
 with another bit of bonus material.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.560
 We will see you all then.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.600
 Catch you later, bitches.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:50.560
 Jesus.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.620
 (upbeat music)

00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:04.620
