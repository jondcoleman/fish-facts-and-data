00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,360
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's bit of bonus material.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,800
 Before we get into it, we have a very special announcement for the people of Sydney.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,280
 And that is that due to the unbelievable number of tickets that you bought for the Sydney Opera House,

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,040
 we have announced another show and people of Club Fish get tickets first.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,040
 That's right, we are doing a pre-sale on Wednesday the 12th of June,

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,080
 all the way to the morning of Friday the 14th of June,

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,520
 whereby the tickets will then go on general sale, but if you want to get in quick,

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,600
 head to knowsuchthingasoffish.com/sidney, head there on the 12th of June to get tickets.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,960
 We're going to be playing at the State Theatre and it's November the 10th.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,160
 And for those of you who are not in Sydney but are in, let's say, London,

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,600
 you have also done an amazing job of selling out our show at the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,200
 And so we can't let you guys down, we have put another show on in London as well.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,440
 It's on the 24th of October at the Theatre Royal and Drury Lane,

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,560
 and just like Sydney, pre-sale tickets will go on sale on Wednesday the 12th of June,

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,920
 and you can access them by going to knowsuchthingasoffish.com/london.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,680
 You'll have until Friday the 14th of June before they go on general sale,

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,200
 so once again, get in there quick and visit knowsuchthingasoffish.com/london

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,400
 on Wednesday the 12th of June to get your pre-sale tickets for our second show in London.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,800
 That's right. Okay, let's get on to this week's bonus compilation episode full of

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,160
 outtakes and bits that just didn't quite make it into the main episode.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,160
 You're going to hear a lot from Alex Bell, you're going to hear from Erica McAllister,

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,720
 and of course you're going to hear from us four regular fishers.

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,760
 So here we go, hope you enjoy it, and on with the show.

25
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,880
 On with the podcast.

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,120
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of knowsuchthingasoffish,

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,120
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the Kiwai offices in Hoban.

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,160
 My name is Alex Bell, and I'm joined by Anna Zhizinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

30
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,120
 James Hawkin, and once again, we are gathered round the microphone,

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,480
 and once again, we are gathered round the microphone to share our four favourite

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,400
 facts from the last seven days, so in no particular order, here we go.

33
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,800
 I fucking nailed it. I mean, you can edit out the bits that I fumbled.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,440
 Yeah, you were annoyingly good at it.

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
 Like, we only asked you to do this because we thought you'd fucking up.

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,360
 Do we always say microphone singular now?

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,640
 I think we say plural.

38
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,320
 Sorry, gathered round the microphones.

39
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,920
 If we're being precise, yeah.

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,520
 Okay, I think you did pretty well, Alex.

41
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,320
 I think it's sort of cuter if there's an image of us all gathered round one microphone.

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,800
 Lady in the Tramps spaghetti.

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
 My favourite part was where you almost forgot Andy's name.

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
 Yeah, that was the best one for a few weeks, but...

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,040
 Ants are pretty extraordinary with how they use pheromones,

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,840
 and how they mess up using pheromones, because they've...

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
 I don't think we've talked about antmills before.

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,600
 But they... Ants basically army ants follow each other

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,840
 based on the pheromones that the bloke in front of them,

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,600
 or the lady in front of them is releasing.

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,080
 And so they'll follow each other to their food or wherever they're headed.

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,800
 To the picnic.

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,760
 To the picnic.

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,480
 But sometimes the pheromone trail will get broken up,

55
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,400
 and then they get very confused.

56
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
 And so, you know, the leaders disappeared.

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,760
 They don't know what direction they're going in,

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,520
 and they all start following each other.

59
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,520
 And they end up going round in this circle,

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,360
 in this what is literally called a death spiral, until they die of exhaustion.

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
 They just keep following each other round and round and round.

62
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,640
 This happened to me a few weeks ago.

63
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,760
 We were on a night out, and we were going from a bar to a bowling alley,

64
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,080
 and no one was paying attention to who was following who,

65
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
 and we went round Bloomsley Square like three times.

66
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,480
 Following each other's smelly ounces.

67
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,320
 No, we just kept following the person who was quite far in front of us,

68
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,600
 we were all having our own conversations,

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,840
 and then eventually someone was like, "Where are we going?"

70
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,400
 So, what was that woman in Iceland?

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,440
 Do you remember where she went missing?

72
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,800
 And there was a load of people went out looking for her,

73
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,360
 and then she didn't know that they were looking for her,

74
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,400
 and she saw a load of people looking for someone as though she just joined.

75
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,960
 And they said, "Who are you looking for?"

76
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
 They're like, "Oh, it looks, someone who looks a bit like you."

77
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,320
 She's like, "Oh, I'll keep my eyes open."

78
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,440
 I'm sure you read the medical report on Wasabi.

79
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
 This was from about four years ago.

80
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,320
 It's from 2019.

81
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,360
 It was a woman, it was in the British Medical Journal case reports.

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,120
 It was a woman who had been into wedding,

83
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
 and had eaten a large quantity.

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
 It said, it didn't specify how much, of green material,

85
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,160
 which she naturally assumed was avocado, guacamole, something like that.

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,520
 And it was actually Wasabi.

87
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,320
 It doesn't specify whether it was horseradish Wasabi or proper Wasabi,

88
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,640
 but it was too much to have.

89
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,680
 And she began experiencing chest pains,

90
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,560
 which remained for a few hours.

91
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,640
 And eventually, I think, went to see a doctor,

92
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,360
 and she was diagnosed with a serious stress-induced heart condition.

93
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,160
 It's this, we've probably mentioned it.

94
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,760
 It's called broken heart syndrome.

95
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,400
 It's Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
 It's where your heart muscles literally can't pump blood.

97
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,160
 It's really, it can be really serious,

98
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,120
 and it's caused because your body floods with stress hormones,

99
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,200
 and it inhibits the proper functioning of your heart.

100
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,520
 So was it caused by the Wasabi,

101
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,320
 or was it just discovered because she'd gone to get it checked out?

102
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,960
 It seems that it was caused by the Wasabi causing a lot of stress hormones.

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,080
 That seems to be the case.

104
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,320
 It's not, obviously, it can't be proved beyond doubt.

105
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,120
 She'd just been dumped,

106
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,440
 so she was eating anything she could find in the fridge through her tears,

107
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,480
 and that's why she had broken heart syndrome.

108
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
 She was at a wedding at the time,

109
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,920
 when she saw this huge mound of green matter.

110
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,720
 And what would you think?

111
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
 You would just think that is clearly avocados.

112
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,920
 I'm, as a single-

113
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,120
 She's sushi at the time.

114
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,440
 Because for sugar, they don't just put Wasabi in the middle of a table.

115
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,720
 It is, I do wonder how much she's just gozzling down,

116
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,360
 going, "This avocado does, it's a bit tangy, isn't it?"

117
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,920
 Oh, come on, you're single, you're at a wedding, you're drunk.

118
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,160
 You're like, "I'm not finding love here, I'm miserable,

119
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,520
 I might as well make the most of this evening

120
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
 and get as much in the buffet as I can."

121
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,360
 Mice produce lots of pheromones,

122
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
 and in their tears they do,

123
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,120
 and mouse tears are a turn-on, sexually.

124
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,920
 A two other mice.

125
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,240
 To me.

126
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,280
 Two other mice.

127
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,480
 Yes, so they produce tears to wet their eyeballs,

128
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
 and they almost...

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,520
 I'm so bad.

130
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,560
 For internationalism, isn't it?

131
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,400
 Crying is when...

132
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,000
 I've got another pheromone use by...

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,160
 This is bees, specifically being tricked by pheromones.

134
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,360
 You've got a burrowing bees.

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,400
 There are loads of kinds of bees.

136
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,200
 These ones, they burrow, live and burrow.

137
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,840
 Anyway.

138
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,120
 Or are you Mikaela Strachan?

139
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,600
 Sweat down.

140
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,000
 Again, it's an impeccably old brand mine,

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,360
 there are these blister beetles, right,

142
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
 which they're much smaller than bees,

143
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,880
 and they're parasitic on them.

144
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,720
 And they release a pheromone, the beetles,

145
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,040
 designed to trick male burrowing bees

146
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,600
 into thinking that there is a hot lady bee

147
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,680
 in their area looking for sex.

148
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
 This is a pop-up ad parasite, yeah?

149
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,560
 It's basically a pop-up ad.

150
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,680
 So it's like, oh, like bees are near you,

151
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,800
 and they want it.

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
 And the male goes and looks, and the beetles,

153
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,000
 the burrowing beetles, the very young ones,

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
 they have climbed up a strand of grass,

155
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,760
 and they have formed a ball

156
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,240
 the size of a female burrowing bee.

157
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,800
 So the male turns up, sees, aha, there's my date.

158
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,320
 It's not a date, it's a ball of parasitic beetles.

159
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,240
 Oh my God, this is insane.

160
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,120
 It's insane.

161
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,200
 They all have grappling hook claws.

162
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,480
 They wrestle the bee.

163
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,680
 The bee falls to the ground.

164
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,760
 He's now covered in these horrible parasites.

165
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,680
 He's had an awful experience.

166
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,360
 Then they're hitching a lift on him.

167
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
 So he's now covered in these parasites.

168
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,400
 Eventually, the male does find a female.

169
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,160
 All the parasites latch onto her.

170
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
 They ride off to a burrow.

171
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
 Not very picky female.

172
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,320
 Yeah, no.

173
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,280
 So now she lays the eggs, she lays her egg or her eggs,

174
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,800
 and she leaves a load of nice sugar and pollen and all of that,

175
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,640
 you know, stuff for the egg to eat.

176
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,400
 The beetles just eat all the food,

177
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,960
 and the egg doesn't get its food.

178
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
 These beetles can target their pheromones

179
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,840
 to different types of bee.

180
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,440
 So clever.

181
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,720
 What happens to the male bee?

182
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,760
 I'm actually just carried on.

183
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
 I'd love to do this again sometime.

184
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,040
 I had a really nice evening.

185
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,840
 Get some Uber.

186
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,800
 Never knew it was three beetles in a trench coat.

187
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,920
 Back down in the ocean, another nitrogen-related scheme,

188
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,920
 in the 1970s, I was just looking up different uses for liquid nitrogen,

189
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,160
 which include many things like they're in crisp packets

190
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,240
 because they preserve freshness because they don't react to crisp.

191
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,520
 That's not liquid, of course.

192
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,920
 No, sorry.

193
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,720
 This is what I'm just talking about.

194
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,200
 Other different uses of nitrogen, all its forms.

195
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,320
 It's also interestingly used.

196
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,080
 I didn't know it was used in binoculars and telescopes

197
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,920
 because it stops fogging because there's no, you know,

198
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,640
 you need to basically fill the void with something that's completely inert.

199
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
 So you can't get any water vapor in there.

200
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,360
 Yeah, exactly.

201
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,680
 And it's also the gas that they use for the MMU,

202
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,000
 which is basically the jet pack that astronauts used to zoom around in space.

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,120
 They only used it a few times.

204
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,680
 Really?

205
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,120
 But another used liquid nitrogen,

206
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,280
 which obviously exists at a very low temperature.

207
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,280
 There was a plan to go down to the wreck of the Titanic in the 1970s,

208
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,720
 freeze it with liquid nitrogen, essentially turning it into a massive,

209
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,320
 ironic iceberg itself and then floating it to the surface

210
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,960
 and so getting it by bringing it up in ice.

211
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,800
 Oh, not then crashing another ship into it?

212
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
 No, no, I think, I mean, that would be awful.

213
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,080
 A ship crashing into the Titanic.

214
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,120
 We're going to need more nitrogen.

215
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
 We're going to have to make a third iceberg to get the next one up.

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,440
 Horrible Jane reaction.

217
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,880
 Wow, that's a great idea.

218
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,360
 Is it?

219
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,400
 Didn't happen.

220
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,720
 Is it?

221
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,720
 The first example of narcolepsy in the medical records

222
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,080
 was a bookbinder in Cooper from Westphal in 1877.

223
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,960
 And this was written up by a guy called Jean-Baptiste-Edouard Galinot.

224
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,520
 And he said that this bookbinder had collapsed at the zoo

225
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,000
 after observing monkeys making faces.

226
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,680
 So basically, and quite often this kind of,

227
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,000
 this illness happens when you have,

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,440
 when you're laughing or when you, you know, that kind of thing.

229
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,800
 At times of heightened emotion.

230
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,760
 Yeah, exactly that.

231
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,560
 Interesting.

232
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,440
 Right, you tell me a part of that next time you're in bed together.

233
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
 Of course you had times of fight over the metal.

234
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,760
 And I read a paper in the Journal of Pediatrics and Child Health

235
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,760
 that says Rip Van Winkle might have had narcolepsy.

236
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,160
 He fell asleep under a tree for 20 years.

237
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
 That's a long bat, isn't it?

238
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,280
 It seems unlikely, right?

239
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,560
 But they gave a lot of different fairy tales

240
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,320
 and maybe decided what illnesses they might have had.

241
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,400
 What a waste of time.

242
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,760
 I hate it when people do this.

243
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,240
 Me too.

244
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,200
 Well, you're not going to like the next 30 seconds.

245
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,640
 So the giant in Jack and the Beanstalk.

246
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
 Petuitary gland.

247
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,680
 Exactly right.

248
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,760
 He obviously has a pituitary tumour

249
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
 because it not only causes giganticism,

250
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,080
 but it also affects his vision

251
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,160
 because he says he can smell the blood of the Englishman

252
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,600
 but he can't see the Englishman.

253
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,120
 Okay.

254
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,360
 Yeah.

255
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,920
 The grandmother of Red Riding Hood.

256
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,680
 This is in a cupboard or she's eaten by wolf?

257
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,080
 Well, that's not a medical condition.

258
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,000
 Maybe she has late stage lupus erythematosus.

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,680
 Oh, well, we're saying that she looks like the wolf.

260
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,320
 She is the wolf.

261
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,200
 She looks like the wolf and probably would be in bed.

262
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,640
 Because she's the wolf.

263
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,440
 Because she's got lupus.

264
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,160
 Fuck it, I'm sorry.

265
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,000
 This is such a good argument for cutting funding

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,280
 from so many places.

267
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,680
 Like, who is sitting like doing a paper on this?

268
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
 But Red Riding Hood is not about a grandmother

269
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,320
 who looks like a wolf.

270
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,640
 No, it's not.

271
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,080
 The wolf disguises itself as a grandmother.

272
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,440
 That's what she thinks.

273
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,680
 But actually, it perhaps it's the grandmother

274
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,800
 just looks like a wolf.

275
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,920
 What's more likely that the grandmother has lupus

276
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,000
 or that the wolf has somehow anthropomorphised

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,760
 and decided to take over the grandmother's place?

278
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,480
 That's a good point.

279
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,400
 No, it's really, these academics, they know what they're talking about.

280
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,840
 The grandmother probably also has exophilmus

281
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,720
 vocal cord nodules and a pituitary tumour

282
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,080
 because what big eye she has,

283
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,560
 what a deep voice she has and what big hand she has.

284
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,280
 Doesn't the story end with her being alive

285
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,240
 inside the wolf and saying,

286
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,000
 "Help, I'm inside," and then Red Riding Hood cuts her out.

287
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Or the woodcutter comes along with a big accent.

288
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,280
 Like, so how do you explain that?

289
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,040
 Well, the woodcutter obviously has gotten

290
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,000
 the wrong edge of a stick.

291
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,680
 And this poor, sick grandmother has also been killed.

292
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,960
 There'll be a grandmother somewhere in here.

293
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,360
 I know it.

294
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,440
 Can I just only think about the dust in the Amazon?

295
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,680
 Yeah.

296
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,560
 This is amazing.

297
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,840
 So I really love this.

298
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,600
 Lots of the dust in the Amazon

299
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,080
 and that fertilises the Amazon comes from the Sahara

300
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,720
 and it fertilises the, it keeps the soil fertile basically.

301
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,360
 It's about 40 million tonnes of dust a year,

302
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,560
 if you can imagine that.

303
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,800
 It's a huge, it's a lot.

304
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
 This is the other amazing thing about it, right?

305
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,360
 There was a study in 2007 that found

306
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120
 that more than half of this dust,

307
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,600
 56% of it, comes from one place in Chad.

308
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,360
 It's called the Bodele Depression.

309
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,840
 It's a tiny, it's a tiny place.

310
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,240
 It's 0.2% of the Sahara produces 56% of the dust

311
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,760
 that keeps the Amazon fertile.

312
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,040
 Just because of weather movements?

313
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,960
 It's because of weather and it's because of the shape of it.

314
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,040
 So the depression is between two mountain ridges

315
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
 and it's basically a great big funnel.

316
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,440
 And so it accelerates the flow of air through it.

317
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,040
 It produces 700,000 tonnes of dust a day.

318
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,760
 I imagine just having a house there

319
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
 and every day doing the hoovering.

320
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,960
 Oh my god.

321
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,040
 There's another 700,000 tonnes of dust.

322
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
 But again, I mean this shows you all the connectivity.

323
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,360
 So every year, four billion hoverflies turn up in the UK

324
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,120
 and they've migrated across.

325
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,400
 So there's a lot of immigrants coming into the UK regularly.

326
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,880
 Is that from France, like from Europe?

327
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,920
 North Africa?

328
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,000
 They even think in sub-Saharan African insects make it up.

329
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
 And you're saying they've migrated just temporarily.

330
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,720
 They've migrated seasonally.

331
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,120
 Or they've come here to stay, they've got their visas.

332
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,520
 They've come here, they've met the locals.

333
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,680
 They've copulated, they've produced very fecund,

334
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,440
 well the ladies have been very fecund

335
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,880
 because of these immigrants.

336
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,000
 And they're doing wonders over here, pollinating our crops,

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,200
 getting rid of our pests.

338
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,680
 Hoverflies.

339
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,720
 How did they get here?

340
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,280
 Because there's not...

341
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,360
 Why?

342
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,800
 No, yes.

343
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,520
 Okay, second question.

344
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,320
 Okay, sorry.

345
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,440
 I would have thought like they would need a prevailing wind.

346
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,520
 Ah, so they do.

347
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,120
 And so they are doing a lot of studies now

348
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,760
 on how they get here and which winds they take and whatever.

349
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,960
 And they will angle themselves within these winds,

350
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,520
 sorry, to make sure they're going the right direction.

351
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
 So you know those times every now and then,

352
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,440
 like every couple of years,

353
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,280
 everyone gets loads of sand on their cars

354
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,680
 because there's a wind coming up from the Sahara.

355
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,600
 And is that also full of these flies, you reckon?

356
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,480
 Everything will be, yeah.

357
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,080
 So it'll be really...

358
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,120
 And again, this is what...

359
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
 So you think about the Amazon and things like that

360
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,360
 and how all these species are moved around.

361
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,520
 It's really changing our understanding

362
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,920
 of how animals move, how things migrate.

363
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,200
 And a lot of species we used to think were very...

364
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,400
 kept in very small areas.

365
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,880
 And now we're like...

366
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,720
 Because I just...

367
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,680
 So my most exciting thing recently

368
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,720
 was collecting flies from the La Brea Tarpits in California.

369
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,800
 Oh, that's cool. I've been there.

370
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,600
 Oh, my God.

371
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,440
 I don't really know what a tarpit is.

372
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,960
 No, it's exactly what it sounds like.

373
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
 Imagine a pit full of tarp.

374
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,800
 Right, so a tarpit.

375
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,680
 Yeah, and like...

376
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,280
 Are you a mispronouncing carpet?

377
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,520
 Yeah.

378
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,680
 Oh, good news, you've got a flying tarpit.

379
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,600
 Oh, disgusting, horrible.

380
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,280
 These are the amazing...

381
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,960
 So this is like the La Brea Tarpits

382
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,680
 are where they found all loads and loads

383
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,840
 of Smilodon and things like that.

384
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,160
 So they're like the same type of tigers.

385
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,880
 Mammoths and...

386
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,800
 And mammoths, loads of mammoths and all sorts.

387
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,640
 But there's also a fly that lives in them.

388
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,000
 You always want the weird thing

389
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,840
 that lives on the huge thing, don't you?

390
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,400
 Yeah.

391
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,720
 But no, so it's learned to live on tar.

392
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,640
 So the larvae live in the tarpits.

393
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,680
 Oh, I see.

394
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,640
 But the only other places these tarpits are found

395
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,080
 are in Trinidad and I believe Peru.

396
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
 And it's like, is this one species?

397
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,640
 Oh, wow.

398
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,520
 Found that far with distribution.

399
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,800
 So it's just bonded to some tar on holiday.

400
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,920
 But this is it.

401
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,840
 I mean, you know, no, I don't know yet.

402
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,040
 The genetics haven't been done.

403
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,720
 Are these isolated populations?

404
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,360
 Yeah.

405
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,000
 Or is there more movement going on

406
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,280
 than we originally thought?

407
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,240
 That's really interesting.

408
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,200
 I mean, I don't know.

409
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,320
 I could be completely wrong.

410
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,400
 I went to those tarpits and it said

411
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,800
 that almost all the animals in them were male.

412
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,520
 And the reason being that males are more stupid

413
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,720
 than females and the males would go in

414
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,680
 and then get stuck.

415
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,320
 Whereas the females would not go in and get stuck

416
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,560
 because they'd realized that there was a problem here.

417
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
 And then what would happen is one animal

418
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,280
 would get stuck in there, like a gazelle or something.

419
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,760
 And then all the other male animals would come along

420
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,960
 and go, oh, a gazelle, great.

421
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,280
 And then they would go in and then they would get stuck.

422
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,520
 And then someone else would go, oh, a smiley done, great.

423
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,040
 And then they would get stuck.

424
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,200
 It's the old woman who lived in a tarpit.

425
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,440
 Yeah.

426
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,080
 Do you know Captain Morgan?

427
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,160
 Not personally, but yeah.

428
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,560
 He has a spiced and an ordinary rum.

429
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:06,800
 Yes.

430
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,320
 He has got loads of varieties of rum.

431
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,440
 Well, do you know how he can save you

432
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,880
 if you have a dislocated hip?

433
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,240
 Drink enough rum.

434
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
 You forget the hip.

435
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,040
 Is that it?

436
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,520
 Not that.

437
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,000
 Okay.

438
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,600
 What do you know about Captain Morgan?

439
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,720
 Have you ever drank it, Erica?

440
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,440
 I've drunk it.

441
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,000
 Yeah.

442
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,480
 Can you remember anything about it?

443
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,400
 About the bottle, for instance?

444
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,280
 He's wearing a hat.

445
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,480
 He's got a wooden leg.

446
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,600
 Yeah.

447
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,440
 What stance is he in?

448
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,880
 Now, it's a podcast, so just you showing us.

449
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,080
 Yeah, well, I know, I know.

450
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,880
 But I'm like, okay.

451
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,520
 So he hasn't even got his arms on his hips like that.

452
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,000
 Yeah, yeah.

453
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,800
 And jaunty.

454
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,680
 He is very jaunty.

455
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,880
 And his leg.

456
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,800
 Yeah, he's got his little wooden low leg.

457
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,160
 And another leg is standing on a barrel.

458
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,720
 So he's kind of got one leg on a barrel

459
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,080
 and he's standing like that.

460
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,040
 And apparently this Captain Morgan technique

461
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,800
 is a way, if someone's got a dislocated hip,

462
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,480
 you stand like Captain Morgan with your leg

463
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,960
 sort of slightly higher than the other one.

464
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,560
 And you lift them up and you can sort of pop it back into place.

465
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,760
 But you lift the leg up.

466
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,160
 You put your leg onto a bed like Captain Morgan

467
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,440
 might be standing on a barrel.

468
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,480
 And that's the patient.

469
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,440
 No, you're doing that.

470
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,320
 And then you drape the patient's leg over yours,

471
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,800
 lift your leg up and it pops the hip into place.

472
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,400
 Right.

473
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,320
 And is that an improvement on the previous?

474
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,760
 I've no idea what the previous method of

475
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,600
 relocating your hip is.

476
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,280
 Yeah, I guess so.

477
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,800
 I think what you would do is you would kind of

478
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,760
 crawl onto the bed and try and move it like that.

479
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,920
 It sounds like an improvement.

480
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,720
 It is an improvement.

481
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,320
 Wow.

483
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,360
 Okay, good to know.

484
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,800
 Because it sounds like the position

485
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,720
 in which you'd give your children a smacked bottom

486
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,400
 that traditionally.

487
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,960
 Yeah.

488
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,320
 I've got that strange, like weird superpower

489
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,280
 where you can stretch.

490
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,480
 It's the, you know, which I dislocate regularly.

491
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,800
 And so I was born with dislocated hips.

492
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,040
 And maybe that's, my parents would just,

493
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,400
 yeah, just maybe I wasn't born with dislocated hips.

494
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,320
 Maybe that's why you like rum so much.

495
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,200
 Well, this is it.

496
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,360
 I dislocated my shoulder and then popped it back in.

497
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
 Yeah, I know, and hindsight.

498
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,920
 Painful.

499
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,920
 May have been some alcohol.

500
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,560
 Oh, right.

501
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,840
 But yes, it was not.

502
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,800
 It's all of these.

503
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,040
 So my knees used to dislocate everything.

504
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,360
 So I should have just drunk rum from an early age.

505
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,520
 You're like one of those puppets

506
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,840
 where you press a button and they collapse all the time.

507
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,000
 So I always think it was a really bad superhero.

508
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,040
 Like, a car would crash into me and I'd just go, yeah.

509
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,840
 And it would be like that.

510
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,160
 And I'd be like, oh, it's not really a lot I could do with it.

511
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,920
 So in Dominica, we have several different types of rum.

512
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,680
 Some of them have different potencies.

513
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,920
 In terms of aphrodisiacs.

514
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,360
 We don't think, I think it's just the advertising.

515
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,560
 Do they add stuff to it?

516
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,640
 No, but there's just sexy women on the label.

517
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,160
 Yeah, I thought I'd do it though.

518
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,040
 Yeah, you know.

519
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,880
 Probably the only proven aphrodisiac.

520
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,480
 Drink rum and it improves your sex drive.

521
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,560
 Mine all has either the Royal Navy flag or Captain Morgan,

522
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,160
 neither of which I find especially.

523
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,760
 You've had plenty of rum in your life,

524
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,520
 but very little sodomy or lash.

525
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:13,600
 You can't be in a lift with liquid nitrogen.

526
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,720
 No, walk it.

527
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,080
 Because it's very awkward conversation.

528
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,360
 That's true because we had some on QI

529
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,560
 and we had to send it up in the lift by itself

530
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,640
 and we were running up the stairs trying to get it.

531
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
 Now you're not really supposed to do that either.

532
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
 So anyone listening has ever taken any liquid nitrogen anywhere.

533
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
 What you need to do is you need to put it in the lift,

534
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,880
 press the button, leg it out,

535
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,440
 and then tell someone who's already on the next floor

536
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,480
 that it's on its way up.

537
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,600
 But what if someone like halfway up presses the button

538
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
 and the lift stops in the way?

539
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,960
 I think you have to make sure that that doesn't happen as well.

540
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,360
 But yeah, and the reason you don't run up

541
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
 is let's say you trip up on the way,

542
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,200
 then suddenly you've just got nitrogen.

543
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,040
 An injury and a deadly lift.

544
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,800
 But it's sealed.

545
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,080
 Yeah, so I think it's in case of a leak.

546
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,920
 And we should probably explain the reason why

547
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
 is because nitrogen is heavier than air.

548
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,520
 If you release nitrogen, it will come out in a massive cloud,

549
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,360
 force all the air up and there'll be no breathable air.

550
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,480
 And it's actually happened.

551
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,800
 There was a party, I think it was like an event

552
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,720
 for an alcohol brand, I can't remember where it was,

553
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,280
 but they put loads of liquid nitrogen,

554
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,760
 sorry, dry ice basically,

555
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,360
 liquid nitrogen into the pool and it sort of steamed up

556
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,520
 and it looked really cool like a sort of thriller video.

557
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,080
 But they put in way too much and this entire party

558
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,960
 suddenly filled with nitrogen gas

559
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,240
 and like all the oxygen was forced up above head level

560
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,280
 and loads of people were hospitalized.

561
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,240
 I think someone maybe even died.

562
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,080
 They did die when that happened.

563
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,840
 It might been CO2.

564
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,560
 Maybe it was dry ice, it was different then, maybe.

565
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,440
 It was kind of the same principle.

566
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,640
 Yeah, it was the same.

567
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,080
 And what happens with the nitrogen is

568
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,880
 whenever it leaks out, it gets warmer,

569
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,040
 and when it gets warmer, it gets much, much bigger.

570
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,480
 And then it does the displacement.

571
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,400
 I've done karaoke in Singapore with a live band.

572
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,200
 Oh, wow.

573
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,760
 Yeah, that's kind of a thing that they do out there.

574
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,880
 That's very cool.

575
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,120
 I have seen a British national treasurer

576
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,480
 taking part in karaoke.

577
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,240
 Well, you don't need to call me that, Andy.

578
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,000
 Who was it?

579
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 I don't know, can we bleep then?

580
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's bleep the name.

581
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
 Was it?

582
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,640
 Really?

583
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,040
 Yeah.

584
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,880
 How, were they any good?

585
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,960
 Good idea, save A, so no one knows who it was.

586
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,840
 [BEEP]

587
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:25,440
 Do you know today if you've watched a movie in the cinema

588
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,000
 or if you've missed it in the cinema, what can you do?

589
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,560
 I stream it.

590
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,600
 You can stream it.

591
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,080
 You could, before that, you could get a DVD.

592
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,480
 Yeah.

593
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,080
 Or even a VHS.

594
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,400
 Yeah.

595
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,920
 Well, what could you get?

596
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,320
 Keep talking.

597
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,200
 Thanks, James.

598
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,120
 Are you advertising for the post?

599
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,640
 What could you get in 1896?

600
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,600
 Flipbooks.

601
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,160
 Exactly.

602
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,640
 Really?

603
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, cool.

604
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,160
 They were known as folioscopes.

605
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,480
 And there was a guy, a company called Bolio, who made--

606
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,520
 Bolio's folios.

607
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,200
 Bolio's folios.

608
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,320
 It's probably Bolia.

609
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,560
 But yeah, they made these flipbooks based on the movies

610
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,280
 from 1895 to 1898.

611
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,640
 So if you've been and enjoyed the movie,

612
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,400
 you could go home and enjoy it again.

613
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,680
 It wasn't a whole film, was it?

614
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,760
 This only works for like two minutes long.

615
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,080
 This only works for the when films are five seconds long.

616
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,120
 She's trying to--

617
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,000
 Let's get across.

618
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,360
 Trying to do dude two.

619
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,960
 Yeah, yeah.

620
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,320
 The flipbooks outside.

621
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,160
 In fact, the flipbooks arrived at the whole street.

622
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,200
 Yeah.

623
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,320
 We're all up and down, flipping.

624
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,240
 And then Michael Strange went out with, in fact,

625
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,160
 Mary John Barrymore, who is the grandfather of Drew.

626
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,680
 Oh.

627
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,280
 John Barrymore was mega famous, wasn't he?

628
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,200
 Yeah, he was one of the most famous.

629
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,880
 I sort of think of him as more famous than Drew Barrymore.

630
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,040
 I know.

631
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,880
 It was quite an amazing takedown of his career, to say.

632
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,000
 Yeah, I know, it's tough.

633
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,800
 It's tough.

634
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,560
 Although I can't name a single thing he would have been in.

635
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,200
 No, I think Drew Barrymore's more famous now, for sure.

636
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,840
 Yeah.

637
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,040
 She's in Spielberg movies.

638
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,840
 Now she's more famous.

639
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,640
 But in the '40s, John was more famous than Drew, definitely.

640
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:54,880
 Yeah.

641
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
 This is how these things progress, isn't it?

642
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,200
 Yeah.

643
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,760
 Absolutely.

644
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,760
 One quick thing on diving.

645
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,720
 This is about Derek Langos from Illinois.

646
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,040
 And he runs the Scuba Bear Diving Recovery Service,

647
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,280
 where if you've been in the area called the "Chain of Lakes,"

648
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,920
 which is like a lot of lakes where people do lots of diving,

649
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,960
 and you lose something in the water,

650
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,480
 he'll go and find it for you,

651
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
 and he will charge you a small amount of money.

652
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,920
 Like a human dog.

653
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,360
 Like a human diving underwater dog.

654
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,240
 Yeah, okay.

655
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
 And you've lost your phone.

656
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,680
 There's important stuff on there.

657
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,560
 He'll go and find it.

658
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,240
 Before you've lost your watch, he'll find it.

659
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,440
 But he often finds stuff that no one sent him for,

660
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,520
 and then he'll keep it.

661
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,840
 And hope that someone gets in touch with him and says,

662
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,280
 "Oh, I lost this."

663
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,520
 What do you think is the most common thing that he finds

664
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,200
 underwater when scuba diving in Illinois?

665
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,080
 In Illinois.

666
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,440
 Oh, that's a clue.

667
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:55,920
 Is there a clue?

668
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,640
 There's not a clue, though.

669
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,760
 The Keeney Bottoms.

670
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,160
 When he's on his dive in and they come off.

671
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,640
 Yeah.

672
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,200
 Sure.

673
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,040
 That this happens even more frequently than that happens,

674
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,000
 which I believe only happens in movies from the 1990s.

675
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
 I'm going to say prosthetic legs.

676
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,560
 The most common thing he finds here.

677
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,680
 The most common thing.

678
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,160
 Yeah.

679
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,840
 No, it's something even more common than that.

680
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,320
 Oh.

681
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,680
 Oh.

682
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,880
 Wedding ring.

683
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,200
 No.

684
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
 iPhones or watches.

685
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,080
 Watches.

686
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,640
 Watches.

687
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,480
 Apparently it's Apple watches.

688
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,720
 Those ones with the kind of sports bands that are plastic

689
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,600
 that go on, apparently they just don't steal people's wrists.

690
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,800
 There was a picture of all the things that he's got

691
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,040
 and literally more than half of the things with these watches.

692
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,000
 Wow, no way.

693
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,160
 So not other watches straps, fine.

694
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,840
 Apple has somehow made a watch strap

695
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,680
 that slips off as soon as you dive into the water.

696
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,440
 That does appear to be the case.

697
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,240
 Well done, Apple.

698
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,200
 That's very cool.

699
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,440
 Any more anecdotes about karaoke?

700
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,720
 I just, I had a, I didn't enjoy karaoke much when I did it.

701
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,200
 What did you do?

702
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,400
 What did you sing, Andy?

703
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,920
 I think it's like Heartbreak Hotel,

704
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,600
 which was a nice song and I love it,

705
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,680
 but it was not the sort of fun raucous Elvis,

706
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,200
 the other song, Heartbreak Hotel.

707
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,560
 I'm not going to do it again.

708
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,800
 I nearly fell for that.

709
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,360
 That's great.

710
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,520
 I don't know why anyone goes anywhere

711
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,480
 near liquid nitrogen.

712
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,560
 It's just because it appears in cocktail bars

713
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,480
 and it appears on QI and all these people.

714
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,680
 The two places you frequent most frequently.

715
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,120
 The coolest places I've ever been.

716
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,080
 It's just bouncing between the two.

717
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,200
 I just think it's what, like minus 200 degrees or something.

718
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,160
 It has an incredibly dangerous effect if you mishandle it.

719
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,960
 I wouldn't.

720
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,000
 It is crazy it's available.

721
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,640
 And you just get a cocktail way to spring on your glass

722
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,880
 and it has led to some awful things happening.

723
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,440
 One interesting thing about it is you're supposed to use specialist gloves,

724
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,920
 but don't use normal gloves with liquid nitrogen.

725
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,880
 It's better to use your skin than normal gloves.

726
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,920
 And the reason is due to something called the laden frost effect,

727
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,400
 where it's like when you pour water on a hot stove

728
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
 and it kind of runs around in little...

729
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,320
 Oh yeah, it looks hydrophobic as about.

730
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,760
 Skittles about, yeah, yeah.

731
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,240
 So that's what will happen with liquid nitrogen on your hand,

732
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,840
 because your hand's warm enough.

733
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,400
 To liquid nitrogen, your hand is like a hot stove,

734
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,600
 because it's so cold.

735
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,360
 So it won't, there'll be a protective layer

736
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,720
 and it won't burn your hand.

737
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,200
 If you put cloth on, like cloth gloves,

738
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,040
 then the cloth gloves will freeze

739
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,240
 and then you've got real problems

740
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,440
 because you've got freezing gloves on.

741
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,880
 And no one's volunteering to take those off.

742
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,560
 Absolutely no, no, you're done.

743
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,920
 Your hand is no more and all the nitrogen is gone.

744
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,360
 There was a story, which was quite fun, that was doing the rounds,

745
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,240
 which you might remember, doing the rounds in the 1880s.

746
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,040
 And it came up.

747
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,120
 I was reading the fan book at the time.

748
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,720
 Of course, didn't get around to this.

749
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,520
 Didn't see it, yeah.

750
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,080
 It came up and it was told about a lot of different places.

751
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,960
 I read a version from Canada, from Pennsylvania, from Liverpool.

752
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,520
 And it went that there was a lady, she seated in a carriage,

753
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,280
 she's sitting between two men.

754
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,240
 And one of the men slips his hand into her muff

755
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,680
 for a little bit of naughty.

756
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,120
 Hand holding under there.

757
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,200
 Just to confirm the meaning of the word 'muff' in this case is her...

758
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,360
 It's just her hand warmer, James, as, I think you know.

759
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,880
 No, it's just from herming for the audience, that's all.

760
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,000
 Yeah, yeah, thank you.

761
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,840
 The gentleman slips his hand into her muff

762
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,440
 and she's not up for being handheld,

763
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,520
 so she slips her opposite hand out.

764
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,280
 Then the gentleman on her other side slips his hand into her muff.

765
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,080
 Lovely.

766
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,680
 And she spends a good 10 or 15 minutes watching them

767
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
 as they both have a jolly good old time.

768
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
 And both of the gentlemen occasionally looking around at her,

769
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,600
 giving her a bit of a wink and a nudge.

770
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,800
 And then at the end of the journey...

771
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,720
 They're just rummaging around with each other's hands, basically.

772
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,160
 They're just rummaging around with each other's hands.

773
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,200
 And then at the end she says,

774
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,600
 "If you gentlemen are done with my muff, I'll have it back now."

775
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,440
 And they both get very embarrassed.

776
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,640
 I've had that done to me.

777
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,480
 I've done it without the muff, like, as in, I've been in a pub.

778
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,840
 And with my arm round my wife's shoulder.

779
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,440
 And then one of my friends would put his hand there

780
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,840
 and just let me stroke his hand.

781
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,040
 And let me allow me to think it was my wife's hand.

782
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,440
 Did he do that to embarrassed or did he just really crave

783
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,040
 for human contact?

784
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,440
 Hey, you know, so these days, you do have,

785
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,280
 before the movie starts, it says,

786
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,440
 "Please turn your mobile phone to side.

787
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,040
 Before the movie starts, it says,

788
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,200
 "Please turn your mobile phone to silent or off."

789
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,400
 Right? Let's not disturb.

790
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,080
 But obviously in early days of cinema,

791
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,040
 we didn't have mobile phones.

792
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,640
 So what do you think was one of the things

793
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,840
 that they had to say to people?

794
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,600
 "Please turn off your gramophone."

795
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,200
 Yeah, yeah, giant gramophone ordered in here.

796
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,440
 To the owner of a horse who's outside,

797
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,600
 sort of done coloured horses.

798
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,280
 It's done a big poo.

799
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,840
 Please go and clean out the poo.

800
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,480
 Is that it?

801
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,440
 No, that's not it.

802
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,240
 It says, "Not turn off your phones."

803
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,160
 Yeah, no, but it would be something on you.

804
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,640
 Ooh.

805
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,080
 And so this was directed for women, specifically women.

806
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,600
 Place your hat pins in the pockets provided.

807
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,920
 Where would you see them?

808
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,200
 I'll tell you why you're close.

809
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,520
 Remove your crinoline dresses because...

810
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,640
 Oh, remove your hats.

811
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,320
 Remove your hats.

812
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,160
 Yeah, they would have signs up saying,

813
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,280
 "Please remove your hats,"

814
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,440
 because pillbox hats got quite big

815
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,960
 during the Jackie Kennedy period.

816
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,040
 Abraham Lincoln's furious in the front row, unrecognisable.

817
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,640
 Well, he stored stuff in his hat, didn't he?

818
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,400
 So if he removed his, all of his notes come tumbling out.

819
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,080
 That's true, that's where he keeps the popcorn.

820
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,920
 On entomologists being useful,

821
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,000
 did you know that both bank holidays

822
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,800
 and daylight saving time were invented by entomologists?

823
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,120
 No.

824
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,760
 Oh, right.

825
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,560
 Oh, were they?

826
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,040
 Oh, did I?

827
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,280
 William Willett was scared on them.

828
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,240
 Well, it's one of those things

829
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,920
 where I think where daylight saving,

830
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,120
 there are a few steps.

831
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,400
 But the first person to suggest it

832
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
 was this Kiwi insect lover

833
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,640
 called George Hudson, who was an entomologist,

834
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,360
 and he came up with a concept in 1895,

835
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,120
 and it was because he wanted some extra daylight

836
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,760
 after his working hours to collect insects.

837
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,560
 You're nodding, Erica,

838
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,320
 is it either as if you know that

839
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,680
 or as if you're like, "Yeah, I would have done that."

840
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,120
 No, no, I think I've heard it.

841
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,520
 I've heard that story, and it was like, "Ah, yeah."

842
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
 And also, "Yeah, I totally get it."

843
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,120
 "Totally get it."

845
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,680
 Bank holidays used to be known, in fact,

846
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,320
 as St. Lubbock's days in the Victorian time,

847
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,400
 because they were invented by John Lubbock,

848
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,080
 who was a Liberal MP,

849
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,840
 and he wrote a book called "Ans, Bees and Wasps,"

850
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,520
 which was incredibly popular.

851
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,000
 It ran to 18 editions, like 18 reprints,

852
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
 because it kept selling out.

853
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,400
 And he also had a pet wasp.

854
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,080
 He tamed a wasp, and he presented it.

855
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,760
 I didn't know who to know.

856
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,040
 He did.

857
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,080
 He presented it to him.

858
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,120
 Tamed a wasp.

859
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,520
 Mary and Rushyard used to keep fleas.

860
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,280
 So you'd apparently turn up,

861
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,160
 and you'd have a little, like, a little dome of fleas.

862
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,400
 So everyone would suck tea and watch the view.

863
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,680
 Everyone watched the view.

864
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,080
 Can I ask you a question about flea circuses, Erika?

865
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,280
 Are they real?

866
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,920
 Well, some...

867
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,240
 Because I'm used to the thing where the showman says,

868
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,840
 "Look, are there fleas doing the tightrope

869
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,960
 and the tightrope pings?"

870
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,400
 And I can't believe it's real.

871
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,520
 I think there were some.

872
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,800
 Were there not some real ones?

873
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,160
 I think there aren't a few,

874
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
 but most of them were completely fake.

875
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,560
 So we've got the dress fleas on my desk at work.

876
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,600
 I've got the dress fleas.

877
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,480
 So these are in Mexico.

878
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,080
 So they were the pugas.

879
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,480
 These fleas were collected by local villagers,

880
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,240
 and they sold them as trinkets.

881
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,040
 And so they make these tiny little outfits,

882
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,280
 and then they use the flea as the head.

883
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,120
 So on my desk, I have two weddings and a mariachi dress.

884
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,240
 Oh, that's lovely.

885
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,440
 Oh, the little fleas.

886
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,320
 How cute.

887
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,480
 Wow, that must be absolutely tiny.

888
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,160
 I've seen smaller.

889
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,400
 The entomologists slam.

890
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,280
 That's brilliant.

891
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,160
 Every three months, the local haiku poets

892
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,240
 go to the post boxes, or they send an envoy,

893
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
 and they empty them out,

894
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,200
 and then they judge all the entries.

895
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,160
 The winner gets a prize.

896
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,960
 That's cool.

897
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,360
 Yeah.

898
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,800
 Yeah, so it won't disappear.

899
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,560
 It's not like writing a letter to Father Christmas,

900
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,320
 where, you know, who knows who's getting that.

901
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,640
 He reads it and then probably puts it in her pile somewhere.

902
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,680
 Right, yeah, exactly.

903
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,800
 But he doesn't give you a prize.

904
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,680
 Well, he gives you presents.

905
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,320
 Well, you get a letter.

906
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,840
 You get a letter back from Santa.

907
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,160
 Do you?

908
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,720
 What?

909
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,280
 You correspond with Santa multiple times.

910
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,080
 Throughout the year.

911
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,200
 Well, no, in the last six years,

912
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,480
 since I've had my eldest son.

913
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,440
 Yeah, if you send a letter to Santa,

914
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,160
 a letter comes back to you.

915
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,040
 I didn't know that.

916
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,680
 Yeah.

917
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,720
 Where are you sending it to?

918
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,080
 The North Pole.

919
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,920
 That's just right, Santa the North Pole.

920
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,960
 You get a letter back.

921
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,440
 Yeah, no, so there is a UK system

922
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,120
 where you buy a response letter,

923
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
 so you send it, your kids write it,

924
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,320
 and it comes back in the mail,

925
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,040
 and it's really nice to write it.

926
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,520
 Get away.

927
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,480
 No, it's a real thing.

928
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,000
 But kids don't want a letter back.

929
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,320
 No one, no kid writes RSVP at the bottom.

930
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,440
 See, Santa?

931
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,360
 Stop sending me fucking letters.

932
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,320
 You want an Xbox?

933
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,520
 OK, that's it.

934
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,480
 That is all of our facts.

935
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,760
 Thank you so much for listening.

936
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,600
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

937
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,800
 about the things that we've said

938
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,080
 over the course of this show,

939
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,040
 you can go to our website,

940
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,560
 nosuchthingasafish.com.

941
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,200
 There is the links to get you into the world of Clubfish,

942
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,960
 which is our secret members group,

943
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
 and there's a great Discord that you can join

944
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,240
 and lots of bonus content

945
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,760
 that we put out through Clubfish.

946
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,800
 Or you can just get access

947
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,400
 to all of our previous episodes,

948
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,120
 as well as bitches.

949
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,640
 As well as bitches.

950
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,560
 [LAUGHTER]

951
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,240
 All of our previous bitches live there.

952
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,200
 All of our previous bitches.

953
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,400
 The word "bitch" is also an offensive word for a woman.

954
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,680
 Or those bits of merchandise

955
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,360
 so you can get your hands on there.

956
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,720
 Otherwise, just come back here next week.

957
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,160
 We're going to be back with another episode,

958
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,280
 and we'll see you then.

959
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,000
 Goodbye.

960
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,040
 Bitches.

961
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:34,160
 All right, that is it.

962
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,680
 That is all of our outtakes.

963
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,800
 Thanks, everyone, for listening.

964
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,240
 You want to get in touch with any of us.

965
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,400
 You can do it through our regular social media accounts,

966
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,760
 or you can email us at podcast@qi.com.

967
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,440
 But again, just a reminder,

968
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,080
 if you would like to come see us live in Sydney

969
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,000
 for our extra show on November the 10th,

970
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,120
 go to nosuchthingasafish.com/sidney

971
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,320
 on the 12th of June.

972
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,840
 You'll have until the Friday

973
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,040
 to get your presale tickets

974
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,120
 before they go open to the rest of the world.

975
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,920
 And that's right.

976
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,440
 And for those of you who want to come

977
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,800
 to our additional show in London

978
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,400
 on the 24th of October,

979
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,440
 then you can visit

980
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,920
 nosuchthingasafish.com/london

981
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,040
 on the 12th of June

982
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,800
 to get those presale tickets for our show.

983
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,680
 In the meantime, why not go to our Discord?

984
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,640
 What is a Discord?

985
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,440
 I hear you ask.

986
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,160
 Well, a Discord is a place where

987
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,760
 like-minded individuals

988
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,160
 can discuss the things that they love.

989
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,320
 And indeed, we have one.

990
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,440
 It's called FishCord.

991
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,800
 And the way to find that is to go to

992
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,920
 nosuchthingasafish.com/fishcord.

993
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,040
 The fish, actually, we dip our toes in there every now and then

994
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,280
 to give you little bits of extra behind-the-scenes stuff.

995
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,040
 So do go to FishCord.

996
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,360
 So that's part of your secret society perk

997
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,200
 of being part of Club Fish.

998
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,840
 That's it for now.

999
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,280
 We're going to be back again in a couple of weeks

1000
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
 with another bit of bonus material.

1001
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,560
 We will see you all then.

1002
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,600
 Catch you later, bitches.

1003
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,560
 Jesus.

1004
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,040
 [LAUGHTER]

1005
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,620
 (upbeat music)

1006
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:04,620
 [BLANK_AUDIO]
