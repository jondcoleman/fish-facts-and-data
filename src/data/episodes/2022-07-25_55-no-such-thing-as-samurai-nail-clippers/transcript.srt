00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:52,400
 Hello and welcome to another episode and most such thing is a fish a weekly podcast. This week coming to you from the Soho Theatre in Central London. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting with James Harkin, Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski, and once again, we have our four favorite facts. We're sat around on microphones and in no particular order. Here we go, starting with you, James Harkin. Okay, my fact this week is that firefighters use wetter water than we do.

3
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,400
 [Laughter]

4
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,800
 Is that in everyday life as well? Just cleaning their teeth and having a shower? No, just for putting up fires.

5
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:15,000
 So what do you mean by wetter water? Well, it's just about how weird water is really. Apparently, if you put certain polymers into water, there is less friction in the pipe, so it shoots out of the pipe quicker.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 So, and it's called a wetting agent and it's to make water wetter. Did someone notice that it was going really slowly out of the pipe and sort of hanging around and how much faster does it go?

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Well, there is, they use it in oil as well and in the Alaskan pipeline they put this stuff in and it reduces pumping cost by up to 50%.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Because it just pumps up more. It pumps up quite a lot. You don't want to mix up the oil in the water if you're a firefighter as well.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 It's terrible. I don't think you can mix oil and water, isn't that the whole point? That's a very good point.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 [Laughter]

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 That's amazing. So, when it's the first time they use this stuff, there were puddles about around and the firefighters were complaining that they were slipping on the puddles because it was so wet.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Quick step in one of those puddles of water for stability.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 So, do you know how long they've been using it?

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 This was, I'm not sure exactly when it came out when they found it out but I think it was in the 60s or 70s and it was a guy called BA Toms and it's called the Toms Effect, this thing that makes it slipper.

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 On slippery water, no one knows why ice is slippery today or no one knows why it says, well the reason ice is slippery is that there's a tiny film of water forms on top of water when it freezes and scientists don't know why water does that.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Why this tiny film of water forms and why it's slippery and that's just another weird thing about water.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 The other thing is that it's sticky and slippery ice. Like if you put your tongue and it sticks with it but also it's slippery and that's just a weird thing to happen.

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Just on water being wetter, my dad uses scissors that are sharper than most scissors.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I was trying to think when I found out this fact. I was just like, "Oh, what else is more than what it's meant to be?"

20
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And my dad actually, my dad's a hairdresser and he has a pair of scissors that were forged by samurai in Japan.

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 It's starting to understand what you believe all this crap about, yes it is. Your dad's been spinning you've served lies since you were a child.

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 So sorry, they were splashing the bin.

23
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 They weren't, no, honestly. They were flogged in the fire of some more dark.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 There are pair of scissors that were forged by samurai and they are the sharpest pair of scissors that you can buy in the world.

25
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And he's had them for 35 coming up to 40 so it's in between that bracket. One day they'll be given to you.

26
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 No, but he's consistently, as a hairdresser, you're meant to get your scissors sharpened every few years.

27
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 He goes every few years to get them sharpened and the people at the sharpening place go, "We can do nothing for you."

28
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 These are sharp as they have ever been, as they ever will be.

29
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And they're just samurai scissors.

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 So what kind of samurai blacksmith makes scissors slow? Is this someone who's been kicked out of the swords bit of blacksmith?

31
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 But if you're a samurai, you're not going to imagine when they're clipping their nails and stuff. They probably have samurai nail clippers.

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 If you're used to that kind of excellence, you're just going to create more products that are going to help you out.

33
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Yeah, that sounds implausible.

34
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 I promise you, everyone Google it, samurai scissors exist.

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Suddenly you had to have your scissors sharpened every few years as a hairdresser. That surprises me.

36
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Yeah. Oh, well, there's a fact.

37
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 That's good.

38
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 So on fire, the very earliest fire fighting organisations in the USA, they were all volunteer ones.

39
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And normally they couldn't do very much because they didn't have much suction through the fire hoses.

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So what they were doing instead, one of the most important things was called a bed key.

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And this was to break down a bed frame, a wooden bed frame, because that was often the most valuable thing in a house.

42
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And so they said, "Well, we can't really do much for the house, but we did at least get your bed frame out."

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And that was the thing.

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 In those days, it wouldn't have made any sense to ask, "What would you save in a fire?"

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Because everyone said, "My bed frame."

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Is that because it was made out of iron?

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 No, there wouldn't. So important to get out.

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 If it's iron, you just leave it there. Come back with the fire.

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Yeah, because what they used to do when they moved house in the old days in America is they would burn down the old house.

50
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And they would take the nails out of the burning gashes because nails were so expensive to make.

51
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 But you're just talking about firefighters. The very first firefighting brigade was from ancient Roman times.

52
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And it was a guy called Crasseus, which James and I always talk about.

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 We've never said it on this podcast. I love this guy.

54
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 He basically realized that when fires were happening, you could make a lot of money by setting up a thing to put them out.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And so he used to do this thing where he announced he had like a 500 person fleet for his first fire brigade.

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And a fire would start. And they'd all race to it. And as soon as they got there, they wouldn't put the fire out.

57
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 They'd negotiate how much the guy was willing to pay for them to put the fire out.

58
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And if they didn't reach an agreement, they'd just let it burn.

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And they'd all just watch it burn to the ground.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 And then Crasseus would buy the house back cheaper.

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 He'd be like, "Are you doing anything with this plot?"

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 No, it's not cheaper.

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Yeah.

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 This house was depreciated and valued.

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 It seems turning into a pile of ash.

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 But yeah, that was the first ever fire brigade.

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 The first ever fire hose was in ancient Greece, I think.

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And I think this is another example of inventions, which I love, which are inventions which then disappear.

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 People forget about them and don't make them again for ages.

70
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 So I think this vanished for 1,700 years.

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 But fire hose invented in ancient Greece.

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And it was made out of an ox's intestine.

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And I think so it was you put water in a bag.

74
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And then you attach a bag to an ox's intestine.

75
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And then you remove the intestine from the ox first.

76
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 I think it depends what you want to be spraying out.

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 But yeah, conventionally, yes.

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 You're trying to make yogurt, however.

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And yeah, the force at which water kicks was expelled from the ox guts was amazing.

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Wow.

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 That's so good.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 It's very cool.

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 I read about a guy who invented a helmet that you would sew.

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 One of the big problems, obviously, when you were going into a fire was that you would smother yourself with the smoke you'd pass out.

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 So everyone was trying to work out.

86
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 In 1823, a guy called Charles Dean invented a helmet that had a hose attached to it.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 So you would go in and you'd have air pushed in through the hose so you could breathe.

88
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 No one ended up using it, though, because it was made of metal.

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And all people were inside.

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 He was suddenly going, "WOW!"

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And dashing back out.

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And this kettle with a mask, yeah.

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But then he transferred the design to a diving helmet.

94
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And those were the very first diving helmets that we...

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Yeah, it's the same guys.

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And that's what it became.

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Yeah, that's very cool.

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 A hundred years before that, which was in 1723,

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 the first automatic fire extinguisher was painted in England.

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And this was a guy called Ambrose Godfrey,

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 and it consisted of a cask of fire extinguishing fluid and a load of gunpowder.

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And you would set fire to the gun plow there.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 It would explode.

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And then the water would go everywhere.

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And then it would put it out.

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 I did.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Did they use to have fire extinguishing grenades as well?

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Yeah.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 They were called fox balls, weren't they?

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Fooks.

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Fooks.

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Sorry.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 They were invented by a German guy called Fooks.

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Yeah.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 They were little glass balls with water or a liquid inside

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 and you would throw them at the fire and they would come out.

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Really?

118
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 It's terrifying.

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Oh, thank God, the fire department here.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Grenade!

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 [laughter]

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Like that.

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Have you guys had a smoke jumpers?

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 I have not.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 No.

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 These are the coolest people in the world.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 They jump out of planes to put out fires.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 They've just...

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 They parachute down onto fires and put them out.

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Wow.

131
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Well, how...

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Well...

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Because I guess from that height, it looks really small.

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 But once you go higher...

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Put it down there.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 With your pocket.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 With your pocket.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 No, they genuinely do this.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 This happens in whether a forest fires, so in places in the USA,

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 where you can get fires and it's much faster to get there, basically, with...

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And obviously, it's not for a mass response.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 You can't have hundreds of people doing it.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 But these people do exist.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And I've read a frequently asked questions.

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I read a little interview with a guy who is a smoke jumper.

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And they just sound like the hardest people in the world.

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 So, isn't it dangerous landing in a fire?

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 We land close to not in the fire.

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 (LAUGHTER)

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And then he went on, at least that's the plan.

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 (LAUGHTER)

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 It's not uncommon to land in smoldering areas.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 So cool.

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Yeah, they're the most hardcore men in the world.

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Yeah, the things they take as well, they take backpacks,

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 which have a little pumping power supplies on them.

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Sometimes they take chainsaws, which I think is to...

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 The cut trees which are at risk of being close to the fire.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I haven't researched that bit enough.

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 But sometimes they would have like a crocodile.

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 (LAUGHTER)

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And we're going to have to move on to the next phase.

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Yeah, if you've got something more.

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Can I just tell people, because we're on water,

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 you could go the rest of your life without drinking water again.

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 This is just a big piece of propaganda from water merchants who...

167
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Big water.

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Big water company is taking over your life.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 So that whole thing about you have to drink eight cups of water a day.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 No scientist know where that comes from.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 There's no scientific basis for it.

172
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 You can replace water if you like.

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 With coffee tea is not going to dehydrate.

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Coffee does have water in it though.

175
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 When I say water, I mean, you could dilute it with...

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 It doesn't need to be water.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 You mean you could have ribina instead.

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 But coffee tea, don't dehydrate you, massively rehydrate you.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And drinking eight cups of water a day is too much.

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 You shouldn't drink water unless you feel thirsty.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 And also, it doesn't help you if you're an athlete.

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 It doesn't help you drinking more water.

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 So they tested cyclists.

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 They had some dehydrated cyclists compete against some non-dehydrated cyclists.

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Didn't make a difference.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Totally fine.

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I mean, it would make a difference eventually.

188
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Yeah.

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Yeah, so they didn't dehydrate them to death.

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 God, ethics committees these days are a nightmare.

191
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 So Anna Chazinski says you do not need to drink water.

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And yet, I'm the dickhead for saying I don't have samurai scissors.

193
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Sure.

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

195
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Yes, my fact is that plants have their own internet.

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 And it's made of fungus.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 So not only this, they've got their internet,

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 which proceeds ours by hundreds of years, by the way.

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And 80% of them assigned up to it.

200
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 But wait, to the ones which don't have it, are they in urban areas?

201
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 They have a plant in developing countries and they rural places.

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 They have cybercrime online.

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 They have social media.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 They're going to have social media.

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 They have online shopping.

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I'm just going to go on like this.

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Like I've lost the plot.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 They've got my space.

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 They've got eBay.

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 They've got a lot.

211
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 They do.

212
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 They've got tree Bay.

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Sorry, yes.

214
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I hate myself a lot.

215
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 So they have this network of fungus attached.

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 You know when you pick up a plant and you see there's the white strands coming off plants roots.

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 That's a kind of fungus.

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And this system is called mycorrhizae.

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And it's a way of them communicating with each other.

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So this fungus will link a whole garden of plants together or a whole forest of trees together.

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And if one tree is lacking in nutrients or water, then it will send out a signal.

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And then another tree will be able to send it nutrients or water via the fungus.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 They have news updates.

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 This is my version of news updates.

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 So if they're under attack, let's say for instance, a plant is being attacked by an aphid,

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 then they'll be able to emit signals via the mycorrhizae network.

227
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And other plants around will know that the aphids are coming and they will put up their defenses.

228
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Yeah, but how much defense does a tree have?

229
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Because I remember reading a few years ago that when giraffes eat acacia trees,

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 they will give out some kind of signal to the other trees to say they're a giraffes coming.

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 You're going to get eaten.

232
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 But how do you stop yourself from eating?

233
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Basically, it's just a lot of other messages going, well shit.

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Now I'm going to get eaten and spend the last hour of my life afraid.

235
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Actually, that's a really interesting question.

236
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Thanks for asking.

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And this is so many ways.

238
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 So they can pump out chemicals to make themselves less tasty to attacking insects.

239
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 One really clever thing that some bean plants do is so they are preyed upon by aphids.

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And when they get preyed upon by aphids, they send out a perfume which is delicious to wasps.

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And wasps come, so they use wasps as their bodyguards.

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 And the wasps come, kill the aphids.

243
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 So they just cool on their bodyguards, what wasp bodyguards?

244
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 I think that's so cool.

245
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Yeah, that actually is what the smell of cut grasses is.

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 It's partly the grass screaming, apparently.

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 What?

248
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 The smell of the lovely smell of cut grass is partly the plant screaming.

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 It's partly summoning creatures to stop the predator because it thinks it's being eaten by other insects.

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 So it cools over it.

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 You know, you can actually, this is so weird.

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Because it does sound like plants have a slight intelligent.

253
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 It seems so dubious.

254
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 I was reading this paper and it was saying that you could, you know, anesthetic works on plants.

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 They go down like, what does that mean?

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And this other one was that basically if you play a recording of a caterpillar munching on a leaf,

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 next to a certain plant, the plant will respond to it and let off a defense mechanism as well.

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 So it's not even like a real thing going, it's just listening to a record of like this happening.

259
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It's happening.

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 But how? It doesn't have ears.

261
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 What is it?

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 I think it might be acoustic vibrations, air vibrations.

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 But the same thing if there's a water pipe, which is enclosed in a pipe which couldn't possibly be emitting any water into the soil,

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 roots will grow towards it because it's assumed they can hear the sound of water.

265
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Is that normal water, sorry, or is it?

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Is it James's super water?

267
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 There was a study in 2009 by the Royal Horticultural Society about how quickly plants grow if you talk to them.

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Because obviously, you know, the whole thing, Prince Charles did that then he taught to his plants and stuff.

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 They found that tomato plants grew up to two inches taller if they were serenaded by a female rather than a male.

270
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And the most effective talker came from a lady called Sarah Darwin, who was a great, great, grand daughter of Charles Darwin.

271
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 No.

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 What? Only me, you could eat.

273
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 The most effective plantalker in the world is a relative of Charles Darwin.

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And the things that she does, I tell you what, it gets better.

275
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 She read out an excerpt from Darwin's On the Origin of the Species.

276
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 That's so hot.

277
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Literally the hottest sentence I've ever heard of.

278
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Darwin has just got two inches bigger than me.

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 That is amazing.

280
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 I looked up, it's a while on the Fungal Network that connects all plants.

281
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 I looked up some British fungi names.

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 British fungi include the Jelly Ear, the bearded tooth, the weeping tooth crust, the slimy earth tongue,

283
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 the fetted parachute, the brainfold truffle, and my favourite, the Harry Nuts Disco.

284
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Well that's the thing, I was looking for this as well, not fungus, but just plants.

285
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 They all used to have really rude names.

286
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Dandelions, trying to be known as dandelions, were originally called Pissabed.

287
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Oh yeah.

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And they were called Pissabed because...

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 In French they're called Pisson Leigh, which is the same.

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And it's because they would make you wait, right?

291
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Yeah, yeah, that was the idea.

292
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 So everyone was like, well let's just call it Pissabed, because that's not...

293
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Well that wasn't these other names.

294
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Mayor's fort, naked ladies, open arse,

295
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 hounds piss, and bum towel.

296
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 So insects can talk to each other using a plant as a kind of telephone.

297
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Wow, yeah.

298
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 This is before they got the internet.

299
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 They do that.

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 So if you've got an insect that's feeding on the roots, he doesn't want another insect feeding on the leaves

301
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 because they could kill their plant too quickly.

302
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And so they'll send up a kind of signal to the leaves, saying we don't want anyone eating these leaves.

303
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And it's like a no vacancies kind of sign.

304
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Yeah, that's really cool.

305
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 And there was a guy called Clive Baxter, he was a lie detector expert working for the FBI.

306
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And he claimed that if you wind up a plant to a polygraph machine,

307
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 you'll be able to detect what they're thinking.

308
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Okay, so this was his experiment.

309
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Where were you on the night of the...

310
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 What have you done with the soil?

311
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 So he had a room with two plants in it.

312
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Six students took it in turns to enter the room,

313
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 and then one of them stamped on and killed a plant in front of another plant.

314
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Okay, but then they had a lineup.

315
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Pretty much.

316
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 When the five innocent students later walked into the room,

317
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 there was little to no response from the plant.

318
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 However, when the murderer came in, the plant went wild.

319
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 The study has never been able to be replicated.

320
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 We're going to have to move on to our next facts.

321
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Anyone else got anything?

322
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 I lost it all on the hairy nut's disco, I'm afraid.

323
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

324
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 My fact is that in 1710, the boys of Winchester College rioted over insufficient beer rations.

325
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 I think it was the sixth form to be fair, but still.

326
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 This is from a book called The Old Boys,

327
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 The Decline and Rise of the Public School by a guy called David Turner.

328
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And it's just incredible.

329
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 There were loads of public school riots during the 17th and 18th and 19th centuries.

330
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 So in 1690, the boys at Manchester Grammar disagreed with their teachers about the Christmas holiday timings

331
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 and responded by locking themselves in with guns and firing warning shots

332
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 that anyone who came near the school for a fortnight.

333
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 What was their objection? Don't lock yourself in the school if you want.

334
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 That's very true.

335
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 But these things happened in 70 years.

336
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Just at Eaton, there were six full-scale riots.

337
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And so how much beer did they get? Do we know?

338
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I don't know.

339
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Because actually, in the olden days, people used to drink a lot of beer, didn't they?

340
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Because it was safer than drinking water and it would be quite weak beer,

341
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 but you would still have it nonetheless.

342
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 But like kids as well.

343
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Kids would just be downing pines going, "Oh, you don't actually need to drink water, that's the thing."

344
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 There's lots of drinks, lots of lots of beer.

345
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 That's the wise lesson.

346
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 In fact, the first children's picture book that is known to man has instructions for brewing your own beer.

347
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Really?

348
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 As instructions for home brewing beer and making your own wine.

349
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Yeah, amongst other things, but it's an important life lesson, I think.

350
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 In the work houses, men would have two pints of beer a day,

351
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 according to the official diet that they were allowed.

352
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And children had one pint and women had a pint of beer and a pint of tea.

353
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 That was the official rules that they were supposed to have, they didn't all get it.

354
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 So is it healthy for kids to drink beer?

355
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Yes!

356
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And yet, the beer accrat's in Brussels.

357
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I've decided it isn't.

358
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 No, we're saying it's not, but like in the olden days people,

359
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 it was better to drink beer, which had been brewed than drink water, which hadn't been boiled,

360
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 because it was really bad for you.

361
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Women in labour in the 16th century were given groaning beer,

362
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 which was consumed during labour.

363
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And it was supposed to help you rather than anesthetics, I guess.

364
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Yeah, there was actually a whole range of groaning foods.

365
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 That's true.

366
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Yeah, you had groaning pie.

367
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 It sounds like a straight out of Harry Potter.

368
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 A groaning pie.

369
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 In the Navy, of course, they would have lots of alcohol.

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 The daily ration up until 1740 was half a pint of meat rum twice a day.

371
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 That's good, right?

372
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Yeah, the Navy would piss the whole time, weren't they?

373
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 How do we win any battles?

374
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Honestly, they would go drunk into war. That was their big thing.

375
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Actually, I did find, speaking of this, some lyrics from the original lyrics of

376
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 "What should we do with the drunk and sailor?"

377
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Oh, wow.

378
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Do you want to hear those?

379
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Yeah.

380
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Here are a few.

381
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 "Put him in the hole with an angry weasel."

382
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 "Stick him in a bag and beat him senseless."

383
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 It was another one.

384
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And the other one is, "Put him in the hole with a captain's daughter."

385
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Wow.

386
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Yeah.

387
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 But actually a captain...

388
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Isn't that punishing the daughter?

389
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Well, the captain's daughter was a nickname for the cat and our nine tales.

390
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Hey, just very quickly, an update from a very old fact that we did on the show, just going

391
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 from you saying "Put them in a bag and beat them."

392
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 There was that fact that you said about how you used to get thrown into...

393
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Okay, so there was an old punishment in the olden days.

394
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 It was capsule punishment, I guess.

395
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 What you would be put into a bag with a cockerel, a cat and a snake, right?

396
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 In Britain you couldn't get snakes very easily and so they would just make do with a picture

397
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 of a snake.

398
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 There were a couple of other little riot...

399
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 No, there were massive riots.

400
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 So, for the 1793 winches to college riot, which I think we all remember.

401
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 But basically the headmaster, they were called wardens in those days, had ordered the whole

402
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 school to be punished because of one boy's misdemeanor.

403
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 And the boy's wrote to him saying, "That's unfair, you've broken the rules."

404
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And he wrote back, not answering them satisfactorily.

405
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 So, they perceived the school again armed with guns, swords and clubs.

406
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 So, it's just a common response.

407
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 The nice thing about it is the whole correspondence between them was in Latin.

408
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Very cool.

409
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 I was looking up stuff about how alcohol might be good for children.

410
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Yep, we are a small but growing political body.

411
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 We're starting in five constituencies this election.

412
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 A few people think that it's actually good for you.

413
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 So, for example, do you guys know about beer and Belgian?

414
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 The schools in Belgium, there was a big push to introduce beer back into schools, yeah.

415
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And they actually tested it out on a school.

416
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And they all failed their exams.

417
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 No, they didn't.

418
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 So, the alcohol had only between 1.5 and 2.5% of alcohol in it.

419
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 This was set up in one particular school where they wanted to test out, do a test run to see if it actually worked.

420
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And they found that 75% of the students that they surveyed said, "Are we really like it?"

421
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And unfortunately, no other school was willing to do the test.

422
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 There shouldn't be the way you judge whether it's a good thing asking the drunk peoples.

423
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Did you like that?

424
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Obviously, they really like it.

425
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Yeah, but the heroin trial at the same school is going great.

426
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Did you have some stuff about riots, Davis?

427
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Did you want to hear some?

428
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Yeah.

429
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Okay, let me think.

430
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Okay, well, you only need three people to cause riots in the UK.

431
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 And we've got four.

432
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 You only need two people in Nevada to cause a riot.

433
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Wow, which is pretty good.

434
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Is there any way we can have a one person riot?

435
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I've never found it anywhere in the world and I have lucked.

436
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 And just one other thing about beer, in 1883, there was a competition organised by the Church of England Temperance Society

437
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 and they wanted to see how good beer was compared to water.

438
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 And the game was simple. Two men would cut down as much corn as possible in the field.

439
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 One was only allowed to drink water and the other was only allowed to drink beer.

440
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And the winner was beer.

441
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And Mr. Terrell, playing for beer, cleared just over 20 acres in 12 hours versus Mr. Robbie's 19 acres.

442
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 So he got an extra raker.

443
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 And they were going to give the winner a gold medal, but he collapsed before they could do something.

444
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And so they dragged him into a ward and anointed him with whiskey.

445
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 We're going to have to move on by the way.

446
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 So this is very, very closely related.

447
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 I think that your rioters at public school who were rioting about beer then went on, obviously, to continue to do the same thing.

448
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Because a famous riot that happened in Oxford in 1355 was the St. Scholastica Day riot.

449
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And this was when this happened in the Swindle-Stocked Heaven.

450
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And it was when water springe hose and Roger De Chesterfield, two university students, surprisingly enough,

451
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 with the tavernor John Croydon about the quality of the beer there, or about the quality of the drinks in his pub,

452
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 they ended up assaulting him.

453
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And in the end, 200 students started rioting.

454
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 It lasted two days, 63 scholars and 30 locals were left dead.

455
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 But it ended up being blamed on.

456
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Sorry, it's the 14th century.

457
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 It's too soon, Anna. It's too soon.

458
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 It's intake of breath over there.

459
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 They're all in it now.

460
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 The Chesterfields in tonight, actually.

461
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Sorry to the Springe hose family.

462
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 So the dispute was settled and it turned out that the mayor had been arguing on the side of the townspeople,

463
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 the non-students who've been saying this is unfair.

464
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 We've been attacked for the quality of the beer we're serving by these post-students.

465
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 And the mayor was found in the wrong, and his counsellors were found in the wrong.

466
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And they had to march bare headed through the streets and pay the university a fine of one penny for every scholar killed for 470 years.

467
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And they did that until 1825 when the mayor decided this was getting ridiculous.

468
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 The currency was changing so many times anyway with very hard to know what to pay.

469
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And it stopped, but yeah, the...

470
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Well...

471
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Can I just say I think we've done very well so far of hardly being rude at all in this podcast,

472
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 because there's been penis, penis, penis until now of this last five episodes.

473
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Yes, there's been no filth whatsoever this podcast so far in all of these first three facts.

474
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Can we move on now?

475
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Yeah, sure.

476
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show.

477
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And that is my fact.

478
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 My fact this week is that the first man to discover the clitoris...

479
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 ...was Colombo.

480
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 So Colombo, not the detective.

481
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Well, I know what a shame. I just love that. So this is a guy who's suddenly...

482
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 It was 1559, I believe. He suddenly said, "Guess what guys? I found the clitoris."

483
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 And everyone was like, "No, we knew where it was anyway."

484
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 But he was the first person to properly say, "This is where the clitoris is."

485
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And he was an amazing physician.

486
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 He was working with Michelangelo on a book that was about the anatomy, which Michelangelo was going to illustrate.

487
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 You know what happened? We don't know how it never came out, but that would have been the most seminal book of medical history.

488
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Michelangelo said, "Well, I like drawing the occasional penis, but this is ridiculous."

489
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Seminal seemed like an unfortunate choice of what I did, didn't it?

490
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I looked on the etymon line to find out the etymology of clitoris and they're not really sure.

491
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 It either comes from the Greek for "to shut" or "a key" or "the side of a hill" or "the tickler."

492
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 I guess it depends on the woman, presumably.

493
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And then they go and say the anatomist Matio Colombo, who you were talking about,

494
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Professor Padua claimed to have discovered it. He called it Amor Veneris, Veldudseido, or whatever,

495
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 which is the love or sweetness of Venus. But then it says, "It had been known earlier to women."

496
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 So, yeah, I think that's the problem, really. For him to say he discovered it.

497
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 He was the first person to proclaim to have discovered it.

498
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Well, yeah, so you say there was another arrival doctor, also male, Gabriel Fallopius,

499
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 who, when this guy came out with this announcement, said, "I've discovered the clitoris.

500
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 I've written about it in my book." And they had a proper, so he tried to sue him for plagiarism, I think,

501
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 stating his idea of clitoris.

502
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 You're right, I think the clitoris. Yeah.

503
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 There was another, there was another doctor as well. He was called Vesalius.

504
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And I think he taught Fallopio. So I think the grudge match was originally between Vesalius and Colombo.

505
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And Vesalius said that it was, he described it as a new and useless part.

506
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 So, presumably, he was just throwing shade at the clitoris because he was angry not to have discovered it.

507
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 I think, we'll see his teacher, he might have been his student. But anyway, I do know that once this started coming about,

508
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 one of them was dead and so one of them tried to sue the other and it was completely useless because the dead person was...

509
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Was Fallopio the guy who invented, not invented?

510
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Discovered Fallopian Jews.

511
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Fallopia actually built the first woman.

512
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Yeah, 16th century. Yeah, he was.

513
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 So, a really cool thing about Fallopia, Gabriel Fallopias. He did find and describe the Fallopian Chubes.

514
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And he named them the Fallopian Chubes.

515
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Fallopian, after his own name, Fallopias and Chubes, after the fact that they look like Chubas, the instrument.

516
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Nothing to do with the fact that they're Chubes.

517
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Yeah, that's a mistranslation. So the Fallopian Chubes, it was supposed to be the Fallopian Chubas.

518
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 And it's because the shape of them is like a brass tuba.

519
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 If everyone, if everyone listening to this, starts only calling them Fallopian tubas, we can change the world.

520
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 How often in conversation, Andy, I've been here.

521
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 I'll say once a day for the rest of the year, I'll say Fallopian tubas if you do.

522
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 So, Fallopias invented the first condom as well, didn't he?

523
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 It was covered in salt and had to be like a cocktail or something.

524
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 I suppose literally like a cocktail in a way.

525
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Don't forget to put a bit of salt around the rim.

526
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Sorry.

527
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Sorry.

528
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 It's the line from an episode at the bottom, I watched the other day.

529
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Oh dear.

530
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 So his condom was covered in salt and it had to be tucked under the foreskin, so it was uncomfortable.

531
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 So much as it was unusable.

532
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 And it was to kind of stop syphilis rather than through contraception.

533
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 But also it was held on by a pink ribbon so that it would appeal to women.

534
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Let's be honest guys, we know she's not going to like the main event.

535
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 But we can't at least doll it up a bit.

536
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 So he was doing this because it was a massive rise in STI's STD.

537
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Syphilis was a big one.

538
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 This is the sentence that confused me.

539
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 I didn't actually read anymore, I should have.

540
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 But he tested these condoms in 1,100 men.

541
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Now, did he test them?

542
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 And there were no pregnancies, not one now.

543
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 To find me to say it doesn't work.

544
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Just speaking of Philopio, who's there's a body part, so obviously named after him.

545
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 I was looking at other body parts that are named after people.

546
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 And the pedendal canal is also called the alcock canal or the alcock canal

547
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 because it was discovered by Benjamin alcock.

548
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 And it's where blood is carried to the genitalia.

549
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 So Benjamin alcock discovered the little tube that carries blood to your willy.

550
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 That's so good.

551
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Because I'm always getting that in conversation.

552
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 That's good to know now.

553
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Again, we were talking about names earlier for plants.

554
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And this is the same thing.

555
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 So Philopian tube.

556
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 I was looking through just a list of people who discovered a bit of the body

557
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 and had it named out of them.

558
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 There's so many bits of the body that I didn't know about.

559
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 And it sounds like the most awesome fantasy novel.

560
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 If someone was on a trip, like they would, like imagine,

561
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 okay, they're passing the pouch of Douglas.

562
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 They make the way through to the crypt of Libakun.

563
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 That's a place on our body, the crypt of Libakum, the sphincter of Odi.

564
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 The zonul of Zinn.

565
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Well, the zonul of Zinn sounds like where your dad had his scissors made.

566
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 I knew you were going to have a look at some things named after people.

567
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 So in 2004, there was a group of scientists who discovered a new species of cockroach

568
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 that they described as dirty, ugly, smelly, and the need of a name.

569
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 And this cockroach extrudes urine out of its back and deposits it on his genital region

570
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 for the female to eat.

571
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 And they made it so that you could bid to name it after your enemy.

572
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Isn't that cool?

573
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 It's such a good idea.

574
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 And so whoever bid the most, I don't know who won it, unfortunately,

575
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 because they haven't said anything.

576
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Sure, you don't.

577
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Even though it's released and it's down-tribe, the next week, it's going to become perfectly clear.

578
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Well, that's such a good idea, isn't it?

579
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Naming something horrible and disgusting after all.

580
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Yeah.

581
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 Because Linnaeus, he named an ugly, insignificant weed after one of his critics.

582
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 It's called Seeks Bechia.

583
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Wow.

584
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 That's great.

585
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Is it true?

586
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 So Linnaeus, can you just quickly explain who he is?

587
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 He is the father of taxonomy.

588
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 So he came up with the idea of naming things in this Latin system that we use.

589
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Yeah, and he was obsessed with...

590
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 I mean, he was really egotistical.

591
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 He thought he was the God's gift to the planet, really.

592
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Yeah, he said God makes Linnaeus' names.

593
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 That's his.

594
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Right.

595
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 So is this true that he had a garden that he could tell the time of the day by

596
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 because he knew plants so well that when they opened, he'd be like, oh, it's three.

597
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Yeah, I think it's time of the year as well, maybe.

598
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Oh, wow.

599
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Yeah.

600
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Well, I mean, I could tell the time of the year.

601
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 The thing I really like about this back, though, is that it is that man thing of going,

602
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 I've discovered the clitoris of everyone's going, no, we knew about it.

603
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 It's like we women knew about this.

604
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And just the way that medical journals used to talk about the anatomy of a woman back in the day

605
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 was just so absurd.

606
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 And so I found one in the British Medical Journal from 1878, they ran a correspondence

607
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 between people where they were discussing on whether menstruating women's touches,

608
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 like, so a menstruating woman, if she touched a bit of ham, whether it would ruin the ham.

609
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 And that was like a serious thing, they're like, maybe they shouldn't be touching ham.

610
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Was that a massive problem before that?

611
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 We're menstruating women constantly touching ham.

612
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 You get this urge.

613
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 It's impossible to explain.

614
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Obviously, I'm in every butcher in London as soon as...

615
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 I mean, they were thinking some extraordinary things at the time, the time that the clitoris was discovered.

616
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 So it was still thought at the time that there was one sex and that a woman was just a

617
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 less developed version of a man, and that in the womb, the fetus hadn't received enough heat,

618
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 so hadn't been able to spur its clitoris into a penis in time.

619
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And so a clitoris was just a less developed version of a penis, people thought.

620
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 And there was a belief that Galen, who was the ancient doctor, wrote down,

621
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 and he had evidence of, and people still believed in the 16th century,

622
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 that women, if they overheated, could spontaneously grow a penis and turn into a man.

623
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Calm down, Barbara.

624
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 You'll get a penis again.

625
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 And I really, Galen is really amazing, because he believed that...

626
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 They didn't know where sperm came from when he was around, and his big idea,

627
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 and everyone was like, "Oh, that makes total sense," is that sperm was in your brain,

628
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 and it traveled through your spinal cord, and then it came out.

629
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 So when you were having sex, you would be like, "Oh!"

630
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 And there you were.

631
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 You would let loose.

632
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 You'll face that. That was your face.

633
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Something we hope we never see again.

634
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 So the truth is, of course, the opposite to what Galen thought,

635
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 is that every penis was once a clitoris, right?

636
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 What?

637
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 And you still have the remnants of it, because when a fetus is first developing it in the wound,

638
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 it starts, your genitalia starts as a clitoris before the male hormones start getting involved

639
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 and growing your own penis, and there's still a...

640
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 I'm just going to read this out, so I don't have to actually say it myself.

641
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 There's a dark underskin, and a thin ridge or seam known as the raft,

642
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 which runs from scrotum to anus,

643
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 and that's the remnants of your clitoris.

644
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 That's a...

645
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Wow!

646
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Or your vagina.

647
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 That's a little bit less...

648
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Every day of the day.

649
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 That is...

650
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 Wow.

651
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 And actually, Davin Andi, you have a vagina.

652
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 Thank you. Thank you very much.

653
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Nice that you've finally noticed.

654
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 It's called the vagina maskulina,

655
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 and it is the remnant of the time as a fetus when it was neither male nor female,

656
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 and the body could have grown into either sex at that time,

657
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 and it can be found at the opening of your prostate,

658
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 and it's like a vestigial.

659
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 What?

660
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Well, next time I'm around there.

661
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 I'll check in.

662
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Andi, after the show.

663
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Did you like that face you made?

664
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 You can see it again.

665
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Oh, we're gonna have to run up guys.

666
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 I think we are.

667
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 But these ones see reasons.

668
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

669
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 Thank you so much for listening.

670
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
