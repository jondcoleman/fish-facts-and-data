 [Music]

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:52.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode and most such thing is a fish a weekly podcast. This week coming to you from the Soho Theatre in Central London. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting with James Harkin, Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski, and once again, we have our four favorite facts. We're sat around on microphones and in no particular order. Here we go, starting with you, James Harkin. Okay, my fact this week is that firefighters use wetter water than we do.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.400
 [Laughter]

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.800
 Is that in everyday life as well? Just cleaning their teeth and having a shower? No, just for putting up fires.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:15.000
 So what do you mean by wetter water? Well, it's just about how weird water is really. Apparently, if you put certain polymers into water, there is less friction in the pipe, so it shoots out of the pipe quicker.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 So, and it's called a wetting agent and it's to make water wetter. Did someone notice that it was going really slowly out of the pipe and sort of hanging around and how much faster does it go?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Well, there is, they use it in oil as well and in the Alaskan pipeline they put this stuff in and it reduces pumping cost by up to 50%.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Because it just pumps up more. It pumps up quite a lot. You don't want to mix up the oil in the water if you're a firefighter as well.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 It's terrible. I don't think you can mix oil and water, isn't that the whole point? That's a very good point.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 [Laughter]

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 That's amazing. So, when it's the first time they use this stuff, there were puddles about around and the firefighters were complaining that they were slipping on the puddles because it was so wet.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Quick step in one of those puddles of water for stability.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 So, do you know how long they've been using it?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 This was, I'm not sure exactly when it came out when they found it out but I think it was in the 60s or 70s and it was a guy called BA Toms and it's called the Toms Effect, this thing that makes it slipper.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 On slippery water, no one knows why ice is slippery today or no one knows why it says, well the reason ice is slippery is that there's a tiny film of water forms on top of water when it freezes and scientists don't know why water does that.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Why this tiny film of water forms and why it's slippery and that's just another weird thing about water.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 The other thing is that it's sticky and slippery ice. Like if you put your tongue and it sticks with it but also it's slippery and that's just a weird thing to happen.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Just on water being wetter, my dad uses scissors that are sharper than most scissors.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 I was trying to think when I found out this fact. I was just like, "Oh, what else is more than what it's meant to be?"

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 And my dad actually, my dad's a hairdresser and he has a pair of scissors that were forged by samurai in Japan.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 It's starting to understand what you believe all this crap about, yes it is. Your dad's been spinning you've served lies since you were a child.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 So sorry, they were splashing the bin.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 They weren't, no, honestly. They were flogged in the fire of some more dark.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 There are pair of scissors that were forged by samurai and they are the sharpest pair of scissors that you can buy in the world.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 And he's had them for 35 coming up to 40 so it's in between that bracket. One day they'll be given to you.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 No, but he's consistently, as a hairdresser, you're meant to get your scissors sharpened every few years.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 He goes every few years to get them sharpened and the people at the sharpening place go, "We can do nothing for you."

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 These are sharp as they have ever been, as they ever will be.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And they're just samurai scissors.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 So what kind of samurai blacksmith makes scissors slow? Is this someone who's been kicked out of the swords bit of blacksmith?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 But if you're a samurai, you're not going to imagine when they're clipping their nails and stuff. They probably have samurai nail clippers.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 If you're used to that kind of excellence, you're just going to create more products that are going to help you out.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Yeah, that sounds implausible.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 I promise you, everyone Google it, samurai scissors exist.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Suddenly you had to have your scissors sharpened every few years as a hairdresser. That surprises me.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Yeah. Oh, well, there's a fact.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 That's good.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 So on fire, the very earliest fire fighting organisations in the USA, they were all volunteer ones.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 And normally they couldn't do very much because they didn't have much suction through the fire hoses.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 So what they were doing instead, one of the most important things was called a bed key.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 And this was to break down a bed frame, a wooden bed frame, because that was often the most valuable thing in a house.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 And so they said, "Well, we can't really do much for the house, but we did at least get your bed frame out."

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 And that was the thing.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 In those days, it wouldn't have made any sense to ask, "What would you save in a fire?"

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Because everyone said, "My bed frame."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Is that because it was made out of iron?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 No, there wouldn't. So important to get out.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 If it's iron, you just leave it there. Come back with the fire.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Yeah, because what they used to do when they moved house in the old days in America is they would burn down the old house.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 And they would take the nails out of the burning gashes because nails were so expensive to make.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 But you're just talking about firefighters. The very first firefighting brigade was from ancient Roman times.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 And it was a guy called Crasseus, which James and I always talk about.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 We've never said it on this podcast. I love this guy.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 He basically realized that when fires were happening, you could make a lot of money by setting up a thing to put them out.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 And so he used to do this thing where he announced he had like a 500 person fleet for his first fire brigade.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 And a fire would start. And they'd all race to it. And as soon as they got there, they wouldn't put the fire out.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 They'd negotiate how much the guy was willing to pay for them to put the fire out.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And if they didn't reach an agreement, they'd just let it burn.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 And they'd all just watch it burn to the ground.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 And then Crasseus would buy the house back cheaper.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 He'd be like, "Are you doing anything with this plot?"

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 No, it's not cheaper.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Yeah.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 This house was depreciated and valued.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 It seems turning into a pile of ash.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 But yeah, that was the first ever fire brigade.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 The first ever fire hose was in ancient Greece, I think.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 And I think this is another example of inventions, which I love, which are inventions which then disappear.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 People forget about them and don't make them again for ages.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 So I think this vanished for 1,700 years.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 But fire hose invented in ancient Greece.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 And it was made out of an ox's intestine.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 And I think so it was you put water in a bag.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 And then you attach a bag to an ox's intestine.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 And then you remove the intestine from the ox first.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 I think it depends what you want to be spraying out.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 But yeah, conventionally, yes.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 You're trying to make yogurt, however.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 And yeah, the force at which water kicks was expelled from the ox guts was amazing.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Wow.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 That's so good.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 It's very cool.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 I read about a guy who invented a helmet that you would sew.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 One of the big problems, obviously, when you were going into a fire was that you would smother yourself with the smoke you'd pass out.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 So everyone was trying to work out.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 In 1823, a guy called Charles Dean invented a helmet that had a hose attached to it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 So you would go in and you'd have air pushed in through the hose so you could breathe.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 No one ended up using it, though, because it was made of metal.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 And all people were inside.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 He was suddenly going, "WOW!"

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 And dashing back out.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 And this kettle with a mask, yeah.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 But then he transferred the design to a diving helmet.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 And those were the very first diving helmets that we...

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Yeah, it's the same guys.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 And that's what it became.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Yeah, that's very cool.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 A hundred years before that, which was in 1723,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 the first automatic fire extinguisher was painted in England.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 And this was a guy called Ambrose Godfrey,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 and it consisted of a cask of fire extinguishing fluid and a load of gunpowder.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 And you would set fire to the gun plow there.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 It would explode.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 And then the water would go everywhere.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And then it would put it out.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 I did.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Did they use to have fire extinguishing grenades as well?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Yeah.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 They were called fox balls, weren't they?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Fooks.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Fooks.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Sorry.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 They were invented by a German guy called Fooks.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Yeah.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 They were little glass balls with water or a liquid inside

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 and you would throw them at the fire and they would come out.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Really?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 It's terrifying.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Oh, thank God, the fire department here.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Grenade!

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 [laughter]

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Like that.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Have you guys had a smoke jumpers?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 I have not.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 No.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 These are the coolest people in the world.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 They jump out of planes to put out fires.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 They've just...

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 They parachute down onto fires and put them out.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 Wow.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Well, how...

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Well...

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Because I guess from that height, it looks really small.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 But once you go higher...

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Put it down there.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 With your pocket.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 With your pocket.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 No, they genuinely do this.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 This happens in whether a forest fires, so in places in the USA,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 where you can get fires and it's much faster to get there, basically, with...

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And obviously, it's not for a mass response.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 You can't have hundreds of people doing it.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 But these people do exist.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 And I've read a frequently asked questions.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 I read a little interview with a guy who is a smoke jumper.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And they just sound like the hardest people in the world.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 So, isn't it dangerous landing in a fire?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 We land close to not in the fire.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And then he went on, at least that's the plan.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 It's not uncommon to land in smoldering areas.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 So cool.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 Yeah, they're the most hardcore men in the world.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Yeah, the things they take as well, they take backpacks,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 which have a little pumping power supplies on them.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 Sometimes they take chainsaws, which I think is to...

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 The cut trees which are at risk of being close to the fire.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 I haven't researched that bit enough.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 But sometimes they would have like a crocodile.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And we're going to have to move on to the next phase.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Yeah, if you've got something more.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Can I just tell people, because we're on water,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 you could go the rest of your life without drinking water again.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 This is just a big piece of propaganda from water merchants who...

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Big water.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Big water company is taking over your life.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 So that whole thing about you have to drink eight cups of water a day.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 No scientist know where that comes from.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 There's no scientific basis for it.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 You can replace water if you like.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 With coffee tea is not going to dehydrate.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Coffee does have water in it though.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 When I say water, I mean, you could dilute it with...

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 It doesn't need to be water.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 You mean you could have ribina instead.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 But coffee tea, don't dehydrate you, massively rehydrate you.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And drinking eight cups of water a day is too much.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 You shouldn't drink water unless you feel thirsty.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 And also, it doesn't help you if you're an athlete.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 It doesn't help you drinking more water.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 So they tested cyclists.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 They had some dehydrated cyclists compete against some non-dehydrated cyclists.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Didn't make a difference.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 Totally fine.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 I mean, it would make a difference eventually.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 Yeah.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Yeah, so they didn't dehydrate them to death.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 God, ethics committees these days are a nightmare.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 So Anna Chazinski says you do not need to drink water.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 And yet, I'm the dickhead for saying I don't have samurai scissors.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Sure.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Yes, my fact is that plants have their own internet.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And it's made of fungus.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 So not only this, they've got their internet,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 which proceeds ours by hundreds of years, by the way.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 And 80% of them assigned up to it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 But wait, to the ones which don't have it, are they in urban areas?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 They have a plant in developing countries and they rural places.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 They have cybercrime online.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 They have social media.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 They're going to have social media.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 They have online shopping.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 I'm just going to go on like this.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Like I've lost the plot.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 They've got my space.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 They've got eBay.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 They've got a lot.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 They do.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 They've got tree Bay.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Sorry, yes.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 I hate myself a lot.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 So they have this network of fungus attached.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 You know when you pick up a plant and you see there's the white strands coming off plants roots.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 That's a kind of fungus.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 And this system is called mycorrhizae.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 And it's a way of them communicating with each other.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 So this fungus will link a whole garden of plants together or a whole forest of trees together.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 And if one tree is lacking in nutrients or water, then it will send out a signal.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 And then another tree will be able to send it nutrients or water via the fungus.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 They have news updates.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 This is my version of news updates.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 So if they're under attack, let's say for instance, a plant is being attacked by an aphid,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 then they'll be able to emit signals via the mycorrhizae network.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 And other plants around will know that the aphids are coming and they will put up their defenses.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Yeah, but how much defense does a tree have?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Because I remember reading a few years ago that when giraffes eat acacia trees,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 they will give out some kind of signal to the other trees to say they're a giraffes coming.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 You're going to get eaten.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 But how do you stop yourself from eating?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Basically, it's just a lot of other messages going, well shit.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 Now I'm going to get eaten and spend the last hour of my life afraid.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Actually, that's a really interesting question.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Thanks for asking.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 And this is so many ways.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 So they can pump out chemicals to make themselves less tasty to attacking insects.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 One really clever thing that some bean plants do is so they are preyed upon by aphids.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 And when they get preyed upon by aphids, they send out a perfume which is delicious to wasps.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 And wasps come, so they use wasps as their bodyguards.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 And the wasps come, kill the aphids.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 So they just cool on their bodyguards, what wasp bodyguards?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 I think that's so cool.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Yeah, that actually is what the smell of cut grasses is.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 It's partly the grass screaming, apparently.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 What?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 The smell of the lovely smell of cut grass is partly the plant screaming.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 It's partly summoning creatures to stop the predator because it thinks it's being eaten by other insects.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 So it cools over it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 You know, you can actually, this is so weird.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Because it does sound like plants have a slight intelligent.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 It seems so dubious.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 I was reading this paper and it was saying that you could, you know, anesthetic works on plants.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 They go down like, what does that mean?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 And this other one was that basically if you play a recording of a caterpillar munching on a leaf,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 next to a certain plant, the plant will respond to it and let off a defense mechanism as well.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 So it's not even like a real thing going, it's just listening to a record of like this happening.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 It's happening.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 But how? It doesn't have ears.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 What is it?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 I think it might be acoustic vibrations, air vibrations.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 But the same thing if there's a water pipe, which is enclosed in a pipe which couldn't possibly be emitting any water into the soil,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 roots will grow towards it because it's assumed they can hear the sound of water.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Is that normal water, sorry, or is it?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Is it James's super water?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 There was a study in 2009 by the Royal Horticultural Society about how quickly plants grow if you talk to them.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Because obviously, you know, the whole thing, Prince Charles did that then he taught to his plants and stuff.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 They found that tomato plants grew up to two inches taller if they were serenaded by a female rather than a male.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And the most effective talker came from a lady called Sarah Darwin, who was a great, great, grand daughter of Charles Darwin.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 No.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 What? Only me, you could eat.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 The most effective plantalker in the world is a relative of Charles Darwin.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 And the things that she does, I tell you what, it gets better.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 She read out an excerpt from Darwin's On the Origin of the Species.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 That's so hot.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Literally the hottest sentence I've ever heard of.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Darwin has just got two inches bigger than me.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 That is amazing.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 I looked up, it's a while on the Fungal Network that connects all plants.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 I looked up some British fungi names.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 British fungi include the Jelly Ear, the bearded tooth, the weeping tooth crust, the slimy earth tongue,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 the fetted parachute, the brainfold truffle, and my favourite, the Harry Nuts Disco.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Well that's the thing, I was looking for this as well, not fungus, but just plants.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 They all used to have really rude names.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 Dandelions, trying to be known as dandelions, were originally called Pissabed.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 Oh yeah.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 And they were called Pissabed because...

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 In French they're called Pisson Leigh, which is the same.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 And it's because they would make you wait, right?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 Yeah, yeah, that was the idea.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 So everyone was like, well let's just call it Pissabed, because that's not...

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Well that wasn't these other names.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Mayor's fort, naked ladies, open arse,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 hounds piss, and bum towel.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 So insects can talk to each other using a plant as a kind of telephone.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 Wow, yeah.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 This is before they got the internet.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 They do that.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 So if you've got an insect that's feeding on the roots, he doesn't want another insect feeding on the leaves

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 because they could kill their plant too quickly.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 And so they'll send up a kind of signal to the leaves, saying we don't want anyone eating these leaves.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 And it's like a no vacancies kind of sign.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Yeah, that's really cool.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 And there was a guy called Clive Baxter, he was a lie detector expert working for the FBI.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 And he claimed that if you wind up a plant to a polygraph machine,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 you'll be able to detect what they're thinking.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Okay, so this was his experiment.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Where were you on the night of the...

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 What have you done with the soil?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 So he had a room with two plants in it.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Six students took it in turns to enter the room,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 and then one of them stamped on and killed a plant in front of another plant.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Okay, but then they had a lineup.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Pretty much.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 When the five innocent students later walked into the room,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 there was little to no response from the plant.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 However, when the murderer came in, the plant went wild.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 The study has never been able to be replicated.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 We're going to have to move on to our next facts.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Anyone else got anything?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 I lost it all on the hairy nut's disco, I'm afraid.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 My fact is that in 1710, the boys of Winchester College rioted over insufficient beer rations.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 I think it was the sixth form to be fair, but still.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 This is from a book called The Old Boys,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 The Decline and Rise of the Public School by a guy called David Turner.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 And it's just incredible.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 There were loads of public school riots during the 17th and 18th and 19th centuries.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 So in 1690, the boys at Manchester Grammar disagreed with their teachers about the Christmas holiday timings

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 and responded by locking themselves in with guns and firing warning shots

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 that anyone who came near the school for a fortnight.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 What was their objection? Don't lock yourself in the school if you want.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 That's very true.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 But these things happened in 70 years.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Just at Eaton, there were six full-scale riots.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 And so how much beer did they get? Do we know?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 I don't know.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Because actually, in the olden days, people used to drink a lot of beer, didn't they?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 Because it was safer than drinking water and it would be quite weak beer,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 but you would still have it nonetheless.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 But like kids as well.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Kids would just be downing pines going, "Oh, you don't actually need to drink water, that's the thing."

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 There's lots of drinks, lots of lots of beer.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 That's the wise lesson.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 In fact, the first children's picture book that is known to man has instructions for brewing your own beer.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Really?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 As instructions for home brewing beer and making your own wine.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Yeah, amongst other things, but it's an important life lesson, I think.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 In the work houses, men would have two pints of beer a day,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 according to the official diet that they were allowed.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 And children had one pint and women had a pint of beer and a pint of tea.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 That was the official rules that they were supposed to have, they didn't all get it.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 So is it healthy for kids to drink beer?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Yes!

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 And yet, the beer accrat's in Brussels.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 I've decided it isn't.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 No, we're saying it's not, but like in the olden days people,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 it was better to drink beer, which had been brewed than drink water, which hadn't been boiled,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 because it was really bad for you.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 Women in labour in the 16th century were given groaning beer,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 which was consumed during labour.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 And it was supposed to help you rather than anesthetics, I guess.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 Yeah, there was actually a whole range of groaning foods.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 That's true.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Yeah, you had groaning pie.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 It sounds like a straight out of Harry Potter.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 A groaning pie.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 In the Navy, of course, they would have lots of alcohol.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 The daily ration up until 1740 was half a pint of meat rum twice a day.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 That's good, right?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Yeah, the Navy would piss the whole time, weren't they?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 How do we win any battles?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 Honestly, they would go drunk into war. That was their big thing.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 Actually, I did find, speaking of this, some lyrics from the original lyrics of

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 "What should we do with the drunk and sailor?"

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 Oh, wow.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 Do you want to hear those?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Yeah.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 Here are a few.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 "Put him in the hole with an angry weasel."

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 "Stick him in a bag and beat him senseless."

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 It was another one.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 And the other one is, "Put him in the hole with a captain's daughter."

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Wow.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Yeah.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 But actually a captain...

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Isn't that punishing the daughter?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Well, the captain's daughter was a nickname for the cat and our nine tales.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Hey, just very quickly, an update from a very old fact that we did on the show, just going

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 from you saying "Put them in a bag and beat them."

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 There was that fact that you said about how you used to get thrown into...

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 Okay, so there was an old punishment in the olden days.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 It was capsule punishment, I guess.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 What you would be put into a bag with a cockerel, a cat and a snake, right?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 In Britain you couldn't get snakes very easily and so they would just make do with a picture

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 of a snake.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 There were a couple of other little riot...

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 No, there were massive riots.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 So, for the 1793 winches to college riot, which I think we all remember.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 But basically the headmaster, they were called wardens in those days, had ordered the whole

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 school to be punished because of one boy's misdemeanor.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 And the boy's wrote to him saying, "That's unfair, you've broken the rules."

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 And he wrote back, not answering them satisfactorily.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 So, they perceived the school again armed with guns, swords and clubs.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 So, it's just a common response.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 The nice thing about it is the whole correspondence between them was in Latin.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Very cool.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 I was looking up stuff about how alcohol might be good for children.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 Yep, we are a small but growing political body.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 We're starting in five constituencies this election.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 A few people think that it's actually good for you.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 So, for example, do you guys know about beer and Belgian?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 The schools in Belgium, there was a big push to introduce beer back into schools, yeah.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 And they actually tested it out on a school.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 And they all failed their exams.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 No, they didn't.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 So, the alcohol had only between 1.5 and 2.5% of alcohol in it.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 This was set up in one particular school where they wanted to test out, do a test run to see if it actually worked.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 And they found that 75% of the students that they surveyed said, "Are we really like it?"

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And unfortunately, no other school was willing to do the test.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 There shouldn't be the way you judge whether it's a good thing asking the drunk peoples.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Did you like that?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Obviously, they really like it.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 Yeah, but the heroin trial at the same school is going great.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Did you have some stuff about riots, Davis?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Did you want to hear some?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Yeah.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Okay, let me think.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Okay, well, you only need three people to cause riots in the UK.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 And we've got four.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 You only need two people in Nevada to cause a riot.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Wow, which is pretty good.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Is there any way we can have a one person riot?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 I've never found it anywhere in the world and I have lucked.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 And just one other thing about beer, in 1883, there was a competition organised by the Church of England Temperance Society

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 and they wanted to see how good beer was compared to water.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 And the game was simple. Two men would cut down as much corn as possible in the field.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 One was only allowed to drink water and the other was only allowed to drink beer.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 And the winner was beer.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 And Mr. Terrell, playing for beer, cleared just over 20 acres in 12 hours versus Mr. Robbie's 19 acres.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 So he got an extra raker.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 And they were going to give the winner a gold medal, but he collapsed before they could do something.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 And so they dragged him into a ward and anointed him with whiskey.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 We're going to have to move on by the way.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 So this is very, very closely related.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 I think that your rioters at public school who were rioting about beer then went on, obviously, to continue to do the same thing.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 Because a famous riot that happened in Oxford in 1355 was the St. Scholastica Day riot.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 And this was when this happened in the Swindle-Stocked Heaven.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 And it was when water springe hose and Roger De Chesterfield, two university students, surprisingly enough,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 with the tavernor John Croydon about the quality of the beer there, or about the quality of the drinks in his pub,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 they ended up assaulting him.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 And in the end, 200 students started rioting.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 It lasted two days, 63 scholars and 30 locals were left dead.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 But it ended up being blamed on.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 Sorry, it's the 14th century.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 It's too soon, Anna. It's too soon.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 It's intake of breath over there.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 They're all in it now.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 The Chesterfields in tonight, actually.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Sorry to the Springe hose family.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 So the dispute was settled and it turned out that the mayor had been arguing on the side of the townspeople,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 the non-students who've been saying this is unfair.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 We've been attacked for the quality of the beer we're serving by these post-students.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 And the mayor was found in the wrong, and his counsellors were found in the wrong.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 And they had to march bare headed through the streets and pay the university a fine of one penny for every scholar killed for 470 years.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 And they did that until 1825 when the mayor decided this was getting ridiculous.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 The currency was changing so many times anyway with very hard to know what to pay.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 And it stopped, but yeah, the...

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 Well...

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Can I just say I think we've done very well so far of hardly being rude at all in this podcast,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 because there's been penis, penis, penis until now of this last five episodes.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 Yes, there's been no filth whatsoever this podcast so far in all of these first three facts.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Can we move on now?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 Yeah, sure.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 And that is my fact.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 My fact this week is that the first man to discover the clitoris...

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 ...was Colombo.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 So Colombo, not the detective.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Well, I know what a shame. I just love that. So this is a guy who's suddenly...

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 It was 1559, I believe. He suddenly said, "Guess what guys? I found the clitoris."

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 And everyone was like, "No, we knew where it was anyway."

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 But he was the first person to properly say, "This is where the clitoris is."

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 And he was an amazing physician.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 He was working with Michelangelo on a book that was about the anatomy, which Michelangelo was going to illustrate.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 You know what happened? We don't know how it never came out, but that would have been the most seminal book of medical history.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 Michelangelo said, "Well, I like drawing the occasional penis, but this is ridiculous."

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 Seminal seemed like an unfortunate choice of what I did, didn't it?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 I looked on the etymon line to find out the etymology of clitoris and they're not really sure.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 It either comes from the Greek for "to shut" or "a key" or "the side of a hill" or "the tickler."

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 I guess it depends on the woman, presumably.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 And then they go and say the anatomist Matio Colombo, who you were talking about,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Professor Padua claimed to have discovered it. He called it Amor Veneris, Veldudseido, or whatever,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 which is the love or sweetness of Venus. But then it says, "It had been known earlier to women."

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 So, yeah, I think that's the problem, really. For him to say he discovered it.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 He was the first person to proclaim to have discovered it.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Well, yeah, so you say there was another arrival doctor, also male, Gabriel Fallopius,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 who, when this guy came out with this announcement, said, "I've discovered the clitoris.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 I've written about it in my book." And they had a proper, so he tried to sue him for plagiarism, I think,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 stating his idea of clitoris.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 You're right, I think the clitoris. Yeah.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 There was another, there was another doctor as well. He was called Vesalius.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 And I think he taught Fallopio. So I think the grudge match was originally between Vesalius and Colombo.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And Vesalius said that it was, he described it as a new and useless part.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 So, presumably, he was just throwing shade at the clitoris because he was angry not to have discovered it.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 I think, we'll see his teacher, he might have been his student. But anyway, I do know that once this started coming about,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 one of them was dead and so one of them tried to sue the other and it was completely useless because the dead person was...

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Was Fallopio the guy who invented, not invented?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Discovered Fallopian Jews.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Fallopia actually built the first woman.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Yeah, 16th century. Yeah, he was.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 So, a really cool thing about Fallopia, Gabriel Fallopias. He did find and describe the Fallopian Chubes.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 And he named them the Fallopian Chubes.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Fallopian, after his own name, Fallopias and Chubes, after the fact that they look like Chubas, the instrument.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Nothing to do with the fact that they're Chubes.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Yeah, that's a mistranslation. So the Fallopian Chubes, it was supposed to be the Fallopian Chubas.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 And it's because the shape of them is like a brass tuba.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 If everyone, if everyone listening to this, starts only calling them Fallopian tubas, we can change the world.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 How often in conversation, Andy, I've been here.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 I'll say once a day for the rest of the year, I'll say Fallopian tubas if you do.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 So, Fallopias invented the first condom as well, didn't he?

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 It was covered in salt and had to be like a cocktail or something.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 I suppose literally like a cocktail in a way.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Don't forget to put a bit of salt around the rim.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 Sorry.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 Sorry.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 It's the line from an episode at the bottom, I watched the other day.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Oh dear.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 So his condom was covered in salt and it had to be tucked under the foreskin, so it was uncomfortable.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 So much as it was unusable.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 And it was to kind of stop syphilis rather than through contraception.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 But also it was held on by a pink ribbon so that it would appeal to women.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 Let's be honest guys, we know she's not going to like the main event.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 But we can't at least doll it up a bit.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 So he was doing this because it was a massive rise in STI's STD.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Syphilis was a big one.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 This is the sentence that confused me.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 I didn't actually read anymore, I should have.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 But he tested these condoms in 1,100 men.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Now, did he test them?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 And there were no pregnancies, not one now.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 To find me to say it doesn't work.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Just speaking of Philopio, who's there's a body part, so obviously named after him.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 I was looking at other body parts that are named after people.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 And the pedendal canal is also called the alcock canal or the alcock canal

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 because it was discovered by Benjamin alcock.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 And it's where blood is carried to the genitalia.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 So Benjamin alcock discovered the little tube that carries blood to your willy.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 That's so good.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Because I'm always getting that in conversation.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 That's good to know now.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Again, we were talking about names earlier for plants.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 And this is the same thing.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 So Philopian tube.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 I was looking through just a list of people who discovered a bit of the body

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 and had it named out of them.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 There's so many bits of the body that I didn't know about.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 And it sounds like the most awesome fantasy novel.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 If someone was on a trip, like they would, like imagine,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 okay, they're passing the pouch of Douglas.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 They make the way through to the crypt of Libakun.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 That's a place on our body, the crypt of Libakum, the sphincter of Odi.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 The zonul of Zinn.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Well, the zonul of Zinn sounds like where your dad had his scissors made.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 I knew you were going to have a look at some things named after people.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 So in 2004, there was a group of scientists who discovered a new species of cockroach

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 that they described as dirty, ugly, smelly, and the need of a name.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 And this cockroach extrudes urine out of its back and deposits it on his genital region

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 for the female to eat.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 And they made it so that you could bid to name it after your enemy.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 Isn't that cool?

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 It's such a good idea.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 And so whoever bid the most, I don't know who won it, unfortunately,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 because they haven't said anything.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Sure, you don't.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 Even though it's released and it's down-tribe, the next week, it's going to become perfectly clear.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Well, that's such a good idea, isn't it?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Naming something horrible and disgusting after all.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Yeah.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Because Linnaeus, he named an ugly, insignificant weed after one of his critics.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 It's called Seeks Bechia.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Wow.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 That's great.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Is it true?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 So Linnaeus, can you just quickly explain who he is?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 He is the father of taxonomy.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 So he came up with the idea of naming things in this Latin system that we use.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Yeah, and he was obsessed with...

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 I mean, he was really egotistical.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 He thought he was the God's gift to the planet, really.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Yeah, he said God makes Linnaeus' names.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 That's his.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Right.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 So is this true that he had a garden that he could tell the time of the day by

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 because he knew plants so well that when they opened, he'd be like, oh, it's three.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Yeah, I think it's time of the year as well, maybe.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 Oh, wow.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 Yeah.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 Well, I mean, I could tell the time of the year.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 The thing I really like about this back, though, is that it is that man thing of going,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 I've discovered the clitoris of everyone's going, no, we knew about it.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 It's like we women knew about this.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 And just the way that medical journals used to talk about the anatomy of a woman back in the day

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 was just so absurd.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 And so I found one in the British Medical Journal from 1878, they ran a correspondence

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 between people where they were discussing on whether menstruating women's touches,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 like, so a menstruating woman, if she touched a bit of ham, whether it would ruin the ham.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 And that was like a serious thing, they're like, maybe they shouldn't be touching ham.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Was that a massive problem before that?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 We're menstruating women constantly touching ham.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 You get this urge.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 It's impossible to explain.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 Obviously, I'm in every butcher in London as soon as...

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 I mean, they were thinking some extraordinary things at the time, the time that the clitoris was discovered.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 So it was still thought at the time that there was one sex and that a woman was just a

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 less developed version of a man, and that in the womb, the fetus hadn't received enough heat,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 so hadn't been able to spur its clitoris into a penis in time.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 And so a clitoris was just a less developed version of a penis, people thought.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 And there was a belief that Galen, who was the ancient doctor, wrote down,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 and he had evidence of, and people still believed in the 16th century,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 that women, if they overheated, could spontaneously grow a penis and turn into a man.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 Calm down, Barbara.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 You'll get a penis again.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 And I really, Galen is really amazing, because he believed that...

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 They didn't know where sperm came from when he was around, and his big idea,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 and everyone was like, "Oh, that makes total sense," is that sperm was in your brain,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 and it traveled through your spinal cord, and then it came out.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 So when you were having sex, you would be like, "Oh!"

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 And there you were.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 You would let loose.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 You'll face that. That was your face.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 Something we hope we never see again.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 So the truth is, of course, the opposite to what Galen thought,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 is that every penis was once a clitoris, right?

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 What?

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 And you still have the remnants of it, because when a fetus is first developing it in the wound,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 it starts, your genitalia starts as a clitoris before the male hormones start getting involved

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 and growing your own penis, and there's still a...

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 I'm just going to read this out, so I don't have to actually say it myself.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 There's a dark underskin, and a thin ridge or seam known as the raft,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 which runs from scrotum to anus,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 and that's the remnants of your clitoris.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 That's a...

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 Wow!

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 Or your vagina.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 That's a little bit less...

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 Every day of the day.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 That is...

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 Wow.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 And actually, Davin Andi, you have a vagina.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 Nice that you've finally noticed.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 It's called the vagina maskulina,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 and it is the remnant of the time as a fetus when it was neither male nor female,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 and the body could have grown into either sex at that time,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 and it can be found at the opening of your prostate,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 and it's like a vestigial.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 What?

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Well, next time I'm around there.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 I'll check in.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Andi, after the show.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 Did you like that face you made?

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 You can see it again.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Oh, we're gonna have to run up guys.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 I think we are.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 But these ones see reasons.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
