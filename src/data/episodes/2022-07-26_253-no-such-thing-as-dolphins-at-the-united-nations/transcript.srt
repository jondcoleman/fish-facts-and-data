00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 How do you know what I don't want like I said, I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Starting with you, James.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the Emperor of the Incas only ever wore an outfit once after which it was immediately burned.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I'd be there. Why are you wearing the same jumper as you love the last three weeks? No, I've worn 21 different jumper so the last three weeks.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 So this was the he was called Sapper Inca and he wore special clothes that no one else was allowed to wear.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Is there a theory as to why he couldn't wear them twice, would we not know?

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 We don't really know. I think it's just because he's so important and it's the ostentatious show of wealth, isn't it?

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And his clothes were seen as divine because he was seen as divine.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 It is a bit like the Duchess of Cambridge.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Well, if you reuse is an outfit, the newspaper say, "Oh, she's recycling her clothes as opposed to only wearing everything once."

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Do you think they burn it after she uses them?

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Maybe. Maybe the ones you really like, she squirrels away so she can wear them again.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I don't know. How did they record their information in the Incas?

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Yeah, so that is interesting. Unlike a lot of the Mesoamericans who we don't really have any information apart from ceramics or cloths or textiles,

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 we have a bit about the Incas because they did talk to the Spanish.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 They were the last Mesoamericans that were there before the Spanish wiped them out.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I didn't quite wipe them out, but basically a lot of them died.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 So we know what they did by what the Spanish said.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Although it should be said that the Spanish did lie a lot.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Exactly. So maybe this is not true.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 So when the Spanish came actually, it was an extraordinary thing that happened, first of all.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So it was 1532 and it was the conquistador Francisco Pizarro and he turned up and it was a surprise attack that he launched on the Inca.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 It sounds a bit like a surprise party when you apply that.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 It's a surprise. Have some smallpox. Have loads of murder.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 But according to the Spanish records, they killed 7,000 Inca without themselves having one single fatality.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Which you can't believe would actually be true, but that is what was recorded.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 But the amazing thing about this is that we can study exactly what happened and the influence of the Spanish by looking at this one glacier.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 We've talked about this kind of thing before, but there's this glacier, which is 150 miles away from where Pizarro landed.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 It's called the Kel Kaya ice cap. And it's the largest ice cap in the tropics.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And what it does is, because South America has wet and dry seasons, then a layer of dust forms every year in the dry season.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And so we know exactly which year it is by looking down in the ice cap.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Like tree rings. Exactly. Like tree rings.

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And so they've studied this ice cap to see what the influence of the Spanish was.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 So the Spanish came and they started doing metallurgy. And so it's got lots more kind of metallurgy deposits for its different types of metal deposits in it.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 When the revolutions started, the independence revolution suddenly a lot of mines were decommissioned.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And so the pollution levels in it go down, which show you that.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And you can just drill straight through this ice cap. And you've got this year by year calendar.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Another thing we can look at is Lamapoo. And that will tell us what happened with the Inca's.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Because basically their culture moved around Mays, which was the main crop, a few other things like potatoes and stuff.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 But Mays is one of the main ones. Mays pollen comes in so you can look at that.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But at the same time, you can find a lot of mites in the ground, dead mites, which feed on Lama excrement.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And you can work out by the number of these mites. And the amount of Mays pollen, exactly how big and small the Inca Empire was.

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 That was kind of the super fuel the Lama done because you need to farm more intensively.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And there was a big switch to Mays about 2,700 years ago.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And the way they found it so cool, because they studied, I didn't know this was a thing.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 They studied what's called mud cores in a lake. So it's like an ice core, but it's made of mud.

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Yeah, and it was also, it's really easy for the Inca's because Lama's defecate communally.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 You know, they have one toilet, not that all Lama's go to, but that, you know, all the Lama's, they live it's a big country parade.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And so yeah, and that was what made it possible to grow huge Mays fields, because it's much richer.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 They wouldn't have done it without that fertilizer.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Oh wow. They were very into Lama's, weren't they?

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 They relied on them massively.

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Into Lama's into Mays.

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Yeah.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 That's potatoes.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Not into the wheel, needed the Lama's, because they didn't have wheels.

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Oh. So because they didn't have carts that could be pulled like massive long distances, they instead had this incredible system of chaskeys.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And probably not how you pronounce it, but who knows how ink has pronounced things.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And chaskeys, chaskeys were relay runners.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So they were totally crucial to the whole Inca Empire.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 They were exempt from things like farming and taxation, because they were so important.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And their whole job was to deliver messages and parcels and equipment through the Empire.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And so they would run a short space, like they'd run 10 kilometers, and they'd pass a message on to the next person.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 They had to memorize the entire message perfectly, so it was like Chinese whispers.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 They didn't do something.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 They weren't holding a message.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 No.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Because I was wondering if that's why our Empire wasn't so big, because we can never get a relay team that can get out of it.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 You just keep dropping it.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 So the Inca, obviously, they were taken out, and there are no longer any sappers.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 But there is a descendant of a sapper, Inca, or the Inca Emperor, who is still in power to this day.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Wow.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 It's a long descendant.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 It's the last Inca Emperor called Hayaoana Cupek.

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 His descendant is the current president of Chile.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Yeah.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 It's a direct descendant.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 His name is Miguel Pinera, and he's actually serving for the second time as president, which is a new rule they've never allowed that before.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And he's a billionaire.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 So he's still the super rich.

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 He could afford to burn his clothes after every time he ordered.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Wow.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 He's worth Â£2billion.

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 The last Inca sapper was called anyone?

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Ooh.

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Don't know.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 It's also the name of a rapper.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Ah, Tupac.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Tupac.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Correct.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 You're thinking.

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 He was called Tupac Amaru, and he was killed by the Spanish, but then there was an insurgency in the 18th century, and another person who wasn't related at all called themselves Tupac.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 He called themselves Tupac after this guy, and then Tupac Shakur, his mother, I think, named him after this insurgency.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Wow.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 That's cool.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Very interesting.

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Very cool.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And the kings, they would go to the coronations of their descendants, so their mummies would be at the coronation.

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Oh, really?

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Because they were really important still.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 They were reminding the new king that he descended from a long line of kings.

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And also, they would stay powerful after they died, because the royal family would visit the mummified kings and ask their advice about stuff.

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And then an oracle sitting next to them would...

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 What did you say?

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 A bit like Matthew, Carbett, and City.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Exactly.

109
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 What a show that would have been.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 There's quite a few of the Inca's, because they've got documents of the lines of the names that are associated with those sapper, and quite a few of them are mythical.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And then suddenly, they just become real.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 People always do that.

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Yeah.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Which Japanese emperors as well.

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Yeah.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 This is the problem with not writing stuff down, because that's an oracle history, isn't it?

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Or they did have this system of Qipu, which is these rods that had lots of threads with knots tied into them hanging from them, which was some really complex language that we don't understand.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 So, all we know is through oral history, which is always going to be entangled, I suppose, with myth.

119
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Yeah.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Do we still not know what those knots mean?

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 We're getting close.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Wow.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Yeah, that's so cool.

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 We're getting close.

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Maybe in our lives.

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Maybe in the next five or ten years, they'll work it out, we think, possibly.

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Yeah.

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 That's so cool.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 What are they missing?

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Are they missing like a knot rosetta stone?

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Yes, they are.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 But they found one, which is some record keeping, where it's in Spanish, and also in Qipu, and they think that they might have the names of some emperors now, and they're getting pretty close.

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Very cool.

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Do you know where Matthew Petru is twinned with?

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Well, I've been to Matthew Petru, it's at the top of a massive hill that's really hard to get to.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 So, is it a high gate?

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Okay, nice.

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 It is not though.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 It is the Yorkshire village of Hayworth.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Is it?

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Oh.

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Yep, that's a big deal.

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 They had a ceremony in 2005, and they've been with the great inconsistent city of Matthew Petru.

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 What is that?

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Do we know anything else about Hayworth?

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Yeah.

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 The Bronte's were from there.

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Did they get it?

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Okay.

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Were they explorers?

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 They have nothing to do with Matthew Petru.

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I was reading the ceremony.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I think they just wanted to inspire an interest in sort of Peruvian history in some school children.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 But I have no doubt Matthew Petru has no idea it's been with Hayworth.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 It doesn't have a sign as you enter Matthew Petru, James.

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 It says, "Twindwood Hayworth."

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Now you've seen Matthew Petru.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Is it?

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Sorry.

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 The Brontes were from Howarth, but is it not that?

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Oh, is that how you pronounce it?

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Oh, I don't know, actually.

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Oh, is it H-A-W?

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Yeah.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Yeah, it's probably Howarth.

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 I don't know.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Some of New Yorkshire right in.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Right in England.

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Everyone from New Yorkshire.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I don't think they've learned to write.

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Oh, no.

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 That's the English.

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Sorry.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Maybe that's what connects them.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 They are going to write it.

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I don't know how we're doing with Frankenstein.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 I've got a fact about ritual burning.

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Great.

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,800
 In 2017, Pakistan's Minister of Tourism, Fida Khan, was so annoyed about his flight being delayed

180
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,800
 that he took his clothes out of his luggage and started setting them on fire.

181
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
 It's only going to delay the flight more, isn't it?

182
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
 Yeah.

183
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
 If you start a fire in the air pool.

184
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
 Unless they say, "Oh, my God, there's a fire.

185
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
 Everyone get out of here.

186
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
 You get on that plane."

187
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
 Yeah.

188
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
 It's the quickest way out.

189
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
 Don't you find it weird that when you see people wearing these amazing

190
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,800
 expensive clothes on the red carpet and they don't own any of them?

191
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,800
 It's actually kind of like all these celebrities are...

192
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,800
 You know when you are struggling financially, of early 20s, you sort of hire stuff and then you have to send it back

193
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
 otherwise it accrues interest.

194
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
 They're basically those people.

195
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
 They're poor early 20s students who are hiring out a dress.

196
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,800
 They're going to top shop and then getting it and then wearing it once and then taking it back.

197
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
 No, no, I never wore it.

198
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
 I never wore it.

199
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 Do you think the day after the Oscars, there's just a queue with Jennifer Lawrence.

200
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
 You've got a Bradley Cooper at your top shop.

201
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
 Yeah, go on, man.

202
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
 They already strict.

203
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
 It has to be within one to two days always.

204
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,800
 I was reading about just while we're in America and the sort of rich elite there.

205
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,800
 Russell Westbrook, who is a basketball player, who you guys won't know.

206
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,800
 But in America, he's one of the biggest names in basketball.

207
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
 And he's very famous for his flashy outfits.

208
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,800
 And he is someone who has said, he said this on Ellen DeGeneres' show.

209
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
 He never wears the same clothes twice.

210
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
 But he says he doesn't waste them.

211
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
 He donates them.

212
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 He doesn't burn them.

213
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
 He donates them to goodwill charities.

214
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,800
 And as a result, he says when he walks through or he's in a car going through Oklahoma City,

215
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,800
 he just sees everyone wearing his clothes.

216
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,800
 He just sees everyone the same size in Oklahoma City.

217
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
 As a basketball player.

218
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,800
 He just got loads of people with clothes like they've been given by their older brothers.

219
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,800
 No one can pick anything up because the sleeves are too long.

220
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,800
 OK, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

221
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 I've changed the number of my fact by the way, so don't freak out when I say it.

222
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:22,800
 My fact this week is that about 70% of my fact this week is that about 70% of parents admit to having a favourite child.

223
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 Yeah, and they do have favourite children.

224
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
 I've got a favourite one.

225
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
 You've only got one.

226
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 Yeah, it's not mine.

227
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 Which is your favourite?

228
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
 I met this awesome kid at the playground.

229
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,800
 When Wellf and I were there, he's called Jess, wicked chef.

230
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,800
 Right, so about 70% of parents were bad as Dan is at parenting and prefer certain kids.

231
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,800
 And this is, I was going through a bunch of kind of studies that have been done over the years.

232
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,800
 Often are into parenting and that seems to be roughly the average.

233
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,800
 So there was a study in 2016 that asked parents and 74% of mothers and 70% of fathers admitted to having a favourite.

234
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
 I was in California.

235
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,800
 There was another one 10 years earlier where it was 70% of fathers but 65% of mothers.

236
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,800
 So it seems like mothers have really gone off their kids in the last decade.

237
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
 And yeah, this keeps on coming up again and again.

238
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,800
 If it's an in-depth study, they will sort of reluctantly admit that they do have a favourite child.

239
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,800
 And also, studies that look at the behaviour of parents towards their children

240
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,800
 invariably find that they prefer certain childrens in the way they act.

241
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,800
 So I just, I'm texted my mum this morning because I have three brothers and sisters

242
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
 and asked if she had a favourite.

243
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
 I am.

244
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,800
 And she didn't say, she didn't say the way which suggests to me that she does it, I'm not it.

245
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 I'm not a one and four chance though, that's something.

246
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,800
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm not even her favourite on this podcast.

247
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,800
 Wait, hang on, are you the youngest?

248
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
 And the eldest.

249
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
 Well, that damages your chances.

250
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
 Ah.

251
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,800
 Because there have been studies done finding that half of parents who confessed they had a favourite

252
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 said that it was their last born.

253
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
 Right.

254
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,800
 And there's another theory about why it's the last born, which is that

255
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,800
 more than half of parents and grandparents said that the last born child made them laugh more.

256
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,800
 So there was an Australian news website which said,

257
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,800
 "So if you aren't the favourite, you might just not be very funny."

258
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
 And that was written by my mum.

259
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,800
 But the good news is, kids are really bad at knowing which one the favourite is.

260
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
 So it shouldn't make you feel too bad.

261
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
 Yeah.

262
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
 Yeah.

263
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,800
 Again, in these studies when they look at who the children think is the favourite and who the

264
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
 parents favourite actually is, it's really often different.

265
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,800
 So there was a survey which was, it was only 30 older mothers and they were asked about their adult

266
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,800
 children and 80% of those mothers admitted to having a favourite and 80% of the children said

267
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 their parents definitely had a favourite, but almost all of them got the favourite wrong.

268
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
 Wow.

269
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
 So maybe parents are overcompensating?

270
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,800
 No, in fact it doesn't really matter if you're the favourite or not.

271
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
 Because if you are the favourite, you will be treated better but you won't know it.

272
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,800
 And if you're not the favourite, they'll make up for it by pretending to treat you better.

273
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
 So it doesn't matter if they don't really like you.

274
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
 Exactly, they're not going to show it.

275
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
 How blatant would a parent make it though?

276
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
 What the...?

277
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 I think you wouldn't give one child loads of presents or Christmas and the other no presents.

278
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
 It's not like Cinderella or Harry Potter or something.

279
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
 Does your child cry much, Dan?

280
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
 No, not too much.

281
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 Oh really?

282
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:23,800
 Because a lot of children do have red and according to evolutionary biologist David Hague,

283
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,800
 this might be to stop their parents from procreating and having another baby.

284
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
 Which would kind of make sense if you think about it evolutionary, doesn't it?

285
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
 Yeah, I read about this.

286
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
 This was, they do it at night particularly, right?

287
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:42,800
 Yeah, the idea of late nurse feeding from the mum so that if you were about to go, "Okay, let's get down."

288
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
 Your baby would stop you.

289
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,800
 Yeah, and the idea is that the baby then gets more resources because he doesn't have to share it with brothers and sisters.

290
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,800
 Which means in theory, they should do better in life, which means they should reproduce more and then.

291
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,800
 But it doesn't also breastfeeding act as a contraceptive.

292
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,800
 So if you're exclusively breastfeeding as a woman, you tend not to have periods.

293
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
 Is that right?

294
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 Meaning that you can't become pregnant.

295
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
 Right.

296
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,800
 So the more the child cries and wants breastfeeding, the less chance there is that another child will be born.

297
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,800
 So it's working double efforts, stopping the actual sex.

298
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,800
 And then even if the actual sex is happening, it's still acting as a human contraceptive problem.

299
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
 It's obviously not working, is it?

300
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
 So these genius babies are failing.

301
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
 During the best they can.

302
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,800
 Maybe in another million years they'll evolve to make chastity belts or something.

303
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,800
 One of you was saying that parents don't tend to just favour one kid with loads of presents.

304
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,800
 But there was one parent who literally did exactly that.

305
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
 So do you guys know about Evelyn Waw's dad?

306
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
 No, no.

307
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,800
 So Evelyn Waw had an older brother called Alec.

308
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 And his dad absolutely loved Alec and absolutely hated Evelyn Waw.

309
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,800
 So all the way through their life, if Evelyn Waw wanted anything, his dad got it for his brother.

310
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
 So Evelyn asked for a bike, his dad bought one for Alec instead.

311
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
 Alec wants us for a billionth table.

312
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
 And so Evelyn Waw had was a child at the time he played in his nursery.

313
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,800
 And the dad just dumped a billionth table in the room that he was supposed to play in.

314
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,800
 He once said when Alec fathered his first son, then Evelyn Waw's dad said to the son,

315
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,800
 "I've only ever loved three people in my life or only I've only ever had three great loves in my life.

316
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
 And my mother, my wife and your father."

317
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 And that's it? For what Evelyn?

318
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
 But Evelyn Waw was also mean to his children, wasn't he?

319
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
 Yes, he was.

320
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,800
 We've done the banana story before, haven't we?

321
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 Which is that there was lots of rationing in the war.

322
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,800
 And Evelyn Waw had children and there was a special thing where bananas were distributed

323
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 because they had not been easy to come by during the war.

324
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
 And so, you know, you would get basically a banana per child.

325
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,800
 And Evelyn Waw sat his three children down in front of him and proceeded to eat all three bananas.

326
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,800
 I think with a knife and a foot he poured cream over them and just sat there eating the banana.

327
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,800
 So, did he just hate them?

328
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
 Or...

329
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,800
 Maybe he was teaching them some lesson that we can't quite comprehend at this amount of time.

330
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
 It can't be how to eat a banana per child.

331
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
 With a knife and fork.

332
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,800
 I have a task question for you guys.

333
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
 Yes.

334
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,800
 The company Kellogg's, who's it named after?

335
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
 John Kellogg.

336
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,800
 John Kellogg.

337
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 Incorrect.

338
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
 John Harvey Kellogg is the guy that we've talked about before.

339
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
 He was sort of an inventor.

340
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,800
 He thought everyone had to eat oats and stop masturbating, stuff like that.

341
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,800
 Again, he's only two rules of Kellogg Academy.

342
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,800
 So, he's a famous one, I think, that people know about John Harvey Kellogg.

343
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,800
 But Kellogg's cornflakes and Kellogg's the company was founded, invented and named after his brother.

344
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,800
 So, John Harvey Kellogg had a younger brother called Will.

345
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,800
 And John was this really flamboyant, really outgoing character guy.

346
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,800
 He was masturbating and hating oats.

347
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,800
 They were polar opposites.

348
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
 They were opposites, although I don't know about them.

349
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,920
 - That's what I'm saying. - Around the dinner table.

350
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,040
 One of them's got a big bowl of oats.

351
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,280
 (laughing)

352
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,760
 - Not near my Siri.

353
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,040
 (laughing)

354
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,360
 Anyway, we'll get this back on track,

355
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,960
 'cause that's quite a serious rivalry.

356
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,000
 Oh my God.

357
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,200
 Will was opposite of John Harvey, not very flamboyant.

358
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,000
 Like hardly said anything, Super Shy was younger.

359
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,320
 He worked for his older brother for 25 years,

360
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,840
 so at that Sanitarian that he founded Battle Creek Spa,

361
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,480
 where he did like real dogs, body staff.

362
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,440
 John Harvey treated him really badly and made him do

363
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,640
 all the drug work, made him shine his shoes and stuff.

364
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,040
 Never gave him an official job title, hardly paid him anything.

365
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,240
 And eventually, Will turn around and thought,

366
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,480
 I'm the better businessman.

367
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,760
 I'm gonna set up a Kellogg's company,

368
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,160
 invent some cornflakes, and he did it.

369
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,920
 So he set up this cornflake company in 1906,

370
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,960
 and it had a promotional campaign

371
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,440
 where the slogan was, wink at your grocer

372
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,640
 and see what you get.

373
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,960
 (laughing)

374
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,560
 That was a spelling mistake.

375
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,960
 (laughing)

376
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,360
 And he got a bowl of cornflakes.

377
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,880
 (laughing)

378
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,460
 (upbeat music)

379
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:30,200
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

380
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,520
 - My fact is that Robert Louis Stevenson died

381
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,920
 halfway through making a batch of mayonnaise.

382
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
 - It's very sad.

383
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,560
 - It's very sad, 'cause he was young, he was only 44.

384
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,600
 - It is, it's so sad, it just makes me sad.

385
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,320
 The also that batch of mayonnaise, I suppose,

386
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,760
 never got finished, presumably.

387
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,160
 - Oh, that's the real tragedy, yeah.

388
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,160
 (laughing)

389
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,280
 - Also, how long does it take to make mayonnaise?

390
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,200
 - It takes me about two and a half minutes.

391
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,520
 - Well, it was very sudden death.

392
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,360
 (laughing)

393
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,120
 No, I think he was dropping the oil in, drop by drop.

394
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,600
 I might've been a longer process.

395
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,440
 - He did a food processor in those days.

396
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,760
 - I don't think he did, no.

397
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,720
 Especially not in Samoa when he lived, so yeah.

398
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,040
 - Yeah, he's just very quickly saying an early death.

399
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,800
 People when the news got relayed,

400
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,040
 'cause he was in Samoa, back home.

401
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,400
 People were properly devastated.

402
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,320
 Famous authors like Henry James actually flat out denied

403
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,360
 that it was true, he just saw this can't be right.

404
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,720
 And Roger Kipling said he was so upset he couldn't

405
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,240
 write for a month, he was just absolutely broken by it.

406
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,080
 Yeah, so he was a big, big character in his time.

407
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
 - Yeah.

408
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,920
 - Yeah.

409
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,160
 - But about this mayonnaise.

410
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,000
 - Yeah.

411
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 - Sorry, what am I?

412
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,080
 (laughing)

413
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,400
 - You are supposed to add the oil slowly.

414
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
 - Okay, so yeah.

415
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,240
 - That's what he was doing.

416
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,560
 And he took ill half way through making the mayonnaise

417
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,960
 and then he collapsed and then he died.

418
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,920
 It was very, very sad.

419
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,400
 - He was a sickly being, wasn't he?

420
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,760
 - He was so ill and weak all the way through his life.

421
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,280
 It's amazing, he wrote as much as he did.

422
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,120
 - Yeah.

423
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
 - Well, the idea was that some people said

424
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,600
 he wrote quicker than anyone else

425
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,720
 because he knew he'd had these hemorrhages and he'd been sick.

426
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,640
 And so because he knew his life would be short,

427
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,440
 he felt like he had to just get as much out as possible.

428
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,320
 - That's interesting.

429
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,160
 - Wow.

430
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,320
 - Yeah.

431
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,680
 - Just back to mayonnaise.

432
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,480
 (laughing)

433
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,880
 - Down, will you stop going on about mayonnaise?

434
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,840
 - Well, I was just looking into 'cause he was in Samoa

435
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,640
 and he was eating mayonnaise and I thought,

436
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,520
 I wonder if that's, did I eat mayonnaise in Samoa?

437
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,840
 Turns out they love it.

438
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,680
 - Did they?

439
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,520
 - Yeah.

440
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,720
 - I found a Facebook page called Samoan Quotes and Sayings.

441
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,080
 And there's one quote, which is,

442
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,480
 "If you eat everything with mayo,

443
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,840
 you might be a Samoan."

444
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,600
 Hashtag Samoan Habits.

445
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,600
 And yeah, apparently it's a very, very loved sauce there.

446
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,760
 - Really?

447
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,080
 - Anyway, back to him.

448
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,920
 - So when he was in Samoa,

449
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,520
 one thing that Robert Lee Stevenson did,

450
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,480
 which was very sweet, was that he gave his birthday to a child.

451
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,480
 He was born on the 13th of November

452
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,520
 and he bumped into a little girl who was called Annie Eyed,

453
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,040
 a daughter of a friend of his,

454
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,160
 and she was born on Christmas Day.

455
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,080
 And so she said, "I'd never get a proper fuss

456
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,960
 "made of me on Christmas Day."

457
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,040
 So he drew up a proper legal document,

458
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,560
 what, come pseudo legal document,

459
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,600
 in which he said, "I bequeath you my birthday."

460
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,440
 - That's cool.

461
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,280
 - So was she one year older than she thought she was at the end?

462
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,400
 - Oh, I don't know.

463
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
 I don't know.

464
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
 - She was half a year older, right?

465
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
 - Aged herself up.

466
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,960
 - She was born on the 13th of November.

467
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,440
 So it's not too much about her.

468
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
 - So just a month.

469
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,640
 - Yeah, you're still in that category

470
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
 of birthday present, Christmas present, annoyance.

471
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,040
 - Yeah.

472
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,680
 - So I was reading, he wrote such a sweet letter to her

473
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,320
 and he put it all in legal ease

474
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,480
 'cause he trained to be a lawyer.

475
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,240
 And so it started out saying,

476
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,720
 "I trust this will prove sufficient in law

477
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,040
 "and explain why he was doing."

478
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,400
 He said, "I've attained an age

479
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,000
 "where we never mention our age anymore

480
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,840
 "'cause it's so old.

481
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,000
 "So I have no further use for my birthday."

482
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,280
 But I remember discussing this before in it being in November,

483
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,480
 but at the end of this letter,

484
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,160
 it said his birthday was 19th of June.

485
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,360
 - Ooh.

486
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,920
 - He gave a fake birthday.

487
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,400
 - Was he given her a fake birthday?

488
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,120
 - I guess so, because actually,

489
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,440
 maybe he was thoughtful.

490
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,280
 - Yeah.

491
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,400
 - And he thought, "Well, so that November day

492
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
 "it's no good, I'm gonna pretend it's June."

493
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,880
 'Cause I mean, it's all pretend, it's all made up, isn't it?

494
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

495
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,880
 - Birthdays aren't made up.

496
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
 - Birthdays are real.

497
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,200
 - This is a legal thing, right?

498
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,240
 - But lots of his interactions were with,

499
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,080
 lots of his significant interactions were with children.

500
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,200
 So supposedly, he only started writing Treasure Island

501
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,040
 when he met a small boy who repeatedly asked him

502
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,640
 why he didn't write something interesting,

503
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,320
 like Robinson Crusoe.

504
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,160
 - Wow.

505
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,960
 - I think he was already an interesting writer.

506
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,320
 I like his stuff, but.

507
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,160
 - Yeah.

508
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,680
 - You don't agree with that little child?

509
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,520
 - No.

510
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,360
 - You think his previous stuff was.

511
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,200
 - That's a fool.

512
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,160
 - I don't know, I think that was,

513
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,080
 I mean, that's what's made him in the end, isn't it?

514
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,280
 That's the main thing that everyone knows him for.

515
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,560
 - It is, but there is one claim

516
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,080
 that he invented the sleeping bag.

517
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,920
 - Oh yeah.

518
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,640
 - Now, so that should be the biggie.

519
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,480
 - That's true.

520
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,320
 - Well, I don't think he did invent the sleeping bag,

521
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,960
 but he commissioned one of the very early sleeping bags

522
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,080
 or invented a prototype version of it.

523
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,800
 'Cause he was traveling solo through the Seven Mountains

524
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,720
 in France with only a donkey.

525
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,080
 And that was research for his book,

526
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,160
 "Travels with a donkey in the Seven."

527
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,360
 - An imaginative title.

528
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,520
 - Yeah.

529
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,520
 (laughing)

530
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,280
 - And the donkey was called Modestine.

531
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,360
 And he was really rude about the donkey.

532
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,800
 He said, oh yeah, the donkey held me up.

533
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
 I would have done it faster if it hadn't been for this donkey

534
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,080
 which was carrying all my stuff and my sleeping bag.

535
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,160
 - When Robert Louis Stevenson had a birthday in Samoa,

536
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,720
 he was very popular there.

537
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,560
 They celebrated by consuming 804 pineapples.

538
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,360
 - Sorry, can I interject here?

539
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,840
 - What the fuck was he doing celebrating his birthday

540
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,640
 in Samoa when he was giving it away to a girl?

541
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,480
 (laughing)

542
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,320
 - Excuse me.

543
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,800
 (laughing)

544
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,720
 - Put those pineapples away.

545
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,080
 - That was his 100th birthday.

546
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,480
 So it must've been terrible behavior.

547
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,960
 - 800 pineapples, that's a lot.

548
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,800
 - It's a lot.

549
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
 I mean, I don't know how many people

550
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,400
 were enjoying those pineapples.

551
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,800
 There might have been 900 people,

552
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,000
 and 100 people went hungry.

553
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,360
 (laughing)

554
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,320
 - His wife was called Fanny van der Grift Osborne.

555
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,680
 - It was not a great name.

556
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,120
 And one of the early women he fell in love with

557
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,240
 was called Fanny Sitwell.

558
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
 - He had a type, didn't he?

559
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,280
 - He had a thing about Fanny's.

560
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,720
 - He loved Fanny's.

561
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,400
 - Their story was quite sweet, actually.

562
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,760
 She was married to this guy in America,

563
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,360
 and he sent her to get their kids educated in Paris,

564
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,720
 and that was where she fell in love

565
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,080
 with Robert Louis Stevenson.

566
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,000
 And so she popped off back to New York,

567
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,600
 got a divorce from this husband of hers,

568
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,280
 and said I fall in love with someone else.

569
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,440
 And then her and Stevenson got married straight away,

570
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,200
 and her ex-husband came to the wedding,

571
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
 with his new girlfriend.

572
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,320
 - Good day.

573
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,160
 - Yeah.

574
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,320
 - Wow, that is quite nice.

575
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,680
 - Very mature, I think.

576
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,840
 - Very mature.

577
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,720
 - Just, we've been talking Treasure Island,

578
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,520
 but the other big, big work outside of travels

579
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,200
 with my donkey, (laughing)

580
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,080
 is, of course, Jacqueline Hyde.

581
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,640
 And that's really interesting, Jacqueline Hyde.

582
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,680
 He wrote a first version of the book and hated it.

583
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,040
 Absolutely hated it, so threw it in the fire,

584
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,400
 and burnt it, and then he rewrote the whole book.

585
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,200
 In the space of, I think, a weekend,

586
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,680
 who was, like, 30 hours that he sat,

587
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,560
 and he managed to bring it out.

588
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,080
 He was quite bad at spelling,

589
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,560
 that was noticed in the drafts of that.

590
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,200
 But Jacqueline Hyde, there's a few interesting facts about it.

591
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,360
 The first one is, we're all saying it wrong.

592
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,520
 - It's G-Kill.

593
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,320
 - G-Kill. - G-Kill.

594
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,000
 - Hey, if you were pronouncing it,

595
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,840
 pronouncing it is J-E-E, and then kill.

596
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,680
 - G-Kill. - Yeah.

597
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,520
 - Is that what he said?

598
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,040
 Did he put a pronunciation guard in the bag?

599
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,520
 - He did, he said that. - For the audio,

600
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,360
 but he said that in an interview.

601
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,920
 He said, let the name be pronounced as it is spelled G-Kill,

602
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,360
 not to J-Kill.

603
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,440
 - It's not spelled G-Kill.

604
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,240
 He's a bad spelling, we've already done this.

605
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,920
 - But it sounds quite Scottish, doesn't it?

606
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,800
 Because he was Scottish, you know, G-Kill.

607
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
 - G-Kill.

608
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,000
 - And do we know how to pronounce Hyde?

609
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,280
 - He'd, no, I think it's probably Hyde.

610
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,880
 - He did lead quite...

611
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,720
 Rubberlow Stevenson did lead a kind of

612
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,880
 almost Jekyll and Hyde life in some ways.

613
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,800
 So, first of all, he created an alternative character for himself.

614
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,200
 And this is when he was in Edinburgh

615
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,920
 and he loved doing really absurd things for the sake of it.

616
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,200
 And him and his cousin would play pranks on everyone

617
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,720
 and they called them jinx.

618
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,480
 And he created this character called John Libble,

619
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,960
 who sort of haunted Edinburgh in all these different ways.

620
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,280
 And so, for instance, he had hundreds or thousands

621
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,440
 of calling cards for John Libble printed off,

622
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,640
 and he went around Edinburgh handing them around to everyone.

623
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,280
 So you must get in touch with this person.

624
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,520
 - Oh God, that sounds very familiar

625
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,720
 from the Edinburgh Festival.

626
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,520
 (all laughing)

627
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,840
 I'll be in the video rooms at 3 p.m. every day.

628
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,400
 (all laughing)

629
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,600
 - He used to go into hotels or boarding houses

630
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,880
 all over the city and say,

631
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,200
 "As John Libble arrived yet,"

632
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,280
 and they'd say, "No, he hasn't."

633
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,400
 And he said, "Oh, he will."

634
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
 (all laughing)

635
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
 And he'd go, "What, who's this guy?"

636
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,200
 And he dropped into conversation

637
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,080
 that he was an agent looking for the person

638
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,240
 who was going to inherit the Libble fortune.

639
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,640
 He tried to get an ad in the Scotsman.

640
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,920
 He just created this guy that everyone was talking about.

641
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,760
 - That's really clever.

642
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,720
 - It does sound like a good way to get noticed

643
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,560
 at Edinburgh, doesn't it?

644
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,400
 - Yeah, it's not about it.

645
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,520
 - It's just a month before.

646
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,120
 - Yeah, it's a hotel's.

647
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,960
 - Is Andrew handsome?

648
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,120
 - Do you wanna hear ya?

649
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,960
 - No. - He will be.

650
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
 (all laughing)

651
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,540
 (upbeat music)

652
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:09,200
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

653
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,600
 and that is my fact.

654
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,160
 My fact this week is that in the 1960s,

655
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,800
 NASA helped to fund a scientific project

656
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,400
 that aimed to teach dolphins

657
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,000
 to speak the English language so perfectly

658
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,680
 that they would be given a chair at the United Nations

659
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,240
 to speak on behalf of marine mammals.

660
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,600
 - Obviously, they wouldn't fit in a chair.

661
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,440
 You'd have to have some kind of tank set up.

662
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
 - That's true, it was a good word.

663
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,200
 - Imagine a dolphin flopping around in a chair.

664
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,600
 - You and think tank.

665
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,120
 (all laughing)

666
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,760
 - So, did it work?

667
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,920
 - It did not work.

668
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,000
 But the premise of it was quite interesting.

669
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,920
 It was a guy called Dr. John Lilly

670
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,280
 and he had the idea along with his wife

671
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,880
 that dolphins were talking through their blowholes

672
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,560
 in a sort of specific noise

673
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,040
 that suggested that perhaps that could be manipulated

674
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,960
 into human language.

675
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
 And if they could train these dolphins to talk

676
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,640
 that they would be able to get cross species

677
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,840
 communication going.

678
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,360
 Now the reason NASA got involved

679
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,520
 is because NASA thought, let's see where this goes.

680
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,640
 If they get anywhere with this,

681
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,160
 this could be useful in the future.

682
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,680
 Should we ever make alien contact?

683
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,160
 The idea of learning some fundamental basics

684
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,880
 about communication. - That kind of makes sense, right?

685
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,080
 Because we don't know that aliens

686
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,840
 will have the same kind of languages as us.

687
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,640
 They could have the same kind of language as any animal

688
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,760
 so you would learn them.

689
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,000
 - Yeah, so this was set up in the 1960s

690
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,360
 and when this funding was given,

691
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,880
 NASA allowed, through its funding,

692
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,360
 to let John Lilly set up this kind of really bizarre laboratory

693
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,360
 where they flooded an entire room with water

694
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,040
 so that a dolphin called Peter could live in there

695
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,600
 with this lady who was gonna sit there

696
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,840
 for months and months on end.

697
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,400
 She had a mattress in the room.

698
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,320
 She had a desk that she could work at.

699
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,720
 - Was the mattress wet and was it under water the mattress?

700
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,960
 - No, she had like a platform.

701
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,520
 She wasn't under water herself, yeah.

702
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,360
 - Sorry, yeah.

703
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,120
 - It was her who was the instigator, really,

704
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,240
 of making the experiment so extensive.

705
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,520
 That was Margaret Love It, right?

706
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,360
 - That's right, yeah.

707
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,080
 - Who visited and she loved dolphins already.

708
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,280
 She visited this place

709
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,200
 and she totally fell in love with these three dolphins

710
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,960
 that were there and the lab at the time was just one tank

711
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,080
 and she said, I wanna see the dolphin living in this house

712
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,560
 in this full lab as if it's its own house

713
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
 so she insisted it was all flooded.

714
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,800
 And then she said, I wanna stay with it 24/7

715
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,400
 so she can really get to understand how it works

716
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,680
 so she could help with this experiment.

717
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,120
 And yeah, then she erected these hanging platforms

718
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,680
 so she could sit hanging from her swing desk.

719
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,600
 - Very shape of water, isn't it?

720
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,240
 - It is very shape of water.

721
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,080
 - Those platforms aren't the only things she erected

722
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,440
 (laughing)

723
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,480
 because, well, anyway, Peter was a young male dolphin

724
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,880
 and needed and was, I think, fancy to her.

725
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,800
 - Oh, did? - Yeah.

726
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,040
 - I think it's quite famously dolphins do tend to have

727
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,160
 a bit of a hump, don't they?

728
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,280
 When you go swimming with them,

729
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,680
 you hear a lot of stories of celebrities.

730
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,120
 - I mean, I must say, I went swimming with dolphins once

731
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,280
 and I attracted no attention whatsoever

732
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,720
 from the dolphin. - Oh God, God, not a celebrity though.

733
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,320
 (laughing)

734
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,720
 Apparently it's only celebrities.

735
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,560
 - Celebrities.

736
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,960
 (laughing)

737
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
 - It's just on seeing your Instagram followers

738
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,040
 before they...

739
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,280
 - They're whispering to the dolphins seriously.

740
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,680
 It's a very successful podcast.

741
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,960
 (laughing)

742
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,120
 - They all have a higher bar than that.

743
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,400
 - Margot used to do, it's interesting looking at the techniques

744
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,160
 that they tried to teach the dolphins

745
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,520
 with one of the techniques I thought was interesting was,

746
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,680
 she painted her face white.

747
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,600
 She put a white paint all over her face

748
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,040
 and then she used black lipstick

749
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,480
 and the idea was she wanted the dolphins to look directly

750
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,920
 at her lips to see the way she was mouthing were.

751
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,120
 So it's sort of to distract every other bit of her face

752
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,240
 from being the attention.

753
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,000
 - But they wanted the dolphin, I couldn't believe

754
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,360
 that the dolphins were speaking through their blowholes

755
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,920
 because I instinctively think of Dolphin Chatteras

756
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,800
 coming from their mouth. - Yeah, yeah.

757
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,800
 - And she said that the one thing she wanted him to say,

758
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,200
 Peter the Dolphin, to say was her name.

759
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,160
 He wanted her to say hello, Margaret.

760
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,120
 And she said that it's very difficult to get a dolphin

761
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,800
 to make an M sound with its blowhole

762
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,120
 and eventually he rolled over

763
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,520
 and kind of bubbled it through the water.

764
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,200
 But dolphins could imitate humans.

765
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,760
 We should say that they were able to imitate

766
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,960
 the pitch of the voice

767
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,040
 and maybe even the frequency too, I think.

768
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:23,040
 So there was some progress but not a lot enough.

769
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,200
 - None enough.

770
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,160
 - Yeah.

771
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,040
 And then it got a bit dodgy when he,

772
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,160
 this is John Lilly, who set up the whole thing.

773
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,240
 As we said before, started experimenting with LSD.

774
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,120
 He thought that the drugs would actually help the dolphins

775
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,200
 in order to understand language better

776
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,120
 and communicate better, open their minds up maybe.

777
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,880
 So he started injecting them with LSD to try.

778
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,960
 - Get that going.

779
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,800
 Is that right?

780
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,640
 It was interesting, yeah.

781
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,440
 - Yeah, she wouldn't let him inject Peter

782
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,080
 but she couldn't stop him injecting the other two.

783
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,200
 But it didn't really affect them, didn't it?

784
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,440
 Dolphins don't really, well, I guess we don't know

785
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,280
 what vision was they're saying because they still,

786
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,440
 they can't speak. - They can't speak.

787
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,240
 Everything they could see had an M in it.

788
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,400
 So they just couldn't say that.

789
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,000
 He was just seeing M in M's everywhere,

790
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,320
 but he just couldn't say it.

791
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,520
 But then he got two into LSD, didn't he?

792
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,240
 And ran away to experiment with that.

793
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,960
 - Yeah, so the project got abandoned and so on.

794
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,200
 So there is no marine mammal chair

795
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,400
 at the United Nations as a result.

796
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,200
 - And then he did go into drugs.

797
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,520
 He decided that he would take a lot of ketamine

798
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,640
 and go into sensory deprivation tanks,

799
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,480
 which is a bit stupid because they're just full of water.

800
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,280
 And so on quite a few occasions,

801
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,400
 his wife had to save him from drowning.

802
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,880
 And at one stage, he said,

803
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,800
 "Oh, one evening I took 150 milligrams of ketamine

804
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,520
 "and suddenly the earth, Coincident Control Office,

805
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,400
 "who were some aliens that he believed in,

806
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,560
 "remove my penis and handed it to me.

807
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,960
 "I screamed in terror.

808
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,160
 "My wife Tony came running in from the bedroom."

809
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
 And she said, "It's still attached."

810
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,840
 So I shouted at the ceiling, "Who's in charge up there?

811
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,720
 "A bunch of crazy kids."

812
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,600
 - I did not get to that matter.

813
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,800
 - He sounds like a reliable man to be doing science.

814
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,640
 - Wow.

815
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,440
 - So yeah?

816
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,280
 - Oh, okay.

817
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,640
 - I wonder how many times your husband would have to take

818
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,120
 loads of ketamine and get into a tank of water before you

819
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,200
 didn't save him.

820
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,520
 - I think on the fifth of a time.

821
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,560
 - That's it.

822
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,800
 - Especially if he hasn't got a penis anymore.

823
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,120
 - What's the point?

824
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,560
 - No, willy-lilly, they call them.

825
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,160
 (all laughing)

826
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,560
 - We are talking to dolphins now better than they used to.

827
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,880
 Yeah, so we've got this thing called a chat,

828
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,680
 which is a cetacean hearing and telemetry device.

829
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,640
 And it's just been invented.

830
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,400
 It's about the same size as a toaster.

831
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,600
 - You wear it on your chest and--

832
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,440
 - Or an auto, you look like a twice.

833
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,640
 (all laughing)

834
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,680
 - No, they've worked out how to translate.

835
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,360
 So you can teach dolphins to recognize certain words.

836
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,920
 They're clever, so you teach them

837
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,120
 to recognize the human word for seaweed.

838
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,360
 And then they make their own sound for that seaweed.

839
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
 So you know what, so this machine can work out

840
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,560
 what the dolphin sound for seaweed is.

841
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,840
 And then it can translate that back to a human.

842
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,840
 So they have got dolphins now to say the word seaweed

843
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,680
 into the machine.

844
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,520
 - That's pretty good.

845
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,400
 - If you think about it at the UN,

846
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,840
 they don't all speak English, do they?

847
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,920
 - No, they speak all sorts of different languages

848
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,240
 and it gets translated.

849
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,840
 - Yeah, it's the first thing on your chest.

850
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,080
 - But you could theoretically have a dolphin at the UN,

851
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,880
 just, I mean, all you can say is seaweed at the moment.

852
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,760
 - You would shove one of those earpieces in its blowhole,

853
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,600
 I guess.

854
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,440
 - Yeah.

855
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,040
 - So it would have to breathe sometimes.

856
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,160
 And then, well, you would have to take turns

857
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,480
 to breathe and to speak and listen,

858
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,880
 which you should do in life anyway.

859
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,240
 - So I don't think we've mentioned before,

860
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,400
 Peter Gabriel's project from Genesis.

861
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,840
 - Peter Gabriel from Genesis is working

862
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,120
 on an interspecies internet.

863
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,600
 - Well, it's a really cool project.

864
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,640
 He's been doing it for a while.

865
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,480
 It happened because he's a musician

866
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,480
 and he sort of played music with some apes.

867
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,800
 And he thought these guys are really getting me.

868
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,320
 And he called this scientist.

869
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,440
 Called this scientist called Neil Gershonfeld,

870
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,000
 who runs, I really like his job, he runs MIT's,

871
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,240
 Center for Bits and Atoms.

872
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,920
 And this guy, Peter Gabriel.

873
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,720
 - I don't know if this sounds good, I don't know.

874
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,320
 - These are legit people, a woman called Diana Rice,

875
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,760
 who's a cognitive psychologist,

876
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,040
 and one of the founders of the internet,

877
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,080
 Vince Sir, for Curfew, I think works, worked at Apple.

878
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,520
 - It's a difficult second invention, isn't it?

879
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,080
 After you've invented the internet,

880
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,280
 and then you go down and invent an internet for monkeys.

881
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,560
 (laughing)

882
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,320
 - This is for all animals to talk to each other.

883
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,160
 - Yes.

884
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,000
 - He's a wasp talking to a rhino,

885
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,640
 because we indeed would have nothing to say to each other.

886
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,200
 - They might have anything in common.

887
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,040
 - What are you talking about?

888
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,920
 They can all bitch about humans.

889
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,760
 - Oh yeah, that's it.

890
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,400
 - Blood of the humans swatted my mate today.

891
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,080
 Yeah, well, they took off my nose.

892
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,400
 (laughing)

893
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,520
 - But the user interface is going to be really hard.

894
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,360
 Because you're going to be--

895
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,200
 - I'm going to use a mouse.

896
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,800
 (laughing)

897
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,720
 - Wow, amazing.

898
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,320
 - Oh, just stuff on the UN.

899
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,880
 I didn't realise this, but I think maybe it's quite well known

900
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,680
 that the UN, the idea of the UN was conceived

901
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,760
 by Churchill and Roosevelt when Churchill was naked,

902
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,680
 as so many things were conceived.

903
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,280
 I think we talked about his punch on for naked.

904
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,520
 - And children's comfort.

905
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,480
 (laughing)

906
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,280
 - So this is from Daisy Suckley,

907
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,760
 who was a confident of Roosevelt,

908
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,680
 who it was when America had just been sucked into the war,

909
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,920
 and they decided that they had to have a united front

910
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,800
 against fascism, and they wanted to know what to call it.

911
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,440
 And FDR was lying in bed going to sleep,

912
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,880
 and suddenly--

913
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,120
 - Churchill birthed him.

914
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,560
 - But no, no, he didn't notice the other way around.

915
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,160
 FDR thought, "United nations."

916
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,000
 And so the moment he woke up the next morning,

917
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,480
 he jumped out of bed, and then he actually had some breakfast,

918
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,320
 and then--

919
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,040
 (laughing)

920
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,280
 And then he went up to Churchill's bedroom and knocked on the door,

921
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,680
 and Churchill said, "Come in and Churchill emerged

922
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,720
 from the bathroom but naked."

923
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,000
 And apparently appeared like a pink cherub FDR described to us.

924
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,840
 (laughing)

925
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,200
 FDR pointed at him and exploded.

926
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,600
 "The United Nations."

927
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,600
 (laughing)

928
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,080
 - I think if I was Churchill, after he came in,

929
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,760
 pointed at me naked, and said, "The United Nations,"

930
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,640
 that would be the nickname for my genitals.

931
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,360
 (laughing)

932
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,960
 - I can get you a seat on the United Nations if you like.

933
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,480
 (laughing)

934
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:22,320
 - Okay, that's it.

935
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,360
 That is all of our facts.

936
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,840
