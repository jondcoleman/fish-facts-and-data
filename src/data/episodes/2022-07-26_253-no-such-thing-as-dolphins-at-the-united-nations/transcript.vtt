00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 How do you know what I don't want like I said, I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that, I don't like that.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the Emperor of the Incas only ever wore an outfit once after which it was immediately burned.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 I'd be there. Why are you wearing the same jumper as you love the last three weeks? No, I've worn 21 different jumper so the last three weeks.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 So this was the he was called Sapper Inca and he wore special clothes that no one else was allowed to wear.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Is there a theory as to why he couldn't wear them twice, would we not know?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 We don't really know. I think it's just because he's so important and it's the ostentatious show of wealth, isn't it?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 And his clothes were seen as divine because he was seen as divine.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 It is a bit like the Duchess of Cambridge.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Well, if you reuse is an outfit, the newspaper say, "Oh, she's recycling her clothes as opposed to only wearing everything once."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Do you think they burn it after she uses them?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Maybe. Maybe the ones you really like, she squirrels away so she can wear them again.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 I don't know. How did they record their information in the Incas?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Yeah, so that is interesting. Unlike a lot of the Mesoamericans who we don't really have any information apart from ceramics or cloths or textiles,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 we have a bit about the Incas because they did talk to the Spanish.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 They were the last Mesoamericans that were there before the Spanish wiped them out.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 I didn't quite wipe them out, but basically a lot of them died.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 So we know what they did by what the Spanish said.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Although it should be said that the Spanish did lie a lot.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Exactly. So maybe this is not true.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 So when the Spanish came actually, it was an extraordinary thing that happened, first of all.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 So it was 1532 and it was the conquistador Francisco Pizarro and he turned up and it was a surprise attack that he launched on the Inca.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 It sounds a bit like a surprise party when you apply that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 It's a surprise. Have some smallpox. Have loads of murder.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 But according to the Spanish records, they killed 7,000 Inca without themselves having one single fatality.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Which you can't believe would actually be true, but that is what was recorded.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 But the amazing thing about this is that we can study exactly what happened and the influence of the Spanish by looking at this one glacier.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 We've talked about this kind of thing before, but there's this glacier, which is 150 miles away from where Pizarro landed.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 It's called the Kel Kaya ice cap. And it's the largest ice cap in the tropics.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And what it does is, because South America has wet and dry seasons, then a layer of dust forms every year in the dry season.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And so we know exactly which year it is by looking down in the ice cap.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Like tree rings. Exactly. Like tree rings.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 And so they've studied this ice cap to see what the influence of the Spanish was.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 So the Spanish came and they started doing metallurgy. And so it's got lots more kind of metallurgy deposits for its different types of metal deposits in it.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 When the revolutions started, the independence revolution suddenly a lot of mines were decommissioned.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 And so the pollution levels in it go down, which show you that.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 And you can just drill straight through this ice cap. And you've got this year by year calendar.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Another thing we can look at is Lamapoo. And that will tell us what happened with the Inca's.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Because basically their culture moved around Mays, which was the main crop, a few other things like potatoes and stuff.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 But Mays is one of the main ones. Mays pollen comes in so you can look at that.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 But at the same time, you can find a lot of mites in the ground, dead mites, which feed on Lama excrement.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 And you can work out by the number of these mites. And the amount of Mays pollen, exactly how big and small the Inca Empire was.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 That was kind of the super fuel the Lama done because you need to farm more intensively.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 And there was a big switch to Mays about 2,700 years ago.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 And the way they found it so cool, because they studied, I didn't know this was a thing.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 They studied what's called mud cores in a lake. So it's like an ice core, but it's made of mud.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Yeah, and it was also, it's really easy for the Inca's because Lama's defecate communally.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 You know, they have one toilet, not that all Lama's go to, but that, you know, all the Lama's, they live it's a big country parade.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 And so yeah, and that was what made it possible to grow huge Mays fields, because it's much richer.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 They wouldn't have done it without that fertilizer.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Oh wow. They were very into Lama's, weren't they?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 They relied on them massively.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Into Lama's into Mays.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Yeah.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 That's potatoes.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Not into the wheel, needed the Lama's, because they didn't have wheels.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Oh. So because they didn't have carts that could be pulled like massive long distances, they instead had this incredible system of chaskeys.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 And probably not how you pronounce it, but who knows how ink has pronounced things.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 And chaskeys, chaskeys were relay runners.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 So they were totally crucial to the whole Inca Empire.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 They were exempt from things like farming and taxation, because they were so important.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 And their whole job was to deliver messages and parcels and equipment through the Empire.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 And so they would run a short space, like they'd run 10 kilometers, and they'd pass a message on to the next person.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 They had to memorize the entire message perfectly, so it was like Chinese whispers.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 They didn't do something.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 They weren't holding a message.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 No.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Because I was wondering if that's why our Empire wasn't so big, because we can never get a relay team that can get out of it.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 You just keep dropping it.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 So the Inca, obviously, they were taken out, and there are no longer any sappers.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 But there is a descendant of a sapper, Inca, or the Inca Emperor, who is still in power to this day.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Wow.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 It's a long descendant.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 It's the last Inca Emperor called Hayaoana Cupek.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 His descendant is the current president of Chile.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Yeah.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 It's a direct descendant.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 His name is Miguel Pinera, and he's actually serving for the second time as president, which is a new rule they've never allowed that before.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 And he's a billionaire.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 So he's still the super rich.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 He could afford to burn his clothes after every time he ordered.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Wow.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 He's worth Â£2billion.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 The last Inca sapper was called anyone?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Ooh.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Don't know.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 It's also the name of a rapper.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Ah, Tupac.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Tupac.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Correct.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 You're thinking.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 He was called Tupac Amaru, and he was killed by the Spanish, but then there was an insurgency in the 18th century, and another person who wasn't related at all called themselves Tupac.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 He called themselves Tupac after this guy, and then Tupac Shakur, his mother, I think, named him after this insurgency.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Wow.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 That's cool.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Very interesting.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Very cool.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 And the kings, they would go to the coronations of their descendants, so their mummies would be at the coronation.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Oh, really?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Because they were really important still.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 They were reminding the new king that he descended from a long line of kings.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 And also, they would stay powerful after they died, because the royal family would visit the mummified kings and ask their advice about stuff.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 And then an oracle sitting next to them would...

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 What did you say?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 A bit like Matthew, Carbett, and City.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Exactly.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 What a show that would have been.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 There's quite a few of the Inca's, because they've got documents of the lines of the names that are associated with those sapper, and quite a few of them are mythical.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 And then suddenly, they just become real.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 People always do that.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Yeah.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Which Japanese emperors as well.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Yeah.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 This is the problem with not writing stuff down, because that's an oracle history, isn't it?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Or they did have this system of Qipu, which is these rods that had lots of threads with knots tied into them hanging from them, which was some really complex language that we don't understand.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 So, all we know is through oral history, which is always going to be entangled, I suppose, with myth.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Yeah.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 Do we still not know what those knots mean?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 We're getting close.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Wow.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 Yeah, that's so cool.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 We're getting close.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Maybe in our lives.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Maybe in the next five or ten years, they'll work it out, we think, possibly.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Yeah.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 That's so cool.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 What are they missing?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Are they missing like a knot rosetta stone?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Yes, they are.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 But they found one, which is some record keeping, where it's in Spanish, and also in Qipu, and they think that they might have the names of some emperors now, and they're getting pretty close.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 Very cool.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Do you know where Matthew Petru is twinned with?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Well, I've been to Matthew Petru, it's at the top of a massive hill that's really hard to get to.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 So, is it a high gate?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Okay, nice.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 It is not though.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 It is the Yorkshire village of Hayworth.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Is it?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Oh.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Yep, that's a big deal.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 They had a ceremony in 2005, and they've been with the great inconsistent city of Matthew Petru.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 What is that?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Do we know anything else about Hayworth?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Yeah.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 The Bronte's were from there.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 Did they get it?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Okay.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Were they explorers?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 They have nothing to do with Matthew Petru.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 I was reading the ceremony.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 I think they just wanted to inspire an interest in sort of Peruvian history in some school children.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 But I have no doubt Matthew Petru has no idea it's been with Hayworth.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 It doesn't have a sign as you enter Matthew Petru, James.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 It says, "Twindwood Hayworth."

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Now you've seen Matthew Petru.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Is it?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 Sorry.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 The Brontes were from Howarth, but is it not that?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Oh, is that how you pronounce it?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Oh, I don't know, actually.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Oh, is it H-A-W?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Yeah.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Yeah, it's probably Howarth.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 I don't know.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Some of New Yorkshire right in.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Right in England.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 Everyone from New Yorkshire.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 I don't think they've learned to write.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 Oh, no.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 That's the English.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Sorry.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Maybe that's what connects them.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 They are going to write it.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 I don't know how we're doing with Frankenstein.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 I've got a fact about ritual burning.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Great.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.800
 In 2017, Pakistan's Minister of Tourism, Fida Khan, was so annoyed about his flight being delayed

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.800
 that he took his clothes out of his luggage and started setting them on fire.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.800
 It's only going to delay the flight more, isn't it?

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.800
 Yeah.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.800
 If you start a fire in the air pool.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.800
 Unless they say, "Oh, my God, there's a fire.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.800
 Everyone get out of here.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800
 You get on that plane."

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.800
 Yeah.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.800
 It's the quickest way out.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.800
 Don't you find it weird that when you see people wearing these amazing

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.800
 expensive clothes on the red carpet and they don't own any of them?

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.800
 It's actually kind of like all these celebrities are...

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.800
 You know when you are struggling financially, of early 20s, you sort of hire stuff and then you have to send it back

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.800
 otherwise it accrues interest.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.800
 They're basically those people.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.800
 They're poor early 20s students who are hiring out a dress.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.800
 They're going to top shop and then getting it and then wearing it once and then taking it back.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.800
 No, no, I never wore it.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.800
 I never wore it.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.800
 Do you think the day after the Oscars, there's just a queue with Jennifer Lawrence.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.800
 You've got a Bradley Cooper at your top shop.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.800
 Yeah, go on, man.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.800
 They already strict.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.800
 It has to be within one to two days always.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.800
 I was reading about just while we're in America and the sort of rich elite there.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.800
 Russell Westbrook, who is a basketball player, who you guys won't know.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.800
 But in America, he's one of the biggest names in basketball.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.800
 And he's very famous for his flashy outfits.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.800
 And he is someone who has said, he said this on Ellen DeGeneres' show.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.800
 He never wears the same clothes twice.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.800
 But he says he doesn't waste them.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.800
 He donates them.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800
 He doesn't burn them.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.800
 He donates them to goodwill charities.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.800
 And as a result, he says when he walks through or he's in a car going through Oklahoma City,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.800
 he just sees everyone wearing his clothes.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.800
 He just sees everyone the same size in Oklahoma City.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.800
 As a basketball player.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.800
 He just got loads of people with clothes like they've been given by their older brothers.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:47.800
 No one can pick anything up because the sleeves are too long.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.800
 OK, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.800
 I've changed the number of my fact by the way, so don't freak out when I say it.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:22.800
 My fact this week is that about 70% of my fact this week is that about 70% of parents admit to having a favourite child.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.800
 Yeah, and they do have favourite children.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.800
 I've got a favourite one.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.800
 You've only got one.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.800
 Yeah, it's not mine.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.800
 Which is your favourite?

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.800
 I met this awesome kid at the playground.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:39.800
 When Wellf and I were there, he's called Jess, wicked chef.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:45.800
 Right, so about 70% of parents were bad as Dan is at parenting and prefer certain kids.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.800
 And this is, I was going through a bunch of kind of studies that have been done over the years.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.800
 Often are into parenting and that seems to be roughly the average.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:00.800
 So there was a study in 2016 that asked parents and 74% of mothers and 70% of fathers admitted to having a favourite.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.800
 I was in California.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.800
 There was another one 10 years earlier where it was 70% of fathers but 65% of mothers.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.800
 So it seems like mothers have really gone off their kids in the last decade.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.800
 And yeah, this keeps on coming up again and again.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.800
 If it's an in-depth study, they will sort of reluctantly admit that they do have a favourite child.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.800
 And also, studies that look at the behaviour of parents towards their children

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.800
 invariably find that they prefer certain childrens in the way they act.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.800
 So I just, I'm texted my mum this morning because I have three brothers and sisters

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.800
 and asked if she had a favourite.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.800
 I am.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.800
 And she didn't say, she didn't say the way which suggests to me that she does it, I'm not it.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.800
 I'm not a one and four chance though, that's something.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.800
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm not even her favourite on this podcast.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.800
 Wait, hang on, are you the youngest?

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.800
 And the eldest.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.800
 Well, that damages your chances.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.800
 Ah.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.800
 Because there have been studies done finding that half of parents who confessed they had a favourite

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.800
 said that it was their last born.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.800
 Right.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.800
 And there's another theory about why it's the last born, which is that

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.800
 more than half of parents and grandparents said that the last born child made them laugh more.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.800
 So there was an Australian news website which said,

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.800
 "So if you aren't the favourite, you might just not be very funny."

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.800
 And that was written by my mum.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:21.800
 But the good news is, kids are really bad at knowing which one the favourite is.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.800
 So it shouldn't make you feel too bad.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.800
 Yeah.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.800
 Yeah.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.800
 Again, in these studies when they look at who the children think is the favourite and who the

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.800
 parents favourite actually is, it's really often different.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.800
 So there was a survey which was, it was only 30 older mothers and they were asked about their adult

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.800
 children and 80% of those mothers admitted to having a favourite and 80% of the children said

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.800
 their parents definitely had a favourite, but almost all of them got the favourite wrong.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.800
 Wow.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.800
 So maybe parents are overcompensating?

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.800
 No, in fact it doesn't really matter if you're the favourite or not.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.800
 Because if you are the favourite, you will be treated better but you won't know it.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.800
 And if you're not the favourite, they'll make up for it by pretending to treat you better.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.800
 So it doesn't matter if they don't really like you.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.800
 Exactly, they're not going to show it.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.800
 How blatant would a parent make it though?

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.800
 What the...?

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.800
 I think you wouldn't give one child loads of presents or Christmas and the other no presents.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.800
 It's not like Cinderella or Harry Potter or something.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.800
 Does your child cry much, Dan?

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800
 No, not too much.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800
 Oh really?

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:23.800
 Because a lot of children do have red and according to evolutionary biologist David Hague,

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.800
 this might be to stop their parents from procreating and having another baby.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.800
 Which would kind of make sense if you think about it evolutionary, doesn't it?

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.800
 Yeah, I read about this.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.800
 This was, they do it at night particularly, right?

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:42.800
 Yeah, the idea of late nurse feeding from the mum so that if you were about to go, "Okay, let's get down."

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.800
 Your baby would stop you.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.800
 Yeah, and the idea is that the baby then gets more resources because he doesn't have to share it with brothers and sisters.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.800
 Which means in theory, they should do better in life, which means they should reproduce more and then.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.800
 But it doesn't also breastfeeding act as a contraceptive.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.800
 So if you're exclusively breastfeeding as a woman, you tend not to have periods.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.800
 Is that right?

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.800
 Meaning that you can't become pregnant.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.800
 Right.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.800
 So the more the child cries and wants breastfeeding, the less chance there is that another child will be born.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.800
 So it's working double efforts, stopping the actual sex.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:22.800
 And then even if the actual sex is happening, it's still acting as a human contraceptive problem.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.800
 It's obviously not working, is it?

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.800
 So these genius babies are failing.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.800
 During the best they can.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:36.800
 Maybe in another million years they'll evolve to make chastity belts or something.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.800
 One of you was saying that parents don't tend to just favour one kid with loads of presents.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.800
 But there was one parent who literally did exactly that.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.800
 So do you guys know about Evelyn Waw's dad?

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.800
 No, no.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.800
 So Evelyn Waw had an older brother called Alec.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.800
 And his dad absolutely loved Alec and absolutely hated Evelyn Waw.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.800
 So all the way through their life, if Evelyn Waw wanted anything, his dad got it for his brother.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.800
 So Evelyn asked for a bike, his dad bought one for Alec instead.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.800
 Alec wants us for a billionth table.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.800
 And so Evelyn Waw had was a child at the time he played in his nursery.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.800
 And the dad just dumped a billionth table in the room that he was supposed to play in.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:15.800
 He once said when Alec fathered his first son, then Evelyn Waw's dad said to the son,

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.800
 "I've only ever loved three people in my life or only I've only ever had three great loves in my life.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.800
 And my mother, my wife and your father."

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.800
 And that's it? For what Evelyn?

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.800
 But Evelyn Waw was also mean to his children, wasn't he?

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.800
 Yes, he was.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.800
 We've done the banana story before, haven't we?

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.800
 Which is that there was lots of rationing in the war.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.800
 And Evelyn Waw had children and there was a special thing where bananas were distributed

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.800
 because they had not been easy to come by during the war.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.800
 And so, you know, you would get basically a banana per child.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.800
 And Evelyn Waw sat his three children down in front of him and proceeded to eat all three bananas.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:59.800
 I think with a knife and a foot he poured cream over them and just sat there eating the banana.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.800
 So, did he just hate them?

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.800
 Or...

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.800
 Maybe he was teaching them some lesson that we can't quite comprehend at this amount of time.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.800
 It can't be how to eat a banana per child.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.800
 With a knife and fork.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.800
 I have a task question for you guys.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800
 Yes.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.800
 The company Kellogg's, who's it named after?

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.800
 John Kellogg.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.800
 John Kellogg.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.800
 Incorrect.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.800
 John Harvey Kellogg is the guy that we've talked about before.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.800
 He was sort of an inventor.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.800
 He thought everyone had to eat oats and stop masturbating, stuff like that.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:42.800
 Again, he's only two rules of Kellogg Academy.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.800
 So, he's a famous one, I think, that people know about John Harvey Kellogg.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:52.800
 But Kellogg's cornflakes and Kellogg's the company was founded, invented and named after his brother.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.800
 So, John Harvey Kellogg had a younger brother called Will.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.800
 And John was this really flamboyant, really outgoing character guy.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.800
 He was masturbating and hating oats.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.800
 They were polar opposites.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.800
 They were opposites, although I don't know about them.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.920
 - That's what I'm saying. - Around the dinner table.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.040
 One of them's got a big bowl of oats.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.280
 (laughing)

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.760
 - Not near my Siri.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.040
 (laughing)

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.360
 Anyway, we'll get this back on track,

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.960
 'cause that's quite a serious rivalry.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.000
 Oh my God.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.200
 Will was opposite of John Harvey, not very flamboyant.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.000
 Like hardly said anything, Super Shy was younger.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.320
 He worked for his older brother for 25 years,

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.840
 so at that Sanitarian that he founded Battle Creek Spa,

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.480
 where he did like real dogs, body staff.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.440
 John Harvey treated him really badly and made him do

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.640
 all the drug work, made him shine his shoes and stuff.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.040
 Never gave him an official job title, hardly paid him anything.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.240
 And eventually, Will turn around and thought,

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.480
 I'm the better businessman.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.760
 I'm gonna set up a Kellogg's company,

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.160
 invent some cornflakes, and he did it.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.920
 So he set up this cornflake company in 1906,

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.960
 and it had a promotional campaign

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.440
 where the slogan was, wink at your grocer

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.640
 and see what you get.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.960
 (laughing)

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.560
 That was a spelling mistake.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.960
 (laughing)

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.360
 And he got a bowl of cornflakes.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.880
 (laughing)

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.460
 (upbeat music)

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:30.200
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.520
 - My fact is that Robert Louis Stevenson died

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.920
 halfway through making a batch of mayonnaise.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.280
 - It's very sad.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.560
 - It's very sad, 'cause he was young, he was only 44.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.600
 - It is, it's so sad, it just makes me sad.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.320
 The also that batch of mayonnaise, I suppose,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.760
 never got finished, presumably.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.160
 - Oh, that's the real tragedy, yeah.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.160
 (laughing)

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.280
 - Also, how long does it take to make mayonnaise?

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.200
 - It takes me about two and a half minutes.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.520
 - Well, it was very sudden death.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.360
 (laughing)

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.120
 No, I think he was dropping the oil in, drop by drop.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.600
 I might've been a longer process.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.440
 - He did a food processor in those days.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.760
 - I don't think he did, no.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.720
 Especially not in Samoa when he lived, so yeah.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.040
 - Yeah, he's just very quickly saying an early death.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.800
 People when the news got relayed,

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.040
 'cause he was in Samoa, back home.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.400
 People were properly devastated.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.320
 Famous authors like Henry James actually flat out denied

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.360
 that it was true, he just saw this can't be right.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.720
 And Roger Kipling said he was so upset he couldn't

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.240
 write for a month, he was just absolutely broken by it.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.080
 Yeah, so he was a big, big character in his time.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.080
 - Yeah.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.920
 - Yeah.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.160
 - But about this mayonnaise.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.000
 - Yeah.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 - Sorry, what am I?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.080
 (laughing)

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.400
 - You are supposed to add the oil slowly.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.400
 - Okay, so yeah.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.240
 - That's what he was doing.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.560
 And he took ill half way through making the mayonnaise

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.960
 and then he collapsed and then he died.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.920
 It was very, very sad.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.400
 - He was a sickly being, wasn't he?

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.760
 - He was so ill and weak all the way through his life.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.280
 It's amazing, he wrote as much as he did.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.120
 - Yeah.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.120
 - Well, the idea was that some people said

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.600
 he wrote quicker than anyone else

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.720
 because he knew he'd had these hemorrhages and he'd been sick.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.640
 And so because he knew his life would be short,

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.440
 he felt like he had to just get as much out as possible.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.320
 - That's interesting.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.160
 - Wow.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.320
 - Yeah.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.680
 - Just back to mayonnaise.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.480
 (laughing)

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.880
 - Down, will you stop going on about mayonnaise?

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.840
 - Well, I was just looking into 'cause he was in Samoa

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.640
 and he was eating mayonnaise and I thought,

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.520
 I wonder if that's, did I eat mayonnaise in Samoa?

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.840
 Turns out they love it.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.680
 - Did they?

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.520
 - Yeah.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.720
 - I found a Facebook page called Samoan Quotes and Sayings.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.080
 And there's one quote, which is,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.480
 "If you eat everything with mayo,

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.840
 you might be a Samoan."

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.600
 Hashtag Samoan Habits.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.600
 And yeah, apparently it's a very, very loved sauce there.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.760
 - Really?

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.080
 - Anyway, back to him.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.920
 - So when he was in Samoa,

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.520
 one thing that Robert Lee Stevenson did,

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.480
 which was very sweet, was that he gave his birthday to a child.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.480
 He was born on the 13th of November

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.520
 and he bumped into a little girl who was called Annie Eyed,

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.040
 a daughter of a friend of his,

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.160
 and she was born on Christmas Day.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.080
 And so she said, "I'd never get a proper fuss

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.960
 "made of me on Christmas Day."

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.040
 So he drew up a proper legal document,

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.560
 what, come pseudo legal document,

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.600
 in which he said, "I bequeath you my birthday."

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.440
 - That's cool.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.280
 - So was she one year older than she thought she was at the end?

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.400
 - Oh, I don't know.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.240
 I don't know.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.240
 - She was half a year older, right?

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.240
 - Aged herself up.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.960
 - She was born on the 13th of November.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.440
 So it's not too much about her.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.440
 - So just a month.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.640
 - Yeah, you're still in that category

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.200
 of birthday present, Christmas present, annoyance.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.040
 - Yeah.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.680
 - So I was reading, he wrote such a sweet letter to her

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.320
 and he put it all in legal ease

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.480
 'cause he trained to be a lawyer.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.240
 And so it started out saying,

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.720
 "I trust this will prove sufficient in law

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.040
 "and explain why he was doing."

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.400
 He said, "I've attained an age

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.000
 "where we never mention our age anymore

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:39.840
 "'cause it's so old.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.000
 "So I have no further use for my birthday."

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.280
 But I remember discussing this before in it being in November,

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.480
 but at the end of this letter,

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.160
 it said his birthday was 19th of June.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.360
 - Ooh.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.920
 - He gave a fake birthday.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.400
 - Was he given her a fake birthday?

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.120
 - I guess so, because actually,

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.440
 maybe he was thoughtful.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.280
 - Yeah.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.400
 - And he thought, "Well, so that November day

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.920
 "it's no good, I'm gonna pretend it's June."

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.880
 'Cause I mean, it's all pretend, it's all made up, isn't it?

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.880
 - Birthdays aren't made up.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.880
 - Birthdays are real.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.200
 - This is a legal thing, right?

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.240
 - But lots of his interactions were with,

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.080
 lots of his significant interactions were with children.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.200
 So supposedly, he only started writing Treasure Island

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.040
 when he met a small boy who repeatedly asked him

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.640
 why he didn't write something interesting,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.320
 like Robinson Crusoe.

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.160
 - Wow.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.960
 - I think he was already an interesting writer.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.320
 I like his stuff, but.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.160
 - Yeah.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.680
 - You don't agree with that little child?

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.520
 - No.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.360
 - You think his previous stuff was.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.200
 - That's a fool.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.160
 - I don't know, I think that was,

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.080
 I mean, that's what's made him in the end, isn't it?

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.280
 That's the main thing that everyone knows him for.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.560
 - It is, but there is one claim

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.080
 that he invented the sleeping bag.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:40.920
 - Oh yeah.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.640
 - Now, so that should be the biggie.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.480
 - That's true.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.320
 - Well, I don't think he did invent the sleeping bag,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.960
 but he commissioned one of the very early sleeping bags

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.080
 or invented a prototype version of it.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.800
 'Cause he was traveling solo through the Seven Mountains

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.720
 in France with only a donkey.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.080
 And that was research for his book,

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.160
 "Travels with a donkey in the Seven."

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.360
 - An imaginative title.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.520
 - Yeah.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.520
 (laughing)

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.280
 - And the donkey was called Modestine.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.360
 And he was really rude about the donkey.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.800
 He said, oh yeah, the donkey held me up.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.800
 I would have done it faster if it hadn't been for this donkey

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.080
 which was carrying all my stuff and my sleeping bag.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.160
 - When Robert Louis Stevenson had a birthday in Samoa,

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.720
 he was very popular there.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.560
 They celebrated by consuming 804 pineapples.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.360
 - Sorry, can I interject here?

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.840
 - What the fuck was he doing celebrating his birthday

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.640
 in Samoa when he was giving it away to a girl?

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.480
 (laughing)

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.320
 - Excuse me.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.800
 (laughing)

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.720
 - Put those pineapples away.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.080
 - That was his 100th birthday.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.480
 So it must've been terrible behavior.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.960
 - 800 pineapples, that's a lot.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.800
 - It's a lot.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.800
 I mean, I don't know how many people

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.400
 were enjoying those pineapples.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.800
 There might have been 900 people,

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.000
 and 100 people went hungry.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.360
 (laughing)

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.320
 - His wife was called Fanny van der Grift Osborne.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.680
 - It was not a great name.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.120
 And one of the early women he fell in love with

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.240
 was called Fanny Sitwell.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.240
 - He had a type, didn't he?

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.280
 - He had a thing about Fanny's.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.720
 - He loved Fanny's.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.400
 - Their story was quite sweet, actually.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.760
 She was married to this guy in America,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.360
 and he sent her to get their kids educated in Paris,

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.720
 and that was where she fell in love

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.080
 with Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.000
 And so she popped off back to New York,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.600
 got a divorce from this husband of hers,

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.280
 and said I fall in love with someone else.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.440
 And then her and Stevenson got married straight away,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.200
 and her ex-husband came to the wedding,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.480
 with his new girlfriend.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.320
 - Good day.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.160
 - Yeah.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.320
 - Wow, that is quite nice.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.680
 - Very mature, I think.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.840
 - Very mature.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.720
 - Just, we've been talking Treasure Island,

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.520
 but the other big, big work outside of travels

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.200
 with my donkey, (laughing)

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.080
 is, of course, Jacqueline Hyde.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.640
 And that's really interesting, Jacqueline Hyde.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.680
 He wrote a first version of the book and hated it.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.040
 Absolutely hated it, so threw it in the fire,

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.400
 and burnt it, and then he rewrote the whole book.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.200
 In the space of, I think, a weekend,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.680
 who was, like, 30 hours that he sat,

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.560
 and he managed to bring it out.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.080
 He was quite bad at spelling,

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.560
 that was noticed in the drafts of that.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.200
 But Jacqueline Hyde, there's a few interesting facts about it.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.360
 The first one is, we're all saying it wrong.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.520
 - It's G-Kill.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.320
 - G-Kill. - G-Kill.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.000
 - Hey, if you were pronouncing it,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.840
 pronouncing it is J-E-E, and then kill.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.680
 - G-Kill. - Yeah.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.520
 - Is that what he said?

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.040
 Did he put a pronunciation guard in the bag?

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.520
 - He did, he said that. - For the audio,

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.360
 but he said that in an interview.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.920
 He said, let the name be pronounced as it is spelled G-Kill,

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.360
 not to J-Kill.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.440
 - It's not spelled G-Kill.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.240
 He's a bad spelling, we've already done this.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.920
 - But it sounds quite Scottish, doesn't it?

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.800
 Because he was Scottish, you know, G-Kill.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.800
 - G-Kill.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.000
 - And do we know how to pronounce Hyde?

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.280
 - He'd, no, I think it's probably Hyde.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.880
 - He did lead quite...

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.720
 Rubberlow Stevenson did lead a kind of

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.880
 almost Jekyll and Hyde life in some ways.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.800
 So, first of all, he created an alternative character for himself.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.200
 And this is when he was in Edinburgh

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.920
 and he loved doing really absurd things for the sake of it.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.200
 And him and his cousin would play pranks on everyone

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.720
 and they called them jinx.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.480
 And he created this character called John Libble,

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.960
 who sort of haunted Edinburgh in all these different ways.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.280
 And so, for instance, he had hundreds or thousands

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.440
 of calling cards for John Libble printed off,

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.640
 and he went around Edinburgh handing them around to everyone.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.280
 So you must get in touch with this person.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.520
 - Oh God, that sounds very familiar

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.720
 from the Edinburgh Festival.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.520
 (all laughing)

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.840
 I'll be in the video rooms at 3 p.m. every day.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.400
 (all laughing)

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.600
 - He used to go into hotels or boarding houses

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.880
 all over the city and say,

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.200
 "As John Libble arrived yet,"

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.280
 and they'd say, "No, he hasn't."

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.400
 And he said, "Oh, he will."

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.400
 (all laughing)

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.400
 And he'd go, "What, who's this guy?"

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.200
 And he dropped into conversation

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.080
 that he was an agent looking for the person

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.240
 who was going to inherit the Libble fortune.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.640
 He tried to get an ad in the Scotsman.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.920
 He just created this guy that everyone was talking about.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.760
 - That's really clever.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.720
 - It does sound like a good way to get noticed

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.560
 at Edinburgh, doesn't it?

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.400
 - Yeah, it's not about it.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.520
 - It's just a month before.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.120
 - Yeah, it's a hotel's.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:56.960
 - Is Andrew handsome?

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.120
 - Do you wanna hear ya?

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.960
 - No. - He will be.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.960
 (all laughing)

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.540
 (upbeat music)

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:09.200
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.600
 and that is my fact.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.160
 My fact this week is that in the 1960s,

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.800
 NASA helped to fund a scientific project

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.400
 that aimed to teach dolphins

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.000
 to speak the English language so perfectly

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.680
 that they would be given a chair at the United Nations

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.240
 to speak on behalf of marine mammals.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.600
 - Obviously, they wouldn't fit in a chair.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.440
 You'd have to have some kind of tank set up.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.440
 - That's true, it was a good word.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.200
 - Imagine a dolphin flopping around in a chair.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.600
 - You and think tank.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.120
 (all laughing)

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.760
 - So, did it work?

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.920
 - It did not work.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.000
 But the premise of it was quite interesting.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.920
 It was a guy called Dr. John Lilly

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.280
 and he had the idea along with his wife

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.880
 that dolphins were talking through their blowholes

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.560
 in a sort of specific noise

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.040
 that suggested that perhaps that could be manipulated

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.960
 into human language.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.960
 And if they could train these dolphins to talk

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.640
 that they would be able to get cross species

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.840
 communication going.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.360
 Now the reason NASA got involved

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.520
 is because NASA thought, let's see where this goes.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.640
 If they get anywhere with this,

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.160
 this could be useful in the future.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.680
 Should we ever make alien contact?

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.160
 The idea of learning some fundamental basics

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.880
 about communication. - That kind of makes sense, right?

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.080
 Because we don't know that aliens

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.840
 will have the same kind of languages as us.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.640
 They could have the same kind of language as any animal

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.760
 so you would learn them.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.000
 - Yeah, so this was set up in the 1960s

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.360
 and when this funding was given,

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.880
 NASA allowed, through its funding,

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:32.360
 to let John Lilly set up this kind of really bizarre laboratory

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.360
 where they flooded an entire room with water

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.040
 so that a dolphin called Peter could live in there

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.600
 with this lady who was gonna sit there

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.840
 for months and months on end.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.400
 She had a mattress in the room.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.320
 She had a desk that she could work at.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.720
 - Was the mattress wet and was it under water the mattress?

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.960
 - No, she had like a platform.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.520
 She wasn't under water herself, yeah.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.360
 - Sorry, yeah.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.120
 - It was her who was the instigator, really,

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.240
 of making the experiment so extensive.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.520
 That was Margaret Love It, right?

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.360
 - That's right, yeah.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.080
 - Who visited and she loved dolphins already.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.280
 She visited this place

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.200
 and she totally fell in love with these three dolphins

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.960
 that were there and the lab at the time was just one tank

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.080
 and she said, I wanna see the dolphin living in this house

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.560
 in this full lab as if it's its own house

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.560
 so she insisted it was all flooded.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.800
 And then she said, I wanna stay with it 24/7

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.400
 so she can really get to understand how it works

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.680
 so she could help with this experiment.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.120
 And yeah, then she erected these hanging platforms

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.680
 so she could sit hanging from her swing desk.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.600
 - Very shape of water, isn't it?

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.240
 - It is very shape of water.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.080
 - Those platforms aren't the only things she erected

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.440
 (laughing)

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.480
 because, well, anyway, Peter was a young male dolphin

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.880
 and needed and was, I think, fancy to her.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.800
 - Oh, did? - Yeah.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.040
 - I think it's quite famously dolphins do tend to have

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.160
 a bit of a hump, don't they?

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.280
 When you go swimming with them,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.680
 you hear a lot of stories of celebrities.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.120
 - I mean, I must say, I went swimming with dolphins once

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.280
 and I attracted no attention whatsoever

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.720
 from the dolphin. - Oh God, God, not a celebrity though.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.320
 (laughing)

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.720
 Apparently it's only celebrities.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.560
 - Celebrities.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.960
 (laughing)

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.960
 - It's just on seeing your Instagram followers

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.040
 before they...

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.280
 - They're whispering to the dolphins seriously.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.680
 It's a very successful podcast.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.960
 (laughing)

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:21.120
 - They all have a higher bar than that.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.400
 - Margot used to do, it's interesting looking at the techniques

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.160
 that they tried to teach the dolphins

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.520
 with one of the techniques I thought was interesting was,

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.680
 she painted her face white.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.600
 She put a white paint all over her face

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.040
 and then she used black lipstick

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.480
 and the idea was she wanted the dolphins to look directly

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.920
 at her lips to see the way she was mouthing were.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.120
 So it's sort of to distract every other bit of her face

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.240
 from being the attention.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.000
 - But they wanted the dolphin, I couldn't believe

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.360
 that the dolphins were speaking through their blowholes

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.920
 because I instinctively think of Dolphin Chatteras

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.800
 coming from their mouth. - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.800
 - And she said that the one thing she wanted him to say,

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.200
 Peter the Dolphin, to say was her name.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.160
 He wanted her to say hello, Margaret.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.120
 And she said that it's very difficult to get a dolphin

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.800
 to make an M sound with its blowhole

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.120
 and eventually he rolled over

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.520
 and kind of bubbled it through the water.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.200
 But dolphins could imitate humans.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.760
 We should say that they were able to imitate

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.960
 the pitch of the voice

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.040
 and maybe even the frequency too, I think.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:23.040
 So there was some progress but not a lot enough.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.200
 - None enough.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.160
 - Yeah.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.040
 And then it got a bit dodgy when he,

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.160
 this is John Lilly, who set up the whole thing.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.240
 As we said before, started experimenting with LSD.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.120
 He thought that the drugs would actually help the dolphins

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.200
 in order to understand language better

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.120
 and communicate better, open their minds up maybe.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.880
 So he started injecting them with LSD to try.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.960
 - Get that going.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.800
 Is that right?

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.640
 It was interesting, yeah.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.440
 - Yeah, she wouldn't let him inject Peter

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.080
 but she couldn't stop him injecting the other two.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.200
 But it didn't really affect them, didn't it?

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.440
 Dolphins don't really, well, I guess we don't know

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.280
 what vision was they're saying because they still,

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:57.440
 they can't speak. - They can't speak.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.240
 Everything they could see had an M in it.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.400
 So they just couldn't say that.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.000
 He was just seeing M in M's everywhere,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.320
 but he just couldn't say it.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.520
 But then he got two into LSD, didn't he?

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.240
 And ran away to experiment with that.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.960
 - Yeah, so the project got abandoned and so on.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.200
 So there is no marine mammal chair

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.400
 at the United Nations as a result.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.200
 - And then he did go into drugs.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.520
 He decided that he would take a lot of ketamine

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.640
 and go into sensory deprivation tanks,

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.480
 which is a bit stupid because they're just full of water.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.280
 And so on quite a few occasions,

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.400
 his wife had to save him from drowning.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.880
 And at one stage, he said,

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.800
 "Oh, one evening I took 150 milligrams of ketamine

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.520
 "and suddenly the earth, Coincident Control Office,

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.400
 "who were some aliens that he believed in,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.560
 "remove my penis and handed it to me.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.960
 "I screamed in terror.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.160
 "My wife Tony came running in from the bedroom."

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.160
 And she said, "It's still attached."

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.840
 So I shouted at the ceiling, "Who's in charge up there?

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.720
 "A bunch of crazy kids."

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.600
 - I did not get to that matter.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.800
 - He sounds like a reliable man to be doing science.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.640
 - Wow.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.440
 - So yeah?

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.280
 - Oh, okay.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.640
 - I wonder how many times your husband would have to take

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.120
 loads of ketamine and get into a tank of water before you

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.200
 didn't save him.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.520
 - I think on the fifth of a time.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.560
 - That's it.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.800
 - Especially if he hasn't got a penis anymore.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.120
 - What's the point?

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.560
 - No, willy-lilly, they call them.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.160
 (all laughing)

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:23.560
 - We are talking to dolphins now better than they used to.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.880
 Yeah, so we've got this thing called a chat,

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.680
 which is a cetacean hearing and telemetry device.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.640
 And it's just been invented.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.400
 It's about the same size as a toaster.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.600
 - You wear it on your chest and--

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.440
 - Or an auto, you look like a twice.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.640
 (all laughing)

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.680
 - No, they've worked out how to translate.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.360
 So you can teach dolphins to recognize certain words.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.920
 They're clever, so you teach them

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.120
 to recognize the human word for seaweed.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.360
 And then they make their own sound for that seaweed.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.360
 So you know what, so this machine can work out

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.560
 what the dolphin sound for seaweed is.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.840
 And then it can translate that back to a human.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.840
 So they have got dolphins now to say the word seaweed

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.680
 into the machine.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.520
 - That's pretty good.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.400
 - If you think about it at the UN,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.840
 they don't all speak English, do they?

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.920
 - No, they speak all sorts of different languages

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.240
 and it gets translated.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.840
 - Yeah, it's the first thing on your chest.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.080
 - But you could theoretically have a dolphin at the UN,

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.880
 just, I mean, all you can say is seaweed at the moment.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.760
 - You would shove one of those earpieces in its blowhole,

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.600
 I guess.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.440
 - Yeah.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.040
 - So it would have to breathe sometimes.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.160
 And then, well, you would have to take turns

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.480
 to breathe and to speak and listen,

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.880
 which you should do in life anyway.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.240
 - So I don't think we've mentioned before,

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.400
 Peter Gabriel's project from Genesis.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.840
 - Peter Gabriel from Genesis is working

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.120
 on an interspecies internet.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.600
 - Well, it's a really cool project.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.640
 He's been doing it for a while.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.480
 It happened because he's a musician

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.480
 and he sort of played music with some apes.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.800
 And he thought these guys are really getting me.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.320
 And he called this scientist.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.440
 Called this scientist called Neil Gershonfeld,

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.000
 who runs, I really like his job, he runs MIT's,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.240
 Center for Bits and Atoms.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.920
 And this guy, Peter Gabriel.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.720
 - I don't know if this sounds good, I don't know.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.320
 - These are legit people, a woman called Diana Rice,

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.760
 who's a cognitive psychologist,

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.040
 and one of the founders of the internet,

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.080
 Vince Sir, for Curfew, I think works, worked at Apple.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.520
 - It's a difficult second invention, isn't it?

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.080
 After you've invented the internet,

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.280
 and then you go down and invent an internet for monkeys.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.560
 (laughing)

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.320
 - This is for all animals to talk to each other.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.160
 - Yes.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.000
 - He's a wasp talking to a rhino,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.640
 because we indeed would have nothing to say to each other.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.200
 - They might have anything in common.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.040
 - What are you talking about?

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.920
 They can all bitch about humans.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.760
 - Oh yeah, that's it.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.400
 - Blood of the humans swatted my mate today.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.080
 Yeah, well, they took off my nose.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.400
 (laughing)

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.520
 - But the user interface is going to be really hard.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.360
 Because you're going to be--

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.200
 - I'm going to use a mouse.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.800
 (laughing)

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:54.720
 - Wow, amazing.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.320
 - Oh, just stuff on the UN.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.880
 I didn't realise this, but I think maybe it's quite well known

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.680
 that the UN, the idea of the UN was conceived

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.760
 by Churchill and Roosevelt when Churchill was naked,

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.680
 as so many things were conceived.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.280
 I think we talked about his punch on for naked.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.520
 - And children's comfort.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.480
 (laughing)

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.280
 - So this is from Daisy Suckley,

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.760
 who was a confident of Roosevelt,

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.680
 who it was when America had just been sucked into the war,

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.920
 and they decided that they had to have a united front

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.800
 against fascism, and they wanted to know what to call it.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.440
 And FDR was lying in bed going to sleep,

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.880
 and suddenly--

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.120
 - Churchill birthed him.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.560
 - But no, no, he didn't notice the other way around.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.160
 FDR thought, "United nations."

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.000
 And so the moment he woke up the next morning,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.480
 he jumped out of bed, and then he actually had some breakfast,

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.320
 and then--

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.040
 (laughing)

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.280
 And then he went up to Churchill's bedroom and knocked on the door,

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.680
 and Churchill said, "Come in and Churchill emerged

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.720
 from the bathroom but naked."

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.000
 And apparently appeared like a pink cherub FDR described to us.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.840
 (laughing)

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.200
 FDR pointed at him and exploded.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.600
 "The United Nations."

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.600
 (laughing)

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.080
 - I think if I was Churchill, after he came in,

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.760
 pointed at me naked, and said, "The United Nations,"

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.640
 that would be the nickname for my genitals.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.360
 (laughing)

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.960
 - I can get you a seat on the United Nations if you like.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.480
 (laughing)

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:22.320
 - Okay, that's it.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.360
 That is all of our facts.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.840
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.600

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.460
 (upbeat music)

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.040
 (upbeat music)

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:11.040
 (upbeat music)
