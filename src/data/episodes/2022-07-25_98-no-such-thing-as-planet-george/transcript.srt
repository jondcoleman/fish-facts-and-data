1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 (blues music)

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,000
 (blues music)

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,500
 (cheering)

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,340
 (cheering)

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,780
 And welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing"

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,120
 as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,460
 from the Up the Creek Comedy Club in Greenwich.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,720
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,580
 I'm sitting here next to Anna Chazinski,

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,420
 Andy Murray and James Harkin.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,480
 Once again, we have sat around the microphones

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,280
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,240
 and in no particular order, here we go.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,040
 Okay, time for fact number one,

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,180
 and that's my fact.

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,680
 My fact this week is that even though we're not sure

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,480
 it exists, the new planet, planet number nine,

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,180
 is the most planetary planet of all the planets.

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,080
 (laughing)

21
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,060
 So this is a major discovery that we found.

22
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,280
 - Yeah, a new planet.

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,120
 - Oh, it didn't find.

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,020
 - Oh, it didn't find.

25
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,480
 Either way, it's big news.

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,540
 - Yeah, we think it exists because of computer modeling.

27
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,620
 They've modeled the solar system.

28
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,540
 They think this thing exists.

29
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,940
 It's absolutely massive.

30
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,660
 And one thing that is very important with planets

31
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,420
 is that it clears out the area of its orbit.

32
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,260
 So the round to other things going round with it.

33
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,180
 And they think according to their calculations,

34
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,580
 this planet has done that more than any other planet.

35
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,380
 And that's what makes it the most planetary planet

36
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,900
 of all the planets.

37
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,180
 According to the guy who discovered it,

38
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,600
 or one of the two guys who discovered it, Doctor Brown.

39
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,440
 - Right.

40
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,280
 - So a planet, a planet is a planet

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,400
 that no other things want to be close to.

42
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
 Really, right?

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,900
 - Well, that's the case.

44
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,780
 Then I and I have landed a planet.

45
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,540
 (laughing)

46
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,800
 - I read a description of it

47
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,440
 that it was almost certain to be a fifth member

48
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,080
 of the Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune quartet.

49
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,500
 So it's like the fifth beetle.

50
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,140
 But it's like the fifth beetle was cast into deep space.

51
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,780
 (laughing)

52
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,580
 Yeah, the really cool thing about the new planet

53
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,660
 is you may have seen this in the news.

54
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,740
 The man who discovered it,

55
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,760
 one of the two guys who wrote the paper on it,

56
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,580
 is the same man who killed Pluto.

57
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,900
 - Yeah.

58
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,620
 - So it's like Brown, that is.

59
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,000
 - It's like a grudge match.

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
 (laughing)

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,680
 It's so exciting.

62
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,980
 - His Twitter account is @PlutoKiller.

63
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,820
 - Yeah, isn't it?

64
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,660
 - No.

65
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,500
 - It's actually, yeah.

66
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,720
 - And he says he still gets,

67
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,580
 he gets abuse from, he gets letters

68
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,440
 and obscene phone calls from people who miss Pluto.

69
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,680
 (laughing)

70
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,880
 He said, these are his exact words.

71
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,360
 He said, I got hate mail from young children for many years.

72
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,200
 (laughing)

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
 And he doesn't get any more now

74
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,760
 because young children these days know

75
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,480
 that Pluto is no longer a planet.

76
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,080
 - Pluto was named by a child, wasn't it?

77
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,920
 - Was it?

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,760
 - Yeah.

79
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,160
 - By an 11-year-old girl, Venetian,

80
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,640
 I read such a nice interview with her,

81
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
 which was about five years ago, I think,

82
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,720
 about how exciting it was that she'd named Pluto.

83
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,240
 And the interview kept on asking her why she'd named it Pluto.

84
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,080
 It was a NASA interviewer.

85
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,600
 The NASA interviewer said,

86
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,320
 "And you thought about it because of the Greek

87
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,120
 and Roman mythology about Pluto being the god

88
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
 of the underworld, yes?"

89
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,720
 And she'd be like, "No, no, I don't think it was as subtle

90
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,520
 as that, no, it was just the name I knew hadn't been used."

91
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,800
 Okay, but it was also because the first two letters,

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,360
 PL, have a connection with Persevalal?

93
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,200
 (laughing)

94
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,240
 No, no, I certainly didn't realize that.

95
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,540
 I appreciate it.

96
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,380
 (laughing)

97
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,440
 - Point interviewer, give me something.

98
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,360
 - She got five pounds for that.

99
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,160
 - But they took that five pounds off her

100
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,840
 when they demoted it from the planet.

101
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,680
 (laughing)

102
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,520
 - No?

103
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,480
 (laughing)

104
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,880
 - She said, she was in her late 80s when it was demoted

105
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,480
 and they asked her about it at the time.

106
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,080
 She said, "At my age, I've been largely indifferent

107
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,920
 "to the babe."

108
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,360
 (laughing)

109
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,400
 - She's just saying that's a hide all the hate mail

110
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,200
 that she's been saving to Mike Brown, hasn't it?

111
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,360
 (laughing)

112
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,920
 And so they're gonna come up with a new name for this planet

113
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,480
 and they don't know what they're gonna call it yet.

114
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,360
 - So a working name is George, isn't it?

115
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,200
 - Oh, is it?

116
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,840
 - No, that's quite nice because we almost did have

117
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
 a planet called George.

118
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
 - Uranus is called George.

119
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,760
 - Oh, it's called George and they said that's a ridiculous name.

120
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,600
 (laughing)

121
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,360
 And then they said, "Let's go with Uranus."

122
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,280
 (laughing)

123
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,840
 - It was gonna be named George after King George III

124
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,520
 and then they said, "No, why do they say

125
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,600
 "no to King George III?"

126
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,760
 Was it after a living?

127
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,400
 - All the other planets were named after Roman gods

128
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,040
 and suddenly some dickhead King's gone.

129
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,200
 Oh, named it after me.

130
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,040
 - No.

131
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,040
 (laughing)

132
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,440
 - So Mike Brown and his friend Constantine Batigin,

133
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,960
 who's the other person who's kind of found this one,

134
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,960
 their working name for it is Planet Fatty, okay.

135
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
 They said that they're gonna call it Planet Fatty

136
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,200
 because it's 1990 slang for something that's cool.

137
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,200
 But I went on to Urban Dictionary and Fatty does not mean cool.

138
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,880
 It means something that I really cannot say on the site.

139
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,720
 - Really?

140
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,120
 - Yeah, it's something very rude indeed.

141
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
 - Wow.

142
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,240
 - Fatty with a pH.

143
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
 - Oh yeah.

144
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,040
 - So James, you think another new story

145
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,360
 that's gonna come up is that Pluto

146
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,080
 is gonna be renamed to Planet?

147
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,840
 - I think it will do in the next couple of years, yeah.

148
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
 - What?

149
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,160
 - I think what will happen in the next couple of years is

150
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,000
 - What?

151
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,840
 (laughing)

152
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,920
 - I'm gonna get a lot of hate metal for this.

153
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
 (laughing)

154
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
 - Give me a stamp.

155
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,040
 I thought the thing was it's so tiny

156
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,440
 and there are so many hundreds of other objects

157
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,280
 which are the same size.

158
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,120
 - So I think all the other hundreds

159
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,920
 will get called planets as well.

160
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,160
 That's my guess, you know.

161
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,280
 - So much more memorizing to do in year nine at school

162
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,240
 is it gonna be in the end of 2000?

163
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,080
 - No.

164
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,280
 - They're all the planets, well, how long have you got?

165
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,040
 - I was reading about the current status of,

166
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,600
 Pluto's current official name is asteroid number 134-340.

167
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,320
 - Which is a long way to the fuller now.

168
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,400
 - Why did they call it that?

169
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,760
 Was it 'cause it's like an asteroid?

170
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,360
 - It's named after the ancient Greek god 134-340.

171
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,920
 (laughing)

172
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,600
 - Some of the names that they maybe,

173
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,360
 some people have suggested names on Twitter

174
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
 and whatever for this new planet.

175
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,160
 Minerva, Persephone, Nix, who's the goddess of the night,

176
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,840
 is quite a good one.

177
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,440
 Some people have said Bowie because of the timing of that.

178
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,240
 And the first person to suggest this one,

179
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,000
 which is my favorite, was at Ted Vogel_Wilson.

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,600
 And he thinks it should be called Pluto.

181
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
 (laughing)

182
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,440
 - Very nice.

183
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,280
 - That's a good name, sir.

184
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,120
 - That's very good.

185
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,080
 - I haven't said more puns in the sky, so.

186
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,480
 (laughing)

187
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,320
 - So there's been other news this week,

188
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,320
 which has been really exciting in sort of NASA news,

189
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,920
 Space News, which is, I saw an article about Scott Kelly,

190
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,600
 who's been up there now 300 days,

191
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,440
 and he was celebrating for 300 days of being in--

192
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,920
 - No, sorry, I'm going to wait.

193
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,760
 - Did he really got up there?

194
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,400
 The media is celebrating.

195
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,240
 (laughing)

196
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,800
 - I'm in space, guys.

197
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,160
 - Well, actually, it's weird you guys bring that up.

198
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,920
 They now factor in ordnance when astronauts go up.

199
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,880
 So Tim Peek, when he went out on his first ever EVA,

200
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,400
 when he went outside the ship,

201
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,560
 they didn't use, they used to have a really tight schedule.

202
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,400
 Go straight here, they now factor in time

203
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,720
 because any astronaut who would go outside

204
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,520
 would find themselves just going, oh my god,

205
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,960
 I'm hanging in space, I'm looking at the planet Earth,

206
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,600
 and they never factored in time for that.

207
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,440
 So they've now given all time,

208
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,440
 where you can just go, oh, and then get on with your work.

209
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,640
 So all time is now a thing, so it's great.

210
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,680
 But yeah, so he's up there, he's with this guy, Scott Kelly,

211
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,080
 who's been up there 300 days,

212
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,320
 and Scott Kelly made this clip to celebrate it

213
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,840
 by showing how you play ping pong in space.

214
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,520
 And what they do is, they have these little bats

215
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,200
 that are built to move water.

216
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,240
 And so this is just as a practical thing in space.

217
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,160
 And so what they do is they play ping pong

218
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,040
 using a droplet of water,

219
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,880
 and you just hit a droplet of water over,

220
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,680
 and it heads that way, and then you hit it back.

221
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,640
 He was playing on his own.

222
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,760
 I don't think it's caught on as again, yeah.

223
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,600
 Up in the ISS.

224
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,280
 But while I saw I was watching this video,

225
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,040
 it was really interesting,

226
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,720
 'cause he's playing, and he's talking about it,

227
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,240
 and I noticed as I was watching it,

228
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,840
 that he's wearing a belt.

229
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,280
 And I'm like, why are you wearing a belt in space?

230
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,800
 That's not going anywhere, so I Googled it,

231
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,800
 and I was looking why wear a belt in space,

232
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,560
 and it turns out you wear a belt in space

233
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,800
 to stop your trousers from falling up.

234
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,840
 And we need to move on to our next fact in a second.

235
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,880
 Anyone got anything else before we do?

236
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,400
 Just one last thing on Mike Brown,

237
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,960
 the astronomer at the centre of all of this.

238
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,080
 I just love the title of his 2010 book on the whole matter.

239
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,920
 It is how I killed Pluto, and why it had it coming.

240
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,920
 (audience laughing)

241
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,680
 Okay, it's time for our second fact of the show,

242
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,320
 and that is James Harkin.

243
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,960
 Okay, my fact this week is that the first use

244
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,880
 of the word snowmageddon came in the same press release

245
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,000
 as the first apology for the use of the word snowmageddon.

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,040
 (audience laughing)

247
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,400
 Because of all the snow in America,

248
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,760
 I thought I'd see like the history of snowmageddon.

249
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,280
 And I found a use in 2008,

250
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,520
 it was a press release from the Canadian government,

251
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,360
 and they said about how it snowmageddon,

252
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,400
 and then right at the end in a very Canadian way,

253
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,480
 they say, "We're sorry, we're not trying to take the mickey

254
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,080
 "and say that it's not very important.

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,880
 "It is important, sorry about snowmageddon."

256
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,240
 No, we're really sorry, really.

257
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
 (audience laughing)

258
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,080
 And then the snowmageddon was kind of not used that much

259
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,360
 for a couple of years, and then in 2008 and in 2010,

260
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,440
 they had a massive storm in Washington, DC,

261
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,560
 and that's when snowmageddon really took off.

262
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,400
 Right.

263
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,560
 And according to Wikipedia, there was a few other things,

264
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,560
 snowzilla within a few hours of snowmageddon,

265
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,040
 and apparently that storm also popularized the term

266
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,680
 Kaiser Snowze.

267
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,720
 (audience laughing)

268
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,440
 This latest storm, it's produced a thing,

269
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,760
 'cause you guys I'm sure have all seen

270
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
 all the enormous snowfall in the East Coast of America,

271
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,520
 it's been thunder snow is what's been produced.

272
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,400
 Oh yeah, 'cause Scott Kelly tweeted it.

273
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,560
 Scott Kelly, who is on the International Space Station,

274
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,360
 I think that was how we found out,

275
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,920
 or he, very early on when it was happening,

276
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,320
 he tweeted thunder snow,

277
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,920
 and 'cause he's obviously such an knowledgeable guy,

278
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,480
 he said, "This is unbelievably rare by the way, guys."

279
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,720
 And it's even more rare that I'm seeing it

280
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,960
 from the other side of it.

281
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,480
 (audience laughing)

282
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
 We had super rare, isn't it, thunder snow?

283
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,480
 Yeah, so it's where a storm, instead of producing rain,

284
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,200
 produces snow, 'cause of the different way

285
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,760
 the air rubs together or something.

286
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,280
 (audience laughing)

287
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,560
 It's some naughty bullshit that we're not gonna give the time to.

288
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,280
 I think when a cloud produces snow instead of rain,

289
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,800
 it's usually just 'cause it's cold.

290
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,240
 (audience laughing)

291
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,680
 You can blind me with all the meteorology like this.

292
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,600
 (audience laughing)

293
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,440
 I read today, I had no idea about this,

294
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,520
 so it's snow's on Mars.

295
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,040
 So it's not your classics, no.

296
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,800
 It's not your like, it's not like snow,

297
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,640
 but they call it like it's kind of like a snow cold

298
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,040
 that falls from the sky, exactly.

299
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,760
 So the Mars rover was looking up, don't know why,

300
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,840
 it was just looking up and it could see this snow coming down

301
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,800
 and it was having all time.

302
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,800
 (audience laughing)

303
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,640
 Wow, wow, wow, wow.

304
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,280
 (audience laughing)

305
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,720
 But so Mars has the craziest of atmospheres.

306
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,400
 There's spots in Mars, in the st,

307
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,760
 this was the article that I was reading,

308
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,280
 and told me this, if you stood in a certain spot of Mars,

309
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,000
 your feet could be 21 degrees,

310
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,040
 but your chest would be zero degrees.

311
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,960
 That's how the difference between,

312
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,440
 down there, so I'm curious.

313
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,240
 There's so little atmosphere here to get out of the atmosphere,

314
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
 you have to go really, really high,

315
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,080
 but there by your chest, you wouldn't be in the atmosphere anymore.

316
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,640
 So it'd be really, really cold.

317
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
 Actually speaking of hot and cold,

318
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,600
 I was reading, so something that's happening

319
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,920
 to go back to space news is the Keppler Space Telescope

320
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,160
 that was sent out a few years ago as do you back

321
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,240
 or back this year, I think.

322
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,440
 And so that's found tons of new planets.

323
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,520
 And one of the planets it's found

324
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,560
 is it's a planet called Glieze 581c.

325
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,560
 And what NASA says about that is, so it's tidally locked.

326
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,920
 So that basically means that it doesn't really rotate.

327
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,040
 So half of it is, one half of it is scorching hot,

328
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,760
 while the other half is constantly frozen.

329
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,560
 It is believed to be the best candidate for human expansion.

330
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,240
 [LAUGHTER]

331
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,760
 So the current storms in America,

332
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,920
 there is a guy who's capitalizing on the moment.

333
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,600
 He started it last year.

334
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,720
 It's a business called shipsnoyo.com.

335
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,120
 He's called Kyle Wearing.

336
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,720
 And you can buy snow in a box from him.

337
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
 And he sends it over, and he keeps it cool.

338
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,320
 And NASA makes sure it doesn't melt.

339
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
 He packs it in--

340
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
 It's like an inesky.

341
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,440
 He packs it in an inesky, yeah, so it doesn't over.

342
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,080
 And that is an Australian word for like a fridge.

343
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,280
 Yeah, it's like really.

344
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,520
 It's like if you're going to the beach,

345
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,920
 and you're bringing some bottles, and you're just going

346
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,560
 to sit there and down some tunis, it's that kind of thing.

347
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,200
 It's weird, because when the Australian comes out

348
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,600
 and you put it there, it really comes out.

349
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,320
 I'm an Aussie by the way, I just can't sound it.

350
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,480
 So there's a story just quickly following up on this.

351
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,280
 He offers-- by the time your eskies arrived

352
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,440
 and your snow's melted, he offers you a refund,

353
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,040
 and you'll send you a whole new batch of snow.

354
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,480
 There's also someone cap-like.

355
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,800
 So quite a few people have made it,

356
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,920
 even though a lot of people are in serious trouble.

357
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,600
 A lot of people actually are quite comfortable

358
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,560
 and having a lot of fun with it.

359
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,200
 People are making bars out of the snow,

360
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,480
 and serving drinks there.

361
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,920
 Yeah, they sold tons of extra booze, didn't they?

362
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,680
 As soon as they knew the storm was coming,

363
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
 they just went to the shops and bars,

364
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,960
 much booze as they could possibly get.

365
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,200
 And that's someone on Airbnb put up an igloo

366
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,680
 that they've built for $10 a night, you can rent the igloo.

367
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,800
 You've got to bring your own sleeping bag.

368
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,320
 But it's suddenly-- so since reading the article,

369
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,200
 it's been updated, the article, and it's now

370
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,320
 no longer on Airbnb.

371
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,360
 They're not sure if it was banned or if it melted.

372
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,680
 One of the two.

373
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,960
 So on naming storms, this storm doesn't need a name.

374
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,560
 And the weather channel, I think, is again the US weather channel.

375
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,720
 So why doesn't it need a name?

376
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,480
 Because of that.

377
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,120
 The only name.

378
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,440
 So a snowstorm is not a finite thing.

379
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,840
 It's just, I think, one meteorologist I was reading

380
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,720
 said it's just an extension of normal weather.

381
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,600
 So something like that.

382
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,760
 Everything's just an extension of normal.

383
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,360
 There's no supernatural weather, which--

384
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,120
 No, something like a cyclone has a very finite start and finish.

385
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
 Oh, I see.

386
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,840
 You can be quite exactly when we're starting exactly when it finish.

387
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,880
 So they need names, but storms don't.

388
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,400
 But the weather channel has announced

389
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,080
 the storm names for 2016.

390
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,880
 And they are things like Ajax.

391
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,640
 So there's going to be a storm called Ajax.

392
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,040
 Kyla.

393
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,960
 Quo, as in status.

394
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,960
 And Zandor, Wailon, and Yolo.

395
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,800
 Storm Yolo.

396
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,680
 Have you been killed by Storm Yolo?

397
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,480
 Well, you want me to die once.

398
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,960
 There's a paper in Canada that came out this week

399
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,320
 that warned people against eating snow.

400
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,920
 Because apparently, snow is really

401
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,160
 good at collecting bits from the car exhausts

402
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,200
 or bits of toxins from the air.

403
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,320
 Snow is really, really good at picking it up.

404
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,720
 And so if you kind of take a little bit of scoop of snow

405
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,200
 from the ground, like a lot of people do,

406
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,240
 and just kind of eat some of it, like everyone does, yeah?

407
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,560
 It's snowing, tonight, we--

408
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,400
 The South Korean government, a few years ago,

409
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,000
 made an explicit thing to people saying,

410
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,520
 you must not eat yellow snow.

411
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,200
 There was an actual press release saying,

412
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,880
 you must not eat yellow snow.

413
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,760
 And that's because they'd had this snow that had come,

414
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,160
 which was yellow, and it had like heavy minerals

415
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,120
 and stuff from some power stations.

416
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,640
 Oh, really?

417
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,480
 Oh, wow.

418
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,880
 And so that's the one reason that you should never eat yellow snow.

419
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,920
 Minorals from power stations.

420
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,640
 We're going to have to move on.

421
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,720
 Just before we end, I read one thing, which

422
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,240
 is a new theory that's erupted this week.

423
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,920
 Penguins, they think, may--

424
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,560
 I mean, there are so many qualifications in this already.

425
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:40,120
 You can get away with saying anything at this point, though.

426
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:49,280
 So penguins, they think, they think, may, possible.

427
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,520
 When they're about to mate,

428
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,440
 they will need a nice--

429
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,840
 Wait, is this the thing you think this is?

430
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,320
 No, this is the penguins.

431
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,200
 No, the penguins, if it's true, know it.

432
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
 It's absolutely the--

433
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
 So they think that the penguins are like,

434
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,960
 oh, we need somewhere to have a good time.

435
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,680
 Why not here?

436
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,760
 But oh, it's really cold in icy and snowy.

437
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,000
 So they'll poo on it.

438
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,200
 And then the poo melts the snow.

439
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,760
 And then they go, now that's where we have sex.

440
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,960
 There's a new theory.

441
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,840
 It's true that they poo.

442
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,200
 I'll give you that.

443
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,000
 Blah, blah, blah.

444
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,800
 OK, time for fact.

445
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,000
 Number three, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

446
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,560
 OK, my fact is that this week we have discovered

447
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,400
 the largest prime number ever.

448
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,240
 We would have discovered it in September,

449
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,760
 but the computer which found it, forgot to tell anybody.

450
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:44,920
 So this has happened.

451
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,600
 So there are computers all over the world

452
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,400
 looking for new prime numbers.

453
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,280
 And they're up to really enormous ones now.

454
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,440
 And they're very useful in encrypting stuff.

455
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,640
 Yeah, they're called GIMPS.

456
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,520
 GIMPS, yeah.

457
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,280
 Something massive prime internet.

458
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,640
 Merzene, which I think--

459
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,040
 Merzene's prime search.

460
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,840
 Yeah, Merzene.

461
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,120
 It's Merzene primes.

462
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,640
 So these are prime numbers named

463
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,560
 after a French guy called Merzene.

464
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,480
 And you can download a computer program onto your computer.

465
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,280
 And it will look for these prime numbers.

466
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,520
 And if you find one, then you get like 100 grand

467
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,320
 or something like that, $100,000.

468
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,120
 And everyone, a lot of people have put it

469
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,800
 onto the computer, but the people

470
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,680
 who found it this week or last year or whatever it was,

471
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,840
 they have so much computer processing power

472
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,560
 that they've managed to find loads of them.

473
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,400
 Right.

474
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,040
 Yeah, I think they found like four of the last five

475
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,560
 or something like that, right?

476
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,480
 Yeah.

477
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,160
 So the new one, I'm going to read this out from here.

478
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,280
 The new number is 5 million digits

479
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,320
 longer than the previous largest one.

480
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,160
 It's 2 to the power of 74 million, 207,281.

481
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,520
 All of that minus one.

482
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
 Yeah.

483
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,280
 And if you were going to write it out

484
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,800
 and you could write 10 digits in four seconds,

485
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,120
 this is a calculation by a New York Times correspondent,

486
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,800
 it would take you three months without slowing down.

487
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,320
 Yeah.

488
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,360
 It's got 22 million digits in it.

489
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
 Like my phone.

490
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:15,600
 It starts 3-0-0-3-7-6-4-1.

491
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,720
 It starts up.

492
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,040
 And then it ends 0-0-7-3-3-9-10-8-6-4-3-6-3-5-1.

493
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,520
 And for people at home--

494
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,680
 So you've just given away the ending.

495
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,680
 There's no point reading the middle now.

496
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,240
 For people at home, we edited out the other 22 million,

497
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,440
 I just didn't say.

498
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,880
 And you can download the actual number

499
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,960
 and get it on your computer and have a look through it,

500
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,600
 which I did.

501
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,120
 Look great.

502
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,920
 It contains my six-digit code to access

503
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,960
 my bank account.

504
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,720
 Oh, James, don't say that.

505
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,480
 And people will know.

506
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,760
 It contains it 21 times.

507
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
 Wow.

508
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,280
 That's how big this number is.

509
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,840
 It contains my library number twice.

510
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,680
 And at one stage, it has 8/7s in a row.

511
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,760
 So I'm just giving you the edited highlights here.

512
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:10,040
 I was watching an interview with the guy who discovered it,

513
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,440
 or rather the guy who set the computer up that discovered it.

514
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,840
 And there was a moment that, like, this is amazing.

515
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,360
 There's the big new prime number.

516
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,960
 It's beyond any that we've had before.

517
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,880
 What can we do with it?

518
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
 And he was like, we have no idea.

519
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,880
 Literally nothing.

520
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,640
 It has no point.

521
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,440
 There's no problem.

522
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,560
 So most of them can be used for encrypting things on computers.

523
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:25,840
 Yeah.

524
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,600
 Unfortunately, this one is now such a global celebrity

525
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,720
 that it will be noticed immediately by hackers.

526
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,480
 So if you have a clean, there's several million digits on.

527
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,720
 The thing is, you use prime numbers in encryption

528
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,160
 by taking two prime numbers, multiplying them together,

529
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,640
 and then it's finding the factors of that secondary number.

530
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,920
 Now, if you have a number which has got 23, 24 million digits in,

531
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,240
 you know that one of them must be this number.

532
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,920
 So everyone knows that it must be this one.

533
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,480
 So it's really easy to crack.

534
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,880
 So the only time this will be useful

535
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,440
 is when we get some even bigger numbers that we can use.

536
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,720
 Which we will do one day.

537
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,920
 Yeah.

538
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,800
 I'd never heard prime numbers described like this,

539
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,280
 but they're the building blocks of maths, really.

540
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,680
 And they're the equivalent of atoms in science,

541
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,560
 because prime numbers are, because nothing goes into them,

542
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,200
 and everything else is a factor of something else.

543
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,280
 So everything else can be split up.

544
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,720
 You can't split up a prime number.

545
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,080
 Well, they were equivalent of an atom.

546
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,920
 And something else I didn't know about prime numbers,

547
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,800
 because you think they're kind of so randomly distributed.

548
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,320
 If we've taken this long to work out what the pattern is,

549
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,480
 is that all prime numbers, if you square them,

550
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,040
 are a multiple of 24, and then adding one.

551
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,080
 Now, you can just run that down.

552
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,160
 Not the really small one.

553
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,400
 No one's under fire.

554
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,560
 Not the number of prime numbers.

555
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,400
 Anything over five.

556
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,520
 Seven is, oh god, we're going to go through them all.

557
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,960
 11 is 13 is 17.

558
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,320
 11 is.

559
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,400
 Yeah, so they found this using the GIMPS software.

560
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,840
 And this is the weird thing about GIMPS is,

561
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,200
 if you go up to Google and type the word GIMPS into Google,

562
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,280
 all of the first five things that you get

563
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,000
 are about this prime number thing.

564
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,600
 The same is not true of Google images.

565
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,400
 This is amazing.

566
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,120
 So cicadas, you know, there's that kind of cicada in North America,

567
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,240
 which only comes up to the surface.

568
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,640
 Every 17 years.

569
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
 Well, it's every prime number of years.

570
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,960
 So in some places, it's every 13 years.

571
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,440
 In some places, every 17 years.

572
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,680
 In some places, another prime number of years.

573
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,840
 And which sounds ridiculous.

574
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,160
 But it was hypothesized in the article I read that actually

575
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,880
 does make sense.

576
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,280
 Because if you come up in a prime number of years,

577
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,560
 you have the least chance of coinciding with predators,

578
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,000
 which also have, like, periodical patterns.

579
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,720
 Because so, let's say you come up every eight years,

580
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,440
 then if you're hunted by a panther that appears every two years,

581
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,880
 then they're going to bump into you a lot.

582
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,360
 But if you're coming up every prime number of years,

583
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,080
 then you're not going to bump into predators

584
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,200
 every prime number of years.

585
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,760
 Do you think there's just a car that comes up every two

586
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,440
 to the 74 million years?

587
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,880
 And the only reason we haven't seen it is because, you know,

588
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,600
 you'd be pretty lucky to see that one, you know.

589
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,120
 Yeah.

590
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,400
 I don't know what a cicada is.

591
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,440
 It's a little insect.

592
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:14,960
 It's OK.

593
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,480
 Look at that.

594
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
 Yeah, like a cricket.

595
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,000
 Got it.

596
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,680
 Cicada fact, there's only one cicada in the UK.

597
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,520
 One species of cicada.

598
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,280
 Oh.

599
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
 One.

600
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,680
 The cicada.

601
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,080
 Lonesome Trevor.

602
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,200
 There's only one species of cicada in the UK.

603
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,040
 It's called the New Forest cicada.

604
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,800
 And we think they live in the New Forest,

605
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,560
 where they might have died out, because no one's seen one

606
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,720
 for about 10 years.

607
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,080
 And you should be able to hear the call,

608
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
 but you can't really hear it because it's outside

609
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,520
 of human hearing range.

610
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,280
 But you can buy an app.

611
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,600
 And the app can hear the cicada call.

612
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,400
 And so you can walk around the New Forest

613
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,080
 with your app listening for cicadas.

614
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,440
 And then if you find one, then you'll

615
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,840
 have discovered that they still exist.

616
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,360
 Wow.

617
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:53,840
 That'd be cool.

618
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,440
 That's right.

619
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,280
 Yeah.

620
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,120
 Yeah.

621
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,800
 So I didn't find any prime number stuff.

622
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,280
 I started looking into numbers of the week.

623
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,960
 And there's a very famous set of numbers now.

624
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,000
 This is going to be a long list.

625
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,440
 Now, six.

626
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,840
 Now there was this week, a set of numbers,

627
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,280
 which was, there was this massive lotto,

628
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,480
 the big lottery draw that went.

629
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,920
 And there was a story about this lady who

630
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,000
 thinks she's won the lottery.

631
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,360
 She's found the ticker that she's won with all the numbers.

632
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,000
 But the barcode is missing.

633
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,560
 She put it in the washing machine, didn't she?

634
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,880
 Yeah, she put it in the washing machine.

635
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,680
 It's missing.

636
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,320
 It's one of those things where you think

637
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,040
 that must be the worst situation, right?

638
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,640
 That you've won the lottery.

639
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,000
 And now you've not won it, because you've lost the thing.

640
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
 That's all I was looking into is that genuinely

641
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,440
 the worst situation anyone's had in the lottery.

642
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
 And I found a guy that I think contends.

643
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
 Oh, really?

644
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
 Yeah.

645
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
 This guy won the lottery.

646
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
 OK.

647
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,120
 But this is what led up to him winning the lottery.

648
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,560
 His name is Franz Seller.

649
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
 He was born in Croatia.

650
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
 He was a teacher.

651
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,880
 He was born in 1929.

652
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,840
 In 1962, his train derailed and plunged into an icy river.

653
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
 And he managed to escape and not die.

654
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,040
 The next year in 1963, while flying,

655
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,160
 the door blew out, and he got sucked out of the way.

656
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
 And he survived.

657
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,640
 Oh, good.

658
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
 It was all good.

659
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,040
 Three years later, 1966, he's riding on a bunge.

660
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,960
 That's sort of what?

661
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,640
 He's riding on a bunge.

662
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,320
 It's Australia.

663
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,400
 It's an Australian term.

664
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,960
 He's riding on a bunge, right?

665
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,480
 Whatever you do, don't check that verb,

666
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,480
 a dictionary when you get on a bunge.

667
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,200
 So he's riding on a bus and the bus suddenly.

668
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,680
 The bus plunges into a river.

669
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,200
 So that's, he gets out and survived.

670
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
 So this is 1962, 1963, 1966.

671
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,040
 1970, he must take no public transport by the way.

672
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,560
 Exactly.

673
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,400
 He's in his car.

674
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,600
 Oh, no.

675
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,440
 He's in his car.

676
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,600
 And it just blows up in flames.

677
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,520
 So he escapes.

678
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,440
 And he's all right.

679
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,360
 So that's 1970, 1973.

680
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,240
 He's still weary of public transport.

681
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,280
 In his car, once again, another fire blows up in his car,

682
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,200
 loses all his hair.

683
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,600
 It manages us to make it out.

684
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,920
 There's a whole nice period between 1973 and 1995

685
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,000
 when nothing happens.

686
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,600
 But he stayed at home, then I guess.

687
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,520
 But then he went out and got hit by a bus.

688
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,760
 So that's 1995.

689
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,800
 Then in 1996, 1996, he's back in his car.

690
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,640
 He drove and another, either it was a truck or a car,

691
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
 is coming towards him.

692
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,680
 He swirves away.

693
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,000
 He manages to escape his car as it plunges over a cliff,

694
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,200
 lands in a tree, and then the car goes 300 feet down

695
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,080
 and breaks into a nicey river.

696
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,560
 And in 2003, he won the lotto.

697
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,600
 [LAUGHTER]

698
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,800
 1 million.

699
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,280
 That's divine justice.

700
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,000
 That's amazing.

701
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,280
 I think that's worse than losing your ticket and not winning.

702
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,600
 There was a couple.

703
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,840
 There were two other very bad lottery stories.

704
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,720
 So one couple-- I think this was actually last year--

705
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,560
 Edwin and David Neillan, who had a lotto app.

706
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,400
 And they got the right numbers.

707
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,720
 And they sent them off in the app.

708
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,840
 And they'd won 35 million pounds.

709
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,480
 And the app broke.

710
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,000
 And it failed.

711
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,640
 So they had the photographic evidence

712
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,080
 that they tried to send it on the app.

713
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,920
 And it only sent it after the deadline

714
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,440
 because they ran out of signals.

715
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,600
 Oh, I've been using their phone to search for cicada noises

716
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
 in New Forest.

717
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,960
 [LAUGHTER]

718
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,520
 OK, let's move on to our final fact of the show.

719
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,800
 And that is Chazinsky.

720
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,200
 Yes, my fact is that in a press release

721
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,240
 about the new English language test

722
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,120
 for migrants, the British government misspelled the word

723
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,120
 language.

724
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,120
 But yeah, this has been a big story over the last few weeks.

725
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,680
 There's the new test for migrants.

726
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,360
 And there's lots of controversy.

727
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,200
 And even if they're on spousal visas,

728
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,680
 if they fail these language tests,

729
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,160
 they might be made to leave the country.

730
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,320
 And it turns out the people who are releasing the press release

731
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,640
 spell language with the A and the U the wrong way around.

732
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,400
 There's a very snotty reply from the government.

733
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,920
 The Prime Minister's official spokesman

734
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,440
 said, "All of us are open to mistakes at times.

735
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,440
 The Prime Minister is fully confident that his team

736
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,800
 speak English competently."

737
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,720
 [LAUGHTER]

738
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,840
 Touched a bit of a nerve.

739
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,560
 [LAUGHTER]

740
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,440
 I went through-- I basically haven't researched that much of this,

741
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,800
 because I just went through trying to find mistakes

742
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,040
 in all government--

743
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,880
 [LAUGHTER]

744
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,720
 --it's all legislation over the last 50 years.

745
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,400
 No, I went-- well, first of all, the independent put together

746
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,720
 a list of 10 questions that are taken from the government's list

747
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,240
 of possible migrant language questions.

748
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,920
 And here's the independence introduction to the questions.

749
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,960
 Listen to this sentence.

750
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,880
 The questions below have been taken from practice exams

751
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,720
 for the B1 test that those who need to prove their knowledge

752
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,680
 of the English language to gain their indefinite leave

753
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,440
 to remain--

754
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,560
 [LAUGHTER]

755
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
 Whoa!

756
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,840
 Oh, it's like a cliffhanger of a sentence.

757
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,360
 [LAUGHTER]

758
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,040
 And then-- so one of the questions is maybe I'm wrong about this,

759
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,920
 but it's multiple choice questions.

760
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,760
 And it is a completely under this sentence.

761
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,960
 So one of them is, have you finished with the newspaper

762
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,000
 and its ABCD and the options are--

763
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,640
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.

764
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,480
 Is this the game--

765
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,880
 Tell citizenship.

766
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's against citizenship.

767
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,640
 You have to say whether you've finished with the newspaper.

768
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
 [LAUGHTER]

769
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,280
 That's the only criteria.

770
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,680
 Just give the freaking newspaper back.

771
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,880
 You can come in the country.

772
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
 [LAUGHTER]

773
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,360
 No, it's have you finished with the newspaper,

774
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,160
 and then it's what is the grammatically correct ending

775
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
 to the sentence.

776
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,680
 Have you finished with the newspaper now still yet,

777
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,000
 or already?

778
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,080
 Now, the answer they want, and I did the test,

779
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,760
 yet is the answer they want, already, is completely correct.

780
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,240
 Yeah, if you want to be really passive-aggressive about it.

781
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,680
 Yeah, you can say, have you finished with that newspaper

782
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,480
 already?

783
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,680
 No, it's not that.

784
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,160
 It's not that.

785
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,280
 It's the opposite of that.

786
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,880
 So they want you to fall into the trap of the American.

787
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,920
 Have you finished with the newspaper already?

788
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,080
 But you could also just ask the valid question,

789
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
 have you finished with the newspaper already?

790
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,920
 Hasn't have you read it that fast?

791
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,440
 Have you finished with the newspaper already?

792
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,880
 Oh, you could also--

793
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
 You could also passive-aggressive, is they?

794
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,360
 Well, have you finished with the newspaper now?

795
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,160
 [LAUGHTER]

796
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,280
 What more brutish than that?

797
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,520
 [LAUGHTER]

798
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,880
 It doesn't make any sense.

799
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,920
 That's what it probably is.

800
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,840
 Yeah.

801
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,120
 So my wife, who's Russian, she will have

802
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,440
 to take these tests quite soon.

803
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,680
 And she was trying out some questions

804
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,400
 from the citizenship test, which is like a general knowledge

805
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,680
 test, and she tried them out on me.

806
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,200
 And literally, I got none of them right.

807
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,720
 Really?

808
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,920
 And my general knowledge is not bad.

809
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,880
 It's all right.

810
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,280
 I have brought a long one to test you,

811
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,840
 because I think your general knowledge is quite good.

812
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,320
 OK.

813
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,520
 Well, one of the ones that she was asked in the practice test

814
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,160
 was, what is a national dish of whales?

815
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
 Oh!

816
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,960
 Well, coal.

817
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,760
 Oh.

818
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,280
 Oh, coal.

819
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,960
 Oh, yeah.

820
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,200
 Cool.

821
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,760
 Well, you might think that according to the government.

822
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,440
 Well, exactly.

823
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,760
 But according to the government, it's Welsh cakes.

824
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,560
 Oh, god.

825
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,240
 Sorry, fellas.

826
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,240
 Sorry, guys.

827
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,120
 The whole office will be sending around.

828
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,640
 Ah, yeah.

829
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,480
 Well, of case.

830
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,760
 Yeah, probably Welsh cakes.

831
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,400
 But the other thing is, if I want to become a citizen of Russia,

832
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,680
 I would have to take a Russian language test.

833
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,600
 And the Russian language test has all the normal things

834
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,640
 that you would expect.

835
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,520
 But you also have to be able to interpret hidden meanings.

836
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,840
 Wow.

837
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,760
 That's cool.

838
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,160
 That's cool.

839
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,160
 You know, Bill Bryson released a new book, The Road to Little

840
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,560
 Dribbling, and it's all in the beginning.

841
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,840
 He talks about taking a test to become a British citizen.

842
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,960
 He decided to become it.

843
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,720
 And he was saying that not only are there mistakes in the test,

844
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,080
 but in the books that guide you into how to take the test

845
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,080
 are just completely filled with mistakes.

846
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,240
 One that he pointed out was they were talking about Anthony Hopkins

847
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,000
 and saying that he's someone to be proud of as a British person.

848
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,920
 He's someone to be proud of.

849
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,240
 They spelt his name wrong.

850
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,600
 And also, he's taken up American citizenship.

851
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,440
 He's not a British anymore.

852
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,400
 Tina Turner is Swiss now.

853
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,200
 Ishi.

854
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,960
 Yep.

855
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
 Wow.

856
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,800
 So I was looking into the news for other language mess ups

857
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,720
 over the last week.

858
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,120
 And I found one that happened in Sweden.

859
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,920
 They were having their parliament, a political debate

860
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,360
 about very serious issues, actually.

861
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,800
 It was like a really long debate.

862
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,320
 They made a mistake, though, of when they transmitted it,

863
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,600
 they put the wrong subtitles onto the debate.

864
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,240
 So you had guys like Jean Borgland,

865
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,120
 who's the Minister of Education, looking really serious,

866
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,680
 saying something really serious, but the subtitles reading,

867
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,400
 "I will build the best sancasel in the calendar."

868
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,600
 [LAUGHTER]

869
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,600
 I vote for him.

870
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,400
 And then you had Stefan Loffan, the prime minister,

871
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,960
 the prime minister, going the latest invention,

872
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,080
 the fantastic dinosaur submarine.

873
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,280
 [LAUGHTER]

874
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,880
 And then the Minister for Environment, going,

875
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,200
 "Greetings, Earth Creatures."

876
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,280
 [LAUGHTER]

877
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,840
 I have two pairs of boots, one red pair,

878
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,880
 and one yellow pair.

879
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,000
 Which one should I take?

880
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,280
 I'm going to ask my dolls.

881
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,200
 [LAUGHTER]

882
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,680
 Well, I don't know where they got those original subtitles.

883
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,640
 Yeah, it was a cartoon animation.

884
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,080
 Oh, that sounds great.

885
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
 It sounds great, isn't it?

886
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,760
 You know that Godzilla has just been awarded Japanese citizenship.

887
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,560
 I was done as a press PR stunt, obviously.

888
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,080
 But it was a particular district of Tokyo

889
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,840
 that he got in Shinjuku, which is a very cool, extremely busy one.

890
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,960
 I think that's-- it's very near the famous crossing in Tokyo.

891
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,000
 Shibuya crossing.

892
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,600
 But they released the certificate, which they'd done.

893
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,120
 And it said, "Previous visits to Shinjuku Ward 3."

894
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,040
 Godzilla, 1984.

895
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,720
 Godzilla versus King Gidora, 1991.

896
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,800
 And Godzilla Millennium, 1999.

897
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,000
 Those were his trips.

898
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,280
 Very good.

899
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,560
 We're going to have to wrap up in a sec.

900
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,160
 So yeah, anything you want to--

901
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,440
 Just as you know, to get South Korean citizenship,

902
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,600
 the test requires you to sing the first four verses

903
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,720
 of the national anthem.

904
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,840
 Sing it in tune.

905
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,600
 Wow.

906
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,440
 Yeah.

907
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,840
 That's a tough gig, isn't it?

908
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,040
 And the Dutch citizenship, you have to watch a video

909
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,240
 that includes beach nudity.

910
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,760
 What?

911
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
 Where's the film?

912
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,280
 [LAUGHTER]

913
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,120
 What does he want?

914
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,280
 I'll do it even if they don't give me Dutch nudity.

915
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,880
 [LAUGHTER]

916
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,400
 It's become such a liberal country they

917
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,880
 want to show you what to expect if you come to the Netherlands.

918
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,520
 Yeah, yeah.

919
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,920
 Like if people come from other countries

920
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,080
 that are a bit more conservative,

921
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,960
 they might turn up into the Netherlands

922
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,560
 and think, wow, what's going on here?

923
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,800
 Beach nudity.

924
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,160
 So they want to show it so that you're not

925
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,520
 shocked when you see it in real life.

926
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,960
 So can you feel that?

927
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,840
 Is it like if you get an erection, or are you crying then?

928
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,880
 You want both, you want both.

929
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,800
 Feelings are confusing, isn't it?

930
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,520
 [LAUGHTER]

931
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,240
 I'm kidding.

932
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,000
 That's it.

933
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,720
 I'll do it.

934
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,760
 I'll do it all day.

935
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,120
 That's all of our facts.

936
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,840

946
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,000
 No such thing as a fish.com.

947
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,240
 We've got all of our previous episodes up there.

948
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,600
