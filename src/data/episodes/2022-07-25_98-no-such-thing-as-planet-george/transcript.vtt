00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
 (blues music)

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.400
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.000
 (blues music)

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.500
 (cheering)

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.340
 (cheering)

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.780
 And welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing"

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.120
 as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.460
 from the Up the Creek Comedy Club in Greenwich.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.720
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.580
 I'm sitting here next to Anna Chazinski,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.420
 Andy Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.480
 Once again, we have sat around the microphones

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.280
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.240
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.040
 Okay, time for fact number one,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.180
 and that's my fact.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.680
 My fact this week is that even though we're not sure

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 it exists, the new planet, planet number nine,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.180
 is the most planetary planet of all the planets.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.080
 (laughing)

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.060
 So this is a major discovery that we found.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.280
 - Yeah, a new planet.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.120
 - Oh, it didn't find.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.020
 - Oh, it didn't find.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.480
 Either way, it's big news.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.540
 - Yeah, we think it exists because of computer modeling.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.620
 They've modeled the solar system.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.540
 They think this thing exists.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.940
 It's absolutely massive.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.660
 And one thing that is very important with planets

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.420
 is that it clears out the area of its orbit.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.260
 So the round to other things going round with it.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.180
 And they think according to their calculations,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.580
 this planet has done that more than any other planet.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.380
 And that's what makes it the most planetary planet

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 of all the planets.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.180
 According to the guy who discovered it,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.600
 or one of the two guys who discovered it, Doctor Brown.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.440
 - Right.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.280
 - So a planet, a planet is a planet

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.400
 that no other things want to be close to.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.400
 Really, right?

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.900
 - Well, that's the case.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.780
 Then I and I have landed a planet.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.540
 (laughing)

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.800
 - I read a description of it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.440
 that it was almost certain to be a fifth member

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.080
 of the Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune quartet.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.500
 So it's like the fifth beetle.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.140
 But it's like the fifth beetle was cast into deep space.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.780
 (laughing)

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.580
 Yeah, the really cool thing about the new planet

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.660
 is you may have seen this in the news.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.740
 The man who discovered it,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.760
 one of the two guys who wrote the paper on it,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.580
 is the same man who killed Pluto.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.900
 - Yeah.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.620
 - So it's like Brown, that is.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.000
 - It's like a grudge match.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.840
 (laughing)

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.680
 It's so exciting.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.980
 - His Twitter account is @PlutoKiller.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.820
 - Yeah, isn't it?

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.660
 - No.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.500
 - It's actually, yeah.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.720
 - And he says he still gets,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.580
 he gets abuse from, he gets letters

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.440
 and obscene phone calls from people who miss Pluto.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.680
 (laughing)

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.880
 He said, these are his exact words.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.360
 He said, I got hate mail from young children for many years.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.200
 (laughing)

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200
 And he doesn't get any more now

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.760
 because young children these days know

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.480
 that Pluto is no longer a planet.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.080
 - Pluto was named by a child, wasn't it?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.920
 - Was it?

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.760
 - Yeah.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.160
 - By an 11-year-old girl, Venetian,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.640
 I read such a nice interview with her,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.640
 which was about five years ago, I think,

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.720
 about how exciting it was that she'd named Pluto.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.240
 And the interview kept on asking her why she'd named it Pluto.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.080
 It was a NASA interviewer.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.600
 The NASA interviewer said,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.320
 "And you thought about it because of the Greek

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.120
 and Roman mythology about Pluto being the god

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.120
 of the underworld, yes?"

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.720
 And she'd be like, "No, no, I don't think it was as subtle

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.520
 as that, no, it was just the name I knew hadn't been used."

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.800
 Okay, but it was also because the first two letters,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.360
 PL, have a connection with Persevalal?

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.200
 (laughing)

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.240
 No, no, I certainly didn't realize that.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.540
 I appreciate it.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.380
 (laughing)

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.440
 - Point interviewer, give me something.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.360
 - She got five pounds for that.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.160
 - But they took that five pounds off her

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.840
 when they demoted it from the planet.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.680
 (laughing)

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.520
 - No?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.480
 (laughing)

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.880
 - She said, she was in her late 80s when it was demoted

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.480
 and they asked her about it at the time.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.080
 She said, "At my age, I've been largely indifferent

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.920
 "to the babe."

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.360
 (laughing)

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.400
 - She's just saying that's a hide all the hate mail

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.200
 that she's been saving to Mike Brown, hasn't it?

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.360
 (laughing)

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.920
 And so they're gonna come up with a new name for this planet

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.480
 and they don't know what they're gonna call it yet.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.360
 - So a working name is George, isn't it?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.200
 - Oh, is it?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.840
 - No, that's quite nice because we almost did have

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.840
 a planet called George.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.120
 - Uranus is called George.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.760
 - Oh, it's called George and they said that's a ridiculous name.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.600
 (laughing)

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.360
 And then they said, "Let's go with Uranus."

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.280
 (laughing)

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.840
 - It was gonna be named George after King George III

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.520
 and then they said, "No, why do they say

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.600
 "no to King George III?"

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.760
 Was it after a living?

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.400
 - All the other planets were named after Roman gods

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.040
 and suddenly some dickhead King's gone.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.200
 Oh, named it after me.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.040
 - No.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.040
 (laughing)

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.440
 - So Mike Brown and his friend Constantine Batigin,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.960
 who's the other person who's kind of found this one,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.960
 their working name for it is Planet Fatty, okay.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.800
 They said that they're gonna call it Planet Fatty

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.200
 because it's 1990 slang for something that's cool.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.200
 But I went on to Urban Dictionary and Fatty does not mean cool.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.880
 It means something that I really cannot say on the site.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.720
 - Really?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.120
 - Yeah, it's something very rude indeed.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.120
 - Wow.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.240
 - Fatty with a pH.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.080
 - Oh yeah.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.040
 - So James, you think another new story

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.360
 that's gonna come up is that Pluto

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.080
 is gonna be renamed to Planet?

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.840
 - I think it will do in the next couple of years, yeah.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.840
 - What?

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.160
 - I think what will happen in the next couple of years is

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.000
 - What?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.840
 (laughing)

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.920
 - I'm gonna get a lot of hate metal for this.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.920
 (laughing)

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.760
 - Give me a stamp.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.040
 I thought the thing was it's so tiny

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.440
 and there are so many hundreds of other objects

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.280
 which are the same size.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.120
 - So I think all the other hundreds

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.920
 will get called planets as well.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.160
 That's my guess, you know.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.280
 - So much more memorizing to do in year nine at school

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.240
 is it gonna be in the end of 2000?

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.080
 - No.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.280
 - They're all the planets, well, how long have you got?

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.040
 - I was reading about the current status of,

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.600
 Pluto's current official name is asteroid number 134-340.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.320
 - Which is a long way to the fuller now.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.400
 - Why did they call it that?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.760
 Was it 'cause it's like an asteroid?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.360
 - It's named after the ancient Greek god 134-340.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.920
 (laughing)

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.600
 - Some of the names that they maybe,

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.360
 some people have suggested names on Twitter

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.440
 and whatever for this new planet.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.160
 Minerva, Persephone, Nix, who's the goddess of the night,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.840
 is quite a good one.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.440
 Some people have said Bowie because of the timing of that.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.240
 And the first person to suggest this one,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.000
 which is my favorite, was at Ted Vogel_Wilson.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.600
 And he thinks it should be called Pluto.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.600
 (laughing)

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.440
 - Very nice.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.280
 - That's a good name, sir.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.120
 - That's very good.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.080
 - I haven't said more puns in the sky, so.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.480
 (laughing)

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.320
 - So there's been other news this week,

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.320
 which has been really exciting in sort of NASA news,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.920
 Space News, which is, I saw an article about Scott Kelly,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.600
 who's been up there now 300 days,

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.440
 and he was celebrating for 300 days of being in--

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.920
 - No, sorry, I'm going to wait.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.760
 - Did he really got up there?

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.400
 The media is celebrating.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.240
 (laughing)

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.800
 - I'm in space, guys.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.160
 - Well, actually, it's weird you guys bring that up.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.920
 They now factor in ordnance when astronauts go up.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.880
 So Tim Peek, when he went out on his first ever EVA,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.400
 when he went outside the ship,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.560
 they didn't use, they used to have a really tight schedule.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.400
 Go straight here, they now factor in time

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.720
 because any astronaut who would go outside

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.520
 would find themselves just going, oh my god,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.960
 I'm hanging in space, I'm looking at the planet Earth,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.600
 and they never factored in time for that.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.440
 So they've now given all time,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.440
 where you can just go, oh, and then get on with your work.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.640
 So all time is now a thing, so it's great.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.680
 But yeah, so he's up there, he's with this guy, Scott Kelly,

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.080
 who's been up there 300 days,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.320
 and Scott Kelly made this clip to celebrate it

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.840
 by showing how you play ping pong in space.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.520
 And what they do is, they have these little bats

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.200
 that are built to move water.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.240
 And so this is just as a practical thing in space.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.160
 And so what they do is they play ping pong

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.040
 using a droplet of water,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.880
 and you just hit a droplet of water over,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.680
 and it heads that way, and then you hit it back.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.640
 He was playing on his own.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.760
 I don't think it's caught on as again, yeah.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.600
 Up in the ISS.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.280
 But while I saw I was watching this video,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.040
 it was really interesting,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.720
 'cause he's playing, and he's talking about it,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.240
 and I noticed as I was watching it,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.840
 that he's wearing a belt.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.280
 And I'm like, why are you wearing a belt in space?

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.800
 That's not going anywhere, so I Googled it,

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.800
 and I was looking why wear a belt in space,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.560
 and it turns out you wear a belt in space

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.800
 to stop your trousers from falling up.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.840
 And we need to move on to our next fact in a second.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.880
 Anyone got anything else before we do?

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.400
 Just one last thing on Mike Brown,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.960
 the astronomer at the centre of all of this.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.080
 I just love the title of his 2010 book on the whole matter.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.920
 It is how I killed Pluto, and why it had it coming.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.920
 (audience laughing)

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.680
 Okay, it's time for our second fact of the show,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.320
 and that is James Harkin.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.960
 Okay, my fact this week is that the first use

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.880
 of the word snowmageddon came in the same press release

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.000
 as the first apology for the use of the word snowmageddon.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.040
 (audience laughing)

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.400
 Because of all the snow in America,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.760
 I thought I'd see like the history of snowmageddon.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.280
 And I found a use in 2008,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.520
 it was a press release from the Canadian government,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.360
 and they said about how it snowmageddon,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.400
 and then right at the end in a very Canadian way,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.480
 they say, "We're sorry, we're not trying to take the mickey

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.080
 "and say that it's not very important.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.880
 "It is important, sorry about snowmageddon."

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.240
 No, we're really sorry, really.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.240
 (audience laughing)

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.080
 And then the snowmageddon was kind of not used that much

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.360
 for a couple of years, and then in 2008 and in 2010,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.440
 they had a massive storm in Washington, DC,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.560
 and that's when snowmageddon really took off.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.400
 Right.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.560
 And according to Wikipedia, there was a few other things,

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.560
 snowzilla within a few hours of snowmageddon,

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.040
 and apparently that storm also popularized the term

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.680
 Kaiser Snowze.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.720
 (audience laughing)

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.440
 This latest storm, it's produced a thing,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.760
 'cause you guys I'm sure have all seen

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.880
 all the enormous snowfall in the East Coast of America,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.520
 it's been thunder snow is what's been produced.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.400
 Oh yeah, 'cause Scott Kelly tweeted it.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.560
 Scott Kelly, who is on the International Space Station,

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.360
 I think that was how we found out,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.920
 or he, very early on when it was happening,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.320
 he tweeted thunder snow,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.920
 and 'cause he's obviously such an knowledgeable guy,

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.480
 he said, "This is unbelievably rare by the way, guys."

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.720
 And it's even more rare that I'm seeing it

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.960
 from the other side of it.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.480
 (audience laughing)

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.240
 We had super rare, isn't it, thunder snow?

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.480
 Yeah, so it's where a storm, instead of producing rain,

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.200
 produces snow, 'cause of the different way

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.760
 the air rubs together or something.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.280
 (audience laughing)

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.560
 It's some naughty bullshit that we're not gonna give the time to.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.280
 I think when a cloud produces snow instead of rain,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.800
 it's usually just 'cause it's cold.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.240
 (audience laughing)

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.680
 You can blind me with all the meteorology like this.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.600
 (audience laughing)

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.440
 I read today, I had no idea about this,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.520
 so it's snow's on Mars.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.040
 So it's not your classics, no.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.800
 It's not your like, it's not like snow,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.640
 but they call it like it's kind of like a snow cold

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.040
 that falls from the sky, exactly.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.760
 So the Mars rover was looking up, don't know why,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.840
 it was just looking up and it could see this snow coming down

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.800
 and it was having all time.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.800
 (audience laughing)

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.640
 Wow, wow, wow, wow.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.280
 (audience laughing)

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.720
 But so Mars has the craziest of atmospheres.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.400
 There's spots in Mars, in the st,

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.760
 this was the article that I was reading,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.280
 and told me this, if you stood in a certain spot of Mars,

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.000
 your feet could be 21 degrees,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.040
 but your chest would be zero degrees.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.960
 That's how the difference between,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.440
 down there, so I'm curious.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.240
 There's so little atmosphere here to get out of the atmosphere,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.480
 you have to go really, really high,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.080
 but there by your chest, you wouldn't be in the atmosphere anymore.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.640
 So it'd be really, really cold.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.640
 Actually speaking of hot and cold,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.600
 I was reading, so something that's happening

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.920
 to go back to space news is the Keppler Space Telescope

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.160
 that was sent out a few years ago as do you back

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.240
 or back this year, I think.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.440
 And so that's found tons of new planets.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.520
 And one of the planets it's found

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.560
 is it's a planet called Glieze 581c.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.560
 And what NASA says about that is, so it's tidally locked.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.920
 So that basically means that it doesn't really rotate.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.040
 So half of it is, one half of it is scorching hot,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.760
 while the other half is constantly frozen.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.560
 It is believed to be the best candidate for human expansion.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.760
 So the current storms in America,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.920
 there is a guy who's capitalizing on the moment.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.600
 He started it last year.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.720
 It's a business called shipsnoyo.com.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.120
 He's called Kyle Wearing.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.720
 And you can buy snow in a box from him.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.720
 And he sends it over, and he keeps it cool.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.320
 And NASA makes sure it doesn't melt.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.920
 He packs it in--

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.920
 It's like an inesky.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.440
 He packs it in an inesky, yeah, so it doesn't over.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.080
 And that is an Australian word for like a fridge.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.280
 Yeah, it's like really.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.520
 It's like if you're going to the beach,

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.920
 and you're bringing some bottles, and you're just going

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.560
 to sit there and down some tunis, it's that kind of thing.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.200
 It's weird, because when the Australian comes out

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.600
 and you put it there, it really comes out.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.320
 I'm an Aussie by the way, I just can't sound it.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.480
 So there's a story just quickly following up on this.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.280
 He offers-- by the time your eskies arrived

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.440
 and your snow's melted, he offers you a refund,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.040
 and you'll send you a whole new batch of snow.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.480
 There's also someone cap-like.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.800
 So quite a few people have made it,

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.920
 even though a lot of people are in serious trouble.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.600
 A lot of people actually are quite comfortable

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.560
 and having a lot of fun with it.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.200
 People are making bars out of the snow,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.480
 and serving drinks there.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.920
 Yeah, they sold tons of extra booze, didn't they?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.680
 As soon as they knew the storm was coming,

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.680
 they just went to the shops and bars,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.960
 much booze as they could possibly get.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.200
 And that's someone on Airbnb put up an igloo

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.680
 that they've built for $10 a night, you can rent the igloo.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.800
 You've got to bring your own sleeping bag.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.320
 But it's suddenly-- so since reading the article,

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.200
 it's been updated, the article, and it's now

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.320
 no longer on Airbnb.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.360
 They're not sure if it was banned or if it melted.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.680
 One of the two.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.960
 So on naming storms, this storm doesn't need a name.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.560
 And the weather channel, I think, is again the US weather channel.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.720
 So why doesn't it need a name?

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.480
 Because of that.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.120
 The only name.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.440
 So a snowstorm is not a finite thing.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.840
 It's just, I think, one meteorologist I was reading

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.720
 said it's just an extension of normal weather.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.600
 So something like that.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.760
 Everything's just an extension of normal.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.360
 There's no supernatural weather, which--

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.120
 No, something like a cyclone has a very finite start and finish.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.120
 Oh, I see.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.840
 You can be quite exactly when we're starting exactly when it finish.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.880
 So they need names, but storms don't.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.400
 But the weather channel has announced

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.080
 the storm names for 2016.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.880
 And they are things like Ajax.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.640
 So there's going to be a storm called Ajax.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.040
 Kyla.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.960
 Quo, as in status.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.960
 And Zandor, Wailon, and Yolo.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.800
 Storm Yolo.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.680
 Have you been killed by Storm Yolo?

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.480
 Well, you want me to die once.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.960
 There's a paper in Canada that came out this week

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.320
 that warned people against eating snow.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.920
 Because apparently, snow is really

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.160
 good at collecting bits from the car exhausts

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.200
 or bits of toxins from the air.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.320
 Snow is really, really good at picking it up.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.720
 And so if you kind of take a little bit of scoop of snow

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.200
 from the ground, like a lot of people do,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.240
 and just kind of eat some of it, like everyone does, yeah?

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.560
 It's snowing, tonight, we--

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:54.400
 The South Korean government, a few years ago,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.000
 made an explicit thing to people saying,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.520
 you must not eat yellow snow.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.200
 There was an actual press release saying,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.880
 you must not eat yellow snow.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.760
 And that's because they'd had this snow that had come,

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.160
 which was yellow, and it had like heavy minerals

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.120
 and stuff from some power stations.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.640
 Oh, really?

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.480
 Oh, wow.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.880
 And so that's the one reason that you should never eat yellow snow.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.920
 Minorals from power stations.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.640
 We're going to have to move on.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.720
 Just before we end, I read one thing, which

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.240
 is a new theory that's erupted this week.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.920
 Penguins, they think, may--

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.560
 I mean, there are so many qualifications in this already.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:40.120
 You can get away with saying anything at this point, though.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:49.280
 So penguins, they think, they think, may, possible.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.520
 When they're about to mate,

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.440
 they will need a nice--

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.840
 Wait, is this the thing you think this is?

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.320
 No, this is the penguins.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.200
 No, the penguins, if it's true, know it.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.200
 It's absolutely the--

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.200
 So they think that the penguins are like,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.960
 oh, we need somewhere to have a good time.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.680
 Why not here?

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.760
 But oh, it's really cold in icy and snowy.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.000
 So they'll poo on it.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.200
 And then the poo melts the snow.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.760
 And then they go, now that's where we have sex.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.960
 There's a new theory.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.840
 It's true that they poo.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.200
 I'll give you that.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.000
 Blah, blah, blah.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.800
 OK, time for fact.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.000
 Number three, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.560
 OK, my fact is that this week we have discovered

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.400
 the largest prime number ever.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.240
 We would have discovered it in September,

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.760
 but the computer which found it, forgot to tell anybody.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:44.920
 So this has happened.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.600
 So there are computers all over the world

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.400
 looking for new prime numbers.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.280
 And they're up to really enormous ones now.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.440
 And they're very useful in encrypting stuff.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.640
 Yeah, they're called GIMPS.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.520
 GIMPS, yeah.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.280
 Something massive prime internet.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.640
 Merzene, which I think--

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.040
 Merzene's prime search.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:01.840
 Yeah, Merzene.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.120
 It's Merzene primes.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.640
 So these are prime numbers named

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.560
 after a French guy called Merzene.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.480
 And you can download a computer program onto your computer.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.280
 And it will look for these prime numbers.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.520
 And if you find one, then you get like 100 grand

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.320
 or something like that, $100,000.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.120
 And everyone, a lot of people have put it

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.800
 onto the computer, but the people

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.680
 who found it this week or last year or whatever it was,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.840
 they have so much computer processing power

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.560
 that they've managed to find loads of them.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.400
 Right.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.040
 Yeah, I think they found like four of the last five

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.560
 or something like that, right?

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.480
 Yeah.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.160
 So the new one, I'm going to read this out from here.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.280
 The new number is 5 million digits

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.320
 longer than the previous largest one.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:47.160
 It's 2 to the power of 74 million, 207,281.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.520
 All of that minus one.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.520
 Yeah.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.280
 And if you were going to write it out

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.800
 and you could write 10 digits in four seconds,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.120
 this is a calculation by a New York Times correspondent,

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.800
 it would take you three months without slowing down.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.320
 Yeah.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.360
 It's got 22 million digits in it.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.360
 Like my phone.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:15.600
 It starts 3-0-0-3-7-6-4-1.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.720
 It starts up.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:24.040
 And then it ends 0-0-7-3-3-9-10-8-6-4-3-6-3-5-1.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.520
 And for people at home--

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.680
 So you've just given away the ending.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.680
 There's no point reading the middle now.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.240
 For people at home, we edited out the other 22 million,

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.440
 I just didn't say.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.880
 And you can download the actual number

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.960
 and get it on your computer and have a look through it,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.600
 which I did.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.120
 Look great.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.920
 It contains my six-digit code to access

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.960
 my bank account.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.720
 Oh, James, don't say that.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.480
 And people will know.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.760
 It contains it 21 times.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.760
 Wow.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.280
 That's how big this number is.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.840
 It contains my library number twice.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.680
 And at one stage, it has 8/7s in a row.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.760
 So I'm just giving you the edited highlights here.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:10.040
 I was watching an interview with the guy who discovered it,

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.440
 or rather the guy who set the computer up that discovered it.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.840
 And there was a moment that, like, this is amazing.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.360
 There's the big new prime number.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.960
 It's beyond any that we've had before.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.880
 What can we do with it?

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.160
 And he was like, we have no idea.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:20.880
 Literally nothing.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.640
 It has no point.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.440
 There's no problem.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.560
 So most of them can be used for encrypting things on computers.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:25.840
 Yeah.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.600
 Unfortunately, this one is now such a global celebrity

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.720
 that it will be noticed immediately by hackers.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.480
 So if you have a clean, there's several million digits on.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.720
 The thing is, you use prime numbers in encryption

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.160
 by taking two prime numbers, multiplying them together,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.640
 and then it's finding the factors of that secondary number.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.920
 Now, if you have a number which has got 23, 24 million digits in,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.240
 you know that one of them must be this number.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.920
 So everyone knows that it must be this one.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.480
 So it's really easy to crack.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.880
 So the only time this will be useful

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.440
 is when we get some even bigger numbers that we can use.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.720
 Which we will do one day.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.920
 Yeah.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.800
 I'd never heard prime numbers described like this,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.280
 but they're the building blocks of maths, really.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.680
 And they're the equivalent of atoms in science,

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.560
 because prime numbers are, because nothing goes into them,

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.200
 and everything else is a factor of something else.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.280
 So everything else can be split up.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.720
 You can't split up a prime number.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.080
 Well, they were equivalent of an atom.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.920
 And something else I didn't know about prime numbers,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.800
 because you think they're kind of so randomly distributed.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.320
 If we've taken this long to work out what the pattern is,

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.480
 is that all prime numbers, if you square them,

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.040
 are a multiple of 24, and then adding one.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.080
 Now, you can just run that down.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.160
 Not the really small one.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.400
 No one's under fire.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.560
 Not the number of prime numbers.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.400
 Anything over five.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.520
 Seven is, oh god, we're going to go through them all.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.960
 11 is 13 is 17.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.320
 11 is.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.400
 Yeah, so they found this using the GIMPS software.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.840
 And this is the weird thing about GIMPS is,

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:07.200
 if you go up to Google and type the word GIMPS into Google,

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.280
 all of the first five things that you get

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.000
 are about this prime number thing.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.600
 The same is not true of Google images.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:19.400
 This is amazing.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.120
 So cicadas, you know, there's that kind of cicada in North America,

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.240
 which only comes up to the surface.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.640
 Every 17 years.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.200
 Well, it's every prime number of years.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.960
 So in some places, it's every 13 years.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.440
 In some places, every 17 years.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.680
 In some places, another prime number of years.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.840
 And which sounds ridiculous.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.160
 But it was hypothesized in the article I read that actually

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:40.880
 does make sense.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.280
 Because if you come up in a prime number of years,

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.560
 you have the least chance of coinciding with predators,

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.000
 which also have, like, periodical patterns.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.720
 Because so, let's say you come up every eight years,

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.440
 then if you're hunted by a panther that appears every two years,

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.880
 then they're going to bump into you a lot.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.360
 But if you're coming up every prime number of years,

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.080
 then you're not going to bump into predators

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.200
 every prime number of years.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.760
 Do you think there's just a car that comes up every two

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.440
 to the 74 million years?

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.880
 And the only reason we haven't seen it is because, you know,

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.600
 you'd be pretty lucky to see that one, you know.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.120
 Yeah.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.400
 I don't know what a cicada is.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.440
 It's a little insect.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:14.960
 It's OK.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.480
 Look at that.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.480
 Yeah, like a cricket.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.000
 Got it.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.680
 Cicada fact, there's only one cicada in the UK.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.520
 One species of cicada.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.280
 Oh.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.280
 One.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.680
 The cicada.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.080
 Lonesome Trevor.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.200
 There's only one species of cicada in the UK.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.040
 It's called the New Forest cicada.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.800
 And we think they live in the New Forest,

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.560
 where they might have died out, because no one's seen one

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.720
 for about 10 years.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.080
 And you should be able to hear the call,

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.080
 but you can't really hear it because it's outside

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.520
 of human hearing range.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.280
 But you can buy an app.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.600
 And the app can hear the cicada call.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.400
 And so you can walk around the New Forest

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.080
 with your app listening for cicadas.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.440
 And then if you find one, then you'll

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.840
 have discovered that they still exist.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.360
 Wow.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:53.840
 That'd be cool.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.440
 That's right.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.280
 Yeah.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.120
 Yeah.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.800
 So I didn't find any prime number stuff.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.280
 I started looking into numbers of the week.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.960
 And there's a very famous set of numbers now.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.000
 This is going to be a long list.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.440
 Now, six.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.840
 Now there was this week, a set of numbers,

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.280
 which was, there was this massive lotto,

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.480
 the big lottery draw that went.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.920
 And there was a story about this lady who

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.000
 thinks she's won the lottery.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.360
 She's found the ticker that she's won with all the numbers.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.000
 But the barcode is missing.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.560
 She put it in the washing machine, didn't she?

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.880
 Yeah, she put it in the washing machine.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.680
 It's missing.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.320
 It's one of those things where you think

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.040
 that must be the worst situation, right?

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.640
 That you've won the lottery.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.000
 And now you've not won it, because you've lost the thing.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.600
 That's all I was looking into is that genuinely

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.440
 the worst situation anyone's had in the lottery.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.440
 And I found a guy that I think contends.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.440
 Oh, really?

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.440
 Yeah.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.440
 This guy won the lottery.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.440
 OK.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.120
 But this is what led up to him winning the lottery.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.560
 His name is Franz Seller.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.560
 He was born in Croatia.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.560
 He was a teacher.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.880
 He was born in 1929.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.840
 In 1962, his train derailed and plunged into an icy river.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.840
 And he managed to escape and not die.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.040
 The next year in 1963, while flying,

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.160
 the door blew out, and he got sucked out of the way.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.160
 And he survived.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:03.640
 Oh, good.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.640
 It was all good.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.040
 Three years later, 1966, he's riding on a bunge.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:08.960
 That's sort of what?

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.640
 He's riding on a bunge.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.320
 It's Australia.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.400
 It's an Australian term.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.960
 He's riding on a bunge, right?

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.480
 Whatever you do, don't check that verb,

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.480
 a dictionary when you get on a bunge.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.200
 So he's riding on a bus and the bus suddenly.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.680
 The bus plunges into a river.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.200
 So that's, he gets out and survived.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.480
 So this is 1962, 1963, 1966.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.040
 1970, he must take no public transport by the way.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:39.560
 Exactly.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.400
 He's in his car.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.600
 Oh, no.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.440
 He's in his car.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.600
 And it just blows up in flames.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.520
 So he escapes.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.440
 And he's all right.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.360
 So that's 1970, 1973.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.240
 He's still weary of public transport.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.280
 In his car, once again, another fire blows up in his car,

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.200
 loses all his hair.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.600
 It manages us to make it out.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.920
 There's a whole nice period between 1973 and 1995

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.000
 when nothing happens.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.600
 But he stayed at home, then I guess.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.520
 But then he went out and got hit by a bus.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.760
 So that's 1995.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.800
 Then in 1996, 1996, he's back in his car.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.640
 He drove and another, either it was a truck or a car,

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.640
 is coming towards him.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.680
 He swirves away.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.000
 He manages to escape his car as it plunges over a cliff,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.200
 lands in a tree, and then the car goes 300 feet down

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.080
 and breaks into a nicey river.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.560
 And in 2003, he won the lotto.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.800
 1 million.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.280
 That's divine justice.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.000
 That's amazing.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.280
 I think that's worse than losing your ticket and not winning.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.600
 There was a couple.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.840
 There were two other very bad lottery stories.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.720
 So one couple-- I think this was actually last year--

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.560
 Edwin and David Neillan, who had a lotto app.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.400
 And they got the right numbers.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.720
 And they sent them off in the app.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.840
 And they'd won 35 million pounds.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.480
 And the app broke.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.000
 And it failed.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.640
 So they had the photographic evidence

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.080
 that they tried to send it on the app.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.920
 And it only sent it after the deadline

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.440
 because they ran out of signals.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.600
 Oh, I've been using their phone to search for cicada noises

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.600
 in New Forest.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.520
 OK, let's move on to our final fact of the show.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.800
 And that is Chazinsky.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.200
 Yes, my fact is that in a press release

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.240
 about the new English language test

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.120
 for migrants, the British government misspelled the word

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.120
 language.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.120
 But yeah, this has been a big story over the last few weeks.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.680
 There's the new test for migrants.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.360
 And there's lots of controversy.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.200
 And even if they're on spousal visas,

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.680
 if they fail these language tests,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.160
 they might be made to leave the country.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.320
 And it turns out the people who are releasing the press release

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.640
 spell language with the A and the U the wrong way around.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.400
 There's a very snotty reply from the government.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.920
 The Prime Minister's official spokesman

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.440
 said, "All of us are open to mistakes at times.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.440
 The Prime Minister is fully confident that his team

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.800
 speak English competently."

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.840
 Touched a bit of a nerve.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.440
 I went through-- I basically haven't researched that much of this,

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.800
 because I just went through trying to find mistakes

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.040
 in all government--

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:12.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.720
 --it's all legislation over the last 50 years.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.400
 No, I went-- well, first of all, the independent put together

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.720
 a list of 10 questions that are taken from the government's list

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.240
 of possible migrant language questions.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.920
 And here's the independence introduction to the questions.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.960
 Listen to this sentence.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.880
 The questions below have been taken from practice exams

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.720
 for the B1 test that those who need to prove their knowledge

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.680
 of the English language to gain their indefinite leave

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.440
 to remain--

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.560
 Whoa!

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.840
 Oh, it's like a cliffhanger of a sentence.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.040
 And then-- so one of the questions is maybe I'm wrong about this,

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.920
 but it's multiple choice questions.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.760
 And it is a completely under this sentence.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.960
 So one of them is, have you finished with the newspaper

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.000
 and its ABCD and the options are--

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.640
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.480
 Is this the game--

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.880
 Tell citizenship.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's against citizenship.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.640
 You have to say whether you've finished with the newspaper.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.280
 That's the only criteria.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.680
 Just give the freaking newspaper back.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.880
 You can come in the country.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.360
 No, it's have you finished with the newspaper,

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.160
 and then it's what is the grammatically correct ending

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160
 to the sentence.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.680
 Have you finished with the newspaper now still yet,

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.000
 or already?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.080
 Now, the answer they want, and I did the test,

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.760
 yet is the answer they want, already, is completely correct.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.240
 Yeah, if you want to be really passive-aggressive about it.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.680
 Yeah, you can say, have you finished with that newspaper

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.480
 already?

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.680
 No, it's not that.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.160
 It's not that.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.280
 It's the opposite of that.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.880
 So they want you to fall into the trap of the American.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.920
 Have you finished with the newspaper already?

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.080
 But you could also just ask the valid question,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.080
 have you finished with the newspaper already?

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.920
 Hasn't have you read it that fast?

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.440
 Have you finished with the newspaper already?

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.880
 Oh, you could also--

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.880
 You could also passive-aggressive, is they?

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.360
 Well, have you finished with the newspaper now?

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.280
 What more brutish than that?

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.880
 It doesn't make any sense.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.920
 That's what it probably is.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.840
 Yeah.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.120
 So my wife, who's Russian, she will have

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.440
 to take these tests quite soon.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.680
 And she was trying out some questions

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.400
 from the citizenship test, which is like a general knowledge

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.680
 test, and she tried them out on me.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.200
 And literally, I got none of them right.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:17.720
 Really?

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.920
 And my general knowledge is not bad.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.880
 It's all right.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.280
 I have brought a long one to test you,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.840
 because I think your general knowledge is quite good.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.320
 OK.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.520
 Well, one of the ones that she was asked in the practice test

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.160
 was, what is a national dish of whales?

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.160
 Oh!

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.960
 Well, coal.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.760
 Oh.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.280
 Oh, coal.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:34.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.200
 Cool.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.760
 Well, you might think that according to the government.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.440
 Well, exactly.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.760
 But according to the government, it's Welsh cakes.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.560
 Oh, god.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.240
 Sorry, fellas.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.240
 Sorry, guys.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:50.120
 The whole office will be sending around.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:50.640
 Ah, yeah.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.480
 Well, of case.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.760
 Yeah, probably Welsh cakes.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.400
 But the other thing is, if I want to become a citizen of Russia,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.680
 I would have to take a Russian language test.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.600
 And the Russian language test has all the normal things

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.640
 that you would expect.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:08.520
 But you also have to be able to interpret hidden meanings.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.840
 Wow.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.760
 That's cool.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.160
 That's cool.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.160
 You know, Bill Bryson released a new book, The Road to Little

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.560
 Dribbling, and it's all in the beginning.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.840
 He talks about taking a test to become a British citizen.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.960
 He decided to become it.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.720
 And he was saying that not only are there mistakes in the test,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.080
 but in the books that guide you into how to take the test

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.080
 are just completely filled with mistakes.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.240
 One that he pointed out was they were talking about Anthony Hopkins

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.000
 and saying that he's someone to be proud of as a British person.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.920
 He's someone to be proud of.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.240
 They spelt his name wrong.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.600
 And also, he's taken up American citizenship.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.440
 He's not a British anymore.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.400
 Tina Turner is Swiss now.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.200
 Ishi.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:47.960
 Yep.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.960
 Wow.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.800
 So I was looking into the news for other language mess ups

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.720
 over the last week.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.120
 And I found one that happened in Sweden.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.920
 They were having their parliament, a political debate

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.360
 about very serious issues, actually.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.800
 It was like a really long debate.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.320
 They made a mistake, though, of when they transmitted it,

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.600
 they put the wrong subtitles onto the debate.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.240
 So you had guys like Jean Borgland,

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.120
 who's the Minister of Education, looking really serious,

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.680
 saying something really serious, but the subtitles reading,

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.400
 "I will build the best sancasel in the calendar."

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.600
 I vote for him.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.400
 And then you had Stefan Loffan, the prime minister,

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.960
 the prime minister, going the latest invention,

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.080
 the fantastic dinosaur submarine.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.880
 And then the Minister for Environment, going,

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.200
 "Greetings, Earth Creatures."

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.840
 I have two pairs of boots, one red pair,

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.880
 and one yellow pair.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.000
 Which one should I take?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.280
 I'm going to ask my dolls.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.680
 Well, I don't know where they got those original subtitles.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.640
 Yeah, it was a cartoon animation.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.080
 Oh, that sounds great.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.080
 It sounds great, isn't it?

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.760
 You know that Godzilla has just been awarded Japanese citizenship.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.560
 I was done as a press PR stunt, obviously.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.080
 But it was a particular district of Tokyo

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.840
 that he got in Shinjuku, which is a very cool, extremely busy one.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.960
 I think that's-- it's very near the famous crossing in Tokyo.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.000
 Shibuya crossing.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.600
 But they released the certificate, which they'd done.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.120
 And it said, "Previous visits to Shinjuku Ward 3."

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.040
 Godzilla, 1984.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.720
 Godzilla versus King Gidora, 1991.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.800
 And Godzilla Millennium, 1999.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.000
 Those were his trips.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.280
 Very good.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.560
 We're going to have to wrap up in a sec.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.160
 So yeah, anything you want to--

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.440
 Just as you know, to get South Korean citizenship,

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.600
 the test requires you to sing the first four verses

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.720
 of the national anthem.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.840
 Sing it in tune.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:52.600
 Wow.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.440
 Yeah.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.840
 That's a tough gig, isn't it?

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.040
 And the Dutch citizenship, you have to watch a video

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.240
 that includes beach nudity.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:00.760
 What?

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.760
 Where's the film?

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.120
 What does he want?

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.280
 I'll do it even if they don't give me Dutch nudity.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.400
 It's become such a liberal country they

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.880
 want to show you what to expect if you come to the Netherlands.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.920
 Like if people come from other countries

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.080
 that are a bit more conservative,

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.960
 they might turn up into the Netherlands

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.560
 and think, wow, what's going on here?

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.800
 Beach nudity.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.160
 So they want to show it so that you're not

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.520
 shocked when you see it in real life.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.960
 So can you feel that?

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.840
 Is it like if you get an erection, or are you crying then?

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.880
 You want both, you want both.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.800
 Feelings are confusing, isn't it?

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.240
 I'm kidding.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.000
 That's it.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.720
 I'll do it.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.760
 I'll do it all day.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.120
 That's all of our facts.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.840
 [APPLAUSE]

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.640
 Thank you so much for listening.
