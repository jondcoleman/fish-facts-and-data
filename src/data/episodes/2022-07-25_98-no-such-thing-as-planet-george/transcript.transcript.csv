00:00:02,00:00:05,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:05,00:00:08,(blues music)
00:00:08,00:00:13,(cheering)
00:00:13,00:00:16,(cheering)
00:00:16,00:00:19,"And welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing"""
00:00:19,00:00:22,"as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:22,00:00:24,from the Up the Creek Comedy Club in Greenwich.
00:00:24,00:00:25,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:25,00:00:27,"I'm sitting here next to Anna Chazinski,"
00:00:27,00:00:29,Andy Murray and James Harkin.
00:00:29,00:00:31,"Once again, we have sat around the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:34,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:34,00:00:37,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:39,"Okay, time for fact number one,"
00:00:39,00:00:40,and that's my fact.
00:00:40,00:00:42,My fact this week is that even though we're not sure
00:00:42,00:00:45,"it exists, the new planet, planet number nine,"
00:00:45,00:00:48,is the most planetary planet of all the planets.
00:00:48,00:00:50,(laughing)
00:00:50,00:00:54,So this is a major discovery that we found.
00:00:54,00:00:55,"- Yeah, a new planet."
00:00:55,00:00:56,"- Oh, it didn't find."
00:00:56,00:00:57,"- Oh, it didn't find."
00:00:57,00:00:58,"Either way, it's big news."
00:00:58,00:01:01,"- Yeah, we think it exists because of computer modeling."
00:01:01,00:01:03,They've modeled the solar system.
00:01:03,00:01:05,They think this thing exists.
00:01:05,00:01:06,It's absolutely massive.
00:01:06,00:01:09,And one thing that is very important with planets
00:01:09,00:01:12,is that it clears out the area of its orbit.
00:01:12,00:01:14,So the round to other things going round with it.
00:01:14,00:01:16,"And they think according to their calculations,"
00:01:16,00:01:18,this planet has done that more than any other planet.
00:01:18,00:01:20,And that's what makes it the most planetary planet
00:01:20,00:01:21,of all the planets.
00:01:21,00:01:24,"According to the guy who discovered it,"
00:01:24,00:01:26,"or one of the two guys who discovered it, Doctor Brown."
00:01:26,00:01:27,- Right.
00:01:27,00:01:29,"- So a planet, a planet is a planet"
00:01:29,00:01:31,that no other things want to be close to.
00:01:31,00:01:32,"Really, right?"
00:01:32,00:01:33,"- Well, that's the case."
00:01:33,00:01:35,Then I and I have landed a planet.
00:01:35,00:01:38,(laughing)
00:01:38,00:01:39,- I read a description of it
00:01:39,00:01:42,that it was almost certain to be a fifth member
00:01:42,00:01:45,of the Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune quartet.
00:01:45,00:01:46,So it's like the fifth beetle.
00:01:46,00:01:49,But it's like the fifth beetle was cast into deep space.
00:01:49,00:01:50,(laughing)
00:01:50,00:01:52,"Yeah, the really cool thing about the new planet"
00:01:52,00:01:54,is you may have seen this in the news.
00:01:54,00:01:55,"The man who discovered it,"
00:01:55,00:01:57,"one of the two guys who wrote the paper on it,"
00:01:57,00:02:00,is the same man who killed Pluto.
00:02:00,00:02:01,- Yeah.
00:02:01,00:02:03,"- So it's like Brown, that is."
00:02:03,00:02:05,- It's like a grudge match.
00:02:05,00:02:05,(laughing)
00:02:05,00:02:06,It's so exciting.
00:02:06,00:02:08,- His Twitter account is @PlutoKiller.
00:02:08,00:02:09,"- Yeah, isn't it?"
00:02:09,00:02:10,- No.
00:02:10,00:02:11,"- It's actually, yeah."
00:02:11,00:02:12,"- And he says he still gets,"
00:02:12,00:02:17,"he gets abuse from, he gets letters"
00:02:17,00:02:20,and obscene phone calls from people who miss Pluto.
00:02:20,00:02:22,(laughing)
00:02:22,00:02:24,"He said, these are his exact words."
00:02:24,00:02:28,"He said, I got hate mail from young children for many years."
00:02:28,00:02:29,(laughing)
00:02:29,00:02:30,And he doesn't get any more now
00:02:30,00:02:31,because young children these days know
00:02:31,00:02:33,that Pluto is no longer a planet.
00:02:33,00:02:35,"- Pluto was named by a child, wasn't it?"
00:02:35,00:02:35,- Was it?
00:02:35,00:02:36,- Yeah.
00:02:36,00:02:38,"- By an 11-year-old girl, Venetian,"
00:02:38,00:02:40,"I read such a nice interview with her,"
00:02:40,00:02:42,"which was about five years ago, I think,"
00:02:42,00:02:45,about how exciting it was that she'd named Pluto.
00:02:45,00:02:48,And the interview kept on asking her why she'd named it Pluto.
00:02:48,00:02:49,It was a NASA interviewer.
00:02:49,00:02:50,"The NASA interviewer said,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,"""And you thought about it because of the Greek"
00:02:52,00:02:54,and Roman mythology about Pluto being the god
00:02:54,00:02:55,"of the underworld, yes?"""
00:02:55,00:02:57,"And she'd be like, ""No, no, I don't think it was as subtle"
00:02:57,00:03:00,"as that, no, it was just the name I knew hadn't been used."""
00:03:00,00:03:02,"Okay, but it was also because the first two letters,"
00:03:02,00:03:05,"PL, have a connection with Persevalal?"
00:03:05,00:03:06,(laughing)
00:03:06,00:03:08,"No, no, I certainly didn't realize that."
00:03:08,00:03:09,I appreciate it.
00:03:09,00:03:12,(laughing)
00:03:12,00:03:14,"- Point interviewer, give me something."
00:03:14,00:03:16,- She got five pounds for that.
00:03:16,00:03:18,- But they took that five pounds off her
00:03:18,00:03:19,when they demoted it from the planet.
00:03:19,00:03:22,(laughing)
00:03:22,00:03:23,- No?
00:03:23,00:03:25,(laughing)
00:03:25,00:03:27,"- She said, she was in her late 80s when it was demoted"
00:03:27,00:03:29,and they asked her about it at the time.
00:03:29,00:03:32,"She said, ""At my age, I've been largely indifferent"
00:03:32,00:03:32,"""to the babe."""
00:03:32,00:03:35,(laughing)
00:03:35,00:03:37,- She's just saying that's a hide all the hate mail
00:03:37,00:03:39,"that she's been saving to Mike Brown, hasn't it?"
00:03:39,00:03:41,(laughing)
00:03:41,00:03:43,And so they're gonna come up with a new name for this planet
00:03:43,00:03:45,and they don't know what they're gonna call it yet.
00:03:45,00:03:48,"- So a working name is George, isn't it?"
00:03:48,00:03:49,"- Oh, is it?"
00:03:49,00:03:50,"- No, that's quite nice because we almost did have"
00:03:50,00:03:51,a planet called George.
00:03:51,00:03:53,- Uranus is called George.
00:03:53,00:03:55,"- Oh, it's called George and they said that's a ridiculous name."
00:03:55,00:03:56,(laughing)
00:03:56,00:03:58,"And then they said, ""Let's go with Uranus."""
00:03:58,00:04:00,(laughing)
00:04:00,00:04:02,- It was gonna be named George after King George III
00:04:02,00:04:04,"and then they said, ""No, why do they say"
00:04:04,00:04:05,"""no to King George III?"""
00:04:05,00:04:06,Was it after a living?
00:04:06,00:04:09,- All the other planets were named after Roman gods
00:04:09,00:04:11,and suddenly some dickhead King's gone.
00:04:11,00:04:12,"Oh, named it after me."
00:04:12,00:04:13,- No.
00:04:13,00:04:16,(laughing)
00:04:16,00:04:20,"- So Mike Brown and his friend Constantine Batigin,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,"who's the other person who's kind of found this one,"
00:04:22,00:04:26,"their working name for it is Planet Fatty, okay."
00:04:26,00:04:28,They said that they're gonna call it Planet Fatty
00:04:28,00:04:32,because it's 1990 slang for something that's cool.
00:04:32,00:04:37,But I went on to Urban Dictionary and Fatty does not mean cool.
00:04:37,00:04:42,It means something that I really cannot say on the site.
00:04:42,00:04:43,- Really?
00:04:43,00:04:45,"- Yeah, it's something very rude indeed."
00:04:45,00:04:46,- Wow.
00:04:46,00:04:47,- Fatty with a pH.
00:04:47,00:04:48,- Oh yeah.
00:04:48,00:04:50,"- So James, you think another new story"
00:04:50,00:04:51,that's gonna come up is that Pluto
00:04:51,00:04:53,is gonna be renamed to Planet?
00:04:53,00:04:54,"- I think it will do in the next couple of years, yeah."
00:04:54,00:04:55,- What?
00:04:55,00:04:58,- I think what will happen in the next couple of years is
00:04:58,00:04:59,- What?
00:04:59,00:05:01,(laughing)
00:05:01,00:05:03,- I'm gonna get a lot of hate metal for this.
00:05:03,00:05:04,(laughing)
00:05:04,00:05:05,- Give me a stamp.
00:05:05,00:05:09,I thought the thing was it's so tiny
00:05:09,00:05:10,and there are so many hundreds of other objects
00:05:10,00:05:11,which are the same size.
00:05:11,00:05:12,- So I think all the other hundreds
00:05:12,00:05:13,will get called planets as well.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"That's my guess, you know."
00:05:15,00:05:17,- So much more memorizing to do in year nine at school
00:05:17,00:05:20,is it gonna be in the end of 2000?
00:05:20,00:05:21,- No.
00:05:21,00:05:23,"- They're all the planets, well, how long have you got?"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"- I was reading about the current status of,"
00:05:26,00:05:30,Pluto's current official name is asteroid number 134-340.
00:05:30,00:05:32,- Which is a long way to the fuller now.
00:05:32,00:05:33,- Why did they call it that?
00:05:33,00:05:35,Was it 'cause it's like an asteroid?
00:05:35,00:05:38,- It's named after the ancient Greek god 134-340.
00:05:38,00:05:40,(laughing)
00:05:40,00:05:43,"- Some of the names that they maybe,"
00:05:43,00:05:45,some people have suggested names on Twitter
00:05:45,00:05:47,and whatever for this new planet.
00:05:47,00:05:51,"Minerva, Persephone, Nix, who's the goddess of the night,"
00:05:51,00:05:52,is quite a good one.
00:05:52,00:05:56,Some people have said Bowie because of the timing of that.
00:05:56,00:05:58,"And the first person to suggest this one,"
00:05:58,00:06:02,"which is my favorite, was at Ted Vogel_Wilson."
00:06:02,00:06:04,And he thinks it should be called Pluto.
00:06:04,00:06:06,(laughing)
00:06:06,00:06:07,- Very nice.
00:06:07,00:06:08,"- That's a good name, sir."
00:06:08,00:06:09,- That's very good.
00:06:09,00:06:11,"- I haven't said more puns in the sky, so."
00:06:11,00:06:12,(laughing)
00:06:12,00:06:14,"- So there's been other news this week,"
00:06:14,00:06:17,"which has been really exciting in sort of NASA news,"
00:06:17,00:06:20,"Space News, which is, I saw an article about Scott Kelly,"
00:06:20,00:06:22,"who's been up there now 300 days,"
00:06:22,00:06:25,and he was celebrating for 300 days of being in--
00:06:25,00:06:26,"- No, sorry, I'm going to wait."
00:06:26,00:06:27,- Did he really got up there?
00:06:27,00:06:29,The media is celebrating.
00:06:29,00:06:30,(laughing)
00:06:30,00:06:31,"- I'm in space, guys."
00:06:31,00:06:34,"- Well, actually, it's weird you guys bring that up."
00:06:34,00:06:37,They now factor in ordnance when astronauts go up.
00:06:37,00:06:40,"So Tim Peek, when he went out on his first ever EVA,"
00:06:40,00:06:42,"when he went outside the ship,"
00:06:42,00:06:44,"they didn't use, they used to have a really tight schedule."
00:06:44,00:06:46,"Go straight here, they now factor in time"
00:06:46,00:06:48,because any astronaut who would go outside
00:06:48,00:06:50,"would find themselves just going, oh my god,"
00:06:50,00:06:52,"I'm hanging in space, I'm looking at the planet Earth,"
00:06:52,00:06:54,and they never factored in time for that.
00:06:54,00:06:56,"So they've now given all time,"
00:06:56,00:07:01,"where you can just go, oh, and then get on with your work."
00:07:01,00:07:03,"So all time is now a thing, so it's great."
00:07:03,00:07:06,"But yeah, so he's up there, he's with this guy, Scott Kelly,"
00:07:06,00:07:08,"who's been up there 300 days,"
00:07:08,00:07:10,and Scott Kelly made this clip to celebrate it
00:07:10,00:07:12,by showing how you play ping pong in space.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"And what they do is, they have these little bats"
00:07:14,00:07:16,that are built to move water.
00:07:16,00:07:19,And so this is just as a practical thing in space.
00:07:19,00:07:21,And so what they do is they play ping pong
00:07:21,00:07:23,"using a droplet of water,"
00:07:23,00:07:24,"and you just hit a droplet of water over,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,"and it heads that way, and then you hit it back."
00:07:26,00:07:27,He was playing on his own.
00:07:27,00:07:29,"I don't think it's caught on as again, yeah."
00:07:29,00:07:31,Up in the ISS.
00:07:31,00:07:33,"But while I saw I was watching this video,"
00:07:33,00:07:34,"it was really interesting,"
00:07:34,00:07:35,"'cause he's playing, and he's talking about it,"
00:07:35,00:07:37,"and I noticed as I was watching it,"
00:07:37,00:07:38,that he's wearing a belt.
00:07:38,00:07:41,"And I'm like, why are you wearing a belt in space?"
00:07:41,00:07:44,"That's not going anywhere, so I Googled it,"
00:07:44,00:07:47,"and I was looking why wear a belt in space,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,and it turns out you wear a belt in space
00:07:49,00:07:51,to stop your trousers from falling up.
00:07:51,00:07:57,And we need to move on to our next fact in a second.
00:07:57,00:07:59,Anyone got anything else before we do?
00:07:59,00:08:01,"Just one last thing on Mike Brown,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,the astronomer at the centre of all of this.
00:08:03,00:08:07,I just love the title of his 2010 book on the whole matter.
00:08:07,00:08:10,"It is how I killed Pluto, and why it had it coming."
00:08:10,00:08:13,(audience laughing)
00:08:13,00:08:18,"Okay, it's time for our second fact of the show,"
00:08:18,00:08:20,and that is James Harkin.
00:08:20,00:08:22,"Okay, my fact this week is that the first use"
00:08:22,00:08:26,of the word snowmageddon came in the same press release
00:08:26,00:08:30,as the first apology for the use of the word snowmageddon.
00:08:30,00:08:33,(audience laughing)
00:08:33,00:08:34,"Because of all the snow in America,"
00:08:34,00:08:36,I thought I'd see like the history of snowmageddon.
00:08:36,00:08:39,"And I found a use in 2008,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,"it was a press release from the Canadian government,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,"and they said about how it snowmageddon,"
00:08:43,00:08:45,"and then right at the end in a very Canadian way,"
00:08:45,00:08:48,"they say, ""We're sorry, we're not trying to take the mickey"
00:08:48,00:08:50,"""and say that it's not very important."
00:08:50,00:08:51,"""It is important, sorry about snowmageddon."""
00:08:51,00:08:53,"No, we're really sorry, really."
00:08:53,00:08:55,(audience laughing)
00:08:55,00:08:58,And then the snowmageddon was kind of not used that much
00:08:58,00:09:02,"for a couple of years, and then in 2008 and in 2010,"
00:09:02,00:09:05,"they had a massive storm in Washington, DC,"
00:09:05,00:09:07,and that's when snowmageddon really took off.
00:09:07,00:09:08,Right.
00:09:08,00:09:10,"And according to Wikipedia, there was a few other things,"
00:09:10,00:09:13,"snowzilla within a few hours of snowmageddon,"
00:09:13,00:09:17,and apparently that storm also popularized the term
00:09:17,00:09:18,Kaiser Snowze.
00:09:18,00:09:21,(audience laughing)
00:09:21,00:09:24,"This latest storm, it's produced a thing,"
00:09:24,00:09:25,'cause you guys I'm sure have all seen
00:09:25,00:09:28,"all the enormous snowfall in the East Coast of America,"
00:09:28,00:09:32,it's been thunder snow is what's been produced.
00:09:32,00:09:35,"Oh yeah, 'cause Scott Kelly tweeted it."
00:09:35,00:09:38,"Scott Kelly, who is on the International Space Station,"
00:09:38,00:09:40,"I think that was how we found out,"
00:09:40,00:09:41,"or he, very early on when it was happening,"
00:09:41,00:09:43,"he tweeted thunder snow,"
00:09:43,00:09:44,"and 'cause he's obviously such an knowledgeable guy,"
00:09:44,00:09:47,"he said, ""This is unbelievably rare by the way, guys."""
00:09:47,00:09:49,And it's even more rare that I'm seeing it
00:09:49,00:09:50,from the other side of it.
00:09:50,00:09:52,(audience laughing)
00:09:52,00:09:54,"We had super rare, isn't it, thunder snow?"
00:09:54,00:09:56,"Yeah, so it's where a storm, instead of producing rain,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,"produces snow, 'cause of the different way"
00:09:58,00:09:59,the air rubs together or something.
00:09:59,00:10:02,(audience laughing)
00:10:02,00:10:06,It's some naughty bullshit that we're not gonna give the time to.
00:10:06,00:10:09,"I think when a cloud produces snow instead of rain,"
00:10:09,00:10:10,it's usually just 'cause it's cold.
00:10:10,00:10:12,(audience laughing)
00:10:12,00:10:14,You can blind me with all the meteorology like this.
00:10:14,00:10:16,(audience laughing)
00:10:16,00:10:18,"I read today, I had no idea about this,"
00:10:18,00:10:20,so it's snow's on Mars.
00:10:20,00:10:22,"So it's not your classics, no."
00:10:22,00:10:24,"It's not your like, it's not like snow,"
00:10:24,00:10:29,but they call it like it's kind of like a snow cold
00:10:29,00:10:31,"that falls from the sky, exactly."
00:10:31,00:10:33,"So the Mars rover was looking up, don't know why,"
00:10:33,00:10:36,it was just looking up and it could see this snow coming down
00:10:36,00:10:38,and it was having all time.
00:10:38,00:10:41,(audience laughing)
00:10:41,00:10:46,"Wow, wow, wow, wow."
00:10:46,00:10:49,(audience laughing)
00:10:49,00:10:51,But so Mars has the craziest of atmospheres.
00:10:51,00:10:53,"There's spots in Mars, in the st,"
00:10:53,00:10:54,"this was the article that I was reading,"
00:10:54,00:10:57,"and told me this, if you stood in a certain spot of Mars,"
00:10:57,00:11:00,"your feet could be 21 degrees,"
00:11:00,00:11:02,but your chest would be zero degrees.
00:11:02,00:11:03,"That's how the difference between,"
00:11:03,00:11:05,"down there, so I'm curious."
00:11:05,00:11:08,"There's so little atmosphere here to get out of the atmosphere,"
00:11:08,00:11:09,"you have to go really, really high,"
00:11:09,00:11:13,"but there by your chest, you wouldn't be in the atmosphere anymore."
00:11:13,00:11:14,"So it'd be really, really cold."
00:11:14,00:11:16,"Actually speaking of hot and cold,"
00:11:16,00:11:19,"I was reading, so something that's happening"
00:11:19,00:11:21,to go back to space news is the Keppler Space Telescope
00:11:21,00:11:24,that was sent out a few years ago as do you back
00:11:24,00:11:26,"or back this year, I think."
00:11:26,00:11:28,And so that's found tons of new planets.
00:11:28,00:11:29,And one of the planets it's found
00:11:29,00:11:32,is it's a planet called Glieze 581c.
00:11:32,00:11:36,"And what NASA says about that is, so it's tidally locked."
00:11:36,00:11:38,So that basically means that it doesn't really rotate.
00:11:38,00:11:43,"So half of it is, one half of it is scorching hot,"
00:11:43,00:11:45,while the other half is constantly frozen.
00:11:45,00:11:48,It is believed to be the best candidate for human expansion.
00:11:48,00:11:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:52,00:11:54,"So the current storms in America,"
00:11:54,00:11:56,there is a guy who's capitalizing on the moment.
00:11:56,00:11:58,He started it last year.
00:11:58,00:12:02,It's a business called shipsnoyo.com.
00:12:02,00:12:04,He's called Kyle Wearing.
00:12:04,00:12:07,And you can buy snow in a box from him.
00:12:07,00:12:09,"And he sends it over, and he keeps it cool."
00:12:09,00:12:12,And NASA makes sure it doesn't melt.
00:12:12,00:12:13,He packs it in--
00:12:13,00:12:14,It's like an inesky.
00:12:14,00:12:17,"He packs it in an inesky, yeah, so it doesn't over."
00:12:17,00:12:20,And that is an Australian word for like a fridge.
00:12:20,00:12:21,"Yeah, it's like really."
00:12:21,00:12:22,"It's like if you're going to the beach,"
00:12:22,00:12:23,"and you're bringing some bottles, and you're just going"
00:12:23,00:12:26,"to sit there and down some tunis, it's that kind of thing."
00:12:26,00:12:28,"It's weird, because when the Australian comes out"
00:12:28,00:12:31,"and you put it there, it really comes out."
00:12:31,00:12:34,"I'm an Aussie by the way, I just can't sound it."
00:12:34,00:12:36,So there's a story just quickly following up on this.
00:12:36,00:12:40,He offers-- by the time your eskies arrived
00:12:40,00:12:42,"and your snow's melted, he offers you a refund,"
00:12:42,00:12:45,and you'll send you a whole new batch of snow.
00:12:45,00:12:46,There's also someone cap-like.
00:12:46,00:12:47,"So quite a few people have made it,"
00:12:47,00:12:49,even though a lot of people are in serious trouble.
00:12:49,00:12:51,A lot of people actually are quite comfortable
00:12:51,00:12:52,and having a lot of fun with it.
00:12:52,00:12:54,"People are making bars out of the snow,"
00:12:54,00:12:55,and serving drinks there.
00:12:55,00:12:57,"Yeah, they sold tons of extra booze, didn't they?"
00:12:57,00:12:59,"As soon as they knew the storm was coming,"
00:12:59,00:13:01,"they just went to the shops and bars,"
00:13:01,00:13:03,much booze as they could possibly get.
00:13:03,00:13:06,And that's someone on Airbnb put up an igloo
00:13:06,00:13:10,"that they've built for $10 a night, you can rent the igloo."
00:13:10,00:13:12,You've got to bring your own sleeping bag.
00:13:12,00:13:15,"But it's suddenly-- so since reading the article,"
00:13:15,00:13:17,"it's been updated, the article, and it's now"
00:13:17,00:13:18,no longer on Airbnb.
00:13:18,00:13:20,They're not sure if it was banned or if it melted.
00:13:20,00:13:22,One of the two.
00:13:22,00:13:26,"So on naming storms, this storm doesn't need a name."
00:13:26,00:13:29,"And the weather channel, I think, is again the US weather channel."
00:13:29,00:13:30,So why doesn't it need a name?
00:13:30,00:13:31,Because of that.
00:13:31,00:13:32,The only name.
00:13:32,00:13:34,So a snowstorm is not a finite thing.
00:13:34,00:13:36,"It's just, I think, one meteorologist I was reading"
00:13:36,00:13:39,said it's just an extension of normal weather.
00:13:39,00:13:41,So something like that.
00:13:41,00:13:43,Everything's just an extension of normal.
00:13:43,00:13:46,"There's no supernatural weather, which--"
00:13:46,00:13:50,"No, something like a cyclone has a very finite start and finish."
00:13:50,00:13:51,"Oh, I see."
00:13:51,00:13:53,You can be quite exactly when we're starting exactly when it finish.
00:13:53,00:13:56,"So they need names, but storms don't."
00:13:56,00:13:59,But the weather channel has announced
00:13:59,00:14:02,the storm names for 2016.
00:14:02,00:14:04,And they are things like Ajax.
00:14:04,00:14:06,So there's going to be a storm called Ajax.
00:14:06,00:14:08,Kyla.
00:14:08,00:14:09,"Quo, as in status."
00:14:09,00:14:14,"And Zandor, Wailon, and Yolo."
00:14:14,00:14:15,Storm Yolo.
00:14:15,00:14:19,Have you been killed by Storm Yolo?
00:14:19,00:14:22,"Well, you want me to die once."
00:14:22,00:14:25,There's a paper in Canada that came out this week
00:14:25,00:14:29,that warned people against eating snow.
00:14:29,00:14:30,"Because apparently, snow is really"
00:14:30,00:14:35,good at collecting bits from the car exhausts
00:14:35,00:14:37,or bits of toxins from the air.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"Snow is really, really good at picking it up."
00:14:39,00:14:41,And so if you kind of take a little bit of scoop of snow
00:14:41,00:14:43,"from the ground, like a lot of people do,"
00:14:43,00:14:46,"and just kind of eat some of it, like everyone does, yeah?"
00:14:46,00:14:47,"It's snowing, tonight, we--"
00:14:47,00:14:54,"The South Korean government, a few years ago,"
00:14:54,00:14:57,"made an explicit thing to people saying,"
00:14:57,00:14:59,you must not eat yellow snow.
00:14:59,00:15:01,"There was an actual press release saying,"
00:15:01,00:15:02,you must not eat yellow snow.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"And that's because they'd had this snow that had come,"
00:15:04,00:15:07,"which was yellow, and it had like heavy minerals"
00:15:07,00:15:09,and stuff from some power stations.
00:15:09,00:15:09,"Oh, really?"
00:15:09,00:15:10,"Oh, wow."
00:15:10,00:15:14,And so that's the one reason that you should never eat yellow snow.
00:15:14,00:15:17,Minorals from power stations.
00:15:17,00:15:20,We're going to have to move on.
00:15:20,00:15:22,"Just before we end, I read one thing, which"
00:15:22,00:15:25,is a new theory that's erupted this week.
00:15:25,00:15:27,"Penguins, they think, may--"
00:15:27,00:15:32,"I mean, there are so many qualifications in this already."
00:15:32,00:15:40,"You can get away with saying anything at this point, though."
00:15:40,00:15:49,"So penguins, they think, they think, may, possible."
00:15:49,00:15:51,"When they're about to mate,"
00:15:51,00:15:54,they will need a nice--
00:15:54,00:15:56,"Wait, is this the thing you think this is?"
00:15:56,00:15:58,"No, this is the penguins."
00:15:58,00:16:00,"No, the penguins, if it's true, know it."
00:16:00,00:16:02,It's absolutely the--
00:16:02,00:16:04,"So they think that the penguins are like,"
00:16:04,00:16:05,"oh, we need somewhere to have a good time."
00:16:05,00:16:06,Why not here?
00:16:06,00:16:09,"But oh, it's really cold in icy and snowy."
00:16:09,00:16:11,So they'll poo on it.
00:16:11,00:16:13,And then the poo melts the snow.
00:16:13,00:16:16,"And then they go, now that's where we have sex."
00:16:16,00:16:17,There's a new theory.
00:16:17,00:16:19,It's true that they poo.
00:16:19,00:16:22,I'll give you that.
00:16:22,00:16:23,"Blah, blah, blah."
00:16:23,00:16:24,"OK, time for fact."
00:16:24,00:16:28,"Number three, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:16:28,00:16:30,"OK, my fact is that this week we have discovered"
00:16:30,00:16:32,the largest prime number ever.
00:16:32,00:16:34,"We would have discovered it in September,"
00:16:34,00:16:36,"but the computer which found it, forgot to tell anybody."
00:16:36,00:16:44,So this has happened.
00:16:44,00:16:46,So there are computers all over the world
00:16:46,00:16:48,looking for new prime numbers.
00:16:48,00:16:50,And they're up to really enormous ones now.
00:16:50,00:16:52,And they're very useful in encrypting stuff.
00:16:52,00:16:53,"Yeah, they're called GIMPS."
00:16:53,00:16:55,"GIMPS, yeah."
00:16:55,00:16:58,Something massive prime internet.
00:16:58,00:16:59,"Merzene, which I think--"
00:16:59,00:17:01,Merzene's prime search.
00:17:01,00:17:01,"Yeah, Merzene."
00:17:01,00:17:03,It's Merzene primes.
00:17:03,00:17:04,So these are prime numbers named
00:17:04,00:17:06,after a French guy called Merzene.
00:17:06,00:17:10,And you can download a computer program onto your computer.
00:17:10,00:17:12,And it will look for these prime numbers.
00:17:12,00:17:14,"And if you find one, then you get like 100 grand"
00:17:14,00:17:17,"or something like that, $100,000."
00:17:17,00:17:19,"And everyone, a lot of people have put it"
00:17:19,00:17:20,"onto the computer, but the people"
00:17:20,00:17:24,"who found it this week or last year or whatever it was,"
00:17:24,00:17:26,they have so much computer processing power
00:17:26,00:17:28,that they've managed to find loads of them.
00:17:28,00:17:29,Right.
00:17:29,00:17:31,"Yeah, I think they found like four of the last five"
00:17:31,00:17:32,"or something like that, right?"
00:17:32,00:17:33,Yeah.
00:17:33,00:17:36,"So the new one, I'm going to read this out from here."
00:17:36,00:17:38,The new number is 5 million digits
00:17:38,00:17:41,longer than the previous largest one.
00:17:41,00:17:47,"It's 2 to the power of 74 million, 207,281."
00:17:47,00:17:48,All of that minus one.
00:17:48,00:17:49,Yeah.
00:17:49,00:17:53,And if you were going to write it out
00:17:53,00:17:55,"and you could write 10 digits in four seconds,"
00:17:55,00:17:58,"this is a calculation by a New York Times correspondent,"
00:17:58,00:18:00,it would take you three months without slowing down.
00:18:00,00:18:01,Yeah.
00:18:01,00:18:04,It's got 22 million digits in it.
00:18:04,00:18:05,Like my phone.
00:18:05,00:18:15,It starts 3-0-0-3-7-6-4-1.
00:18:15,00:18:17,It starts up.
00:18:17,00:18:24,And then it ends 0-0-7-3-3-9-10-8-6-4-3-6-3-5-1.
00:18:24,00:18:25,And for people at home--
00:18:25,00:18:26,So you've just given away the ending.
00:18:26,00:18:29,There's no point reading the middle now.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"For people at home, we edited out the other 22 million,"
00:18:32,00:18:33,I just didn't say.
00:18:33,00:18:35,And you can download the actual number
00:18:35,00:18:37,"and get it on your computer and have a look through it,"
00:18:37,00:18:38,which I did.
00:18:38,00:18:39,Look great.
00:18:39,00:18:44,It contains my six-digit code to access
00:18:44,00:18:45,my bank account.
00:18:45,00:18:47,"Oh, James, don't say that."
00:18:47,00:18:50,And people will know.
00:18:50,00:18:52,It contains it 21 times.
00:18:52,00:18:53,Wow.
00:18:53,00:18:55,That's how big this number is.
00:18:55,00:18:57,It contains my library number twice.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"And at one stage, it has 8/7s in a row."
00:19:00,00:19:02,So I'm just giving you the edited highlights here.
00:19:02,00:19:10,"I was watching an interview with the guy who discovered it,"
00:19:10,00:19:12,or rather the guy who set the computer up that discovered it.
00:19:12,00:19:14,"And there was a moment that, like, this is amazing."
00:19:14,00:19:16,There's the big new prime number.
00:19:16,00:19:17,It's beyond any that we've had before.
00:19:17,00:19:18,What can we do with it?
00:19:18,00:19:20,"And he was like, we have no idea."
00:19:20,00:19:20,Literally nothing.
00:19:20,00:19:21,It has no point.
00:19:21,00:19:22,There's no problem.
00:19:22,00:19:25,So most of them can be used for encrypting things on computers.
00:19:25,00:19:25,Yeah.
00:19:25,00:19:29,"Unfortunately, this one is now such a global celebrity"
00:19:29,00:19:31,that it will be noticed immediately by hackers.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"So if you have a clean, there's several million digits on."
00:19:33,00:19:36,"The thing is, you use prime numbers in encryption"
00:19:36,00:19:40,"by taking two prime numbers, multiplying them together,"
00:19:40,00:19:43,and then it's finding the factors of that secondary number.
00:19:43,00:19:47,"Now, if you have a number which has got 23, 24 million digits in,"
00:19:47,00:19:50,you know that one of them must be this number.
00:19:50,00:19:51,So everyone knows that it must be this one.
00:19:51,00:19:53,So it's really easy to crack.
00:19:53,00:19:54,So the only time this will be useful
00:19:54,00:19:57,is when we get some even bigger numbers that we can use.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Which we will do one day.
00:19:58,00:19:59,Yeah.
00:19:59,00:20:02,"I'd never heard prime numbers described like this,"
00:20:02,00:20:05,"but they're the building blocks of maths, really."
00:20:05,00:20:07,"And they're the equivalent of atoms in science,"
00:20:07,00:20:10,"because prime numbers are, because nothing goes into them,"
00:20:10,00:20:14,and everything else is a factor of something else.
00:20:14,00:20:15,So everything else can be split up.
00:20:15,00:20:16,You can't split up a prime number.
00:20:16,00:20:18,"Well, they were equivalent of an atom."
00:20:18,00:20:19,"And something else I didn't know about prime numbers,"
00:20:19,00:20:22,because you think they're kind of so randomly distributed.
00:20:22,00:20:26,"If we've taken this long to work out what the pattern is,"
00:20:26,00:20:30,"is that all prime numbers, if you square them,"
00:20:30,00:20:34,"are a multiple of 24, and then adding one."
00:20:34,00:20:36,"Now, you can just run that down."
00:20:36,00:20:37,Not the really small one.
00:20:37,00:20:38,No one's under fire.
00:20:38,00:20:40,Not the number of prime numbers.
00:20:40,00:20:41,Anything over five.
00:20:41,00:20:45,"Seven is, oh god, we're going to go through them all."
00:20:45,00:20:49,11 is 13 is 17.
00:20:49,00:20:53,11 is.
00:20:53,00:20:57,"Yeah, so they found this using the GIMPS software."
00:20:57,00:21:02,"And this is the weird thing about GIMPS is,"
00:21:02,00:21:07,"if you go up to Google and type the word GIMPS into Google,"
00:21:07,00:21:09,all of the first five things that you get
00:21:09,00:21:12,are about this prime number thing.
00:21:12,00:21:13,The same is not true of Google images.
00:21:13,00:21:19,This is amazing.
00:21:19,00:21:23,"So cicadas, you know, there's that kind of cicada in North America,"
00:21:23,00:21:25,which only comes up to the surface.
00:21:25,00:21:26,Every 17 years.
00:21:26,00:21:29,"Well, it's every prime number of years."
00:21:29,00:21:30,"So in some places, it's every 13 years."
00:21:30,00:21:32,"In some places, every 17 years."
00:21:32,00:21:34,"In some places, another prime number of years."
00:21:34,00:21:36,And which sounds ridiculous.
00:21:36,00:21:40,But it was hypothesized in the article I read that actually
00:21:40,00:21:40,does make sense.
00:21:40,00:21:43,"Because if you come up in a prime number of years,"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"you have the least chance of coinciding with predators,"
00:21:46,00:21:49,"which also have, like, periodical patterns."
00:21:49,00:21:51,"Because so, let's say you come up every eight years,"
00:21:51,00:21:55,"then if you're hunted by a panther that appears every two years,"
00:21:55,00:21:56,then they're going to bump into you a lot.
00:21:56,00:21:59,"But if you're coming up every prime number of years,"
00:21:59,00:22:01,then you're not going to bump into predators
00:22:01,00:22:02,every prime number of years.
00:22:02,00:22:04,Do you think there's just a car that comes up every two
00:22:04,00:22:07,to the 74 million years?
00:22:07,00:22:09,"And the only reason we haven't seen it is because, you know,"
00:22:09,00:22:11,"you'd be pretty lucky to see that one, you know."
00:22:11,00:22:12,Yeah.
00:22:12,00:22:13,I don't know what a cicada is.
00:22:13,00:22:14,It's a little insect.
00:22:14,00:22:14,It's OK.
00:22:14,00:22:15,Look at that.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"Yeah, like a cricket."
00:22:16,00:22:17,Got it.
00:22:17,00:22:19,"Cicada fact, there's only one cicada in the UK."
00:22:19,00:22:21,One species of cicada.
00:22:21,00:22:22,Oh.
00:22:22,00:22:23,One.
00:22:23,00:22:24,The cicada.
00:22:24,00:22:28,Lonesome Trevor.
00:22:28,00:22:30,There's only one species of cicada in the UK.
00:22:30,00:22:32,It's called the New Forest cicada.
00:22:32,00:22:33,"And we think they live in the New Forest,"
00:22:33,00:22:35,"where they might have died out, because no one's seen one"
00:22:35,00:22:36,for about 10 years.
00:22:36,00:22:39,"And you should be able to hear the call,"
00:22:39,00:22:41,but you can't really hear it because it's outside
00:22:41,00:22:42,of human hearing range.
00:22:42,00:22:44,But you can buy an app.
00:22:44,00:22:46,And the app can hear the cicada call.
00:22:46,00:22:48,And so you can walk around the New Forest
00:22:48,00:22:50,with your app listening for cicadas.
00:22:50,00:22:51,"And then if you find one, then you'll"
00:22:51,00:22:52,have discovered that they still exist.
00:22:52,00:22:53,Wow.
00:22:53,00:22:53,That'd be cool.
00:22:53,00:22:54,That's right.
00:22:54,00:22:55,Yeah.
00:22:55,00:22:56,Yeah.
00:22:56,00:22:57,So I didn't find any prime number stuff.
00:22:57,00:23:00,I started looking into numbers of the week.
00:23:00,00:23:01,And there's a very famous set of numbers now.
00:23:01,00:23:03,This is going to be a long list.
00:23:03,00:23:06,"Now, six."
00:23:06,00:23:08,"Now there was this week, a set of numbers,"
00:23:08,00:23:11,"which was, there was this massive lotto,"
00:23:11,00:23:12,the big lottery draw that went.
00:23:12,00:23:14,And there was a story about this lady who
00:23:14,00:23:16,thinks she's won the lottery.
00:23:16,00:23:18,She's found the ticker that she's won with all the numbers.
00:23:18,00:23:20,But the barcode is missing.
00:23:20,00:23:21,"She put it in the washing machine, didn't she?"
00:23:21,00:23:22,"Yeah, she put it in the washing machine."
00:23:22,00:23:23,It's missing.
00:23:23,00:23:25,It's one of those things where you think
00:23:25,00:23:27,"that must be the worst situation, right?"
00:23:27,00:23:28,That you've won the lottery.
00:23:28,00:23:32,"And now you've not won it, because you've lost the thing."
00:23:32,00:23:33,That's all I was looking into is that genuinely
00:23:33,00:23:36,the worst situation anyone's had in the lottery.
00:23:36,00:23:38,And I found a guy that I think contends.
00:23:38,00:23:39,"Oh, really?"
00:23:39,00:23:40,Yeah.
00:23:40,00:23:41,This guy won the lottery.
00:23:41,00:23:42,OK.
00:23:42,00:23:44,But this is what led up to him winning the lottery.
00:23:44,00:23:45,His name is Franz Seller.
00:23:45,00:23:46,He was born in Croatia.
00:23:46,00:23:47,He was a teacher.
00:23:47,00:23:48,He was born in 1929.
00:23:48,00:23:53,"In 1962, his train derailed and plunged into an icy river."
00:23:53,00:23:55,And he managed to escape and not die.
00:23:55,00:23:59,"The next year in 1963, while flying,"
00:23:59,00:24:02,"the door blew out, and he got sucked out of the way."
00:24:02,00:24:03,And he survived.
00:24:03,00:24:03,"Oh, good."
00:24:03,00:24:04,It was all good.
00:24:04,00:24:08,"Three years later, 1966, he's riding on a bunge."
00:24:08,00:24:08,That's sort of what?
00:24:08,00:24:10,He's riding on a bunge.
00:24:10,00:24:11,It's Australia.
00:24:11,00:24:12,It's an Australian term.
00:24:12,00:24:15,"He's riding on a bunge, right?"
00:24:15,00:24:17,"Whatever you do, don't check that verb,"
00:24:17,00:24:21,a dictionary when you get on a bunge.
00:24:21,00:24:24,So he's riding on a bus and the bus suddenly.
00:24:24,00:24:28,The bus plunges into a river.
00:24:28,00:24:31,"So that's, he gets out and survived."
00:24:31,00:24:34,"So this is 1962, 1963, 1966."
00:24:34,00:24:39,"1970, he must take no public transport by the way."
00:24:39,00:24:39,Exactly.
00:24:39,00:24:40,He's in his car.
00:24:40,00:24:43,"Oh, no."
00:24:43,00:24:44,He's in his car.
00:24:44,00:24:46,And it just blows up in flames.
00:24:46,00:24:47,So he escapes.
00:24:47,00:24:48,And he's all right.
00:24:48,00:24:51,"So that's 1970, 1973."
00:24:51,00:24:53,He's still weary of public transport.
00:24:53,00:24:56,"In his car, once again, another fire blows up in his car,"
00:24:56,00:24:57,loses all his hair.
00:24:57,00:24:58,It manages us to make it out.
00:24:58,00:25:01,There's a whole nice period between 1973 and 1995
00:25:01,00:25:03,when nothing happens.
00:25:03,00:25:06,"But he stayed at home, then I guess."
00:25:06,00:25:08,But then he went out and got hit by a bus.
00:25:08,00:25:09,So that's 1995.
00:25:09,00:25:13,"Then in 1996, 1996, he's back in his car."
00:25:13,00:25:16,"He drove and another, either it was a truck or a car,"
00:25:16,00:25:17,is coming towards him.
00:25:17,00:25:18,He swirves away.
00:25:18,00:25:22,"He manages to escape his car as it plunges over a cliff,"
00:25:22,00:25:26,"lands in a tree, and then the car goes 300 feet down"
00:25:26,00:25:28,and breaks into a nicey river.
00:25:28,00:25:30,"And in 2003, he won the lotto."
00:25:30,00:25:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:32,00:25:33,1 million.
00:25:33,00:25:35,That's divine justice.
00:25:35,00:25:36,That's amazing.
00:25:36,00:25:39,I think that's worse than losing your ticket and not winning.
00:25:39,00:25:40,There was a couple.
00:25:40,00:25:42,There were two other very bad lottery stories.
00:25:42,00:25:45,So one couple-- I think this was actually last year--
00:25:45,00:25:49,"Edwin and David Neillan, who had a lotto app."
00:25:49,00:25:51,And they got the right numbers.
00:25:51,00:25:52,And they sent them off in the app.
00:25:52,00:25:54,And they'd won 35 million pounds.
00:25:54,00:25:56,And the app broke.
00:25:56,00:25:57,And it failed.
00:25:57,00:25:58,So they had the photographic evidence
00:25:58,00:26:00,that they tried to send it on the app.
00:26:00,00:26:01,And it only sent it after the deadline
00:26:01,00:26:03,because they ran out of signals.
00:26:03,00:26:06,"Oh, I've been using their phone to search for cicada noises"
00:26:06,00:26:07,in New Forest.
00:26:07,00:26:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:10,00:26:13,"OK, let's move on to our final fact of the show."
00:26:13,00:26:15,And that is Chazinsky.
00:26:15,00:26:19,"Yes, my fact is that in a press release"
00:26:19,00:26:21,about the new English language test
00:26:21,00:26:24,"for migrants, the British government misspelled the word"
00:26:24,00:26:28,language.
00:26:28,00:26:32,"But yeah, this has been a big story over the last few weeks."
00:26:32,00:26:33,There's the new test for migrants.
00:26:33,00:26:35,And there's lots of controversy.
00:26:35,00:26:38,"And even if they're on spousal visas,"
00:26:38,00:26:39,"if they fail these language tests,"
00:26:39,00:26:42,they might be made to leave the country.
00:26:42,00:26:44,And it turns out the people who are releasing the press release
00:26:44,00:26:47,spell language with the A and the U the wrong way around.
00:26:47,00:26:50,There's a very snotty reply from the government.
00:26:50,00:26:51,The Prime Minister's official spokesman
00:26:51,00:26:54,"said, ""All of us are open to mistakes at times."
00:26:54,00:26:56,The Prime Minister is fully confident that his team
00:26:56,00:26:57,"speak English competently."""
00:26:57,00:27:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:01,00:27:02,Touched a bit of a nerve.
00:27:02,00:27:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:06,00:27:09,"I went through-- I basically haven't researched that much of this,"
00:27:09,00:27:10,because I just went through trying to find mistakes
00:27:10,00:27:12,in all government--
00:27:12,00:27:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:12,00:27:15,--it's all legislation over the last 50 years.
00:27:15,00:27:18,"No, I went-- well, first of all, the independent put together"
00:27:18,00:27:20,a list of 10 questions that are taken from the government's list
00:27:20,00:27:23,of possible migrant language questions.
00:27:23,00:27:25,And here's the independence introduction to the questions.
00:27:25,00:27:26,Listen to this sentence.
00:27:26,00:27:29,The questions below have been taken from practice exams
00:27:29,00:27:32,for the B1 test that those who need to prove their knowledge
00:27:32,00:27:34,of the English language to gain their indefinite leave
00:27:34,00:27:36,to remain--
00:27:36,00:27:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:38,00:27:40,Whoa!
00:27:40,00:27:42,"Oh, it's like a cliffhanger of a sentence."
00:27:42,00:27:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:45,00:27:48,"And then-- so one of the questions is maybe I'm wrong about this,"
00:27:48,00:27:49,but it's multiple choice questions.
00:27:49,00:27:51,And it is a completely under this sentence.
00:27:51,00:27:54,"So one of them is, have you finished with the newspaper"
00:27:54,00:27:57,and its ABCD and the options are--
00:27:57,00:27:58,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
00:27:58,00:27:59,Is this the game--
00:27:59,00:28:00,Tell citizenship.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's against citizenship."
00:28:02,00:28:04,You have to say whether you've finished with the newspaper.
00:28:04,00:28:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:05,00:28:07,That's the only criteria.
00:28:07,00:28:08,Just give the freaking newspaper back.
00:28:08,00:28:09,You can come in the country.
00:28:09,00:28:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:11,00:28:13,"No, it's have you finished with the newspaper,"
00:28:13,00:28:15,and then it's what is the grammatically correct ending
00:28:15,00:28:16,to the sentence.
00:28:16,00:28:19,"Have you finished with the newspaper now still yet,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,or already?
00:28:21,00:28:23,"Now, the answer they want, and I did the test,"
00:28:23,00:28:27,"yet is the answer they want, already, is completely correct."
00:28:27,00:28:30,"Yeah, if you want to be really passive-aggressive about it."
00:28:30,00:28:32,"Yeah, you can say, have you finished with that newspaper"
00:28:32,00:28:33,already?
00:28:33,00:28:34,"No, it's not that."
00:28:34,00:28:35,It's not that.
00:28:35,00:28:36,It's the opposite of that.
00:28:36,00:28:38,So they want you to fall into the trap of the American.
00:28:38,00:28:40,Have you finished with the newspaper already?
00:28:40,00:28:43,"But you could also just ask the valid question,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,have you finished with the newspaper already?
00:28:45,00:28:46,Hasn't have you read it that fast?
00:28:46,00:28:48,Have you finished with the newspaper already?
00:28:48,00:28:49,"Oh, you could also--"
00:28:49,00:28:51,"You could also passive-aggressive, is they?"
00:28:51,00:28:53,"Well, have you finished with the newspaper now?"
00:28:53,00:28:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:28:55,00:28:57,What more brutish than that?
00:28:57,00:29:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:00,00:29:01,It doesn't make any sense.
00:29:01,00:29:02,That's what it probably is.
00:29:02,00:29:03,Yeah.
00:29:03,00:29:06,"So my wife, who's Russian, she will have"
00:29:06,00:29:08,to take these tests quite soon.
00:29:08,00:29:10,And she was trying out some questions
00:29:10,00:29:13,"from the citizenship test, which is like a general knowledge"
00:29:13,00:29:15,"test, and she tried them out on me."
00:29:15,00:29:17,"And literally, I got none of them right."
00:29:17,00:29:17,Really?
00:29:17,00:29:19,And my general knowledge is not bad.
00:29:19,00:29:20,It's all right.
00:29:20,00:29:22,"I have brought a long one to test you,"
00:29:22,00:29:23,because I think your general knowledge is quite good.
00:29:23,00:29:24,OK.
00:29:24,00:29:27,"Well, one of the ones that she was asked in the practice test"
00:29:27,00:29:30,"was, what is a national dish of whales?"
00:29:30,00:29:31,Oh!
00:29:31,00:29:32,"Well, coal."
00:29:32,00:29:33,Oh.
00:29:33,00:29:34,"Oh, coal."
00:29:34,00:29:34,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:34,00:29:35,Cool.
00:29:35,00:29:37,"Well, you might think that according to the government."
00:29:37,00:29:38,"Well, exactly."
00:29:38,00:29:41,"But according to the government, it's Welsh cakes."
00:29:41,00:29:42,"Oh, god."
00:29:42,00:29:44,"Sorry, fellas."
00:29:44,00:29:45,"Sorry, guys."
00:29:45,00:29:50,The whole office will be sending around.
00:29:50,00:29:50,"Ah, yeah."
00:29:50,00:29:51,"Well, of case."
00:29:51,00:29:52,"Yeah, probably Welsh cakes."
00:29:52,00:29:56,"But the other thing is, if I want to become a citizen of Russia,"
00:29:56,00:29:58,I would have to take a Russian language test.
00:29:58,00:30:01,And the Russian language test has all the normal things
00:30:01,00:30:02,that you would expect.
00:30:02,00:30:08,But you also have to be able to interpret hidden meanings.
00:30:08,00:30:09,Wow.
00:30:09,00:30:10,That's cool.
00:30:10,00:30:13,That's cool.
00:30:13,00:30:16,"You know, Bill Bryson released a new book, The Road to Little"
00:30:16,00:30:17,"Dribbling, and it's all in the beginning."
00:30:17,00:30:19,He talks about taking a test to become a British citizen.
00:30:19,00:30:20,He decided to become it.
00:30:20,00:30:24,"And he was saying that not only are there mistakes in the test,"
00:30:24,00:30:28,but in the books that guide you into how to take the test
00:30:28,00:30:30,are just completely filled with mistakes.
00:30:30,00:30:33,One that he pointed out was they were talking about Anthony Hopkins
00:30:33,00:30:36,and saying that he's someone to be proud of as a British person.
00:30:36,00:30:36,He's someone to be proud of.
00:30:36,00:30:39,They spelt his name wrong.
00:30:39,00:30:41,"And also, he's taken up American citizenship."
00:30:41,00:30:44,He's not a British anymore.
00:30:44,00:30:46,Tina Turner is Swiss now.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Ishi.
00:30:47,00:30:47,Yep.
00:30:47,00:30:48,Wow.
00:30:48,00:30:54,So I was looking into the news for other language mess ups
00:30:54,00:30:55,over the last week.
00:30:55,00:30:58,And I found one that happened in Sweden.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"They were having their parliament, a political debate"
00:31:00,00:31:03,"about very serious issues, actually."
00:31:03,00:31:04,It was like a really long debate.
00:31:04,00:31:07,"They made a mistake, though, of when they transmitted it,"
00:31:07,00:31:10,they put the wrong subtitles onto the debate.
00:31:10,00:31:14,"So you had guys like Jean Borgland,"
00:31:14,00:31:17,"who's the Minister of Education, looking really serious,"
00:31:17,00:31:19,"saying something really serious, but the subtitles reading,"
00:31:19,00:31:22,"""I will build the best sancasel in the calendar."""
00:31:22,00:31:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:25,00:31:28,I vote for him.
00:31:28,00:31:31,"And then you had Stefan Loffan, the prime minister,"
00:31:31,00:31:33,"the prime minister, going the latest invention,"
00:31:33,00:31:36,the fantastic dinosaur submarine.
00:31:36,00:31:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:39,00:31:41,"And then the Minister for Environment, going,"
00:31:41,00:31:43,"""Greetings, Earth Creatures."""
00:31:43,00:31:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:46,00:31:48,"I have two pairs of boots, one red pair,"
00:31:48,00:31:50,and one yellow pair.
00:31:50,00:31:53,Which one should I take?
00:31:53,00:31:54,I'm going to ask my dolls.
00:31:54,00:31:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:58,00:32:02,"Well, I don't know where they got those original subtitles."
00:32:02,00:32:04,"Yeah, it was a cartoon animation."
00:32:04,00:32:06,"Oh, that sounds great."
00:32:06,00:32:08,"It sounds great, isn't it?"
00:32:08,00:32:12,You know that Godzilla has just been awarded Japanese citizenship.
00:32:12,00:32:16,"I was done as a press PR stunt, obviously."
00:32:16,00:32:19,But it was a particular district of Tokyo
00:32:19,00:32:22,"that he got in Shinjuku, which is a very cool, extremely busy one."
00:32:22,00:32:25,I think that's-- it's very near the famous crossing in Tokyo.
00:32:25,00:32:27,Shibuya crossing.
00:32:27,00:32:29,"But they released the certificate, which they'd done."
00:32:29,00:32:33,"And it said, ""Previous visits to Shinjuku Ward 3."""
00:32:33,00:32:35,"Godzilla, 1984."
00:32:35,00:32:37,"Godzilla versus King Gidora, 1991."
00:32:37,00:32:39,"And Godzilla Millennium, 1999."
00:32:39,00:32:41,Those were his trips.
00:32:41,00:32:42,Very good.
00:32:42,00:32:43,We're going to have to wrap up in a sec.
00:32:43,00:32:45,"So yeah, anything you want to--"
00:32:45,00:32:47,"Just as you know, to get South Korean citizenship,"
00:32:47,00:32:49,the test requires you to sing the first four verses
00:32:49,00:32:50,of the national anthem.
00:32:50,00:32:51,Sing it in tune.
00:32:51,00:32:52,Wow.
00:32:52,00:32:53,Yeah.
00:32:53,00:32:54,"That's a tough gig, isn't it?"
00:32:54,00:32:58,"And the Dutch citizenship, you have to watch a video"
00:32:58,00:33:00,that includes beach nudity.
00:33:00,00:33:00,What?
00:33:00,00:33:01,Where's the film?
00:33:01,00:33:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:04,00:33:05,What does he want?
00:33:05,00:33:07,I'll do it even if they don't give me Dutch nudity.
00:33:07,00:33:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:09,00:33:12,It's become such a liberal country they
00:33:12,00:33:15,want to show you what to expect if you come to the Netherlands.
00:33:15,00:33:16,"Yeah, yeah."
00:33:16,00:33:17,Like if people come from other countries
00:33:17,00:33:19,"that are a bit more conservative,"
00:33:19,00:33:20,they might turn up into the Netherlands
00:33:20,00:33:22,"and think, wow, what's going on here?"
00:33:22,00:33:24,Beach nudity.
00:33:24,00:33:26,So they want to show it so that you're not
00:33:26,00:33:27,shocked when you see it in real life.
00:33:27,00:33:28,So can you feel that?
00:33:28,00:33:32,"Is it like if you get an erection, or are you crying then?"
00:33:32,00:33:35,"You want both, you want both."
00:33:35,00:33:37,"Feelings are confusing, isn't it?"
00:33:37,00:33:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:40,00:33:41,I'm kidding.
00:33:41,00:33:42,That's it.
00:33:42,00:33:43,I'll do it.
00:33:43,00:33:44,I'll do it all day.
00:33:44,00:33:46,That's all of our facts.
00:33:46,00:33:50,[APPLAUSE]
