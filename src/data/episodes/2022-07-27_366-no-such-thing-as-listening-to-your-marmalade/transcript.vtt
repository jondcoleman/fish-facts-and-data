 [Anitoshin-Ski theme song playing]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.500
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anitoshin-Ski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 My fact is that the prototype personal cassette player was a block of wood which the inventor carried around in his pocket to make sure it would fit. That was it, he just wanted to make sure that it would be the right size, and so he did it the simplest way possible.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 So when you say prototype, he didn't think it was making any noise or anything. I remember when I was in the school orchestra in primary school, I was on the wooden block, so you know, that is an instrument, isn't it?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 It is an instrument, that's true.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 That was the very early prototype, the idea.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 That was the only song you could play, the wooden block parts of children's songs.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Yeah, it was a really early prototype, and then he worked on it a lot before it became The Walkman.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 He was called Lou Ottens, this guy, and he passed away a couple of weeks ago, aged 94, and in his working life he worked at Philips, the electronics firm, and he was the head of research and development.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 So in the 1950s he started working on an alternative for the huge tape recorders that you had at the time, and he had this block made in the 60s to show him how big the first compact cassette should be, so it was convenient.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 And the really nice thing is we don't have it anymore.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 This prototype has been lost in the midst of time because he used it to prop up his jack while he was replacing a flat tire in his car, and he just left it by the road at the end by mistake.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 It was just a bit of wood. I mean, you're acting like a museum.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 It was history, I agree.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 We know where he broke down, because if you're driving along the road, keep an eye open for a block of wood the same size as The Walkman, because it could be worth billions.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Exactly. I think he was Dutch, so look around, Dutch listeners.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Yes, that's very cool.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 He was madly in love with electronics right from the beginning, wasn't he?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 When he was a kid, he used to build radios, and as a teen, he built radios during the war that meant that they could sort of listen in to illegal channels.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Him and his parents could listen to radio that should have been hurt.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 And he built this weird directional antenna on top of one that he called the Germanin filter, and the idea was it would jam any of the Nazis who were trying to work out who was getting illegal radio.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 I think it was a thing that would stop the jammers, right?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 As in the Nazis would put jammers out there to try and stop you from listening to certain radio stations, and his thing stopped the jammers rather than jamming other things, right?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 It was a jam jam jammer.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 A jam jammer. Wow.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 A jam avoider, yeah.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 So he could listen to his jam.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Yeah.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Well, do you know what the radio station was called?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 It was called Radio Oranje, or Oranje, and oranges.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 What do you make out of them?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Marmalade.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 It's literally the only fruit that if you turn it into a jam-like substance, it's not called jam.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Andy, I think it falls under the jam umbrella.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 The jam umbrella.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 I think it's a subcategory of jam.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 In later life, obviously, the personal cassettes he helped invent, what can you listen to on them?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Your jams.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 That's what I just said.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 I literally just made that joke.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 James made that joke.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 I'm so sorry.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 James made the joke, and while you were not listening to it, you were busy coming up with your whole marmalade thing.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 You don't know why that was in there at all.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Unmortified.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 The interesting thing about this block is he came up with the size and then had to fit everything inside it.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 That's just kind of an interesting way of doing it, right?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 You would think you would get everything that you need, so all your speakers and all your bits and where the batteries go and stuff,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 and then try and make it smaller.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 But he thought, this is the side it needs to be.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 And in that size, we have to fit the cassette.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 We have to fit a loudspeaker.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 We have to fit batteries.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 We have to fit all the electronics, and we have to fit a few connectors.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 And then basically that was the puzzle that he had to solve at Philips to try and get all these amazing things into this tiny little block.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 That's very interesting.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 So Lou Ottens, he actually didn't think much of the cassettes compared to CDs.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 He thought that CDs were the absolute best quality of anything you could get.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 He even thought CDs were better than vinyl.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Later on in life, he kind of reneged on their whole, "Aren't cassettes amazing?"

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 And that's true.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 I mean, cassettes, they do compress their audio quite a lot, don't they?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 He helped to invent the CD.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Yeah, he wasn't just being selfless when he was saying, "The CD is so much better than my invention.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 It was also his, wasn't it?"

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 It was partly his, wasn't it?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 He must have been absolutely bloody loaded.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Well, I don't know what kind of a stake he had, but 100 billion tapes were sold.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 And then as soon as he invented the CD, 200 billion CDs were sold.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 If he got one P for everything, he would be the richest man in the...

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 I don't know about numbers and stuff, but it feels like he would be the richest person in the world.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 He's a maths graduate.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 But you know, when you say how much money Elon Musk has got, it's just the numbers just become crazy, don't they?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 That's true.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Must be there and thereabouts.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 I think he must have not made too much from it, right?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Otherwise, the obituary would have said, "The richest man ever had died."

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 That wasn't really a sentence that featured in it.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 That's right.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Do you know what the event was that the cassette player was launched at?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 It was the International Funkausstellung, which is...

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Cool.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Yeah, and it sounds like it's the International Funk exhibition, but it just means wireless in German.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 It's the International Wireless Exhibition, but it still happens to this day, every year, they event new stuff.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 And release it.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Cool, yeah.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 I mean, people still buy cassettes, don't they?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Yeah.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 I think last year they sold more than they have since the 80s or 90s, didn't they?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 There was one by Five Seconds of Summer, who's like an Australian boy band, and they sold tens and tens of thousands of them.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Yeah.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Because they released a lot.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 I think it was Lady Gaga's last album was the biggest selling cassette for a long time in the tens of thousands.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 But there was this really odd thing where for quite a long time in the 2000s, they weren't selling anything.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 So there's a fact that makes the round on the internet, which is that Ensink was the top selling single for a cassette in 2010.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 And they'd sold 13 copies in 2010.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 And in 11, they got the chart topper again with the same album by selling 11 copies in 2011.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 So I suddenly thought, I know the last time I bought a cassette, the last time I bought a cassette was in 2012, and it was our theme tune Wasps.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 So I looked into it because in 2012, the top selling cassette was Borders by the band Feeder, and they sold 480 cassettes out of all the cassettes that the UK registered, which was 604 cassettes sold.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 But Emperor Yes, the band who does our theme tune, they sold 50 cassettes.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Definitely because they sold out, which must mean our theme tune was one of the top five best selling cassettes of 2012.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 Huge.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 We've got to get that on the press blurbs.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 It was before we existed, wasn't it?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Yes.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 It was.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Two years.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Yeah.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 It is mad how much it's gone up then, given that we were in the almost single figures.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 And I think in 2020, 160,000 tapes were bought, and that was three times what it was in 2018.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 So something's happening.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 And I think an industry person said it's actually slightly called as off guard because we don't have enough of the magnetic tape.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 We weren't really expecting tapes to come back into fashion and started running out.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 In 2012, so this was the year of the Emperor Yes release when it was still sort of like 400 copies being sold.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Is that how 2012 is going to go down in history now?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 It's like the year of the dragon, the year of the dog, the year of the Emperor Yes release.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Yeah.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Fuji and IBM built a prototype cassette, which can hold more than say, you know, the classic cassettes that we bought were 30 minutes.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 You could get onto it.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 90 minutes was the top.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 And then I think there was 120 and 180 minutes.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Those really were pushing the limits.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 They've now built one which can store 185 terabytes on a single cassette tape.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 Single cassette tape.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 So I was trying to look into how many songs that could fit onto it.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 And some guys worked it out online.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 He says you could fit on this a single cassette tape, 47.3 million songs on a single.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 That's too many.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Yeah, well, it is.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 No one needs that many songs.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Surely we have more than that just on Spotify or whatever.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Spotify currently has 70 million songs.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 So this is more than half of what Spotify has.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Wow.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Sorry, this is a kind of a massive tape.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 No, it's the size of a cassette tape.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 And what they've done is it's a process they've called sputter deposition and it shrinks the magnetic particles on the tape.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 So it just drastically shrinks them down so that more information could be fit on it.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Why have they done that when none of us really care about tapes anymore?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 I don't know.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 I think they want it for storage because in the same article they were talking about how Facebook has its whole backup on Blu-ray discs.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 This is back in 2012.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 And so I think they're just trying to find tiny spaces where they don't have to use these insanely large hard drives that are chewing up energy to hold things.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Just to show how obsolete it is, the word cassette tape was taken out of the concise Oxford English dictionary.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 So the concise Oxford English dictionary doesn't have every word.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 It has all the most useful ones.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 And cassette tape was taken out of it in 2011.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 And that's one year before the year of Emperor Yes's cassette tape.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 That's outrageous.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 They had no idea.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 I think that's an oversight.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 That is bad, bad work.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 I think there's a lot of people listening to it.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Not a lot of people, but some people listen to this podcast.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 You've got literally no idea what we're talking about.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Do you want to hear a cassette tape anecdote?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 No.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Yeah.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 Okay.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Give us half of it.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 All right.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 All right.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Look, there's a scientist called Barry Marshall.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 I think we've mentioned before.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 He gave himself, what's it called?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 Stomaculci.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Stomaculci.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Yeah.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 He won the prize for suggesting that Stomaculci were caused by bacteria and not by stress

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 and diet.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 And this was a revolutionary thing.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 He and his colleague won the Nobel Prize in 2005.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Anyway, this is what I found in an online comment thread beneath an article about cassettes,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 which was when Marshall and Robin Warren submitted a paper concluding that blah, blah, blah,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 one of the reviewers of the paper sent back a cassette tape that was just 15 minutes of laughter.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Now, I wrote to Barry Marshall because I couldn't quite believe it because I thought 15 minutes

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 is such a long time to be fake laughing to make a point.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 And he said it was fake news.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 He wrote back and said, no, this never happened.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Oh, right.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Contact with Barry Marshall.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 That's incredible.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 I wrote to him to ask him maybe the most pointless question ever.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Yeah.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 He won the prize and said, is it true that someone laughed at you for 15 minutes on a cassette

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 tape based on this one comment on an online thread?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 And he said, no, it was about a full word email.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 He said back.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Wow.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 But then like, because that would have been a pointless 15 minutes of laughter, but he

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 has received a pointless email from you.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 So in a way, he's wasting that time in the end.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 I've got one more story about cassette tapes.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 Okay.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 In the 1990s, a woman called Stella Weddell was on holiday in Spain.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 I think she might have just been a girl at the time.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Anyway, she lost her mixtape.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 It had some shaggy on it, some Bob Marley and a few Disney songs.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Good collection.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Yeah, right.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 I mean, yeah, proper mixtape stuff, really eclectic.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Anyway, in 2019, she was on holiday in Stockholm and she went to an exhibition by an artist

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 called Mandy Barker who had been documenting plastic pollution and had put a tape on display.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 She'd found a tape and had it professionally restored and, you know, show the track listing

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 and Stella Weddell saw the track listing and said, that's my mixtape, which I lost 30

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 years ago in Spain.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 And then she got fined for littering or what?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 It doesn't relate.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 I hope so.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 She just put her hands up and said, it wasn't me.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 That is Anna.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 It's about baboons.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 My fact this week is that baboons can take 45 minutes debating which direction to go in

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 the morning.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 And Anna, who spends 45 seconds debating whether to say a fact.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 I was on the wrong page and you can just snip that silence right out.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Yes, baboons.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 Baboons are very indecisive, it turns out.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 And so every day they wake up and they need to decide where to go to get food or water

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 or shelter or fun.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 And they have this amazing process whereby they decide which way to go.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And it was looked at properly by a behavioural ecologist called Meg Crowfoot recently.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 And she observed a number of things.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 So one quite funny thing is that eventually everyone ends up following a leader to go in

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 the right direction.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 But there seems to be no rhyme or reason to which baboon they follow.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 It's not the most dominant.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 It's not the biggest.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 It's not the males.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 It's not the sexiest.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 The only thing that determines which one they follow is the style of walking.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 So if you walk...

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 It's a bit like, do you remember that Conservative Party conference where they all started doing

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 an unbelievably stupid stance where they kind of would...

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Yes.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 They would walk on stage and all stand with their legs like five feet apart.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Legs of Kimbo.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Yeah, it feels like that.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 But then they all followed Theresa May doing her dance instead.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Robot.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Yeah.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Is it a different walk then every morning?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 It's basically if you walk with extreme confidence.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 The boons that went off but in a bit of a windy way or walked a bit slowly or did some pauses,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 they didn't get followed.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 If you walk very straight and at a very steady pace, you're more likely to be followed.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 That's really cool.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 They are quite democratic in one way, but undemocratic in another way, which is basically the rank

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 in the pack, which is not deciding on who goes in which direction.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 It just depends on who's in charge.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 But that's very much...

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 In the females, it depends on how strong your mother was.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 In males, it depends on how much you can beat up the other boons.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 It's very much like if your mum was amazing, you're amazing.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 If you can beat up all the other boys, you're amazing.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Everyone else just has to suck it up.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Right.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 But the walk decisions are not based on that.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 It's really weird.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 It's really peculiar.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Everything else is.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Like you say, they're so hierarchical.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 There was one quite endearing scene that Meg Crawford painted.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 One baboon that she observed obviously tried to lead the group.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 So they're all loitering around in the morning under a tree.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 One baboon started wandering away, walked about 100 meters, looked back, no one's followed

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 him.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 And so he sort of like wanders around and like thrust his chest out.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 He's like, you know, why aren't you following me?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 And eventually he climbed up onto a tree stump and made it obviously trying to make himself

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 more prominent.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 And he stood there for 10 minutes trying to encourage him to follow and then gave up and

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 returned to the group.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Oh, wow.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Sad.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.960
 about trying to persuade people to make a decision on where to eat. Yeah. You think if I just start

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.320
 walking, they'll follow? They never do, do they, Andy? No. Did you say the thing about compromise?

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:05.600
 That when leading boobins go in opposite directions, the degree counts. So if there is less than 90

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.360
 degrees between the two leaders of the pack who are saying, let's go this way, if there's less than

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.680
 90 degrees, they'll just find a direction in the middle and go that way. But if they're going

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:19.120
 in opposite directions, then they side with each other. Not a good plan. Yeah. It's like a terrible

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:25.680
 plan. Yeah. Because what if there's something in the way? Yes. Yeah, or a hippo or something. Yeah,

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.840
 you're basically picking something that neither of the two main guys have picked. You're just

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.000
 choosing something quite arbitrary, aren't you? James, I would have thought as a Lib Dem voter

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.240
 that you'd literally pick something roughly in the middle. That's fair. Yeah, and I don't

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.560
 understand if then, do they join the group? I guess they do. The two who've picked the directions,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.800
 or are they just now out on a limb, I wonder, and everyone else? Because it's about the whole

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.040
 group then picks the one in the middle, don't they? The root of the middle. Yeah, yeah. I guess

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.760
 the two who were leading it, lead it, but I don't know. Yeah, the two leading would say, OK, we've

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.360
 come to a, yeah. I'm just seeing where my position is in this entire group and in the group of all

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.880
 of our fans now that everyone knows I'm a Lib Dem voter. I might have come right down to the bottom

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.120
 of the group. No one's following you anywhere. You're standing on a tree stump on your own.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:22.480
 But they aren't. The democracy element is pretty fascinating. So as you said, if two

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:28.240
 baboons go in opposite directions, then sometimes they'll just be a stalemate. So exactly the same

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.160
 number of baboons will follow each one. And so the rest who are still left in the middle are like,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.120
 well, it's equal. So we just have to do a revote. It's like the second stage of voting. So everyone

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.240
 comes back to the middle and then try again and eventually slightly more baboons will follow

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.360
 one than the other. And then they all go, OK, more voted for that one. Let's go with that.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.560
 Very cool. You know, baboons have red bums. Yes. Do you know why they have red bums?

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:58.160
 It's not so that when you're walking, people can follow you. I don't think. Yeah, that would be

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:05.120
 good. Are they always slapping each other's bottoms? That's just a bit of bruising. No, not really.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.040
 They actually don't have red bottoms. They just have a big bruise, all of them.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:17.760
 So you would think, I would have thought, that whoever has the reddest bum might have the most

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.440
 sex. Yeah, it's the sexy bums. You would think so, right? But they've done some studies. So it's a

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:31.200
 2015. Actually, on my notes, it's a 2,105 AD study, but I think it was in 2015. And it was in the

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.480
 journal Animal Behavior. And they looked at all the female baboons with the most swelling and they

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:41.920
 found that the redder rumps didn't have more offspring and didn't have more sex. And so they're

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.440
 like, well, why do they do that? And they reckon that it's simply kind of a byproduct of ovulation.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:55.280
 So when a female is the most fertile, various changes happen in her body. But one of them is

00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:00.720
 that her bum gets redder. And there's actually not any particular reason. It doesn't seem to

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.160
 help or hinder them in any other way. It's just kind of a byproduct of that.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.080
 Interesting. Isn't that weird? It's random. It's like if women having periods, we were being

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.080
 studied by aliens and they were like, I guess men must find this period thing attractive.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:19.200
 And then it's like, no, it just happened. It's just part of life. Just part of life.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:26.480
 I read that the way they do choose a mate is by how long it's been since the woman last had a baby.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:34.640
 Because apparently they're less fertile if they're nursing. So it's best that they're not nursing

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.080
 young. But I'm not sure how they, how do you have that conversation as a baboon?

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:44.640
 Maybe it's obvious when you, you know, go back to their place and they've got a 17 year old kid.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.240
 The quality of the drawings on the fridge, how you do it. It's very basic and she's had a baby

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:57.840
 recently. So I really like this baboons and impalas, you know, sort of antelope like creatures,

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.800
 they make friends with each other because this is in Tanzania. There's a tree in Tanzania called

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:08.400
 the sausage tree, which I was immensely pleased to find out exists. And they hang out under the

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.800
 sausage tree. Annoyingly, it's not real sausages, but what a tree that would be. It's just fruits,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.320
 which have these rough gray rinds on the outside. And they look like sausages. It just looks like

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.120
 it's festooned with sausages. But anyway, the impalas are trying to eat their sausages under

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.520
 the tree. And the baboons are there looking out for predators. And the impalas are visibly more

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.480
 relaxed. They spend half the time with their heads up and around looking for predators

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:38.080
 that they would do normally if they were, you know, unaccompanied by their baboon friends.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:45.520
 I was reading about how baboons get their food. And this is probably a tip for anyone who's

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:51.920
 lost out in the wild as well. But they scavenge through elephant dung. So they come across a

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.960
 massive pile of dung and they head in there because elephants eat a lot of nuts and they eat a lot of

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.680
 fruit, but they don't digest at all. So a lot of the stuff passes through their body completely

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:07.680
 undigested. So if you see a giant pile of elephant dung and you're starving, stick a hand in and you

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:14.720
 might like a dip style come out with an apple. Quite far down the road of being starving before

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.840
 you get that far. I think don't do it. If you're walking around Chester Zoo and you feel like a

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:26.800
 snack, don't do it. I think that they're going, fuck, we voted for the wrong person this morning

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.560
 when they left that pile of elephant dung. Democracy doesn't always work. We know that.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:41.040
 Baboons like to heavy pet each other quite a lot. It's in a quite sweet way. I read an

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:46.080
 article from 2003 in Nature, which I was surprised by the title of it because it is Nature,

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.960
 a very high-respected journal. And the article was titled "Risky Diddling Bones Baboons"

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.960
 and it's about the closer friends you are with someone as a baboon, the more risky your diddling is.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:04.800
 Diddling, I love that phrase. It's so nice, isn't it? So they love to fondle each other. They'll pull

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:12.080
 on each other's penises reciprocally. There are several forms of grasping of bums and genitals

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:17.120
 that they engage in, apparently. They nibble each other. They mount each other when they meet,

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.560
 but the closer they are to that other baboon, the closer they'll get. And the idea is that

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.760
 your own knees sort of... How can you get closer than pulling each other's penises? It feels like

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.240
 there's no closer you can get after that, is there? I guess it depends how hard you pull. Maybe it's

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:40.880
 a gentle tug for an acquaintance, but a real heave for a pal. And the idea is that if it's not a close

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.760
 friend, then you maybe don't trust them. Well, the way they put it was, for instance, if you're

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:52.400
 genital biting, which is something else they do, if it's someone you don't know very well,

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:57.760
 an over-enthusiastic bite can end a baboon's mating career. So you only...

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.360
 I can imagine, though. Probably just mistook it for a sausage from that phrase.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:10.720
 Here's another penisy thing about baboons. There was a baboon. No, there wasn't a baboon.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:18.240
 Called babby, because this was like an ancient Egyptian kind of god. I don't want to say that

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.640
 gods don't exist, but this one is probably a story. So there was a baboon called babby,

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:29.280
 and it was kind of the person who took you from the living world to the dead world

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:36.000
 in ancient Egypt, according to some stories. And because baboons have such high libidos and have

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.040
 his sex all the time and doing all this diddling, he's usually portrayed with a massive erection.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.360
 And sometimes when he would take the souls from the living world to the

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.560
 dead world, he would have to cross a river, and he would use his penis as the mast of the ferry.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:57.920
 He would tie a sail to it, and it would help him to get across the river stick, so whatever it was in Egypt.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.400
 That's more realistic than what I thought you were going to say, which is that he'd use it as a

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:07.680
 bridge for them to walk across. I thought you were going to say you had to take him by the penis,

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.280
 so he was your guide into the spirit world, and you just had to follow his knob, you know.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.720
 But then he's walking backwards, and so that would make him a terrible guide, wouldn't it?

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.080
 That's a really good point. Tor guides do walk backwards.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:24.480
 You know in London, when you see the tar guides, they've got a massive umbrella that they're holding

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:30.640
 up so everyone else can see them. If that was a baboon's penis, the world would be very different.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.840
 I reckon they'd get more custom. That's an idea.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:40.240
 Ancient Egyptian life with baboons seems, did you guys read the story, which again,

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.480
 I think it's one of those ones that sits across a lot of those fact sites on the internet, but

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.480
 supposedly, baboons used to be part of the police force in ancient Egypt.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.280
 And yeah, and there's hieroglyphics and examples on walls that show

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.560
 baboons that have sort of been let off after a criminal who's trying to escape, taking them down.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.800
 And we do have examples of this. So there's classical works where they would go around with

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.200
 the baboon on a leash, and if the person was a thief escaping in a marketplace, let them off the

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.360
 leash, and they would bite their leg and hold the criminal down.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.520
 If they only bite your leg, then you've done okay, haven't you?

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:23.040
 That's amazing, but can't be. I mean, do you mean, would they use the attack dogs, do we think?

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.760
 Yeah, like attack dogs. The police say, go get that guy, and then the three baboons have a 45-minute

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.120
 chat about the best route through the marketplace to perceive. I love it.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.520
 They're quite trainable. There are baboons that herd goats, apparently, and have done.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:43.920
 It's so cool. This is like first record. It seems to be in Namibia specifically,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:50.240
 but in the 1830s, then they were recorded of like, you know, they'll herd goats out and make sure

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.880
 goats don't sort of wander off track and stuff. At the end of the day, they'd herd them back into

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.720
 the compound. They'd raise an alarm if there's like a wolf on the horizon. They'd make a big

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:04.560
 shrieky noise. And in the 1960s, this was still happening, and there was this such sweet account

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:11.120
 of a baboon called Arla. Did you guys read about Arla? So this is in Namibia, and Arla's herding

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:17.360
 the goats of a farmer, and she's obsessed, according to this article, with reuniting parents with

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.520
 children. So sometimes the farmer will put the parent goats in one pen and the kids in another,

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.760
 because he just shoved them all separately. And Arla would leap into the kid's pen, because

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.240
 there'll be a kid bleeding out for his mum, would leap in, pick it up, and jump over and

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:35.200
 return it to its mother. To the extent that a farmer said, it's actually quite annoying,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.080
 because when a goat has twins, you try to foster one out to a different mother. But Arla would

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.960
 keep jumping in, picking it up and returning it to its birth, mum. Wow. This is so amazing.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.640
 So we're not believing that they were police forces in ancient Egypt, but we are capable of

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.440
 believing that. Jimi Hendrix's recording career started. There were goat herds doing family

00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:01.200
 reunions. The bear I heard about was all these baboons of the herding goats would often be seen

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.720
 riding the biggest of the goat back home, as they were herding it, like a cowboy riding a horse.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.360
 Yeah. There are photos of them riding, and we don't know if they chose the biggest,

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.840
 but there are certainly photos of them popping on the back. He would, wouldn't he, after a tough

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:22.320
 day's herding? Yeah. Photos of dogs on surfboards, but I don't think that it's kind of a regular

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:28.800
 thing that they did. But the farmer said that Arla would jump on top, pop on their backs.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:33.440
 They're quite fun-loving. I think you would. Wow. I don't know. I think of all this story that

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:40.400
 you've just told, the Occam's razor is that one farmer is a massive liar. That is the simplest

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.640
 explanation for that whole story, isn't it? I have faith in them baboons.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:54.720
 Okay. It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that

00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:01.280
 Ella Fitzgerald's voice was so pitch-perfect that musicians would tune their instruments to it.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:09.120
 Wow. That's a good voice. Yeah. This appeared in an NPR article that I was reading about Ella

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:15.680
 Fitzgerald's general voice technique and the love that people have for her voice, including

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:21.440
 all the band members that used to work with her. And they all talk about her voice in this really

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.640
 sort of otherworldly kind of way. There was one person in the band called Janice Siegel,

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.480
 who said that they were doing a few four-part harmonies, and then Ella would scat a couple

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.640
 of choruses, and then would turn to them and say, "Was that all right?" And she said it was like

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.200
 God-asking angels after he created the world. What did you think? The Grand Canyon? Could it

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.560
 use a little tweaking? They were just so in awe of this instrument that she had inside of her.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.360
 Oh, wow. And she was extraordinary. Yeah. I hadn't realised with Ella Fitzgerald that the

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:58.240
 thing seems to be how perfect her voice was. There's a lot of… I feel like sort of slight

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.480
 digs when people write about her. She didn't have the emotional depth and pain of a lot of blues

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.960
 and jazz things, but she could hit every note flawlessly, right? And her voice never ever

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.080
 failed or cracked. Amazing. Yeah. I was interested in this fact, because we had

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.600
 a really great conversation with Karen Gibson during our 20-hour marathon, who was the creator of

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.160
 the Kingdom Choir, who sang at Harry and Meghan's wedding. You should everyone go watch that

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.240
 chat on YouTube. It's really cool about gospel. But I suddenly realised I knew nothing about

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.640
 Ella Fitzgerald, and her story is pretty remarkable where she came from and how she became

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:36.320
 a big musician in the jazz era, where segregation was still massive and where at the height of her

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:41.440
 career, she was still having to come in through different doors to white people and not allowed

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.560
 to perform in certain places. And what's fascinating as well is that her first mega hit

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:53.120
 was a nursery rhyme that gave her her first number one. Yeah, so weird. And she had a number one hit

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:58.880
 with it before you could have billboard number one hits. And the way that you used to do that was

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:04.240
 sheet music. So you would release the sheet music to your song, and that was judged to be the most

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:08.560
 popular song. Also, I think it was that, and jukebox plays, wasn't it? I think where you used to

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.800
 help, that was billboard. Yes, yes, that's right. How incredibly disappointing when you bought the

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.000
 sheet music, went home and remembered that you did not have Ella Fitzgerald's voice.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:25.120
 That's true. Yeah, so much worse. Yeah, she had an amazing start. So I think she got that big hit

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.880
 in about 1938. But as you sort of started, her big break came in 1934, I think called amateur night

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.680
 at Harlem Apollo Theater. And it was the first year that that was happening. And it still goes on

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.800
 today, which is quite cool. And it's just amateurs go up and sing. And it was a bet she went with two

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.440
 friends. And they put their names in this hat. And you pick names out of a hat to choose who goes on

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:51.040
 stage. And Ella's name was pulled out of a hat. And she was really into dancing then, not nearly as

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.680
 much into singing. And she planned to do some dancing on stage. And there were some women

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.440
 called the Edward sisters who danced amazingly before her. And she lost confidence. She's very

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:06.480
 shy. And she got up on stage. And so she thought, okay, I'll sing instead. And I think she said,

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.800
 at one point, that it messed up first time, she couldn't really sing it properly, or she freaked

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.240
 out. And the crowd started sort of jeering and booing. MC paused gave her another go. She won

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.800
 first prize. Someone who was there danced called Norma Miller said, she shut us up so quickly,

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:29.920
 you could hear a rat piss on cotton. That's a great phrase. Worth reusing.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.840
 Why didn't that catch on? Why are we not using that in everyday language? That's great. Time to

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:41.920
 get it in circulation again. But yeah, and she won the prize. That was a kind of job before. Well,

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.600
 she was a she was only a girl at the time, wasn't she? But she she tap danced on the pavement,

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.960
 busking. And that's what what gave her the idea to do the amateur night at the Harlem Theatre.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.800
 Although apparently that was only one of her jobs. She also had a job doing errands for the mob,

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.840
 which I don't know what kind of errands the mob needed doing stuff running down to the post.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:06.080
 I think they have quite a lot of errands to do. And she was also a lookout for a brothel, wasn't

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:11.760
 she? I think I read that she she would stand outside the brothel. And if the police were coming,

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.000
 she'd be like, get your trousers back on, everyone. The police are coming. Yeah, or something.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.680
 But she said it in such a beautiful voice that everyone.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:27.520
 One of Ella Fitzgerald's most famous recordings. I'm sure you guys all read about this was in

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:34.240
 Berlin live in Berlin, which she won the best female vocal performance and best vocal performance

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.840
 for a single and an album at the Grammy Awards. And it was mostly for this song,

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:45.120
 Mac the Knife, which everyone will know. And halfway through, she at least pretends to or

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.000
 actually forgets all the lyrics. Brian, if you listen to it, it's amazing. She starts singing

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.840
 the first verse, she sings fine. And then the second bit, she does a little bit. And then she

00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:00.080
 goes, Oh, what's the next chorus to this song now? This is the one now. I don't know. But it's a

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:07.280
 swinging tune. And it's a hit tune. So we tried to do Mac the Knife. And she's literally just like,

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:12.800
 she just completely made up the lyrics. And then towards the end, she just does her normal scat

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.840
 singing, where she's just like, boob-ups away to the end. But I mean, it is an incredible,

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.280
 incredible recording. If anyone hasn't heard it, you've got to listen to it.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:27.360
 But she won a Grammy for that, for that recording. Yeah, yeah. Did she? That is extraordinary.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.200
 Well, if you think about it, you've not just sung it, you've written a song on the fly as well,

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.240
 haven't you? In the way. I know, you've got a co-writer credit, all of a sudden.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:41.840
 Hang on, mate. What? The lyrics sound like they could do with some work. I mean, I appreciate

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:47.040
 that it sort of rhymes or whatever. Well done, her on the spot. Well, she rhymes now with now,

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.760
 so I'm not sure. It's not perfect. There you go. It's what I'm saying.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.840
 I wrote her a bit tree in the Washington Post, where I wrote a couple of different bit trees.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.600
 But I love this. This is not really a fact about Ella Fitzgerald per se. It's more a fact about

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:07.520
 Washington Post bit trees in the 1990s. That's what most of my research is about. I just found

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.400
 this amazing. So there's the whole bit tree, obviously. And then at the end of it, there's

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.160
 this one paragraph, which just says, "To sample different aspects of Ella Fitzgerald's music,

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:20.480
 the post offers three sound bites. They can be heard by calling post-haste at 202-334-9000

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.480
 and pressing the number listed after each selection. To hear a tiscata task it, press

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:29.600
 8151." And you just had a dial and obituary service, which I think is brilliant. Why don't we do

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:34.080
 that anymore? That is such a good idea. That's amazing. A number of reasons why we don't do it

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.320
 anymore, but it is amazing. Did you try calling the number? I didn't, no, because it's in America,

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.800
 and I thought I'd probably get charged loads. It's not worth it. That's a rather than a TV show

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.680
 of obituary. So that feels like it would work, wouldn't it? It's a Radio 4 show, which is called,

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.080
 I can't remember what it's called. It's called They're Dead or something. It's all from last week.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.880
 And it's a really great show because it's several different types each week. I don't think it's a

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:59.120
 TV show. There should be. It feels like it would be brilliant. Yeah, like you would say you'd be

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.040
 celebrating the people's lives and then you would show clips of what they did and stuff. I think

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.080
 that'd be amazing. But I think this is your life. The key emotional thing in this is your life is

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.880
 that they get the famous person and then they bring out all the people from their life. Whereas

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.280
 you'd have them there in a coffin and then all the famous people they knew in life just

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.120
 they'd be crying because it's a week later. Maybe you could do it a while after. Yeah,

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:25.760
 like a year. It's been a year since this person died or something. Yeah. Got the coffin still in

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:30.880
 the room. No, no. Oh, okay. Sorry. Right. We're just dropping that. Okay. That was never part.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.800
 Doesn't feel like a crucial format for you. It was never part of my father. It's the second

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.160
 piece of the set. I don't know what you're talking about. It's the main desk that the host is on.

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:44.160
 Maybe the big reveal is the person has died. So everyone comes out and it's like,

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.440
 you've got to work out what connects you all. Why are you all here? Oh, who's not here? Who's not

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:58.240
 here? Yeah. That's why it's cold. Oh my God. Oh, this is turned from heartwarming to the card

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:08.080
 very quickly. On Ella? Yeah. Yeah. Ella Fitzgerald, the thing about her that I've wondered about

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.160
 before. So I was glad to have it confirmed in this fact is that she really doesn't look how you

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:20.080
 expect her to look based on the fact that she was the biggest star of her era. She and she never

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:25.840
 did. So she always was kind of frumpy. She was thought it was a bit too chubby. She didn't look

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:31.200
 glamorous at all. Even when she won that first prize in 1934, the prize was meant to be that the

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.160
 winner got to perform at the Apollo Theater for the next week every day. And they didn't let her

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:41.440
 because she looked so scruffy. She was homeless at the time. And she was wearing like men's work boots

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:48.720
 and like a really raggedy dress. And she actually was spotted, I think, that night or at similar

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.720
 time by Chick Webb. And it was Chick Webb was the band leader whose band she joined, her first

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.440
 partner. But when he first saw her, he looked at her and said, you're not putting that on my stage.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:04.320
 And his band said like she smelled like she hadn't bathed for a year. And she was just so scruffy

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.960
 that they thought we can't be, can't be doing that. And then she sang and they went, they decided

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.560
 they could put her on the stage. But yeah, she doesn't, she hasn't got the look, has she?

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:19.840
 Oh, and that was, was the thing about Marilyn Monroe. I read that basically Marilyn Monroe said

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:25.440
 this woman has the most amazing voice. You need to put her on stage to, to some owner. And he was

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.440
 like, no, I'm not doing that. And she said, well, if you do, then I'll sit on the front row for the

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:34.640
 next, you know, two weeks or something. And you'll guarantee that all the newspapers will be here

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:41.200
 because they'll want to see me sitting on the front row. Yeah. Yeah. That was, yeah. So that was

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.600
 Ella Fitzgerald says that Marilyn Monroe was sort of responsible for her breaking through. And that

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:50.240
 was a mixture of things. It was, it was her look. It was also, you know, the fact she was black,

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.520
 the whole segregation thing. They didn't want black performers headlining these big Las Vegas

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.400
 showcases. And Marilyn was the person who said, well, yeah, exactly. I'll sit in the front row.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:05.920
 And then as soon as her voice got heard, Frank Sinatra was coming to the shows and Judy Garland

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:11.200
 was coming to the shows. And suddenly it was, hang on, who's this woman that is pulling this

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.480
 A-list crowd to come and see her? And yeah, Ella, Ella always said it was Marilyn Monroe.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:23.280
 She's a bit like Susan Boyle, wouldn't you say? She's, is that not fair? Because like that's what,

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.960
 that was the point of Susan Boyle when she was first on the talent show, wasn't it? That she

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:32.400
 didn't look like a singer, but then she had an amazing voice. Yeah. I saw Susan Boyle once

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:37.600
 in Edinburgh. She was just, she just walked past me. Oh yeah. Or I walked past her. But

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.840
 memories may vary of the event. We definitely walked past each other. One of you was standing

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.240
 still then in that case, right? So we were both moving. I've mis-told even this incredibly

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:52.080
 short story. You walked past each other. We walked past each other. Yeah. And I don't think

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.960
 memories vary of the event, Andy, because I'm fairly sure there's only one person who has

00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:01.200
 a memory of it. She's always mentioning it in interviews, Anna. How dare you? She's constantly

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:07.120
 saying. One of her big inspirations when she was a child was a man called Earl Snake Hips Tucker.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:14.800
 This was one, it's really sleazy laugh, James. I was just thinking about snakes and whether

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:22.000
 they have hips or not. Great points. And I think they might have very, very small residual hips.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.280
 And I think some snakes, you can see, they have tiny little leg bones that come off them.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:34.160
 So did this man have an extremely small residual legs? Yeah. Yeah. He's known after the tiny hips

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:40.400
 of snakes. No, he wasn't. Well, why did they give him that name then? I think, okay. Well,

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:45.680
 I can tell you he was also known as the human boa constrictor. Oh, so he killed people by wrapping

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:51.280
 his legs around their neck. Okay. You're really applying too much biological knowledge to what

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.840
 was a bit more of a casual nickname. So he was a dancer constrictor because his Latin name was

00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:03.280
 the same as his common name. Right. I think it sounds like he was hung like an ancient Egyptian

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.960
 baboon of the afterworld. Okay. You've all got your very quintessentially you interpretations

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:14.000
 of the reason for this name. None of them are correct. Okay. He did a dance where you wiggle

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.600
 your hips around and your body looks like a snake. And it's where you sort of like you're

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:21.680
 standing with your feet together. And then you move one knee forward and back after the other.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.440
 And it makes your hips rotate. I was looking up some more of the great singers of the 20th

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.360
 century. Okay. Just out of curiosity. And did you know that in 1978, Dame Barbara Cartland

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:37.360
 released an album of love songs? Gee. Yeah. Backed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.440
 It was her singing. And there's a spoken word intro to everyone. Was she a good singer?

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:47.040
 She wasn't great. I haven't listened to all the whole thing. But the little bit I've heard to

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.360
 does it like Ella Ella Fitzgerald didn't need to worry about her crown being taken away by

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:57.520
 Dame Barb's. I found one review on a quite obscure website, but a great review it said,

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:02.480
 "With such a lushly orchestrated backing, her limited vocal abilities stick out like a bookmark

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:09.280
 in a well-thumbed novel. Her feeble efforts to stay in a key entirely unsuitable for her

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:15.040
 result in a curious strained whimper, not unlike the howl of her trademark lap dog when it's past

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.600
 dinner time." Well, it's weird that that's where you'll search for greatest female singers of the

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:25.920
 20th century. I searched for Barbara Cartland news a lot. So that's probably why Google makes me better.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:34.960
 So she gave her last concert in 1991. So this is Ella now, right? Sorry, back onto Ella. Yeah,

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.160
 I'll save my Barbara Cartland material for another episode. So Ella Fitzgerald gave her

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.360
 last concert in 1991. And she had a bit of a sad ending. She was sort of very ill near the end of

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:50.960
 her days. But I do love in all the stories that you hear about her. She was relentless with wanting

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.440
 to sort of carry on singing. Her voice was even getting worse and worse as she got older, but she

00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:00.800
 still just wanted to be on stage. And at one point, I think it was through diabetes, she had to have

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:06.320
 her legs amputated below the knees. And when she had her first leg amputated, her friends thought,

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.520
 "God, that's probably it." And a friend said to her, "Okay, I guess we're pausing now." And her

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:17.120
 response was, "What? There's nothing wrong with my throat. I'm not singing with my leg. I love that."

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:22.560
 And she was back on the stage just doing her thing. And yeah, just an astonishingly determined

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:29.040
 character who earned the role of second best singer just behind Barbara.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:37.200
 She married someone called Cigarette. Well, she married someone whose nickname was Cigarette.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:44.080
 And he was called Benny Cornigay. And she married him in 1941. It was quite short-lived because

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.240
 her managers and bandmates thought he was a nasty piece of work. And so they hired private

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:53.040
 investigators to look into him. And indeed, he did have a criminal past. And so they told her to

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:59.040
 divorce him or annul the marriage. But one of the bandmates did remember they all called him Cigarette.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:04.080
 And he didn't know why. He said, "He wasn't tall or thin or anything. We just all called him Cigarette."

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.160
 He always wore a hat that was on fire, didn't he?

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:18.240
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show. And that is James.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:24.640
 Okay, my fact this week is that as part of their rivalry, Arnold Schwarzenegger tricked Sylvester

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:31.200
 Stallone into making Stop All My Mom Will Shoot. Stallone later described the movie as one of the

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:38.960
 worst films in the entire solar system. I cannot believe we are talking about Stop All My Mom Will

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.960
 Shoot. What? I can't. I mean, finally, I'm dying for this.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:51.760
 Well, this is a fact sent to me by MK Chris on Twitter after we mentioned Stop All My Mom Will

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:57.600
 Shoot a couple of times over the last year or so. It was my favorite film, which I've never

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:03.040
 actually seen. And it's just like a go-to joke film. And then yesterday, I actually watched it.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.880
 I watched the film yesterday. Did you? Yeah.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:12.000
 James, how was it? I thought it wasn't that bad, actually. I mean, it was kind of fine. It was

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.440
 kind of, I did laugh a couple of times. There's some weird bits where some kind of funny thing

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:22.080
 happens and they have this kind of music in the background going, "Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo."

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:27.440
 That is so strange. It's so weird. I watched it yesterday, too. And that's one of the main features.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:32.160
 The best bit is where Sylvester Stallone actually says the name of the title. He says,

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.120
 "Stop All My Mom Will Shoot!" Which is like, I imagine if I was in the theater in the 80s or

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:41.600
 whenever it came out, I would have done a big cheer all the 90s. And then the weirdest thing

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.880
 about it, I thought, was the very, very last joke, which kind of wraps the whole thing up,

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:53.440
 is Estelle Getty saying, "Oh, this guy, he shot his mother!" That's the big joke at the end of the

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.120
 whole thing. And then Stallone makes a face and like, "Oh, well, I can kind of see why he did,

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.120
 because my mom's so annoying. I can't believe, James, you've just amical-edited, stop all my

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:10.000
 mom will shoot." I think it's a piece of classic work. And if you haven't seen it by now, you

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.680
 probably never will see it. I only got yourself to blame. People will have invested 84 minutes of

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.720
 their life into this film. I'm for you to just spoil it like that.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.320
 You're saying that assuming they watch the film. If they read the novel, it'll be even longer.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:27.200
 It's so short. It's just so short.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:27.920
 It's like, quickly.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.440
 That's got to be a redeeming feature. I mean, they must have known when they made it right.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.480
 We've made a piece of shit here, but should we at least leave it for too long?

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.120
 I think it's not that. The first few minutes, I genuinely laughed a few times. But can I just

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.760
 quickly say what it is first, like, for people-

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.720
 About the fact itself.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:48.720
 Yeah, I guess so. Basically, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone had this big rivalry

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:55.440
 because they were two main strong men of Hollywood. And we might get to a few of the things that

00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:01.920
 happened between them. But Schwarzenegger apparently leaked out that he was really interested in doing

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:09.040
 this movie because he wanted Sylvester Stallone to do it instead. And so he said, "Oh, I'm really

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.640
 interested." He said in the press, "Yeah, I'm really interested. I'm up for this. I'm up for

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:18.000
 this." And then he told the studio that he wanted loads and loads and loads of money.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.240
 So the studio then went to Sylvester Stallone and said, "Arnold Schwarzenegger is really

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:27.440
 interested in this. Would you be interested in maybe undercutting him?" And he said, "Yeah,

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:32.880
 absolutely. I'd love to stick it to him." And then he made this thing and he said that

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.280
 it's one of the worst films in the entire solar system, including alien productions we've never

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:44.160
 seen. He said, "A flat worm could write a better script." And he said, "In some countries, China,

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:49.200
 I believe, running the movie once a week on government television has lowered the birth rate to zero."

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:55.040
 Oh, that's not correct. That's an amazing line.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:59.440
 He shouldn't have taken it. He's only got himself to blame. If he knew it was a terrible script,

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.800
 then, you know, that's where Petty Rivalry gets you.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.640
 You never know, though, right? You never know what's going to hit. It was that period of film

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.520
 where these things will either just be massive or…

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:14.320
 I think a decent edit could have worked wonders with that. I think the, you know, the Zack Snyder

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.400
 cut of Stop My Mum Will Shoot might really add sort of tension and drama and comedy.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:23.360
 But there are so many interesting things in it. So there's, if you want to see Sylvester Stallone

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:30.080
 wearing a nappy, that features in the film. Halfway in. But the best thing for me is, James,

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:36.400
 you'll remember this scene, is where his mum is trying to buy him the gun and she ends up accidentally

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:43.440
 buying him an Uzi, basically. Anyway, the Gunstore Clark is played by Richard Schiff.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.800
 And if anyone listening is a fan of the West Wing, Richard Schiff played Toby Ziegler,

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:54.720
 an incredibly prestigious role in maybe one of the most prestigious TV shows ever made.

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:59.760
 This was just a few years after he'd done Stop My Mum Will Shoot. But he brings such,

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:05.360
 you know, gravitas to the role of unnamed Gunstore Clark, after about 20 minutes of the

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:09.200
 movie, that I don't think the film ever really recovers from his brilliant, quiet, five-line

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:14.560
 turn in this role. It's like, oh, wow, he was so good as the Gunstore Clark that the rest of the

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:19.360
 film is kind of a bit of a disappointment for me. Does he have the same sort of long suffering,

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:25.120
 slightly misanthropic, but right? He doesn't. I really think it might be the same character. But,

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.760
 you know, in between, there was some event which turned him into the press. Do you think they live

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:37.200
 in the same universe then? 100% is the same cinematic universe. Wow, that's exciting. Also,

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.840
 there's a moment where Estelle Getty is sitting on the plane and she holds up a black and white

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:48.480
 picture of Sylvester Stallone as a young boy, and that exact same picture is used in Rocky.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:53.520
 So, there could be a suggestion that they're twins who were leading these different lives.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:58.800
 Well, that makes sense, because one of the motivations for Sylvester Stallone taking this

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.960
 film was that he'd seen, apparently, this is what he said in an interview, that Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:09.040
 was branching out with, for instance, films like Kindergarten Cop and Twins. And so, he felt that

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:14.080
 he should branch out in the same way. So, maybe the twin thing was his way of emulating that.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:20.160
 Right. Yeah. Another one of the terrible movies he did was starring alongside podcast favourite

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:25.600
 Dolly Parton, of course. Rhinestone, which he was when he was... He was this, sorry, Anna?

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.440
 Sylvester Stallone, sorry. So, he was in Rhinestone. And when he did an interview where

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.960
 members of the public asked him questions, they said, "Are there any films you wish you hadn't

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:39.920
 done?" And he sort of immediately had a very long list. Top, of course, was Stop While I Mum Will

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:45.760
 Shoot. Get Carter, he did a remake of that, Bad Idea, Oscar-driven, detox. And then he said,

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:50.080
 "Rhinestone," which I wish had been "Romancing the Stone," which I thought a strange thing to say.

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.360
 But actually, he was offered that same year "Romancing the Stone," which he turned down

00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:00.880
 in favour of the lesser stone film release, Rhinestone. And "Romancing the Stone" was...

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:06.240
 Do you think he was... Do you think he was stereotyped as doing... After he did Rocky,

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:10.240
 do you think we just have to put him in stone-based movies from now on?

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:15.760
 Yeah. And he's Sylvester Stallone. So, it's kind of persuasive.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:21.520
 Yeah. I think that's right. Someone else who worked on the film, Stop While I Mum Will Shoot,

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:26.640
 was the person who coordinated the action sequences. Now, I haven't seen the film, guys.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.640
 So, they're quite... Oh, they're pretty amazing.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.720
 Please. Any questions? Yeah, they're pretty... They come thick and fast.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:39.280
 Great. Okay. So, he had a lot to do. So, he was a guy called Evan Lurie. And he starred,

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.920
 Evan Lurie, or Lurie, starred in a film called American Kickboxer 2.

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.600
 Oh, great movie.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.960
 Have you actually seen that?

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:47.440
 Of course, I've seen it.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:52.480
 Yeah. Well, wait. So, Dan, have you seen the prequel to American Kickboxer 2?

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.600
 Yeah. It wouldn't make sense if I mob straight into American Kickboxer 2.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.960
 The prequel to American Kickboxer 2. I don't know. Just say American Kickboxer.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:03.040
 Incorrect. I'm not going to say the name because it's not true.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:09.840
 You've fallen right into my trap. Right. American Kickboxer 1 was released in 1991.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.400
 American Kickboxer 2 was released in 1993.

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:20.160
 2 had nothing to do with 1. Although 1 did have a sequel, but that sequel was called To the Death.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:25.760
 And then a totally different studio released a totally unrelated film called American Kickboxer 2.

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.400
 That's weird. So, wait a minute. So, American Kickboxer 2 didn't have a prequel. It just went

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:35.280
 straight in as American Kickboxer 2. No. Sorry. So, it was a trick question. You should have said,

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:38.960
 no, obviously not, Anna, because it didn't have a prequel. Everyone knows that.

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:44.880
 Estelle Getty, who plays the other role in Stop on My Mum Will Shoot alongside Sylvester Stallone,

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:50.960
 she has played not just the mother of Sylvester Stallone, but also the mother of Cher and the

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:56.080
 mother of Barry Manilow in various films. And she basically says that she always gets

00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:00.800
 typecast as a mother in any single thing because she was a mother in Golden Girls.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:06.480
 So, she was a mother in the Golden Girls. And actually, I think she might have been younger

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.760
 than some of the people she was supposed to be the mother of. She was, yeah.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:14.560
 But she like had this kind of character as just being this typical kind of Jewish overbearing

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:19.840
 mother, which she then took into almost every play. She said she I played mothers in plays

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:24.720
 by Neil Simon, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams, mother to everybody but a tiller the

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.440
 hun. Wow. Do you think she was angling for the a tiller the hun role, Mrs. Hun?

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:33.120
 I want to complete this. Stop on My Hunnel Shoot.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:41.840
 I read Estelle Getty's book that she wrote when I was about 14 years old because I heard that she

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:47.680
 was a comedy actor in a big sitcom like Golden Girls. So, I assumed that she was like one of the

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.600
 hot comedians of America. And this was a time when I was younger where I thought I just want to read

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:56.800
 everything. So, I read this whole book and it really was bizarre. And I guess it'll get good.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.840
 And it never quite did. But I think I'm one of the few people in their 30s who can say they've

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:08.880
 read Estelle Getty's book. I think that's a real error sentence. The thing is, Andy and James,

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:13.280
 you do mad things like watching Stop on My Hunnel Shoot for the sake of research.

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:19.760
 Dan actually just chooses to do this stuff for fun. Yeah. Her biography was called If I Know Then

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:26.640
 What I Know Now. And it came out I think after she'd won her Golden Globe maybe or an M.E. or

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.440
 something like that. And she said after 50 years in the business, I'm an overnight success.

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:35.760
 Yes. She got her first named role when she was over 60.

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:42.160
 Her first role was she was credited in a film and then she goes on to win Grammys and Emmys.

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:48.640
 So, there's hope for her. She's very good in this film, I must say. She's overlooked by the academy.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:57.200
 As the entire film was. So, should we mention this huge rivalry that happened between

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:02.320
 Stelone and Schwarzenegger? Yeah. The first moment where it properly became a thing was

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:06.960
 at the Golden Globes. Sylvester Stelone was nominated for a number of awards for Rocky

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.960
 and they were sat very near each other, I believe on opposite ends of a table.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.680
 And Rocky just kept losing the awards through the night. And every time they lost an award,

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:20.640
 Stelone would catch Schwarzenegger's eye and Schwarzenegger would be pulling a sort of smug

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:27.040
 kind of face. You shouldn't win it anyway. And it got to the point where Stelone was

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:34.880
 so intimidated by this that he picked up a giant bowl of flowers, a big vase, and he chucked it

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:39.200
 at Schwarzenegger and he said they had tulips and lilies and everything going everywhere.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:46.880
 And that was the start of it. That was the moment that instigated what was a decade-long rivalry

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.800
 between the two of them, where they took every opportunity to get one up on each other.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:57.360
 Of all the, you know, things you want to throw to show off your testosterone and masculinity,

00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.240
 a vase of tulips strikes me as not the first choice.

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:05.840
 Especially as later down the road, where they would deliberately have movies that would have a

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:11.760
 bigger gun than the previous guy's movie. I love that idea. That Schwarzenegger would be in a film

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:16.880
 with a kind of a 12-inch gun and then Stelone would come in with a 15-inch gun and they get

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.120
 bigger and bigger and bigger until they had to mount all the guns on the helicopters and tanks

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:27.040
 so that they built. Well, that was the thing I think one of them was saying in an interview and

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:30.880
 this really resonated with me because I always wondered, I've never seen something like that.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:35.280
 Rambo, so if Schwarzenegger had a movie with a sword, he would make sure it was a massive

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:42.000
 sword. And in Rambo, Rambo's knife is ginormous. It's just way bigger than any kind of knife you

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.920
 would ever have. And supposedly, that was made specifically at the request of Sylvester Stelone

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:53.120
 because he was like, "I need the biggest knife. I need a bigger than Schwarzenegger." And if you

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:58.000
 see it, it's a memory from Charles. I'm always like, "That's a ridiculously novelty size knife."

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:05.040
 And it turns out it's the rivalry that led to it. You know why? Yeah. You know, Rambo was named after

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:11.120
 an apple. Really? Yeah. What? Could be that the knife was just for cutting the apple. It was named

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:17.200
 after Rambo apples, which apples in America, which in turn are named after a guy called Peter

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:23.920
 Gunnison Rambo, who founded New Sweden, a colony in America in 1637. This guy, Peter Gunnison Rambo,

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:29.760
 was named after Rambo Get, which is where he was from, which means Raven Mountain in Gothenburg,

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:37.440
 and Rambo's codename in Rambo is Raven. Wow. That was a fact sent in by a listener who has too much

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:44.160
 time on their hands and spotted it. This whole thing has been blown wide open. And what, stopping

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:49.200
 my mum was shooting in the same world as what was the thing, Andy? The West Wing. The West Wing.

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:53.520
 Oh, this is all going crazy. The other thing I thought, which is kind of weird, is you know how

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.640
 we were saying that if one of them had a gun, which was a certain size, the other one had to go one

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:08.480
 bigger. Well, in Twins, Schwarzenegger worked with Danny DeVito, who was 1.47 meters tall. Whereas

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:14.560
 in Stop at My Mum Will Shoot, Stallone worked with Estelle Getty, who was 1.49 meters tall.

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:20.240
 So he had to go two centimetres taller in his supporting actor, didn't he? I think that's what

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:25.440
 that was. That's so funny. That's a really good point. Because a lot of the comedy comes from

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:29.840
 the fact that Estelle Getty just looks so tiny next to Stallone. And it is hilarious when they

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:34.800
 keep showing them next to each other. It stays hilarious all the way through throughout the

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:40.160
 84 minutes of screen time. He's a really fast writer, Stallone. That's the other thing. So he

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:44.480
 claimed to have written the first Rocky film in three days. He wrote it and starred in it.

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:50.640
 He wrote Rocky 2 in 29 hours, according to him. And then later on, he claimed he wrote the cop

00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:59.040
 thriller Cobra in 16 hours, which can't really fast. That's amazing. Wasn't it the thing with

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:06.480
 Rocky 1, the first one that he wrote it? And he took it to a studio and they said, "Yeah, we'll

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:11.120
 buy it off you for the equivalent of like a million quid or something, but we don't want you to be in

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:15.840
 it. We want Bert Reynolds or someone to be in it." I don't know who they said. But he said, "No,

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:20.160
 I need to be in it. Otherwise, you're not having it." And so he wouldn't take the money. And at

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:24.240
 that time, he had no money in the bank. He had like $100 in the bank or something.

00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:29.360
 So that's the story. But later on, it turned out that that was a bit of a PR thing to make

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:34.240
 him seem like this big underdog. And actually, the studio had always accepted he was going to be

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.760
 in it. They spent six months helping him to get the script and the film into shape.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:44.000
 It was such a compelling story. That's such a nice idea that he stuck to his guns and said,

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.160
 "I don't have any money, but I have to be in this."

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:50.400
 But it doesn't work because why would they have to put so much time and effort into fixing the

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:56.720
 script that he'd already spent 16 hours writing? Do you know what he later? He later made an arm

00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:02.080
 wrestling version of Rocky called Over the Top, was it? Yes, of course, then.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:06.560
 So that's a description of the movie, but what was it called?

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:12.240
 And he doesn't know it in the course of his research. This is the amazing thing. He didn't

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:17.440
 need to research this fact at all. Over the top, the one liner on IMDb. I'll say it just to save

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:23.120
 Dan's breath, but Tough Trucker Lincoln Hawke, he plays Lincoln Hawke, is determined to win back

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:29.440
 his son and triumph at the World Arm Wrestling Championships. Wow. The reason I know that movie

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:34.160
 so well is I used to work for the BBC for the quiz department developing shows, and we'd

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:39.920
 managed to get to the boss of BBC. We're in the room with the top dog of BBC pitching the show,

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:44.160
 and he wasn't buying it, and we needed a moment to sell it, like something big. And the guy

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:49.120
 who was on our team, who we really hoped would not speak during the meeting, decided to speak,

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:54.480
 and he said, "Can I tell you, Peter, Peter, it's like the last scene in Over the Top,

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:59.600
 when you don't think, and all of us just went, 'I cannot believe you are referencing

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:05.040
 the most obscure Sylvester Stallone movie ever made in our golden moment. We needed the hero

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.680
 moment, and you came up with that." "Dan, I want to meet the person who can be sat in a room with

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:17.280
 you, and he is the one who's making these obscure references to shit movies." "Yeah,

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:21.840
 stop referring to yourself in the third person, guys." "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry, yeah. I shut

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:24.960
 him up. I was like, sorry, Peter, Peter, what he meant was, you know the end scene of American

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:33.040
 Kickboxer 2?" "We haven't, guys, so, yeah, whatever." "I've just got one last tiny thing.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.040
 This is an interview Bob Hoskins did with The Guardian in 2011.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:42.560
 They asked him three questions. Here we go. What is the worst job you've done?"

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:48.880
 He said, "Super Mario Brothers." They then said, "What has been your biggest disappointment?

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:54.640
 Super Mario Brothers, if you could edit your past, what would you change?" He said,

01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:00.400
 "I wouldn't do Super Mario Brothers." "Dan, you must have seen that. Is it any good?"

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:06.080
 "A brilliant film. Brilliant film." "Absolutely classic." "Did he play a mushroom or something?"

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.680
 "No, he's Mario. Yeah, yeah, he's a plumber in New York, I think, and they get taken down. It's

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.680
 quite dark. It's really sort of like Ninja Turtles style movie. Wonderful. Wonderful."

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:22.000
 "Yeah, that's obviously a dog film, Ninja Turtles." "Wow, wait till we show you Shindler's less, Dan."

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:30.160
 "Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to
