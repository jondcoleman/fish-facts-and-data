00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, this week coming to you live from Tumbridge Wells.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 This bit was actually meant to be coming to you live from Tumbridge Wells, but, um, full disclosure, we forgot to press the record button.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 So, uh, we actually missed the start of my intro, but that doesn't matter. Let's just do it again, and we'll seamlessly edit into the room.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 So close your eyes, picture that you're sitting in the assembly hall in Tumbridge Wells, the lights have gone down, and the four dorks are about to come on stage. Here we go.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Tumbridge Wells.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 [ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 My name is Dash Shriver, and I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that the guy who invented Space Invaders really struggles to get past the first level of Space Invaders.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 [ Laughter ]

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Oh, my God. This is true. This was invented by a guy called Tomohiro Nishikado, and he's an amazing inventor, but he's terrible at video games.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 And so much so that when he invented it in 1978, he kind of tried to make it easier just so he could get to the end, and they all went, "No, that's a terrible game."

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 He does sound very cool. He invented the game, but he also designed the artwork, he did the sounds, and he built a customized computer to run the game on.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 So he did everything.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Yeah, and when he first released this game, there was a little process where they showed it to people and so on, and it didn't get good feedback.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 They thought, "No, this is not that great." And then the game was released, and it just exploded. It was really massive in Japan.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 All these stories started coming out, so there was a story in Japan, soon after the release, a 12-year-old boy held up a bank with a shotgun, and he didn't want any notes.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 He just wanted coins, and he did more coins for the arcade.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Did that not happen? Did that happen?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 I think that possibly did happen, but there was a whole raft of stories where they were talking about the fact that there was 100 yen coin, there was a shortage of them in Japan because just too many coins were being used, and I think that was a rumor.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 I think it might be true that in some small areas they did run out for a short amount of time, but then over the years that has come into, they completely ran out of 100 yen coins in Japan.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 It broke the economy, didn't it? It's what caused the downturn of the Japanese economy in the 90s.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 The first ever World Championship in any video game that was a really big one was Space Invaders. It was in 1980. There were more than 10,000 participants, and the winner was a 16-year-old called Rebecca Heineman.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Rebecca Heineman is really, really interesting. She had quite a difficult childhood because she would like to find out that she was transsexual, and she had to live in a dumpster for a little while.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 She got kicked out of home, but she put all of her energy into video games, and she didn't realize how good she was because she didn't really have the self-worth, this is what she says.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 She started playing in the regional heats, and she got bored really, really quickly playing against this guy, and she said, "I got bored so quickly, I started talking to him and saying, 'How's the weather? What's it like here?'"

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 This is while she's playing, okay? And slowly people are getting knocked out, knocked out, knocked out. She's still just chatting away.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 In the end, she got to the very, very end of the game, and they said, "Watch your score." They said, "88,000 points." And she says, "Is that good?" And it was so good that it was double the amount of points that the runner-up in the competition got.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Wow.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 And the tournament refused to post her score because they thought it would intimidate other players.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Wow.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 Wow.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Isn't that amazing?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Did she go on to become a game designer?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 A programmer, yeah.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 That is actually, I'd say that's more scary if the score is redacted.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 If I was playing tennis against someone, and I said, "Oh, how'd you do in your last match?" And he said, "You don't want to know."

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 I'd be more, actually more frightened.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Yeah.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 I'd assume it just spelled out a rude word, like "boob" or something.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Yeah, it was called "88,008."

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Yeah.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 I don't know if it meant Andy's tennis, just shit.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 What?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 I thought it was a tennis score.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 This is a distraction. The other day, Dan told me a funny thing about when he plays tennis, which is that he imagines that he's on center court.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 He imagines he's on center court, and he's got this great crowd cheering him on.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And that's how he psychs himself up for the game, okay?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, really exciting.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Okay, the next time I played tennis, I tried this out, okay?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 I thought, right, I'm on center court at Wimbledon, and I lost the crowd.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 I genuinely, within five seconds, lost the crowd, and they were hostile because I'd hit a ball the wrong way, or I don't know, hit a ballboy or something.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 And they were on the other guy's side.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 You played tennis against Andy as well, haven't you, Anna?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 And I think you won redacted love, redacted love.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Anna actually did win, very, yeah.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Do you like the way you say Anna actually did win, in case people were thinking James was joking there?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Space Invaders was made by a company called Taito in Japan.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 And the company Taito was founded by a Ukrainian Jewish businessman in 1944.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 He was called Michael Kogan, and they originally sold wigs and hog bristles.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Okay, then that company almost went out of business, so they decided to become the first company to sell vodka.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Sorry, can I ask, were they selling wigs and then wigs for pigs?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Is that what that was?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 Pig wigs, yeah.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Why was there hog bristles?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 I suppose if you're making wigs, hog bristles, maybe they use the same machine?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 It's like for people to make their own, either you can buy a wig, or you can make your own wig out of these hog bristles.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 They also made floor coverings, so maybe they're the same stuff that they're making carpets with.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 They also make wigs and pig wigs.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 A doormat made of hog bristles sounds like an extremely luxurious one.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 Yeah, but one made of two pays, sounds a bit weird.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Oh, God, yeah.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Anyway, then they became the first company to make vodka in Japan.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 And that did okay, but not that well.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 Then they went into peanut vending machines, then into perfume machines, and then into video games.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 Wow, very cool, finally landed on it.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Sorry, did Nintendo start it off with...

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Love hotels.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Love hotels, yeah.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 Yeah, they did.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 Which hotels in Japan that you rent by the quarter of an hour...

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Is it once a year you play Tennyson?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 It's very nice, very nice.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 You know, you rent them for a quarter of an hour or...

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 About three minutes.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 You know, Kanye West, the first ever music that he created, the first ever beats,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 was for a video game that he created as well when he was 12 years old.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Yeah, so he said, "The first beat I did was in seventh grade on my computer.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 I got into doing beats for the video game I used to try and make.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 The main character was a giant penis.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 So it was based on himself.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 It was like Mario Brothers, but the ghosts were like, "Veginers.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 You have to draw in and program every little step.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 It literally took me all night to do a step because the penis, you know, had little feet and eyes."

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 That's the first ever music he created for a video game based on the walking penis with eyes

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 that was eating vaginas.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 How did he know how to draw a vagina?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 I don't believe he knew what a vagina looked like.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 12-year-old Kanye West.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 And his penis has feet and eyes.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Christ knows what a vagina was.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 We're going to have to move on in a sec to our next fact.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 James, you're learning Russian.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Have you heard of the game Repka Siloma?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 My kind of learning Russian doesn't really go into playing video games.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Okay.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Well, it's a Soviet-era arcade game where the aim of the game is to pull a mechanical turnip to demonstrate your strength.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 I know the story it's based on.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 It's based on a story?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Yeah, there's like a famous story in Russian literature and I think it did come over to Europe a bit where

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 there's a big turnip in the ground and everyone's trying to pull it.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 And there's like a big pile of the farmer and the farmer's wife and the farmer's kids

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 and then the dog pulls and the cat pulls and in the end it's just like a little mouse pulls

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 and that pulls up the turnip and that's communism.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Wow.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Oh!

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 I just understood this game and communism at the same time.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 That's great.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 [Music]

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 It is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 My fact is that during the Cold War there was a Soviet spy in London who contacted his handlers by throwing

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 a copy of Men Only magazine over a garden hedge.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 This is from an article about the National Archives who sporadically released spy papers

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 when enough time has passed and this was a batch of papers released in 2015.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 It was about the Cold War and Klaus Fuchs was a German physicist who then came to work in the UK

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 but he was a spy as well for the Soviet Union and his way of meeting his handlers

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 or saying he needed to have a meeting with them was to buy a copy of Men Only magazine

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 right on page 10 we need to meet, walk along a street in queue in south-west London

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 and then just chuck Men Only magazine over the garden hedge.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Right.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 And then they would pick that up and discover it, but there must presumably have been some people

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 who saw a man throwing a magazine over a hedge for no reason and didn't know what was going on.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 I think he was lucky that Men Only magazine in those days wasn't the sexy Men Only magazine that it became.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 What was it?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 I think it was the men only magazine.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 I think it was the men only magazine.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 I think it was the men only magazine.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 I think it was the men only magazine.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 I think it was the men only magazine.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 I think it was the men only magazine.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 I think it was the men only magazine.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 I don't know this magazine.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Is it still going and is it kind of like Playboy?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 As far as I know, it's not still going.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 It became big in the 70s when it was bought over by a guy called Paul Raymond who ran nightclubs in SoHo

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 and then he turned it into much more of a sexy magazine.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 It did become kind of a little bit sexy before that, but that's when it became proper top shelf stuff.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Before that, it had sort of like Jessica Rabbit type pictures in it, didn't it?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 And quite sexy cartoons of women.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 This is an example.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 On the front page, it had the names of the people who were writing in this edition.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 One of them was Charles Darwin's grandson who was a golf writer.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Another one was Sir Alan Patrick Herbert who was an independent member of Parliament for Oxford University.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 The old independent member of Parliament system, which was very interesting because you had MPs for a city,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 but then also for the university, right?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 No, doesn't even make it into that shit.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Boring version of Men Only Magazine, sorry.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 They also had one of the articles was building better brains.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 So it was ways to improve your memory, which is a thing called pelmanism.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 And the way that you would kind of make your memory better is do you remember that game where you put like cards,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 turn them all over and you turn two over and you have to match them up.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 And if they don't match, you turn them back over.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Tears.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Yeah, it was telling people how to play that game, basically.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 The game for five year olds.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Is that building a better brain?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 If you're four years old.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Fuchs practically single-handedly showed the USSR how to build an atomic bomb, didn't he?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 He was such a successful spy and when he was finally caught, he only served nine years.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 He served nine years in prison and then he was sent back to East Germany where he was married to a communist official.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 I didn't realize they did arranged marriages, but seems like they did.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 And he then gave atom bomb making lessons to the Chinese.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 So to be fair, he wanted global nuclear equality was his defense in court.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 And I think he might have been his principal.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 He thought that we were safer if we all had it.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Right.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 The whole mutually assured bullshit thing.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 The thing I love about this fact is it sort of shows the sort of real lo-fi spying abilities.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Yeah, we always think of the James Bond.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 This pen can do this and all that stuff.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 But actually there was just so much stuff where it was a bit crap.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Have we ever on the podcast mentioned the Jack in the Box?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 No.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Oh my goodness.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 I love this.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 This was just such a simple lo-fi thing.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Imagine you're a spy.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 There's two spies in a car and you're driving along and you're being tailed and you think,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 "I need to get out of here because they're going to get me."

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 So the Jack in the Box was a little suitcase that sat there in the car.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 And the idea was when you took a sharp corner, you'd open up the suitcase and a new inflatable spy would pop up

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 and you can open the door and just throw yourself out, slam the door,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 and they'll just be going, "Well, he's still in the car."

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 And you just roll away to safety.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 That was the real thing.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Does he still drive it, the inflatable you?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 I think you need to be in the passenger seat, so I think you're throwing the...

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 They did use that a few times, didn't they?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Yeah.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 And I was watching an interview with a woman called Jono Mendez,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 who was the CIA's Chief of Disguise in the 1980s.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 What a cool job.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 And she revealed so many things like the Jack in the Box and things like lying doggo.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 I don't know if you guys know about this.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 This was a fake dog that they made for agents in Moscow.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 And the reason they did it was they sent a couple to Moscow, a couple of spies,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 and they sent with them a huge dog, some sort of breed of dog.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 And they got this couple to drive in and out of the embassy just doing routine stuff,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 in and out of the embassy with a dog in the back of the car,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 and the dog would be sitting up or lying down or wagging its tail.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 So the security there would see this dog every day.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 They also sent with them a fake dog, which was hollow on the inside.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 They got a wig maker to make them a fake dog that looked exactly the same as their other dog.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 So when this couple of spies needed to smuggle somebody into the embassy,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 they would curl up inside this fake dog.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 No.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 And it would go through security.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 A Trojan dog.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 That's amazing.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Security would just go, "Oh, Rover's asleep today. Looking cute."

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 How big is this dog?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 I think it was like a big Dulux dog, wasn't it? It was super fluffy.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Wow.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 What would you do if someone came over and started tickling your chin?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 You'd have to go, "Rrrrr."

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 And they love you and adopt you and you just have to live out the rest of your life.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Do you want to know another lo-fi spying method?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 This is a CIA thing.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 The CIA have a facility in Virginia which teaches you all the complicated spying stuff.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 Like how to crash a car, how to parachute, how to use a speedboat and how to commit suicide.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Apparently that's just one of the skills they teach you.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 I guess if you're caught and you can't give away secrets.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 But they also teach you how to go to Starbucks.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 And this is one of the other methods they have for spying.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 So one professor, one spy, would give all of his people he was running a Starbucks gift card.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 Okay, that was not just a present because he would say, "If you need to see me, just buy a coffee."

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 And then every morning he just checks in with all of his Starbucks gift cards he's given out.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And if one of them has any money removed on it, he knows that that agent in particular is trying to contact him.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 Okay, that's quite clever.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 And he can just arrange a meeting.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 And then they meet up the next 3pm at the statue or wherever it is they've previously agreed.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Yes.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 How cool is that?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 It is cool.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Those hacks, those hacks were amazing.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 There was a hack that was used by, a big problem when people were trying to track down,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 all countries trying to track down Osama bin Laden was they were trying to find them via the internet.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And Al Qaeda were very good at not using the internet.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 So one of the things was how do you get an email to someone without sending an email and going through all the traffic?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Can you think of how you do that?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Thanks.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 No.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Did Brian Blessed have his printed off or something and he would read his emails that way?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 The way he used the tweet because he set up a Twitter account was that he would have tweets sent to him.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 A friend of his would then print out the tweets and would call up his agent who would then write them down and fax them to Brian.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 Brian then read them from his fax, call his agent.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 His agent would write them down, send them back to this guy and then they would be tweeted.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 It was about a 4-day process.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 But what's amazing is that was quicker than using WhatsApp yesterday.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 But we're not saying Brian Blessed has got anything to do with Al Qaeda.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Well, maybe we are.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 I don't know.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 He's got the bid for it.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Here's the thing.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 You couldn't hide Brian Blessed anywhere.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 It's ridiculous.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 You need a big dog for that.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 So just with the email thing, what they would do is they would be an account and what they would do is they would go in and they would write an email and then they would save it as a draft.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 And then someone else would go in, they would open up the same account because they all had the details and they would find the draft.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Never goes across any information highway.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 The Secret Intelligence Service were the forerunner, I think, to MI5 and MI6.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 They were just after the First World War, during and after.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 The CIS.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 The CIS.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Yeah, Secret Intelligence Service.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 They had an office in London, which was disguised as a company called the Minimax Fire Extinguisher Company, which was their cover story.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 We just make fire extinguishers.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Weirdly, that is still a fire extinguishing company today.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 So I don't know.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 I don't know whether they keep in the cover up.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Is that what you're saying?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 I'm not sure what I'm saying.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 If you need to buy a fire extinguisher, you can get one from there.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 But anyway, everyone knew about it.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 London taxi drivers all knew. Take me to the spy building men. Take me to 54 Broadway, which is where the office was.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Even German intelligence knew all about it and they positioned an agent there disguised as a blind match seller who would just stand outside the building,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 openly watching what was going on.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 A blind match?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Did he ever strike a match and someone rushed out of the building and extinguished it just to prove they're doing their job?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 I don't know.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 We're going to move on to our next fact very, very shortly.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Just one other lo-fi thing that the Americans used to do during the Cold War is dip dead rats in Tabasco sauce and then leave them lying around.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 So first of all, they'd find a dead rat and then they'd have a taxidermist hollow it out and stuff all the stuff inside it that you want to pass to your agent in, let's say, Moscow.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 So he's asked for a toothbrush, a bunch of rubles, whatever. You put it inside the dead rat and then you leave it on the street.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 And this is because they did a bunch of research that showed them that the one thing no one will pick up and dispose of is a dead rat.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 So no humans will touch a dead rat.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Problem is animals touch dead rats.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 So to deter animals from picking it up, they just dipped it in a hefty vat of Tabasco before dropping it on the street.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 You're pretending to be a big dog and you see that rat on the floor and you're like, "Shit, in character, I'm going to have to go for that."

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 OK, it is time for fact number three and that is Hannah.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 My fact this week is that in 1930s Yemen, it was forbidden to walk backwards or to give a horse a human name.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 I thought for a live show, a bit of a light one, I'd do a fact about Yemen.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 I've got a question right off the block, Hannah.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 It was illegal to give a horse a man's name.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 A person's name.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Yeah, but there's some grey area there, surely?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Yeah, I don't know if there was a catalogue of the big book of...

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 Some names are clearly horses' names like Dobbin and some names are clearly human names like Tony.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Yeah, so what I'm thinking is you can't call your horse Tony, right?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 You can't call your horse Tony, but I'm presuming there's a grey area of names which could apply equally to a human horse.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Like Mr Edd, who definitely...

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Thank you.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 I was struggling and struggling and just, you know, spooling it out and trying to think, "What are these names?"

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Mr Edd is a perfect name.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 I started to think Mr Edd might have been a spy inside a horse.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 I've got some good news for you, Andy.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Yeah.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 In 1930s Yemen, it was illegal to play tennis.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 Oh, get me there.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 Yeah, look, a lot of stuff was forbidden in Yemen in the 1930s.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 It was a strange place.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 It was a very insular place.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 It didn't really open up to the world until the 1960s.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 And the imams kept it completely cut off from the world.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 And there were a few travel writers who went there in the 30s.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 One of them was a guy called Norman Lewis who then wrote a report of what he found.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 He found you weren't allowed to point at the moon.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 That was very dangerous because superstition.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 You weren't allowed to contemplate women.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 I don't know if that meant with your eyes or if you even just thought about women.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 I imagine that's what Kanye West was doing when he was 12 years old.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 Contemplate?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Yeah, singing, whistling.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 You were allowed to wear a watch, but only if it wasn't working.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 Really?

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Yeah, you could wear it as decoration, but you couldn't, like, use it to tell the time.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Wow.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 How interesting.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 This is all thanks to Imam Yahya, who was the Imam at the time.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 And especially band music and singing.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Really frowned on that.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Right.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 So all music and singing, apart from religious chants, were banned.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 You could accompany the religious chants with a tambourine,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 but I don't think you could play a tambourine unless you were doing a religious chant at the same time.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 And singers had to perform in locked rooms with the windows stuffed with cushions.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 Wow.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 Because, you know, it was illegal, so this was the only way you could perform.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 And this Imam, basically, it was just after the First World War, wasn't it?

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 He'd taken over, and he was just trying to stop modernity from coming into the country.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 And he did so by micromanaging everything, which meant that basically anything that happened,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 he had to know about it, and he had to have his say so.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 Yeah.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Norman Lewis, the guy Anna mentions, thinks that he was probably the third or fourth English person ever to go to North Yemen.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Wow.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 So Britain had a colonial territory called Aden, that was the city, which was owned, I think it's about 1960 something.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 From 1839 Britain owned that, but you weren't allowed to go to North Yemen,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 and this was the way you got permission to go, kind of like getting Brian Blessed to reply to your tweet, basically.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 You had to write to the envoy in Aden, and the application was then carried by sea in a traditional Dao boat.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 It was taken to the port of Hodeida, then it was taken by horseback to Senaar, which was the capital in the north.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 It took up to two months to get a reply from the Imam saying whether you could go to North Yemen or not.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 It was usually just #No, wasn't it?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 Norman Lewis went, and he thought he had his permissions, he thought he had the papers all in order.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 He got there, and it turned out they were expecting someone else, and he and his colleagues were just sent away.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 I think he thinks they were expecting, they thought he was someone who they'd also booked to come and deliver quite a lot of weapons,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 and they were very disappointed when he was just some travel writer, so they retracted the permission.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 He was just very quickly on Norman Lewis, amazing travel writer, but also, I'm surprised he got turned away,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 because he's one of those people where I think he could slip into any country and just be a part of it and not really cause a fuss.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 He famously claimed that he was the only person he knew who could walk into a room full of people

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 and leave at some time afterwards without anyone ever realising he was actually there to begin with.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 That's easy to say, though, isn't it? It's easy to say, "Oh, I was there yesterday."

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 "Oh, you didn't see me, that's because I'm so good at not being seen."

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 And also, I have done that multiple times, normally at parties.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 I've gone, I've left, I've left no trace on anyone's mind.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Yeah, you're the Norman Lewis of your day. He had some other jobs before he became an explorer and travel writer.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 One of his jobs, apparently, was as a wholesaler of umbrellas he bought up from lost property offices.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 Oh, that's a great idea.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 And he tripled his money on them. He made an incredible profit.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 He was supposed to be a medium. His parents wanted him to be a medium, and he was a large, yes.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Well, his father was a medium, right, claimed to be a medium.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Because when he was married to someone called Anestina Kovaya, who was a daughter of a mafia lawyer,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 but when her parents came to visit his parents for the first ever time, it was all going very, very fine.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 Sunday lunch was happening, and his father slipped into a trance and began to communicate with the spirit of her dead sister.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 It's a very awkward dinner with the in-laws, isn't it?

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 That's, wow. I mean, was it with their permission or with their encouragement, or was it just...

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 It was just like, literally, past the spuds, please. No, wait a minute.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Gosh. I'm getting a B. A B, Brenda. Is it Brenda?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 I'm like, that's not really a mafia name, is it?

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 Wow, that is, yeah, that's pretty intense for a first meeting.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Well, one more thing on Lewis. He went to Havana. He was sent to Havana by Ian Fleming, pretty cool, in 1959.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 And he was meeting up with a guy called Ed Scott, who was one of the models for James Bond.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 Okay, so that's already a very exciting James Bondi espionage meeting that's happening between Norman Lewis and Ed Scott in Havana.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Not only that, the meeting was observed by Graham Greene, who then used that meeting scene in his novel, Our Man in Havana.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 Really? That's one of the most intensely literary espionage meetings that's ever happened, I reckon.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 There were fewer people back then, weren't there? There were only about ten people in the world.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 I think on that trip, he also met Ernest Hemingway, right?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 Oh, really?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 Yeah, because a lot of people said that Lewis was like, you know, he should have been more well-known, because he was such a great writer.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 But whenever they said it to him, he was like, well, I met Hemingway when I was in Cuba,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 and he looked exceedingly sad, and I thought, how lucky I am to have got as far as I have, but no further.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 He was like, thank God I'm not famous, because Hemingway looks so sad.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 Wow.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Anyway, who's for a game of humps or eggs?

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Humps or eggs?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Humps or eggs.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Okay.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 I went to look at the world records that are owned by people from Yemen.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 Oh.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 One is the most eggs balanced on top of each other, and one is the most humps ever on a camel, which is higher.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 Oh.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Is it fried eggs, scrambled eggs?

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Eggs and shells.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Just eggs and shells unboiled on top of each other, not allowed to do any tricks.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 They've just got a balance through gravity.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 Or humps on a camel.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 Or humps on a camel.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 Okay, anyone for humps?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Yeah.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 This isn't going as well as I thought it might do.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 Anyone for eggs?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Yeah.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Now, I feel like I primed them for that one.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 I'm going to go for humps, because I feel like you can just, you can grow random humps, right?

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Whereas, defying gravity is hard, guys.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 Could you possibly imagine balancing three eggs on each other?

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 I can, but I can also picture a camel with 14 humps.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 What are you going to do with all them humps?

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 That's more impressive in a way to me that Dan can imagine that, because I'm tapping out a camel with four humps.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 Okay.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 But that's still more than three.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 You thought the maximum eggs was three though, right?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 Yeah.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 I think maximum is going to be eggs, but I think it is going to be three.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 And you think maximum humps is four, but you still think eggs is going to win?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 No, no, no.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Sorry.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 I think the maximum I can imagine is four, but I know that that's an insane thing to imagine a camel with four humps.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 And I think the most any camel has ever had is two.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Anna, Anna's got her head in her hands for the listener at home.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 I don't care.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 I think it's not...

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 And we have a winner, Anna Shinsky.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 You were basically right.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 The maximum eggs is three, the maximum humps is four, but then you somehow went for the opposite answer.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Wow.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Either way, I don't think it's going to revolutionise Saturday Night TV, James.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 The maximum humps is four.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 The extra humps.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 They were on the camel.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Okay.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 You know, underside, coming out of the arms.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 They were on the top.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 On the top.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 This was a guy called Dr Bernhard Güssameck.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 He was a German zoologist, but he was in Yemen.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 And he noticed, or a farmer told him, that his camel had grown four humps.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 It sounds like the start of a joke, doesn't it?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 Yeah.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 And it was sold for $10,000.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 Wow.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Yeah.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 And how did the eggs...

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 How does that work?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 Do you bum on the head or side on side?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 It's one on top of the other, and they're in the basic egg way you would think, which is the fat bit at the bottom.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 Then thin, fat, thin, fat, thin.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Wow.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 That's impressive.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 So who was the genius who thought, I'm going to set up a competition where...

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 What?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 The competition of humps versus eggs.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 That was me.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 That was my idea.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Is that what you're saying?

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Yes, I used to wear genius.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Yes, I did.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Not lightly.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Well, we need to move on to our next bag.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Can I quickly then give you...

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 The Queen of Sheba is from Yemen, possibly, we think, maybe.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 She's in the Bible and in Koran and in a few different holy books.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 And she's like this legendary person who met with Solomon and asked him lots of riddles.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 So can I give you one of the Queen of Sheba's riddles?

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 If it's humps or eggs again, James.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Go on.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 What are the seven that issue and nine that enter the two that offer drink and the one that drinks?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 God, is it some kind of complicated sort of entering a club or all the bounces?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 I'm throwing a party.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Well, this is already unlikely, isn't it?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 I invite seven people.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Nine people say they're going to turn up.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Two people turn up.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 Only one of the only other drinks.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 And only other drinks.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 It is.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 The answer is the seven that issue are the seven days of menstrual impurity.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 The nine that enter are the nine months of pregnancy.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 The two that offer drink are the breasts and the one that drinks is the child.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 That's the...

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 I can't believe you didn't get it, guys.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Fucking weird party you're throwing, Andy.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 Why are you not programming BBC television change?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 I don't understand.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 There's time for our final fact and that is James.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that on the official tourist website of the Mont Blanc area of France,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 you can buy an excursion into Pussycanyon for 69 euros.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 This feels like a fact presented by Kanye West, age 12.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 So I was organising the trip to France and I did my usual loads of research.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 And I was like, I don't know what brought my mind to...

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 I saw Pussycanyon and thought I might want to go there and I looked it up.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 And it turns out that it's a funny sounding place with a funny sounding number of euros.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 And I'm not trying to say any more about the world than that.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 Just out of curiosity, is that deliberate or is it...

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 No, no, no.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 It's not?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 No, no, no.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Because a lot of places do that, right?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 They'll just do some sort of tourist trap.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 That's a genuine thing.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 I think so because you could also buy a more expensive one for like 74 euros.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 Oh.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 I mean, who's going to do that if it's 69?

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Yeah.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 By the way, James, thank you for the hard as to Google decently fact of the entire show.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 I know.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Very, very difficult.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 So, yeah, it's a town.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 There's a town called Pussy and the town has a canyon in it, Pussycanyon.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 It's named after a Roman person we think called Pusseus.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 He lived inside a cat when he was spying on it.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 And not really much has happened there over the years.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 The Nazis entered Pussy in 1944 and burned the village down.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 I'm sorry, the Nazis just got a big laugh at our show.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 I don't know if that's what got the laugh.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 That's really pretty much the only interesting thing that I could ever find that happened there.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 Did you, did this persuade you to enter it?

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 No, I'm not a child.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 I see.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 It was too expensive, wasn't it?

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 Too cheap to fork out the 69.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 Because you can't do quite fun stuff there, it looks like.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 It's a canyoning destination.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 So you can do slides down rocks and abseiling and waterfalls and cliff jumps.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 So it's worth going into Pussycanyon, it looks like.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 Okay.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 It's mentioned in the Bokov as well, in one of his books called Transparent Things.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 He writes, "There's many a mile between condom in Gascoigne and Pussy in Savoy."

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 Wise words.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 Dirty old man.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Wow.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 So I got into reading about the Alps and about Mont Blanc.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 You know, because this is all in the Mont Blanc area of France.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Mont Blanc is a very interesting place.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 Though it's so interesting that in England in 1852, there was a show on in London called The Ascent of Mont Blanc

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 by a guy called Albert Smith, which was just a guy who'd climbed up Mont Blanc.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 That was it.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 But the show ran for six years on Piccadilly.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Wow.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Yeah.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 And it sounds insane.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 It's good.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 There were songs making fun of tourists.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 There were some Bernard dogs let loose in the aisles of the auditorium in the interval.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Were they dogs, Andy?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Or were they CIA agents?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 It's impossible.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 I'm now doubting every dog I've ever seen.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 Yeah.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 And he did 2,000 performances of this show just about going up Mont Blanc.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Isn't that cool?

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 Yeah.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 Wow.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Was this back when James was in charge of programming the theatres?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 There's a lot of reasons that people have climbed Mont Blanc in the past.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Yeah.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 This is from a book called Killing Dragons, The Conquest of the Alps by Fergus Fleming.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 In 1818, there was a Russian count called Mazepsky, and he decided to climb to the top

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 of Mont Blanc to improve his poetry skills.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 Oh.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 There's a guy called John Oljo who climbed to the top so he could see a better reflection

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 of the mountain in the lake.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Okay.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 There was a guy called Conte Henry de Tee who wanted to cheer himself up after a failed

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 affair, so he decided just to go to the top of Mont Blanc.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 Okay.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 And there was someone called Edward Boutal-Wilbraham who went because someone had told him not to.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Just on something on the word pussy.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 So octopussy.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 Pussy.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 Not octopussy.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Pussy galore.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.360
 Well, played by Anna Blackman in the movie Goldfinger, I think.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:40.600
 So the name pussy galore apparently comes from the fact that Ian Fleming who wrote the

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.760
 James Bond books had an octopus called pussy.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.760
 What?

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.760
 And it was a pet octopus that he had.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.760
 Really?

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.280
 And so this was when, I think he lived in the Caribbean, right?

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.280
 Yeah.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.200
 Well, so he lived by the sea, and there was this octopus that used to come up every day,

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.000
 and they used to give him bits of food and stuff, and then it would hide away, and then

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.600
 it would come out, and they would kind of pet it.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.760
 They called it pussy, obviously, because of octopus, and then, unfortunately, one day,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.800
 the housemaid mashed it up, cooked it in olive oil, and ate it out of a coconut.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.800
 Wow.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:16.680
 And Fleming wrote it in a paper called My Friend the Octopus, and he says, "That's the worst

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.880
 of pets.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.720
 Something always happens to them."

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.720
 Wow.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.720
 That is an understanding boss.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.240
 I don't want to sound like I'm on the wrong side of history, but the maids fucked up there.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.240
 Like in the pet.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.240
 Yeah.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:34.760
 And on a black man, she became an actor because of an amazing teacher she had called Irene

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:41.400
 Cockin, and it was Irene Cockin who introduced her to poetry and plays, and then convinced

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.120
 her father, who wasn't kind of, her father was, I think, from London or something, and

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:49.800
 he thought that the family didn't have enough elocution and wouldn't be able to get into

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.480
 theatre and stuff, but it was this teacher, Irene Cockin, who talked her into going for

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.480
 it.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.800
 It was a double act of any kind.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.800
 What, Pussy and Cockin?

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.800
 Pussy and Cockin.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.800
 Yeah.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.800
 You wouldn't, why would you put it that way around, guys?

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.040
 Because we don't know about branding.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.760
 That was so good.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:18.280
 I find, there's so many interestingly rude-named places in France, which I didn't realise

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.760
 at Pussy Canyon, there's a place called Anus.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:26.000
 Do you think that's how they pronounce it?

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.880
 Oh, how would they pronounce it?

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.880
 Anu.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.880
 Come on.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.880
 Anu.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.480
 But to be fair, they know it's rude because it's in their society of rude names, right?

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.480
 Well, that's the thing.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:41.560
 It is in their society, but also, it happens to be located, the Anus, in a town, Yon, but

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:47.760
 it's called, so it's Yon Burgundy, which sounds very suspiciously close to Ron Burgundy.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.320
 That just, yeah, made me smile.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:55.200
 Only France, surely, would notice that it had enough rude place names that they have actually

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.400
 formed an association of rude place names in France, the Association des communes de

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.000
 France au number lesque.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.200
 And it's got about 40 towns in it, and all these mayors meet up every year in a different

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:15.160
 one in Arnaque la Poste, which means postal fraud, or Bousier, which means to cock up Montétan,

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:23.040
 which means my nipple, and the horsey, horsey village of Mariole rejected membership.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:27.200
 So it was asked to be a member, and then got a new mayor, who said, "Actually, we want

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.480
 to be taken seriously now, so we're not going to get involved in this."

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.280
 They were supposed to host it, turn it down.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:42.780
 And Mariole means smart ass in French, so.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.780
 That is it.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:44.900
 That is all of our facts.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.580

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.900
 [APPLAUSE]

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.480
 (upbeat music)

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.060
 (upbeat music)
