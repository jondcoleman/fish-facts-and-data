1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,560
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,100
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish,"

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,260
 a weekly podcast coming from four

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,740
 undisclosed locations in the UK.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,820
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,860
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,220
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,380
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,420
 and in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,020
 Starting with my fact this week,

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,660
 my fact is that while working as a publisher,

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,800
 the poet T.S. Eliot liked to sit his visiting authors

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,040
 on a whoopee cushion before offering them

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,540
 an exploding cigar.

17
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,880
 (laughing)

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,740
 - Wow, I mean, did he do this with everybody?

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,920
 - Yeah, I don't know if people were warned about it.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,940
 I think most people assumed it wouldn't happen.

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,540
 He was a very serious guy according to the writings

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,040
 that he released, so the idea that you would enter

23
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,500
 the office of the great poet T.S. Eliot

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,180
 and have a cigar explode in your face

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,140
 while making a loud fart seems out of place, doesn't it?

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,620
 - Do you think maybe the very grave, serious persona

27
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,380
 he had throughout his life was all an act

28
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,500
 so that he could do this, jade, without people expecting it?

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,340
 - That's a great idea.

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,660
 - Could have been all building up to this.

31
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,100
 - All the front, yeah.

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,860
 It wasn't just his authors who came in

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,540
 who he would turn these sort of practical jokes on to.

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,860
 He once broke up a board meeting as well

35
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,100
 by setting off a bucket full of firecrackers

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,860
 underneath the chairman's legs.

37
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,220
 So he was all over the shop.

38
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,340
 He was a nightmare to work with.

39
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,180
 - Sounds like a maniac.

40
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,460
 That sounds dangerous as a fourth of July prank.

41
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,460
 - Yeah, you'd be fired if you weren't quite senior

42
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,500
 in the company or you weren't about to become

43
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,700
 the greatest poet of the 20th century,

44
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,620
 you would be fired for that.

45
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,260
 - But wait a minute, wouldn't it be quite cool

46
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,220
 if you were about to be fired and they went,

47
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,540
 "You're fired," and you went, "No, you're fired, mate."

48
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,140
 And a lot of firecrackers went, "Oh, his ass."

49
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,980
 - That'd be amazing.

50
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,340
 - "Dunning, maybe that's what happened."

51
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,180
 And it was such an event,

52
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,460
 they completely forgot this accent.

53
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,620
 - So T.S. Eliot, he, famous poet,

54
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,380
 but also was actually a publisher himself.

55
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,620
 So he worked for Faber and Faber.

56
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,780
 In fact, he actually worked for,

57
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,980
 before it was Faber and Faber,

58
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,300
 he worked for it when it was Faber and Gwyer.

59
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,140
 Do you know why he became--

60
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,900
 - Can I just say, very, very good publishers,

61
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,340
 Faber and Faber.

62
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,700
 They've got one book out this year,

63
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,260
 I think it's called "Funner You Should Ask"

64
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,820
 by the QALs. - Oh, here we go.

65
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,660
 - Here we go.

66
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,860
 (laughing)

67
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,340
 - Viral marketing. - They are very, very good.

68
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,620
 - Very crafty.

69
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,820
 - Sorry, Dan, you were saying.

70
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,300
 - But so, yeah, so he joined them in the 1920s,

71
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,540
 and he became a director and an editor there.

72
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,260
 - We're saying he was one of the great poets

73
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,900
 of the 20th century, which I guess he was, fine.

74
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,540
 But he did, he did also write "Cats."

75
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,260
 I mean, he is credited.

76
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,100
 - I believe that's what we're referring to

77
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,420
 when we say-- - Oh, I'm sorry, yeah.

78
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,980
 (laughing)

79
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,900
 He is the lyricist, credited as the lyricist

80
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,740
 on the musical "Cats."

81
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,340
 Even though he died 20 years before it came out,

82
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,140
 'cause he wrote this book,

83
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,940
 "Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats" in 1939,

84
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,700
 and it was for his godson, it was, you know, it wasn't.

85
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,780
 - Yeah, that's unfair to say that he wrote "Cats."

86
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,980
 - I say he wrote "Cats" because, for example,

87
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,260
 he won a Tony Award for "Cats" in 1983,

88
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,900
 18 years after he died.

89
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,500
 - And they wheeled him up, didn't they,

90
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,420
 on stage for a very dark award ceremony?

91
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,020
 - And he went, "Surprise, I haven't been dead all this time."

92
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,540
 (laughing)

93
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,980
 - That huge stink bomb goes off at the back of the room, chaos.

94
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,020
 - I think in his defense, he said about "Cats"

95
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,540
 in an interview, and he was asked about it,

96
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,020
 that one wants to keep one's hand in.

97
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,140
 So, you know, you just keep trying stuff out,

98
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,260
 you just keep writing the practice of writing,

99
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,620
 even if you're not really writing serious stuff.

100
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,900
 But he did really enjoy writing about "Cats"

101
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,380
 'cause in this same interview, he basically said,

102
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,860
 "I've thought about writing about dogs,

103
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,980
 "but they don't seem to lend themselves to verse

104
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,340
 "quite so well," which I can see that that's true.

105
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,740
 - A dog on a log does rhyme.

106
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,060
 But I think there's more rhyming words for "Cats"

107
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,940
 than there are for dogs.

108
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,660
 Just, I mean, I'm not a poet,

109
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,260
 as you might be able to tell, but I just--

110
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,620
 - No, I think that's really good.

111
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,100
 He probably hadn't thought of the log thing.

112
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,340
 - Frog, the cat-- - Frog is well actually frog.

113
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,020
 - Yeah, but it's the cat in the hat, isn't it?

114
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,420
 Not the dog on the log.

115
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,260
 - With a frog.

116
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,060
 - Okay, he wasn't Dr. Seuss, go on.

117
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,900
 (laughing)

118
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,900
 - Is that what poetry is?

119
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,700
 I've never read any of his stuff, I must say.

120
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,180
 - Ezra Pound gave him his nickname,

121
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,460
 which you mentioned a minute ago, which was Possum.

122
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,980
 So it's called Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats,

123
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,900
 'cause that was Elliot's nickname.

124
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,260
 And it's related to his serious personality.

125
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,780
 So despite all the practical jokes,

126
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,420
 he was known for being incredibly stiff.

127
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,500
 The nickname Possum came after the fact

128
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,140
 that Possums are known for faking their own deaths.

129
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,260
 So the idea was that whenever he was at a social gathering,

130
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,260
 it seemed like he was faking being dead.

131
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,100
 That's how much life he contributed to the party.

132
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,660
 - Oh, like playing Possum, yeah.

133
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,740
 - Exactly.

134
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,300
 - But so he liked the name Possum?

135
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,140
 Is that what you're saying?

136
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,780
 - He did like it, yeah, it was affectionate.

137
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,140
 And Virginia Woolf said he was so buttoned up,

138
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,420
 he wore a four-piece suit.

139
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,780
 And so he liked the name Possum,

140
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,460
 he kind of embraced this and it was based on--

141
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,620
 - That's the joke.

142
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,900
 I understand that, I was just trying to work out.

143
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,940
 'Cause I wanted to know if there was a bit of a three-piece suit

144
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,300
 I was missing all these years.

145
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,980
 (laughing)

146
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,900
 - No, there's a bit of your sense of humor

147
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,260
 you've been missing all these years.

148
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,140
 (laughing)

149
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,660
 - But that's interesting 'cause he did have a bit

150
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,500
 of a lack of a sense of humor about his names generally.

151
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,460
 For example, T.S. Eliot.

152
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,380
 Why is the S in there?

153
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,700
 Why not T. Eliot?

154
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,540
 Do you guys know?

155
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,740
 - Well, all I know really about T.S. Eliot

156
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,380
 before researching this is that his name

157
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,900
 is an anagram of toilets.

158
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,740
 So is it-- - There you go.

159
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,660
 - Is that it?

160
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,580
 - If you take the S out, it's toilet backwards

161
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,820
 and he did not want that to be the case, yeah.

162
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,940
 - Kidding, that's why he put the S in.

163
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,380
 - This is, a lot of people said it.

164
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,020
 I haven't read him saying it himself,

165
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,780
 but Samuel Beckett has written about it,

166
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,900
 saying T. Eliot is toilet-spelled backwards.

167
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,540
 Ordon mentioned it, that's what you would get.

168
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,780
 I think it was the thing that everyone had noticed.

169
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,380
 And so that's why the S was in there.

170
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,660
 - Wow.

171
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,780
 - So we know he didn't like dogs.

172
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,860
 We know he likes cats.

173
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,980
 Do you know what other animals he didn't like?

174
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,460
 - Spiders, I guess, is the obvious one.

175
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,660
 - Farm yard animals.

176
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,860
 As a group, he famously at,

177
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,020
 or rather, perhaps not as famous as it should be,

178
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,260
 while working at Faber,

179
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,900
 turned down George Orwell's Animal Farm.

180
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,780
 He was submitted to them.

181
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,940
 And he read it and he wrote him a nice long letter

182
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,260
 saying it's brilliant.

183
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,620
 And I'm very upset that we're not gonna be publishing it

184
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,940
 because it means that whoever gets to publish it

185
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,820
 will probably get to publish your subsequent work.

186
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,540
 But I just, I can't do it.

187
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,060
 It doesn't fit with us.

188
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,820
 - Because he doesn't like farm yard animals, does he?

189
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,420
 - I'll tell you another animal he didn't like, flies.

190
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,700
 Because they also turned down Lord of the Flies,

191
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,420
 Faber and Faber.

192
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,060
 - Is every subsequent fact in this show

193
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,220
 gonna have to be linked tangentially to an animal?

194
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,660
 - Was it because Lord of the Flies

195
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,820
 has a character called Piggy

196
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,460
 and you get pigs in farm yards?

197
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,180
 - Brilliant, that's exactly it.

198
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,140
 Yes, they, well, they didn't specify that.

199
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,620
 They turned it down with the notes,

200
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,260
 rubbish and dull, pointless, reject.

201
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,100
 - Wow.

202
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,940
 - Ouch, yeah.

203
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,340
 - God, it sounds like he was quite a bad publisher.

204
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,100
 I wonder he had to write poems to make ends meet,

205
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,900
 turning down all these absolute stone cold hits.

206
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,860
 - Unlike Faber of today, of course,

207
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,780
 who have another stone cold hit on their hands.

208
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,340
 With funny, you should ask.

209
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,300
 The new book by the QIL.

210
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,140
 - Available now.

211
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,980
 - Spawn.

212
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,060
 - I didn't know how fun TS Eliot was.

213
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,900
 I appreciate we've just said

214
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,300
 that he's not fun all the way through this,

215
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,940
 but I didn't know he really liked Groucho Marx.

216
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,580
 He idolized Groucho Marx.

217
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,500
 They had dinner once together, TS Eliot and Groucho Marx,

218
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,580
 but the dinner was a complete disaster

219
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,820
 because all Marx wanted to talk about was literature

220
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,140
 and all Eliot wanted to talk about

221
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,900
 was Marx Brothers films.

222
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,740
 - Yeah.

223
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,700
 - It's really interesting that if Groucho Marx

224
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,460
 was going to become friends with anyone,

225
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,660
 you would think it wouldn't be someone

226
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,980
 who has the big exploding cigar trick up his sleeve.

227
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,060
 - Maybe that was his ultimate prey for TS Eliot.

228
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,100
 I will get him one day.

229
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,500
 - Well, that actually makes so much sense.

230
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,940
 Sorry, because Eliot once wrote Marx a letter.

231
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,340
 So he'd written Groucho Marx a letter saying,

232
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,540
 "Can I have a photo of you?"

233
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,300
 And Marx had sent it and TS Eliot put this framed

234
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,580
 on his table, but then Eliot wrote another letter

235
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,700
 to Marx saying, "In the photo of you,

236
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,580
 "you're not smoking your cigar and it's a bit annoying

237
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,500
 "because all my visitors come, look at it and say,

238
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,340
 "who's that?

239
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,580
 "No one recognizes you without the cigar.

240
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,100
 "Can you do one with a cigar?"

241
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,580
 So maybe that was all part of a ploy

242
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,500
 to get that exploding cigar into his face.

243
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,580
 - That is interesting.

244
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,620
 - I think it's interesting that they were so close

245
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,340
 because Eliot was quite anti-Semitic, wasn't he?

246
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,180
 Do you know what I mean?

247
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,780
 We should mention that, I think.

248
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,420
 A lot of his poems that before he became famous

249
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,900
 do have certain anti-Semitic tropes to them.

250
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,100
 And that it was before Second World War.

251
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,140
 And then obviously after the Second World War,

252
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,620
 people realized that, wait a minute,

253
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,540
 you can't really do this kind of thing.

254
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,180
 But he never really properly backtracked on it, so.

255
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,980
 - Yeah.

256
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,540
 Well, actually it was quite tense.

257
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,780
 I'm not sure they did like each other that much.

258
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,660
 If you read the exchanges of letters,

259
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,020
 they're full of barbs.

260
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,220
 So there was one where when Marx sent Eliot this photo,

261
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,340
 Eliot wrote back saying,

262
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,100
 "I've hung that right next to my photos of Yates

263
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,820
 "and Paul Valeri, you know, in the pride of place."

264
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,060
 And then Groucho wrote back to him saying,

265
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,380
 "That's so weird 'cause I've just read an essay about you

266
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,300
 "which named those other two pictures,

267
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,980
 "but there was a conspicuous absence.

268
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,140
 "I trust this was an oversight

269
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,860
 "on the part of the journalist."

270
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,220
 - What a weird thing to write to someone saying.

271
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,700
 The article about you didn't mention a photo of me

272
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,260
 in your home, get a grip, mate.

273
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,100
 - But then Eliot's excuse wasn't it?

274
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,500
 - He said, "Oh, well, your picture was a photo

275
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,820
 "and the other pictures were drawings or paintings.

276
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,500
 "So maybe the writer had only noticed the paintings

277
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,340
 "and hadn't noticed photographs

278
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,820
 "and didn't want to talk about photographs."

279
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,140
 - Good excuse, very good excuse.

280
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,140
 I mean, it's absolutely mad that in the old days

281
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,260
 you had to write to someone for a photo of them.

282
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,300
 Can we just appreciate that as a really stupid system?

283
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,140
 Imagine.

284
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,180
 - How do you get a photo of someone now again?

285
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,380
 Is it easy now?

286
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,220
 - Yeah, Google it.

287
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,700
 - Google image.

288
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,740
 And then right click and you go print.

289
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,140
 - Yeah, but when you've got a picture of Groucho Marx

290
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,940
 on your wall with all the other people you've met,

291
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,220
 you don't want one that you've taken off Google image,

292
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,060
 do you?

293
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,660
 - With getty images over the top of it.

294
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,900
 - Oh, my lad, do you?

295
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,500
 - You should come and see my gallery wall.

296
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,300
 It's got a lot of lovely watermarks on it.

297
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,780
 - So many celebrity friends.

298
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,340
 It's Nicole Kidman's up there, Barack Obama.

299
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,060
 - Shall we talk about his sex life?

300
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,620
 - Always up for that.

301
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,460
 - T.S. Eliot.

302
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,860
 - Okay, sure, yeah.

303
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,900
 - It was very difficult, I think is the headline there.

304
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,820
 He was very awkward around women.

305
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,580
 He had a lot of relationships in his life.

306
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,580
 And until the end, they were pretty much a disaster.

307
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,980
 - Oh, I was ready for the juicy stuff, James.

308
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,140
 I didn't think it was just, he had bad relationships.

309
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,780
 - Okay, I was just gonna set it up

310
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,100
 for someone else to jump in there.

311
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,940
 But fine.

312
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,700
 - We've all got bad relationships, yeah.

313
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,780
 - His most famous relationship was with Vivian.

314
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,980
 And he told the wolves that he couldn't imagine

315
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,460
 shaving in her presence.

316
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,980
 That's how awkward the relationship

317
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,860
 was between those two people.

318
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,020
 - This is Virginia Woolf's family,

319
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,940
 we should say not actual wolves.

320
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,660
 - It was confusing.

321
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,060
 - Sorry, I just, yeah.

322
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,500
 - He didn't like dogs, but he loved wolves.

323
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,980
 - I thought I pronounced the word wolf

324
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,740
 with the obvious double O.

325
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,540
 It was so obvious that there was a double O in there, guys.

326
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
 - I heard the F of wolves.

327
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,420
 - And that's what I was, but I think wolves, wolves.

328
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,500
 It's probably, Virginia Woolf always said,

329
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,940
 "I'm Virginia Woolf."

330
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,900
 - So what did the wolves say about him?

331
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,700
 - They said, "Oh, that's interesting."

332
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:49,020
 - Well, he was part of that Bloomsbury group, wasn't he?

333
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,460
 With the wolves, Virginia Woolf.

334
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,500
 And Bertrand Russell as well,

335
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,700
 with whom his wife had an affair.

336
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,980
 - Wait, so what did Virginia Woolf say?

337
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,460
 What were you saying about what did the wolves say?

338
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,020
 We need to know what the wolves at the door said.

339
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,060
 - He said it to the wolves.

340
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,100
 He said, "I can't imagine shaving in my wife's presence."

341
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,260
 And then the wolf said,

342
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,900
 "You really need to make this house out of bricks."

343
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:16,180
 - He said he couldn't imagine shaving in his wife's presence.

344
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,580
 - Yeah, because he was so awkward.

345
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,380
 They got married really, really quickly,

346
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,020
 but then it was really obvious very, very quickly

347
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,300
 that they weren't compatible one little bit.

348
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,100
 They slept in different rooms as well.

349
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,940
 That's another...

350
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,660
 - Well, they tried to sleep in the same room

351
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,900
 on their honeymoon, as is traditional.

352
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,180
 And it sounds awkward, as is the theme.

353
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,780
 So they went on honeymoon in Eastbourne

354
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,860
 and she was on her period

355
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,860
 and had an embarrassing accident

356
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,380
 when they were trying to have their honeymoon moment.

357
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,620
 And they were both so incredibly embarrassed

358
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,380
 that he went and slept out on a deck chair

359
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,420
 outside the hotel for the rest of the week.

360
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,580
 And she trashed the hotel room

361
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,140
 'cause she was in such a frenzy of embarrassment.

362
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,340
 And then she took the sheets away with her

363
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,340
 'cause she didn't want the hotel staff to see them.

364
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,180
 But then of course, they just called their home

365
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,020
 when they got back and said,

366
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,740
 "You've stolen all of our bedding."

367
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,900
 Which sort of is more embarrassing, I think.

368
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,100
 - Oh dear.

369
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,220
 - But they did also, I think, at that point of the honeymoon.

370
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,020
 The honeymoon was meant to be the debut sex fest

371
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,580
 because they hadn't had sex as far as I could tell.

372
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,220
 It seems that they got married really quickly

373
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,500
 because I think he told Ezra Pound

374
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,180
 he said, "I want to have sex."

375
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,740
 And then three months later, he was married to her.

376
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,220
 So he obviously--

377
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,060
 - The debut sex fest.

378
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,900
 - The debut sex fest.

379
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,860
 (laughing)

380
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,660
 - Yeah, they should rebrand honeymoon.

381
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,700
 (laughing)

382
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,620
 - Where are you going on your debut sex fest?

383
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,180
 - Oh, we're off to stay with the wolves.

384
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,340
 (laughing)

385
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,060
 - Ashley Virginia Woolf said,

386
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,020
 "Living with Vivian, who was quite mad,

387
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,900
 "living with Vivian was like having a bag of ferrets

388
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,820
 "hung around your neck."

389
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,300
 - She was very troubled, wasn't she?

390
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,060
 And you know, I think she was,

391
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,260
 was she sectioned at one point when he was away

392
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,140
 and she spent the rest of her life in a hospital?

393
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,940
 - Yeah, so he went away to America, didn't he?

394
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,500
 And then his solicitors sent her a letter saying,

395
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,860
 "I want a separation," rather than him saying it.

396
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,380
 And then when he went back to London,

397
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,140
 she kind of stalked him and would go to his office

398
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,020
 and he would always sneak out of the back door

399
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,780
 so that she wouldn't see him.

400
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,300
 And then she would walk around London with a knife.

401
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,420
 It was like a rubber knife, so it was like a joke.

402
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,620
 She was like, "I'm trying to find my husband

403
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,980
 "with this rubber knife."

404
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,300
 - Wait, did she get it from the same shop

405
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,900
 as the Exploded Cigars and the Wolf Division?

406
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,820
 - Smithy's absolutely clinked up on the Elias, didn't they?

407
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,100
 (laughing)

408
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,060
 - And then she joined the British Union of Fascists

409
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,620
 in the late 30s, yeah. - Oh, yes, that's right.

410
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,140
 - And she liked to wear the uniform in public.

411
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,580
 - Yeah, 'cause when you hear about the early days

412
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,300
 of her life, particularly the university years,

413
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,900
 everyone sort of talked about her as being very flamboyant.

414
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,860
 She was a great dancer, she'd always speak her mind.

415
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,620
 She smoked in public, which you wouldn't usually see

416
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,060
 women doing, she dressed like an actress.

417
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,260
 Aldous Huxley said that he really liked hanging out with her

418
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,980
 because she was vulgar, she was just so different,

419
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,420
 she would say what she thought.

420
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,540
 And then you get to this fascist period

421
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,900
 where suddenly it seems like a totally different character.

422
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,580
 In fact, the last time she ever saw Elliot

423
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,660
 was at one of his book talks

424
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,540
 where she went into the audience.

425
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,300
 She brought three books with her and she brought her dog

426
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,260
 and he signed her books for her

427
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,740
 and then went off with someone else.

428
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,580
 It's the weirdest thing,

429
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,300
 it's the last time they ever saw each other.

430
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,380
 - Wow, wow. - Yeah.

431
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,700
 - But still, you know, she got her book signed.

432
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,180
 - She got what she wanted, she got her book signed.

433
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,780
 - But she not, I've just found his signature

434
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,100
 on the internet, printed it off

435
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,900
 and then stuck it in her book.

436
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,900
 - All right, so you've seen my autograph book too, fine.

437
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,940
 - She did, she tried various ways to get him back.

438
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,300
 So one of them seemed to be bringing this dog

439
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,140
 to his book chat, which is a bad idea.

440
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,100
 Another one was putting an advert out in the times, the 1930s.

441
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,020
 So she thought there was a sort of a conspiracy

442
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,940
 to keep him apart by other people.

443
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,540
 And so she put an ad in the time saying,

444
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,460
 "Will T.S. Elliot please return to his home

445
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,460
 "68 Clarence Gate Gardens, which he abandoned

446
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,940
 "on the September the 17th, 1932."

447
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,140
 - Wow.

448
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,540
 - Yeah.

449
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,420
 - Do you know, Elliot himself was really secretive

450
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,340
 about his correspondence.

451
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,540
 In fact, the whole estate has been very secretive

452
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,420
 since he died, pretty much.

453
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,380
 'Cause his widow was called Valerie,

454
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,460
 he married again much later.

455
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,380
 So Peter Eckroyd was trying to write a biography of him

456
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,740
 and he was forbidden to quote from any correspondence

457
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,140
 or unpublished work.

458
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,260
 And he was hardly allowed to quote

459
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,100
 even actual published poems of T.S. Elliot's

460
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,740
 in this biography of the man.

461
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,340
 Elliot destroyed so much correspondence

462
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,340
 that between 1905 and 1910,

463
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,820
 there was just one postcard left by him.

464
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,860
 That's it, that's all there is for those five years.

465
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,060
 - What does it say?

466
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,540
 Just, dear mom, really sunny here, hope you're well.

467
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,700
 Having a lovely debut sex fest in Yves Bourne.

468
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,280
 (upbeat music)

469
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:58,620
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

470
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,100
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 2001,

471
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,180
 an artist got lost in Los Angeles

472
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,260
 and decided to make his own sign

473
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,260
 to stop other people from getting lost in future.

474
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,500
 Not only did it remain unnoticed for more than a year,

475
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,300
 but when the city was tipped off,

476
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,340
 they found that it met all signage rules

477
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,580
 and they kept it in place for eight years.

478
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,940
 - It's so charming.

479
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,900
 What was the sign saying?

480
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,540
 - It said five.

481
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,220
 - And the word north as well. - Five more.

482
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,100
 So this was a sign to get off a highway

483
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,620
 and get onto another highway.

484
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,100
 And basically the signpost to tell you where to go

485
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,140
 was really close to the ramp.

486
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,380
 And really there should have been one a lot further back.

487
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,740
 So whenever anyone drove down the 110

488
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,620
 and wanted to get onto the five,

489
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,340
 they would only realize at the last second

490
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,260
 that they needed to be in a certain lane

491
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,860
 and they would kind of swerve in front of the cars.

492
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,660
 And he was like, well, it's just really dangerous.

493
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,340
 So I'm going to put a five,

494
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,820
 maybe a mile further back or a half mile further back.

495
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,340
 And he put it there and he did it in broad daylight.

496
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,780
 He just one day he just got a load of ladders

497
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,180
 and just went up there and did it.

498
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,220
 And it was there and no one noticed.

499
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,020
 And I think he tipped them off in the end.

500
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,220
 This artist named Richard Angrom.

501
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,820
 He tipped off the city in the end and they just kept it there.

502
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,740
 And then they decided we're making some new signs now

503
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,300
 and we're going to have to take this down.

504
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,300
 But actually they put a new five where his five was.

505
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,900
 So they took his down and they put a new one up there.

506
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,700
 So they kind of tacitly admitted that he was right

507
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,780
 that it should have been there.

508
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,460
 - He planned it for ages as well.

509
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,900
 Like he didn't just go in broad daylight

510
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,100
 just dressed as he was.

511
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,380
 He absolutely planned the whole thing.

512
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,580
 So he had his haircut.

513
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,580
 Not sure why, but he had his haircut.

514
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,940
 He bought some work clothes.

515
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,020
 He had a hard hat.

516
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,140
 He got an orange vest.

517
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,100
 He even made--

518
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,940
 - The haircut must have been

519
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,500
 to fit inside the hard hat, maybe.

520
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,340
 - Possibly.

521
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,740
 - He had a mohican before that, didn't he?

522
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,500
 - And he had his truck.

523
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,860
 He did a thing where, as well as making the signage

524
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,420
 for the actual sign itself,

525
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,460
 he made signage for the side of his truck

526
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,420
 to match the Caltrans, which is California Transports.

527
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,540
 The logos and so on to make it look like he was part of them.

528
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,140
 So he was properly planned.

529
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,380
 - And he's an artist, isn't he?

530
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,940
 - And you can tell because he clearly doesn't have a 95 job.

531
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,020
 - He called his piece "Guerrilla Public Service."

532
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,940
 And I should just say that I got this fact from a book

533
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,020
 called "The 99% Invisible City,

534
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,340
 a Field Guide to the Hidden World of Everyday Design"

535
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,620
 by Roman Mars.

536
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,900
 And it's a really awesome book

537
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,180
 based on the 99% Invisible Podcast.

538
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,180
 And it's full of loads of awesome stuff about the streets.

539
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,620
 And if you read it, then you walk down the street

540
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,740
 and you go, "Oh, you know why that's there?

541
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,580
 You know why that's there?

542
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,420
 You know why that's there?"

543
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,420
 It's a really cool book.

544
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,260
 - Oh, great.

545
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,100
 He's amazing, Roman Mars.

546
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,500
 - Yeah, we did, 99% Invisible

547
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,460
 did not need any extra advertising from us.

548
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,700
 Yay, cool stuff.

549
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,300
 - Not compared with the new book.

550
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,460
 Funny you should ask.

551
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,460
 It's so cool how people keep doing this around the place.

552
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,460
 And it's kind of all these micro banksies,

553
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,820
 but with particular bug bears.

554
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,860
 So there is a thing currently going on in Sheffield

555
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,900
 where people are changing noughts on street signs into queues.

556
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,620
 And no one really knows why they're doing this.

557
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,460
 - Oh, yeah.

558
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,820
 So there is a theory that it's to do with queue and non.

559
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,620
 I was wondering if it might do that.

560
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,180
 - Which is the insane conspiracy that the USA has run

561
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,540
 by Satan worshiping child sacrificing pedophiles.

562
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,020
 But I don't know why in Sheffield,

563
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,620
 people will be changing the street signs.

564
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,340
 This will get the word out.

565
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,380
 So maybe nothing to do with that.

566
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,540
 - One of the road based public service that people perform,

567
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,500
 which I think is very cool is in the Czech Republic,

568
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,100
 where a group of Czech nerds basically just saved

569
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,300
 the government $18 million.

570
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,140
 - What?

571
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,460
 - And they did this because there's this guy called

572
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,620
 Tomas Von Dracheck, and he is a businessman.

573
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,780
 He runs some tech businesses.

574
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,060
 And he found out that the country was about to pay $18 million

575
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,460
 to switch their road toll system to a digital system.

576
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,660
 And as someone who knows about coding and programming

577
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,100
 and stuff, he was really pissed off.

578
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,660
 He put a post on LinkedIn saying,

579
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,020
 "This is classic bureaucracy gone mad.

580
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,220
 "This task is simple enough for a group of programmers

581
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,780
 "to do over a weekend."

582
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,340
 And he just put that on LinkedIn.

583
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,260
 And the prime minister got in touch and was like,

584
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,660
 "Well, is that true?

585
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,140
 "And would you mind doing it?"

586
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,420
 And so he was like, "All right, I'll ask some friends."

587
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,060
 And he signed up 150 of his programmer friends.

588
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,580
 And over 48 hours, they got together

589
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,340
 and redesigned the whole Czech road system.

590
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,940
 And they got like meals brought to them

591
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,620
 by members of the public and saved the country.

592
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,100
 - That's awesome.

593
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,020
 Speaking of European road stuff and road signs,

594
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,180
 the big story of this year, as we all know,

595
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,700
 was the town of fucking,

596
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,140
 which is in, where is the town of?

597
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,860
 - Austria? - In Austria, yeah.

598
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,700
 And they are sick and tired of all the fucking tourists

599
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,780
 coming over and stealing their road signs, right?

600
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,260
 They really... - They're fucking road signs.

601
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,500
 - They're fucking road signs.

602
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,220
 So they decided that they were gonna change their name

603
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,380
 to "fugging" and they wrote it on it.

604
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,740
 And this has happened and the town of fucking

605
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,940
 is now called the town of "fugging."

606
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,460
 But it hasn't stopped the vandalism

607
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,780
 because there's been a whole load of more vandalism

608
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,140
 of people changing the signs back to "fugging."

609
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,260
 (laughing)

610
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,580
 - "Fugging" is objectively a funny-sounding word as well.

611
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,980
 And it's quite close to the original.

612
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,140
 They should have changed it to "gent" or something.

613
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,260
 - They can't change it to "gent."

614
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,140
 There's already a "gent." - Well, that'd be confusing.

615
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,100
 - Yeah, something nice sounding like "gent."

616
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
 Vienna, yeah, exactly Vienna, thank you.

617
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,700
 - In 2017, in China, in the province of Jiangzhou,

618
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,900
 a man was arrested for repainting road signs

619
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,100
 in order to make his commute easier.

620
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,780
 He was really annoyed being stuck in traffic

621
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,060
 in a lane on the motorway and he was caught

622
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,100
 on CCTV painting big white paint arrows

623
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,220
 to redirect all the cars in his lane

624
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,580
 into the lane next to it to stop the traffic.

625
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,780
 - That is brilliant.

626
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,020
 (laughing)

627
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,540
 But as if he would get out, paint it, get back in

628
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,220
 and then all the cars would go, "Whoa!"

629
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,660
 (laughing)

630
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,740
 - I couldn't work out for a long...

631
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,700
 When you started saying this,

632
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,340
 I couldn't work out how you would choose road signs

633
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,540
 to make your commute easier

634
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,660
 'cause I thought he was putting out directions for himself

635
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,420
 like this way, Derek, or whatever.

636
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,260
 (laughing)

637
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,100
 Which I would love to do.

638
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,060
 - Do you know that's a thing that exists in Los Angeles?

639
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,460
 This is another thing I read in that book.

640
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,300
 - What's that?

641
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,420
 - So if you live in Los Angeles, you would know about this

642
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,300
 but I'd never heard of it before.

643
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,620
 There are these road signs, rectangular yellow road signs

644
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,980
 that just turn up every now and then.

645
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,300
 And they tend to be a black arrow with some letters above it

646
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,980
 and some letters below and the letters below

647
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,340
 are kind of the inverse mirror image of the ones above.

648
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,460
 And what these are is their directions to movie sets

649
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,220
 or to TV show filming locations.

650
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,300
 And when you're in LA and you're filming

651
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,260
 in some kind of parking lot somewhere,

652
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,380
 you'll put these signs up.

653
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,180
 So all the techies will know where to go,

654
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,260
 all the actors will know where to go, stuff like this.

655
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,940
 And obviously the people in LA know what this is

656
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,660
 but if you're a tourist and you're kind of looking

657
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,420
 for celebrities and stuff, you just wouldn't know.

658
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,780
 You just see this sign and you think,

659
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,420
 "Well, it's just nonsense."

660
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,260
 - Also it doesn't say Batman or whatever.

661
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,340
 - No, but what they do is they tend to put words

662
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,860
 that the people in the know would know what it is.

663
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,220
 But the people who don't know what it is

664
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,660
 wouldn't know what it was.

665
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,780
 For instance, it would say, "Magnus Rex this way,

666
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,100
 Magnus Rex this way."

667
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,300
 And that was the Batman reboot, the Dark Knight Rises.

668
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,260
 So if you saw those signs, you would know

669
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,980
 to go to the Dark Knight Rises.

670
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,220
 There were signs for Rasputin.

671
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,580
 So you would think, "Oh, they're just doing some low budget

672
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,060
 Russian movie but actually it was for Iron Man 2."

673
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,380
 But that's got a Russian baddie in it.

674
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,220
 - Does it?

675
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,060
 - Yeah.

676
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,900
 - Does it?

677
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,220
 - So that's a very tricky clue.

678
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,620
 - Iron Curtain Man.

679
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,940
 - Brilliant, isn't he?

680
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,500
 - Yeah, I think that's what they actually tried calling it.

681
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,660
 - Well, in ancient Rome,

682
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,500
 they used to have names on road signs, didn't they?

683
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,260
 I think I read this, that yeah, you used to have,

684
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,460
 if you had a road sign, whoever built the road

685
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,660
 would have their name on it.

686
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,780
 So you could admire the work of this particular person

687
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,580
 and then it would have the name as well of the person

688
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,500
 who last repaired it.

689
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,740
 So it's sort of update on who to thank

690
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,260
 for the smoothness of the road.

691
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,380
 - It's like these toilets were last checked by signs

692
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,580
 that you get in publics.

693
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,940
 - Yeah, exactly.

694
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,860
 - So this is kind of about street art

695
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,140
 and artists mucking around with things.

696
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,180
 So I just thought I'd try and find out a little bit

697
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,220
 about Banksy and I'm here to tell you who he is.

698
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,060
 No, I don't know that.

699
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,420
 But there was a large theory that did the rounds

700
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,740
 that it's Neil Buchanan from Art Attack.

701
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,540
 If you remember that from your childhood.

702
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,380
 - I do.

703
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,420
 - He's very used to large outdoor multimedia installations.

704
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,020
 There's lots of good circumstantial evidence.

705
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,260
 It got so bad this year that he had to put

706
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,700
 at the top of his website an announcement saying,

707
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,660
 "Neil Buchanan is not Banksy.

708
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,500
 We have been inundated with inquiries over the weekend.

709
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,420
 This website does not have the infrastructure

710
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,620
 to answer all these inquiries individually.

711
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,780
 We can confirm there is no truth in the rumor whatsoever."

712
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,420
 - Exactly what Banksy would say.

713
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,020
 (all laughing)

714
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,260
 It's Neil.

715
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,620
 So the Museum of Modern Art in New York

716
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,900
 has had a few of these over the years.

717
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,580
 There was a guy called Harvey Stromberg

718
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,300
 who in 1971 decided he wanted an exhibition in MoMA.

719
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,020
 But obviously they wouldn't let him

720
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,020
 'cause he wasn't very famous.

721
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,340
 So what he did was he went in every day

722
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,980
 and he would take photos of a light socket

723
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,340
 or of a tile on the floor or of a brick on the wall.

724
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,260
 He would go home.

725
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,140
 He would print it out on his printer

726
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,020
 and then he would go in and stick it over

727
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,420
 to the exact place where he'd taken the photo from.

728
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,020
 Like a lot of them, they never found them

729
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,540
 for years and years and years.

730
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,700
 Whenever you put one on the floor,

731
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,860
 they would find it on the same day

732
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,180
 because they had those kind of buffing machines

733
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,260
 that would go around and clean the floor

734
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,340
 and they would find them.

735
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,740
 But there were some that were just over a brick on the wall

736
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,620
 which they didn't find for decades.

737
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,260
 - I'm gonna start doing that in my house

738
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,980
 to broken bits of wallpaper and, you know,

739
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,060
 rusting bath handles.

740
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,060
 Just take a photo of a nice bit of wallpaper,

741
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,900
 stick it over.

742
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,940
 Have you guys been about the Grammar Vigilantes?

743
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,780
 - No.

744
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:58,100
 - So these are people who go around correcting sign posts.

745
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,180
 They seem to happen in various countries.

746
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,020
 In Bristol, Bristol has the UK's leading grammar vigilante

747
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,340
 and he specialises in apostrophes.

748
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,140
 He began in 2003 when he saw a council sign

749
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,820
 which said open Mondays to Fridays

750
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,660
 but with apostrophes in both of those words

751
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,580
 which obviously is a painful experience.

752
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,940
 And so he invented something called the apostrophizer

753
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,020
 which is an eight foot long tool

754
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,020
 which basically has an apostrophe stamp on the end

755
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,140
 so that he can reach the really high signs

756
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,900
 and insert the apostrophe.

757
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,060
 And he doesn't like to do damage

758
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,020
 so he built his own specially made step ladder

759
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,300
 so it didn't have to be lent up against shops.

760
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,540
 - How much damage is he doing with a normal step ladder?

761
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,980
 You're using the step ladder wrong

762
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,140
 if every time you're taken away from the building

763
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,460
 bricks fall out of it.

764
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,780
 - Yeah, he's not a step ladder pro.

765
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,020
 - I've got a couple of things just on signs,

766
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,860
 general signs.

767
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,940
 So firstly, I found it quite amazing

768
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,180
 that signs played quite an important role

769
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,100
 during World War II in the UK

770
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,220
 in that there was a message that went around

771
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,340
 to a lot of people to remove the signs

772
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,580
 so that if any Germans were coming over

773
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,980
 they'd be confused and have no idea where to go.

774
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,940
 So people encouraged us to take them down

775
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,020
 and people would arrive, not know where they're going

776
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,140
 but on the flip side there was also a movement by Hitler

777
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,220
 to change signs around so you would send people to the rock.

778
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,500
 Apparently that's a thing that was attempted.

779
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,220
 I don't know how successful it was.

780
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,820
 So it must have just been very confusing driving around

781
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,660
 in World War II.

782
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,620
 - It sounds like your sauce for this is dad's army.

783
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,460
 - Yeah.

784
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,700
 - That's amazing.

785
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,220
 - If you are a Hitler and you've got spies on the ground

786
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
 during the Second World War,

787
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,340
 I would definitely want to know about troop movements

788
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,620
 and the state of the country's defense

789
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,860
 is more than misdirecting people to their local church

790
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,580
 or whatever the signs are for.

791
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,020
 - Getting a commuter lost on his way home for tea.

792
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,140
 Well, this is why they lost the war, Andy.

793
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,980
 It was definitely a sign of resistance in Norway

794
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,420
 when the fascists took over Norway.

795
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,620
 A very subtle sign of resistance was apparently

796
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,100
 you often gave Nazis incorrect directions

797
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,500
 when they asked the way for somewhere.

798
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,980
 That was a signal that you were on the good guy's side.

799
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,060
 - And they can't find their way back to you

800
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,860
 'cause they're lost.

801
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,900
 So that's actually pretty effective, yeah.

802
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,180
 - Have you ever given someone wrong directions

803
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,420
 in London, for instance, like a tourist

804
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,660
 and then realized afterwards that you've done it,

805
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,060
 you didn't do it on purpose.

806
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,460
 And then you realize, you think,

807
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,980
 "Oh, fuck, I've just sent them to the wrong place."

808
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,700
 That is one of the worst feelings in the world, isn't it?

809
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,900
 - It's bad.

810
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,940
 But if you suspect that they're a foreign spy,

811
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,300
 then it's actually nothing to do with it, yeah.

812
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,460
 - They were a leftover Nazi still plugging away

813
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,820
 80 years later.

814
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,660
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

815
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,220
 and that is Andy.

816
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,140
 - My fact is that King Edward III owned a Yeti mask.

817
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,620
 So, riddle me that.

818
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,100
 Okay, so, I've said Yeti mask.

819
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,260
 There is a creature in English mythology,

820
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,180
 which I think is kind of close,

821
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,580
 sort of analogous to the Yeti.

822
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,380
 Basically, these were things called woodwoses,

823
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,700
 and they were wild men who lived in the woods.

824
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,300
 They were big, they were not civilized,

825
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,980
 they were covered in hair.

826
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,900
 They weren't really human from all the depictions of them.

827
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,500
 They crop up a lot in medieval manuscripts

828
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,340
 and things like that.

829
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,700
 Normally, kind of trying to carry women off,

830
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,500
 and then a knight has to turn up and save the day

831
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,980
 and kill the woodwose.

832
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,180
 And in Edward III's accounts,

833
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,340
 they have these wardrobe accounts

834
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,580
 which list everything that the king bought.

835
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,700
 From 1348 AD, there is Capita de Woodwose,

836
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,300
 which is the head of a woodwose.

837
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,260
 In fact, before it, there is XIV,

838
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,700
 which is 14 of Roman numerals.

839
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,980
 I don't think that means he bought 14 of them.

840
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,700
 I really hope it was.

841
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,060
 - Could be, yeah. - It was that.

842
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,660
 Yeah, so this is a woodwose.

843
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,980
 - He really liked, he's from the 14th century,

844
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,340
 Edward III, right?

845
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,700
 He really enjoyed doing like tournaments

846
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,660
 and jousts and stuff like that.

847
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,420
 And according to one paper I read,

848
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,660
 so this is by a guy called A. Chester Beattie,

849
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,380
 who was like an American billionaire who became a historian.

850
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,820
 He reckons that Edward might have used the mask

851
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,860
 for one of his Christmas tournaments

852
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,340
 so that maybe people would be jousting

853
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,340
 with a woodwose head on.

854
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,740
 So it might have been like, you know, like the masked singer,

855
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,460
 where people are kind of jousting,

856
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,820
 but they're in masks and stuff,

857
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,380
 because there was also a Capita elefantum,

858
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,300
 a Capita virginum, a Capita leonum,

859
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,620
 and a Capita signorum.

860
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,260
 So in his wardrobe, he had an elephant head,

861
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,740
 a virgin's head, a lion's head, and a swan's head.

862
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,300
 - A virgin's head. - A virgin's head.

863
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,860
 - The virgin's chances in this fight

864
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,380
 between several wild animals.

865
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,060
 (laughing)

866
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,860
 How can you tell a virgin's head?

867
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,700
 I mean, the hymen's not on the head.

868
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,940
 What's gonna give it away?

869
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,620
 Just on Edward's royal wardrobe,

870
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,780
 he did have pretty lavish taste,

871
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,500
 so this might be the same year as the woodwose costume,

872
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,940
 but in 1337 to 38,

873
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,100
 the clerk of his wardrobe ordered these huge amounts

874
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,900
 of like cloth and yarn and full bull's hides

875
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,340
 and loads of gold leaf,

876
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,340
 and also 86 plain masks and 12 masks with long beards.

877
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,740
 And this was preparation for the King's Games,

878
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,900
 which they had every year.

879
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,740
 And along with that,

880
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,300
 they built an entire fake forest,

881
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,100
 so out of timber and paint and everything,

882
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,380
 a massive fake forest,

883
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,380
 and then they made loads of linen baboons,

884
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,980
 and they sort of dropped all these linen baboons

885
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,900
 into the forest,

886
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,100
 and they sewed the baboons into tunics

887
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,180
 with sort of pearls and hoes and gloves

888
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,620
 and caps on them and everything.

889
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,180
 So they were wearing the proper gear

890
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,660
 'cause they're in the royal household.

891
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,980
 And then I guess they galloped through the fake forest

892
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,540
 and hunted down linen baboons.

893
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,700
 - Oh my God, that sounds amazing.

894
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,580
 A lot of this was because,

895
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,180
 so Edward was married to Philippa of Hainult, right?

896
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,460
 And they were very young when they got married.

897
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,220
 And so there was a regency period

898
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,980
 where Isabella was looking after the country,

899
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,260
 who was Edward's mother, right?

900
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,100
 Isabella.

901
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,540
 So Isabella kept Philippa and Edward in real punery,

902
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,100
 like she wouldn't give them much money to do anything.

903
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,580
 They kind of had to live their life almost,

904
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,780
 not as normal people, but as normal rich people.

905
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,820
 But then when they became king and queen proper,

906
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,580
 they just really went for it.

907
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,940
 And Philippa of Hainult just spent so much money

908
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,300
 on all these incredibly lavish clothes and jewels.

909
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,420
 And by 1360, they owed about 16,000 pounds

910
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,820
 to various different clothing embroiderers

911
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,380
 and tailors and furriers.

912
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,940
 And that's a couple of million pounds in today's terms

913
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,100
 that they owed to these people.

914
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,540
 And I was reading about like one robe that she had,

915
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,340
 which required 952 ventures.

916
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,860
 And I didn't know what a ventra was.

917
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,460
 Apparently it's the fur that you get

918
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,460
 from the belly of a red squirrel.

919
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:48,460
 So they had to get 952 squirrels for this one robe.

920
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,580
 It's like, whoa.

921
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,580
 - Is the whole blaming the gray squirrels thing?

922
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,780
 Were they a scapegoat that these guys created

923
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,180
 'cause they actually caused red squirrels

924
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,740
 to go almost extinct?

925
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,100
 - Maybe, yeah.

926
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,700
 - He really went bust later on.

927
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,740
 Edward III had to pawn off the crown jewels

928
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,540
 so that he could raise money.

929
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,980
 He didn't have a, yeah.

930
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,820
 But he pawned off the great crown of England

931
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,420
 to Simon de Mirabello.

932
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,620
 - Wow.

933
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,660
 - Just one thing that he did own,

934
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,260
 which is quite similar to something that Dan owns,

935
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,260
 is he had a Yeti mug in as much as he had a silver cup

936
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,740
 that was decorated with Wodewozes.

937
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,020
 So if we're saying that there was a Yeti's,

938
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,700
 then he had a Yeti mug.

939
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,700
 - I think Dan will,

940
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,620
 Dan, you've been keeping a very polite diplomatic silence

941
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,780
 about whether they're Yetis or not.

942
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,300
 I'm pretty sure Dan thinks they're not Yetis.

943
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,940
 - They absolutely aren't Yetis, yeah.

944
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,620
 - It's a completely different species.

945
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,620
 - Completely different species.

946
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:50,620
 Before we get into me absolutely ripping Andy over that,

947
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,020
 just sticking on Edward III for a second,

948
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,460
 he's an interesting character that I hadn't heard of him

949
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,460
 as a king, have to say.

950
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,620
 Again, I'm not British,

951
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,340
 so he's very far back.

952
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,420
 - But you've heard of, you know,

953
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,060
 Edward's the fifth and sixth,

954
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,060
 presumably you knew that a third must have happened before.

955
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,980
 - Yeah, I've got all the other in the trilogy of Edwards,

956
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,220
 but I've not seen that one, unfortunately.

957
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,140
 - No, it went downhill actually.

958
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,380
 - Yeah, so it's interesting in that all of us

959
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,900
 are probably related to him.

960
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,540
 He's one of those guys where they've done a few reports

961
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,460
 where they say there's a 99% chance

962
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,820
 that if you are of British origin,

963
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,140
 if you were born and your family was through this period,

964
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,980
 you are directly related to him.

965
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,460
 So all of us are his great, great, great, great grandchildren,

966
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,420
 but also he created something that still goes on today,

967
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,140
 which is also connected to clothing,

968
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,500
 which is the chivalry Knights of the Garter.

969
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,700
 And the garter itself is literally a garter

970
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,860
 which you would wear.

971
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,740
 There's a story that he was at some dance

972
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,620
 and he was dancing with the Countess of Salisbury

973
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,980
 and the garter, and this is one of the stories,

974
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,940
 there's many stories, but the story is is that

975
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,860
 the garter slipped down her leg

976
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,420
 and everyone started laughing, but he got very furious

977
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,580
 and he yelled, "Shame on him who thinks ill of it,"

978
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,060
 about the situation.

979
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,180
 And that is the motto of the Knights of the Garter,

980
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,820
 "Shame on him who thinks ill of it."

981
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,140
 And that is a garter that became the code for these knights,

982
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,140
 which is a thing still going on today.

983
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,380
 In fact, there's over a thousand Knights of the Garter now,

984
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,780
 the thousandth of which was Prince William,

985
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,260
 which is a very convenient number to land on, yeah.

986
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,540
 - Yeah, who had to fill in those last 20?

987
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,660
 Was it just 20 folks wandering past?

988
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,500
 - Do you think that they rushed through a load

989
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,460
 to get to a thousand, or do you think a load of people

990
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,580
 weren't allowed to become for like 30 years,

991
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,620
 they weren't allowed to do it?

992
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,380
 - Yeah, interestingly, it's the two princes,

993
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,700
 it's Andrew and Edward,

994
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,340
 and then it's meant to be William next,

995
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,900
 but they just slipped in an MP in between,

996
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,380
 so there's one guy just taking up 999.

997
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,220
 - Genuinely at 999.

998
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:50,020
 - Anyway, Woodwosers, Andy, you fucking idiot.

999
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,580
 (all laughing)

1000
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,420
 They are Yetis, then, they're the British Yeti.

1001
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,580
 - Wow. - And this is, okay,

1002
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,740
 this is the real thing.

1003
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,220
 I think they may have a kind of relationship

1004
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,780
 with the real history in that,

1005
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,300
 obviously they're mythical, these Wordwosers,

1006
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,500
 they're not, they don't exist,

1007
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
 but after the Norman conquest,

1008
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,140
 you did for many years,

1009
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,980
 you got gangs of wild men living savage in the woods,

1010
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,500
 the swamps, they were social outcasts,

1011
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,820
 they were criminalized,

1012
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,700
 so that is a possible origin point for this story,

1013
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,580
 sort of wild man living in the woods.

1014
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,980
 There are lots of medieval churches

1015
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,020
 which have Woodwosers in their stones,

1016
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,420
 and so there's this weird kind of relationship

1017
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,220
 between local myth and newer Christian traditions,

1018
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,060
 that kind of thing.

1019
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,500
 - Well, even great scientific minds, actually,

1020
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,300
 for a while thought that these were real,

1021
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,980
 and they didn't think it was a separate species,

1022
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,660
 they thought it was someone, as you say, went wild,

1023
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,580
 became wild, had children that were wild,

1024
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,220
 and they grew up as a sort of subspecies

1025
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,180
 that knew nothing but the wild.

1026
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,540
 In fact, the person who gave us the name Homo sapiens,

1027
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,140
 he had Linnaeus, that was Linnaeus who did that,

1028
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,980
 and one of the categories was Homo ferris,

1029
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,780
 which was these wild people, and he was convinced,

1030
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,980
 and that's been dropped since,

1031
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,300
 we don't talk about his Homo ferris group,

1032
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,060
 there's a few, but he believed that there were wolf boys,

1033
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,100
 or feral children, that were abandoned by lost parents,

1034
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,220
 and subsequently raised by wolves,

1035
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,460
 that's the actual wolves, not Virginia wolf's family,

1036
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,460
 and there's lots of legends like Romulus in Rome and Remus

1037
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,740
 who were suckled by a she-wolf.

1038
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,380
 - And there was a belief that they sort of naturally grew hair,

1039
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,020
 I think, in the forest to protect themselves,

1040
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,820
 'cause they were living the elements, wasn't there?

1041
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,820
 - That's right, I quite like that Romulus and Remus

1042
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,820
 were suckled by a she-wolf, because Edward III,

1043
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,260
 who wore a woad-woose, was suckled by a she-wolf as well.

1044
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,420
 - No, he wasn't.

1045
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,300
 - Was he? - Yeah, that's what his mother

1046
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,900
 was known as, the she-wolf.

1047
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,420
 - Oh, very fair, yeah, don't ever switch a roux.

1048
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,180
 - These tenuous links to animal themes.

1049
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,100
 - Aw, that was a great one, Dan,

1050
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,220
 don't let the bump around that.

1051
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,260
 - TS Eliot would have rejected that for publication.

1052
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,900
 - Come on.

1053
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,620
 - You know, woad-wooses and wild men and stuff like that

1054
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,900
 are in one very famous historical poem,

1055
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,740
 seeing as we're talking about TS Eliot,

1056
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,540
 and that is the 14th century romance poem,

1057
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,180
 "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,"

1058
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,780
 and according to that poem,

1059
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,420
 the woad-wooses in the UK,

1060
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,580
 they live on the Wirral Peninsula,

1061
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,340
 which is just outside Liverpool.

1062
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,220
 According to this poem,

1063
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,620
 "In the wilderness of Wirral,

1064
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,180
 dwelt there but few,

1065
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,740
 that God or man with good heart loved."

1066
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,780
 And it is basically, this was such a wild west,

1067
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,300
 wooded, crazy area,

1068
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,660
 that this is where you would get these wild men living.

1069
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,820
 - It's a little known fact that if the Beatles

1070
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,220
 didn't shave meticulously every day,

1071
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,460
 it would be covered in air from head to toe.

1072
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,660
 The other stuff that Gawain fights

1073
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,020
 in "Gawain and the Green Knight" is quite odd.

1074
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,420
 So the Green Knight himself is a kind of woad-woaser

1075
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,580
 in the, like Tolkien does a translation

1076
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,540
 where he translates the Green Knight as being a woad-woaser,

1077
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,980
 and they were often green men as well,

1078
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,420
 were another mythical wild man.

1079
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,420
 But Gawain also fights in that chivalric myth,

1080
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,060
 Wormers, which are dragons.

1081
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,540
 Dragons were called worms.

1082
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,380
 - Really?

1083
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,900
 - I think that's a huge promotion.

1084
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,540
 We've given dragons that they were worms.

1085
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,900
 People, worms, wolves and word-woats.

1086
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,220
 And the reason I'm saying it weirdly

1087
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,260
 is because every time it's spelled, it's spelled differently.

1088
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,220
 So you can say word-a-woaz-a-ward-a-ward-a-woaz-a,

1089
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,060
 any way you like.

1090
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,900
 - It is when, isn't it?

1091
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,020
 And one of the spelling is water house,

1092
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,740
 which is where PG Woodhouse gets his name.

1093
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,860
 - So cool. - That is amazing, isn't it?

1094
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,900
 - PG Woodhouse has descended from Yeti's.

1095
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,180
 - Dan, do you agree with that?

1096
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,900
 - I do, but for different theories.

1097
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,900
 (laughing)

1098
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,340
 - You guys know, you do remember John Falstoff?

1099
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,260
 We've mentioned him before, friend of the podcast.

1100
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,540
 He was maybe the inspiration for Falstoff.

1101
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,860
 - He was, and he was there at the Battle of Agincourt

1102
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,300
 and stuff, and he was there when Joan of Arc came

1103
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,100
 into Paris and all that kind of stuff.

1104
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,020
 - Yeah, he had a big old tapestry

1105
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,020
 with word-woaz in his hall.

1106
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,860
 Yeah, so they were big.

1107
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,780
 - Well, you also said they appear quite a lot

1108
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,600
 in architecture and cathedrals and stuff.

1109
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,780
 One example of where word-woaz, or in fact, green men,

1110
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,940
 the sort of descendant of word-woaz appears,

1111
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,380
 is Norwich Cathedral.

1112
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,340
 And that is 'cause they were very common in roof bosses,

1113
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,780
 which we know a lot about, 'cause they featured heavily

1114
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,580
 in our last year's book of the year 2019.

1115
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,480
 And that's why, if you remember, in Norwich Cathedral,

1116
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,020
 they erected a helter-skelter that you could climb up

1117
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,620
 last year so you could get a better view of the roof bosses.

1118
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,500
 And I mentioned it 'cause I love that reference,

1119
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,760
 who was the guy who decided to put the slide in,

1120
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,680
 and he was inspired when he visited the Sistine Chapel,

1121
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,680
 and the thing he thought, as he looked over the ceiling

1122
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,640
 of the Sistine Chapel, was that Norwich Cathedral's

1123
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,800
 decorations were every bit as wonderful,

1124
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,680
 but just too high up to be appreciated.

1125
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,280
 - Yes.

1126
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,880
 The Sistine Chapel, they have recently,

1127
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,960
 'cause it's such a pain to look up constantly.

1128
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,200
 You get a kind of crick in your neck if you're in there

1129
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,680
 and you're always having to, you know, crane your neck up.

1130
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,960
 So they, I think, have just installed swings

1131
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,180
 so that you get a really good view of that thing.

1132
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,020
 (all laughing)

1133
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,180
 - Oh, I was with you for so much of that.

1134
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,760
 (upbeat music)

1135
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:18,820
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1136
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,020
 and that is N.

1137
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,900
 - My fact this week is that there's a single termite home

1138
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,460
 in Brazil that's the same size as Great Britain.

1139
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,100
 - Wow, that's astonishing.

1140
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,940
 - It's a big home.

1141
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,060
 It's not, I don't think a home, yeah.

1142
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,040
 I'm gonna preempt to James.

1143
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,340
 (all laughing)

1144
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,860
 - Right, I wanna say it.

1145
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,900
 - No, stop it, shut your mouth.

1146
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,020
 It's not a single termite.

1147
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,280
 It's a single home, but it is more than one termite

1148
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,640
 living there.

1149
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,780
 - Since the kids of left were rattling around the place,

1150
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,380
 it's the size of Great Britain,

1151
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,260
 and I'm the size of a grain of rice.

1152
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:59,460
 - The bedroom tax has taken it as tall on these termites.

1153
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,060
 - This is just incredible.

1154
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,940
 It was only confirmed a couple of years ago,

1155
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,380
 only sort of discovered a couple of years ago

1156
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,540
 when they've been clearing this pasture in Brazil

1157
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,460
 for agriculture and stuff for 20 or 30 years,

1158
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,100
 and people started noticing there were a lot of mounds around,

1159
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,260
 and eventually, 2018,

1160
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,060
 someone decided to do a proper study of it

1161
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,020
 and survey of it.

1162
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,260
 They realized there are 200 million termite mounds.

1163
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,500
 These piles of excavated termite dirt

1164
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,780
 spread across something the size of Great Britain.

1165
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,820
 So all across Brazil, and no one had really noticed before,

1166
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,060
 'cause then the people who lived there knew

1167
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,620
 that there were these termite mounds kind of scattered about.

1168
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,500
 - It wasn't that a scientist came along,

1169
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,300
 and he went, "What are these massive mounds doing?"

1170
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,740
 They went, "What? Oh my God."

1171
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,380
 (laughing)

1172
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,620
 - It wasn't quite that.

1173
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,060
 - Because their termite mounds are quite solid,

1174
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,860
 they would just build their houses around them,

1175
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,700
 wouldn't they?

1176
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,140
 They would, you know, they'd be in your garden,

1177
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,260
 and you'd like turn it into a barbecue or something,

1178
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,380
 or you sit on-- - Slides.

1179
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,220
 - You could put a slide down it for their kids.

1180
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,340
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1181
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,180
 - It's amazing as well, isn't it?

1182
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,340
 Because it's a single termite species

1183
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,780
 that's been working on this,

1184
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,860
 and they've looked into the amount of soil

1185
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,420
 that they've managed to excavate

1186
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,660
 that sits on top of the earth,

1187
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,060
 and they say that it's equivalent

1188
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,620
 to 4,000 Great Pyramids of Giza.

1189
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,300
 It's the amount that they've managed in all these years.

1190
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,140
 - Amazing. - Yeah.

1191
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,980
 - It's extraordinary.

1192
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,060
 - And some of them are as old as the pyramids,

1193
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,220
 so all of these are at least 700 years old,

1194
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,540
 give or take, a few years,

1195
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,180
 and they're up to 3,800 years old,

1196
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,340
 and that's just from the 11

1197
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,420
 that they've properly studied the age of so far.

1198
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,020
 So some of them could be way older than that,

1199
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,340
 but that is roughly the age of a lot of pyramids.

1200
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,300
 - Yeah, no, they've said it,

1201
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,540
 that's actually the minimum estimate of their range,

1202
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,500
 and it's like 4,000 years old is the minimum.

1203
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,140
 It might be twice as old as that

1204
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,700
 from what they've studied so far.

1205
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,500
 And like you say, it is one family,

1206
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,140
 'cause they thought that it must be

1207
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,300
 lots of different species of termites that are rivals,

1208
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,620
 but they took a bunch of termites from one pile of dirt

1209
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,100
 and then put them with a bunch of termites from another,

1210
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,900
 and you'd expect them to always fight,

1211
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,860
 and they got along like family, like a happy family.

1212
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,260
 And so they basically proved that this is just one home,

1213
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,540
 one family house. - So cool.

1214
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,340
 Do you know how they found out how old they are?

1215
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,660
 This is quite cool.

1216
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,540
 What they did was they dug into the bottom

1217
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,060
 of one of these piles of earth,

1218
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,980
 and they took out a little bit of earth,

1219
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,980
 and there's a technique which is really complicated,

1220
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,820
 so I won't go into it,

1221
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,380
 but you can kind of fire lasers at this earth

1222
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,860
 and look at what happens to the electrons,

1223
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,500
 and you work out the last time that it was exposed to sunlight.

1224
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,340
 So they can just work.

1225
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,180
 It's so clever.

1226
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,420
 It's like carbon dating,

1227
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,020
 but for things that have not been alive,

1228
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,700
 and you just fire your little lasers at it,

1229
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,460
 and it'll tell you when the last time it was in the sun.

1230
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,300
 - Oh, that's so cool. - It's so clever.

1231
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,580
 - We're so clever.

1232
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,940
 We're here talking about how clever these termites are,

1233
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,820
 but look at us, kicking ass.

1234
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,540
 - When we say we, it is the scientist,

1235
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,660
 because when I say it's complicated,

1236
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,540
 I don't wanna go into it.

1237
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,940
 Partly it's because I don't really understand it.

1238
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,620
 (laughing)

1239
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,660
 - We can take credit.

1240
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,860
 I bet there were just two termite architects

1241
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,820
 that built this whole thing,

1242
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,340
 but the rest of the termites are going,

1243
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,180
 "God, we're impressive, aren't we?"

1244
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,020
 - That's right, yeah.

1245
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,020
 - You take credit for your species.

1246
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,580
 - But they're not even proper mounds

1247
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,740
 like other termites built.

1248
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:12,820
 So some termites build sort of chimneys or ventilation things.

1249
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,700
 These were just described by the scientists

1250
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,380
 who worked on this project as slag piles,

1251
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,620
 because they live underground.

1252
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,060
 All it is is they're making space

1253
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,020
 for their chambers underground,

1254
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,420
 so they make a vertical hole to the surface,

1255
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,340
 and then they just chuck the soil out of those holes,

1256
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,860
 and over time that builds up into, however tall these are,

1257
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,460
 two meters, two and a half meters.

1258
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,340
 I mean, imagine what's underground,

1259
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,700
 this huge cathedral space that they emptied out.

1260
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,660
 - Yeah, and they were first discovered by a few scientists,

1261
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,780
 but one in particular, a guy called Stephen Martin,

1262
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,260
 who's an entomologist at the University of Salthard,

1263
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,900
 and he doesn't even care about termites.

1264
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,660
 He is an expert in giant killer hornets.

1265
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,500
 - Is it me?

1266
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,220
 - The things that actually we should just call

1267
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,300
 giant hornets these days, just big old hornets.

1268
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,580
 We're not supposed to call them killer hornets.

1269
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,420
 - Murder hornets.

1270
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,260
 - Murder hornets, we're not supposed to say that.

1271
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,820
 But he's an expert in those guys,

1272
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,300
 and he was in Brazil looking for some bees,

1273
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,180
 because he wanted to see how the bees

1274
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,020
 were getting on in Brazil,

1275
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,460
 and then as he was going down the road,

1276
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,860
 he was like, wait a minute, what are those?

1277
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,180
 What are those things, and why are they so regular,

1278
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,860
 and why are they in like a pattern?

1279
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,580
 And that was when they worked out

1280
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,260
 that it was all this same species.

1281
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,100
 - Actually, it's worth saying,

1282
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,700
 I don't know if this has been mentioned,

1283
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,260
 or even if it's assumed by the listener,

1284
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,140
 but they're still building these mounds.

1285
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,820
 This is an active house.

1286
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,660
 It's not dead, it's not like a fossilized,

1287
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,580
 old abandoned Great Britain.

1288
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,540
 It's an active thing.

1289
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,380
 - Yeah.

1290
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,540
 - It's an extraordinary house, it's a Great Britain, sorry.

1291
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,900
 - Not enough there, are they, Andy?

1292
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,740
 - No, no, no.

1293
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:44,500
 - So termites are pretty incredible,

1294
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,180
 and possibly the most incredible termite

1295
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,300
 is the queen.

1296
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,780
 So they've got a queen-based structure,

1297
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,780
 like bees and other species.

1298
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,620
 - And England.

1299
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,380
 - And England, and much like in England,

1300
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,020
 the termite queen is the only fertile member.

1301
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:02,020
 And so she is super fertile, the termite, I mean,

1302
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,460
 and she basically spends her entire life

1303
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,860
 incessantly mating.

1304
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,380
 So she chooses a male to mate with,

1305
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,820
 and then she spends the subsequent 15 to 20,

1306
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,460
 sometimes years, constantly shagging him,

1307
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,420
 and she'll make one egg every three seconds.

1308
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,260
 So in her lifetime,

1309
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,540
 she makes over a quarter of a billion eggs,

1310
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,100
 it's constantly producing them.

1311
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,260
 - Is there a king termite that produces all the mating?

1312
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,100
 - There's a king termite,

1313
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,540
 and what's quite funny about them

1314
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,540
 is that she's about a hundred times bigger than he is,

1315
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,100
 and than anyone else in the colony.

1316
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,700
 So he's this microscopic thing, she's next to him,

1317
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,780
 and the reason she's so large

1318
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,620
 is because she is one giant ovary.

1319
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,340
 And do please look on YouTube

1320
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,020
 at the picture of a queen termite with eggs inside her.

1321
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:47,860
 So she's like this big, pulsating, transparent lump

1322
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,860
 that's full of eggs,

1323
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,300
 and you can see the eggs bubbling

1324
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,500
 and moving around inside her under her surface.

1325
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,820
 And yeah, she can't move.

1326
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,380
 So it's awful being the queen because you're stuck.

1327
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,900
 She can't fit out of the door of her enclosure anymore.

1328
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,860
 She can't move at all.

1329
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,500
 So she depends totally on members of her colony

1330
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,900
 to wash her, to feed her, to lick this weird sweat off her.

1331
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,740
 She's just stuck.

1332
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,700
 - Is this still the termite queen we're talking about?

1333
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,420
 - I'm just gonna leave that ambiguous.

1334
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,260
 - Scandal.

1335
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,340
 - But the door thing seems to be a bit of a mystery

1336
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,060
 'cause if you've got a house the size of Great Britain,

1337
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,660
 you'd think you could make the doors a bit bigger

1338
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,300
 to fit your leader out of.

1339
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,140
 What's going on there?

1340
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,100
 - That's a good point.

1341
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,700
 Termites usually have quite small doors.

1342
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,060
 They have like termite-sized doors.

1343
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:30,900
 - Indeed.

1344
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,180
 - She doesn't wanna go anywhere either.

1345
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,620
 I mean, she's attached to this huge body of,

1346
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,820
 her legs are tiny compared with the breeding mass of her.

1347
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,380
 - Yeah, if you gave her a big door,

1348
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,380
 it would actually just be horrifying for her

1349
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,820
 knowing she couldn't even get through it

1350
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,460
 'cause she can't move.

1351
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,180
 - So they're tricking her, they're basically saying,

1352
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,860
 "Oh, you could go everywhere, but the doors are too small."

1353
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,140
 What a shame, so she never knows.

1354
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,380
 - The door thing is quite important in termites

1355
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:57,180
 because a lot of them can't really defend themselves very well.

1356
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,620
 They can do a little bit of squirting,

1357
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,980
 horrible stuff out of their anus,

1358
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,900
 but there's not really much they can do if they're attacked.

1359
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,580
 And so usually what they'll do is like a few different insects,

1360
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,740
 they'll come back into their door and then use their head

1361
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:13,220
 as a block to stop anything else from coming into the door.

1362
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,380
 And so basically then anything coming in

1363
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,460
 will have to get past that one door head

1364
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,820
 and then another door head would go into their place

1365
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,660
 and then that stops anyone from getting into their tunnels.

1366
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,380
 And that is interesting as well because in 2018, in Japan,

1367
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,860
 they found the first all-female termite colonies

1368
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,420
 where all of the termites,

1369
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,260
 usually you would have kings and you would have lots

1370
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:36,540
 of male soldiers and stuff like that and male workers,

1371
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,540
 but this one is all females.

1372
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,540
 And the reason that they think it works

1373
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,780
 is that their males are lots of different sizes,

1374
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,420
 but the females are all exactly the same size.

1375
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,420
 And so they can have a head

1376
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,620
 which will exactly fit in the door every single time.

1377
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,260
 And you're not sometimes going to have someone

1378
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:56,260
 whose head's a bit too big or a bit too small.

1379
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,380
 And so by just having females in this colony,

1380
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,020
 it means that they have less chance of being attacked,

1381
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:05,060
 which makes up for the lack of genetic change

1382
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,180
 that you kind of need males and females for.

1383
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,020
 - So it's kind of interesting. - Nice.

1384
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:09,860
 - That's really cool.

1385
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,100
 - It's like they're the IKEA door blockers, you know?

1386
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,380
 It's just like made to very basic specifications.

1387
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,820
 It's all the same, it's going to fit together.

1388
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,260
 - Smart.

1389
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,860
 - We do take advice from termites on building these days.

1390
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:26,700
 So they are particularly good at ventilation,

1391
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,220
 which is something that we are quite bad at

1392
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,820
 because the amount that ventilation costs the atmosphere

1393
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,580
 and greenhouse gas emissions, et cetera, is so massive.

1394
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,180
 So we're now building buildings

1395
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,020
 that are inspired by their ventilation systems.

1396
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,100
 There's this place in Zimbabwe,

1397
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,220
 which was the first massive building,

1398
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,860
 it's a big shopping center called the Eastgate Center

1399
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:48,380
 and Office Block, inspired by termite systems.

1400
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,460
 And what they do is they have this system

1401
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,260
 of opening and closing doors that they're constantly tending to

1402
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,660
 to make sure that air comes in the right places,

1403
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,780
 moves up through the termite mound

1404
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,100
 so that it's heated in the right places,

1405
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,540
 it's cooled in the right places.

1406
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,780
 'Cause it needs to be at one precise temperature

1407
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,100
 the whole time on the inside for them to be able to survive.

1408
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,140
 So yeah, and they make the reason that they work so well

1409
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,500
 is the termite mounds catch the wind,

1410
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,580
 so it blows through them.

1411
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:16,620
 So a mound is like a lung and the wind comes in to them

1412
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:19,140
 and then is absorbed by the various bits,

1413
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,620
 the cells that need it and then goes out.

1414
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,700
 - If you want to go into this shopping center,

1415
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,500
 there's a security guard with his head blocking the door.

1416
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,620
 - Yeah, always female though.

1417
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,780
 Yeah, that's amazing.

1418
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,460
 And another good thing, because they're ventilated so well,

1419
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,420
 they make really good ovens.

1420
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,780
 So in South Africa, you'll get people

1421
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,260
 where they'll take a termite mound

1422
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,460
 and they'll kind of drill a little hole,

1423
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,100
 make the door a little bit bigger.

1424
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,380
 Hopefully it's the termite mound

1425
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,780
 where all the termites aren't there anymore, I hope.

1426
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,620
 But they'll set a little fire inside

1427
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,180
 and then the air will be sucked in through the door

1428
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,420
 and then go up through the top of the termite mound

1429
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,980
 because it's so well ventilated.

1430
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,020
 - Brilliant.

1431
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,340
 - And it means that you can cook like pizza in there

1432
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,700
 or anything that needs a high temperature, you cook in there.

1433
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,740
 - Do they warn the termites like a demolition order?

1434
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,580
 Do they put a sign up saying in three weeks time,

1435
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,860
 this will be turned into an oven,

1436
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,460
 please vacate your home?

1437
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,020
 - I'm just hoping that they're old ones.

1438
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,580
 - You don't have any ashes of termites on your pizza

1439
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,060
 as you're taking it out of the oven, do you?

1440
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,020
 - Maybe it's a delicacy.

1441
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,140
 - Well, people do eat termites, don't they?

1442
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,060
 They're infused into muffins in certain countries.

1443
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,900
 - Really?

1444
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,700
 - Yeah, so it's possible that termite pizza is a thing.

1445
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,540
 - Yeah.

1446
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,380
 - Do you know how they transfer water across their mounds?

1447
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,420
 So sometimes a bit of the mound gets really dry

1448
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,900
 and it needs moistening lubrication.

1449
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,740
 This is so cool.

1450
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,380
 They drink half their body weight in water.

1451
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,060
 They go to a dry part of the mound

1452
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,380
 and then they pass it into another termite's mouth.

1453
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,220
 It's basically-

1454
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,060
 - All the water?

1455
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,020
 - All the water, yeah, yeah.

1456
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,660
 And there's a scientist called J. Scott Turner

1457
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,940
 who fed them fluorescent dyed water

1458
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,380
 and could see it moving from one termite to another.

1459
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,260
 So basically it's like it's as if a bucket chain

1460
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,660
 to put out a fire was people just, you know,

1461
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,420
 pushing the water into each other's mouths.

1462
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,140
 - It's not very COVID friendly, is it?

1463
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,540
 - It's not very COVID friendly,

1464
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,100
 but it would make firefighting a much sexier profession

1465
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,060
 than it already is.

1466
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,820
 - Is it, wait, so is it to make sure that-

1467
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,660
 - Would it?

1468
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:14,500
 (laughing)

1469
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,340
 - Sorry?

1470
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,180
 - Yeah.

1471
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,260
 - I think it would make it a much less effective profession

1472
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,660
 because every time you would swallow a little bit

1473
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,180
 of the water and by the time it got to the final fireman,

1474
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,940
 it would just be a little dribble coming out of as well.

1475
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,980
 - You'd obviously hire people with enormous mouths

1476
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,540
 to hold as much water as they could.

1477
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,060
 So the physical profile of the firefighter might change.

1478
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,740
 I'm not suggesting a change in the system.

1479
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,540
 I'm sorry, I'd just like to clarify.

1480
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,380
 - Is this to-

1481
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,820
 - As you see your house being burnt down,

1482
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,260
 why not at least have something sexy to look at

1483
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,780
 while you're watching your life get destroyed?

1484
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,100
 I get it, I get that.

1485
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,980
 - Is this to moisten the other side then

1486
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,220
 or is this to give a drink to the people on the other side?

1487
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,300
 - It's to moisten the other side.

1488
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,100
 So it's sort of, it's, but they then go and, you know,

1489
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,260
 spit the water out on the actual mound itself.

1490
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,140
 - That's incredible.

1491
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:58,980
 - Yeah.

1492
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,020
 - They never sleep as well.

1493
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,180
 Turmites don't sleep.

1494
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,020
 - Really?

1495
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:05,780
 - Yeah, they're just building 24 hours a day until they die.

1496
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,900
 - Do they rest?

1497
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,140
 Do they have like a nap?

1498
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:08,980
 Or not even-

1499
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,060
 - They must have downtime, yeah.

1500
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,460
 - Yeah, downtime, exactly.

1501
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,420
 - They might play the Xbox for a little while.

1502
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,980
 - In fact, I think I've read that they normally,

1503
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,420
 like Dan says, they're just all active,

1504
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,340
 but if they run out of holes to fill,

1505
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,780
 they just stand around touching each other's antennae.

1506
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,460
 So that might be their equivalent of downtime.

1507
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,380
 - Well, the Queen rests a lot, rests her entire life.

1508
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,980
 And then her life ends really tragically

1509
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,460
 because her children lick her to death.

1510
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:37,380
 She sort of, she dies in the same sort of tragic way

1511
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,320
 that she lives.

1512
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,660
 She stops being useful, stops laying eggs.

1513
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,020
 And so her kids like lick and lick and lick her,

1514
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,820
 drawing all the fat and fluids out of her.

1515
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,380
 And she just disintegrates away.

1516
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,420
 - God.

1517
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,260
 - Yeah.

1518
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,580
 - That's another sexy image for you, Loretta.

1519
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,820
 (laughing)

1520
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,980
 (upbeat music)

1521
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,940
 Okay, that's it.

1522
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,980
 That is all of our facts.
