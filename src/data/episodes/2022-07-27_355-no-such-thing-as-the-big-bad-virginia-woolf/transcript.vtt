00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.560
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.100
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish,"

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.260
 a weekly podcast coming from four

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.740
 undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.820
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.860
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.220
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.380
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.420
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.020
 Starting with my fact this week,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.660
 my fact is that while working as a publisher,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.800
 the poet T.S. Eliot liked to sit his visiting authors

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.040
 on a whoopee cushion before offering them

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.540
 an exploding cigar.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.880
 (laughing)

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.740
 - Wow, I mean, did he do this with everybody?

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.920
 - Yeah, I don't know if people were warned about it.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.940
 I think most people assumed it wouldn't happen.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.540
 He was a very serious guy according to the writings

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.040
 that he released, so the idea that you would enter

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.500
 the office of the great poet T.S. Eliot

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.180
 and have a cigar explode in your face

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.140
 while making a loud fart seems out of place, doesn't it?

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.620
 - Do you think maybe the very grave, serious persona

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.380
 he had throughout his life was all an act

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.500
 so that he could do this, jade, without people expecting it?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.340
 - That's a great idea.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.660
 - Could have been all building up to this.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.100
 - All the front, yeah.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.860
 It wasn't just his authors who came in

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.540
 who he would turn these sort of practical jokes on to.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.860
 He once broke up a board meeting as well

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.100
 by setting off a bucket full of firecrackers

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.860
 underneath the chairman's legs.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.220
 So he was all over the shop.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.340
 He was a nightmare to work with.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.180
 - Sounds like a maniac.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.460
 That sounds dangerous as a fourth of July prank.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 - Yeah, you'd be fired if you weren't quite senior

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.500
 in the company or you weren't about to become

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.700
 the greatest poet of the 20th century,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.620
 you would be fired for that.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.260
 - But wait a minute, wouldn't it be quite cool

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.220
 if you were about to be fired and they went,

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.540
 "You're fired," and you went, "No, you're fired, mate."

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.140
 And a lot of firecrackers went, "Oh, his ass."

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.980
 - That'd be amazing.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.340
 - "Dunning, maybe that's what happened."

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.180
 And it was such an event,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.460
 they completely forgot this accent.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.620
 - So T.S. Eliot, he, famous poet,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.380
 but also was actually a publisher himself.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.620
 So he worked for Faber and Faber.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.780
 In fact, he actually worked for,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.980
 before it was Faber and Faber,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.300
 he worked for it when it was Faber and Gwyer.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.140
 Do you know why he became--

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.900
 - Can I just say, very, very good publishers,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.340
 Faber and Faber.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.700
 They've got one book out this year,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.260
 I think it's called "Funner You Should Ask"

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.820
 by the QALs. - Oh, here we go.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.660
 - Here we go.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.860
 (laughing)

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.340
 - Viral marketing. - They are very, very good.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.620
 - Very crafty.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.820
 - Sorry, Dan, you were saying.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.300
 - But so, yeah, so he joined them in the 1920s,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.540
 and he became a director and an editor there.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.260
 - We're saying he was one of the great poets

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.900
 of the 20th century, which I guess he was, fine.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.540
 But he did, he did also write "Cats."

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.260
 I mean, he is credited.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.100
 - I believe that's what we're referring to

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.420
 when we say-- - Oh, I'm sorry, yeah.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.980
 (laughing)

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.900
 He is the lyricist, credited as the lyricist

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.740
 on the musical "Cats."

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.340
 Even though he died 20 years before it came out,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.140
 'cause he wrote this book,

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.940
 "Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats" in 1939,

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.700
 and it was for his godson, it was, you know, it wasn't.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.780
 - Yeah, that's unfair to say that he wrote "Cats."

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.980
 - I say he wrote "Cats" because, for example,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.260
 he won a Tony Award for "Cats" in 1983,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.900
 18 years after he died.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.500
 - And they wheeled him up, didn't they,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.420
 on stage for a very dark award ceremony?

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.020
 - And he went, "Surprise, I haven't been dead all this time."

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.540
 (laughing)

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.980
 - That huge stink bomb goes off at the back of the room, chaos.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.020
 - I think in his defense, he said about "Cats"

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.540
 in an interview, and he was asked about it,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.020
 that one wants to keep one's hand in.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.140
 So, you know, you just keep trying stuff out,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.260
 you just keep writing the practice of writing,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.620
 even if you're not really writing serious stuff.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.900
 But he did really enjoy writing about "Cats"

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.380
 'cause in this same interview, he basically said,

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.860
 "I've thought about writing about dogs,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.980
 "but they don't seem to lend themselves to verse

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.340
 "quite so well," which I can see that that's true.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.740
 - A dog on a log does rhyme.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.060
 But I think there's more rhyming words for "Cats"

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.940
 than there are for dogs.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.660
 Just, I mean, I'm not a poet,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.260
 as you might be able to tell, but I just--

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.620
 - No, I think that's really good.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.100
 He probably hadn't thought of the log thing.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.340
 - Frog, the cat-- - Frog is well actually frog.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.020
 - Yeah, but it's the cat in the hat, isn't it?

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.420
 Not the dog on the log.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.260
 - With a frog.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.060
 - Okay, he wasn't Dr. Seuss, go on.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.900
 (laughing)

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.900
 - Is that what poetry is?

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.700
 I've never read any of his stuff, I must say.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.180
 - Ezra Pound gave him his nickname,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.460
 which you mentioned a minute ago, which was Possum.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.980
 So it's called Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.900
 'cause that was Elliot's nickname.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.260
 And it's related to his serious personality.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.780
 So despite all the practical jokes,

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.420
 he was known for being incredibly stiff.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.500
 The nickname Possum came after the fact

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.140
 that Possums are known for faking their own deaths.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.260
 So the idea was that whenever he was at a social gathering,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
 it seemed like he was faking being dead.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.100
 That's how much life he contributed to the party.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.660
 - Oh, like playing Possum, yeah.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.740
 - Exactly.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.300
 - But so he liked the name Possum?

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.140
 Is that what you're saying?

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.780
 - He did like it, yeah, it was affectionate.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.140
 And Virginia Woolf said he was so buttoned up,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.420
 he wore a four-piece suit.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.780
 And so he liked the name Possum,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.460
 he kind of embraced this and it was based on--

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.620
 - That's the joke.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.900
 I understand that, I was just trying to work out.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.940
 'Cause I wanted to know if there was a bit of a three-piece suit

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.300
 I was missing all these years.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.980
 (laughing)

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.900
 - No, there's a bit of your sense of humor

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.260
 you've been missing all these years.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.140
 (laughing)

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.660
 - But that's interesting 'cause he did have a bit

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.500
 of a lack of a sense of humor about his names generally.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.460
 For example, T.S. Eliot.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.380
 Why is the S in there?

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.700
 Why not T. Eliot?

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.540
 Do you guys know?

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.740
 - Well, all I know really about T.S. Eliot

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.380
 before researching this is that his name

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.900
 is an anagram of toilets.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.740
 So is it-- - There you go.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.660
 - Is that it?

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.580
 - If you take the S out, it's toilet backwards

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.820
 and he did not want that to be the case, yeah.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.940
 - Kidding, that's why he put the S in.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.380
 - This is, a lot of people said it.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.020
 I haven't read him saying it himself,

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.780
 but Samuel Beckett has written about it,

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.900
 saying T. Eliot is toilet-spelled backwards.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.540
 Ordon mentioned it, that's what you would get.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.780
 I think it was the thing that everyone had noticed.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.380
 And so that's why the S was in there.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.660
 - Wow.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.780
 - So we know he didn't like dogs.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.860
 We know he likes cats.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.980
 Do you know what other animals he didn't like?

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.460
 - Spiders, I guess, is the obvious one.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.660
 - Farm yard animals.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.860
 As a group, he famously at,

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.020
 or rather, perhaps not as famous as it should be,

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.260
 while working at Faber,

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.900
 turned down George Orwell's Animal Farm.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.780
 He was submitted to them.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.940
 And he read it and he wrote him a nice long letter

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.260
 saying it's brilliant.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.620
 And I'm very upset that we're not gonna be publishing it

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.940
 because it means that whoever gets to publish it

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.820
 will probably get to publish your subsequent work.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.540
 But I just, I can't do it.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.060
 It doesn't fit with us.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.820
 - Because he doesn't like farm yard animals, does he?

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.420
 - I'll tell you another animal he didn't like, flies.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.700
 Because they also turned down Lord of the Flies,

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.420
 Faber and Faber.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.060
 - Is every subsequent fact in this show

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.220
 gonna have to be linked tangentially to an animal?

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.660
 - Was it because Lord of the Flies

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.820
 has a character called Piggy

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.460
 and you get pigs in farm yards?

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.180
 - Brilliant, that's exactly it.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.140
 Yes, they, well, they didn't specify that.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.620
 They turned it down with the notes,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.260
 rubbish and dull, pointless, reject.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.100
 - Wow.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.940
 - Ouch, yeah.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.340
 - God, it sounds like he was quite a bad publisher.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.100
 I wonder he had to write poems to make ends meet,

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.900
 turning down all these absolute stone cold hits.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.860
 - Unlike Faber of today, of course,

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.780
 who have another stone cold hit on their hands.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.340
 With funny, you should ask.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.300
 The new book by the QIL.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.140
 - Available now.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.980
 - Spawn.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.060
 - I didn't know how fun TS Eliot was.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.900
 I appreciate we've just said

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.300
 that he's not fun all the way through this,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.940
 but I didn't know he really liked Groucho Marx.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.580
 He idolized Groucho Marx.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.500
 They had dinner once together, TS Eliot and Groucho Marx,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.580
 but the dinner was a complete disaster

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.820
 because all Marx wanted to talk about was literature

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.140
 and all Eliot wanted to talk about

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.900
 was Marx Brothers films.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.740
 - Yeah.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.700
 - It's really interesting that if Groucho Marx

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.460
 was going to become friends with anyone,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.660
 you would think it wouldn't be someone

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.980
 who has the big exploding cigar trick up his sleeve.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:52.060
 - Maybe that was his ultimate prey for TS Eliot.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.100
 I will get him one day.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.500
 - Well, that actually makes so much sense.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.940
 Sorry, because Eliot once wrote Marx a letter.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.340
 So he'd written Groucho Marx a letter saying,

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.540
 "Can I have a photo of you?"

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.300
 And Marx had sent it and TS Eliot put this framed

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.580
 on his table, but then Eliot wrote another letter

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.700
 to Marx saying, "In the photo of you,

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.580
 "you're not smoking your cigar and it's a bit annoying

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.500
 "because all my visitors come, look at it and say,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.340
 "who's that?

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.580
 "No one recognizes you without the cigar.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.100
 "Can you do one with a cigar?"

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.580
 So maybe that was all part of a ploy

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.500
 to get that exploding cigar into his face.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.580
 - That is interesting.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.620
 - I think it's interesting that they were so close

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.340
 because Eliot was quite anti-Semitic, wasn't he?

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.180
 Do you know what I mean?

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.780
 We should mention that, I think.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.420
 A lot of his poems that before he became famous

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.900
 do have certain anti-Semitic tropes to them.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.100
 And that it was before Second World War.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.140
 And then obviously after the Second World War,

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.620
 people realized that, wait a minute,

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.540
 you can't really do this kind of thing.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.180
 But he never really properly backtracked on it, so.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.980
 - Yeah.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.540
 Well, actually it was quite tense.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.780
 I'm not sure they did like each other that much.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.660
 If you read the exchanges of letters,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.020
 they're full of barbs.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.220
 So there was one where when Marx sent Eliot this photo,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.340
 Eliot wrote back saying,

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.100
 "I've hung that right next to my photos of Yates

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.820
 "and Paul Valeri, you know, in the pride of place."

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.060
 And then Groucho wrote back to him saying,

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.380
 "That's so weird 'cause I've just read an essay about you

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.300
 "which named those other two pictures,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.980
 "but there was a conspicuous absence.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.140
 "I trust this was an oversight

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.860
 "on the part of the journalist."

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.220
 - What a weird thing to write to someone saying.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.700
 The article about you didn't mention a photo of me

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.260
 in your home, get a grip, mate.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.100
 - But then Eliot's excuse wasn't it?

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.500
 - He said, "Oh, well, your picture was a photo

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.820
 "and the other pictures were drawings or paintings.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.500
 "So maybe the writer had only noticed the paintings

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.340
 "and hadn't noticed photographs

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.820
 "and didn't want to talk about photographs."

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.140
 - Good excuse, very good excuse.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.140
 I mean, it's absolutely mad that in the old days

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.260
 you had to write to someone for a photo of them.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.300
 Can we just appreciate that as a really stupid system?

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.140
 Imagine.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.180
 - How do you get a photo of someone now again?

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.380
 Is it easy now?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.220
 - Yeah, Google it.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.700
 - Google image.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.740
 And then right click and you go print.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.140
 - Yeah, but when you've got a picture of Groucho Marx

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.940
 on your wall with all the other people you've met,

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.220
 you don't want one that you've taken off Google image,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.060
 do you?

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.660
 - With getty images over the top of it.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.900
 - Oh, my lad, do you?

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.500
 - You should come and see my gallery wall.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.300
 It's got a lot of lovely watermarks on it.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.780
 - So many celebrity friends.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.340
 It's Nicole Kidman's up there, Barack Obama.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.060
 - Shall we talk about his sex life?

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.620
 - Always up for that.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.460
 - T.S. Eliot.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.860
 - Okay, sure, yeah.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.900
 - It was very difficult, I think is the headline there.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.820
 He was very awkward around women.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.580
 He had a lot of relationships in his life.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.580
 And until the end, they were pretty much a disaster.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.980
 - Oh, I was ready for the juicy stuff, James.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.140
 I didn't think it was just, he had bad relationships.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.780
 - Okay, I was just gonna set it up

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.100
 for someone else to jump in there.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.940
 But fine.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:54.700
 - We've all got bad relationships, yeah.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.780
 - His most famous relationship was with Vivian.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.980
 And he told the wolves that he couldn't imagine

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.460
 shaving in her presence.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.980
 That's how awkward the relationship

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.860
 was between those two people.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.020
 - This is Virginia Woolf's family,

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.940
 we should say not actual wolves.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:11.660
 - It was confusing.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.060
 - Sorry, I just, yeah.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.500
 - He didn't like dogs, but he loved wolves.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.980
 - I thought I pronounced the word wolf

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.740
 with the obvious double O.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.540
 It was so obvious that there was a double O in there, guys.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.540
 - I heard the F of wolves.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.420
 - And that's what I was, but I think wolves, wolves.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.500
 It's probably, Virginia Woolf always said,

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.940
 "I'm Virginia Woolf."

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:38.900
 - So what did the wolves say about him?

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.700
 - They said, "Oh, that's interesting."

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:49.020
 - Well, he was part of that Bloomsbury group, wasn't he?

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.460
 With the wolves, Virginia Woolf.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.500
 And Bertrand Russell as well,

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.700
 with whom his wife had an affair.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.980
 - Wait, so what did Virginia Woolf say?

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.460
 What were you saying about what did the wolves say?

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.020
 We need to know what the wolves at the door said.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.060
 - He said it to the wolves.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.100
 He said, "I can't imagine shaving in my wife's presence."

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.260
 And then the wolf said,

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.900
 "You really need to make this house out of bricks."

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:16.180
 - He said he couldn't imagine shaving in his wife's presence.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.580
 - Yeah, because he was so awkward.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.380
 They got married really, really quickly,

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.020
 but then it was really obvious very, very quickly

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.300
 that they weren't compatible one little bit.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.100
 They slept in different rooms as well.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:27.940
 That's another...

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.660
 - Well, they tried to sleep in the same room

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.900
 on their honeymoon, as is traditional.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.180
 And it sounds awkward, as is the theme.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.780
 So they went on honeymoon in Eastbourne

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.860
 and she was on her period

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.860
 and had an embarrassing accident

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.380
 when they were trying to have their honeymoon moment.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.620
 And they were both so incredibly embarrassed

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.380
 that he went and slept out on a deck chair

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.420
 outside the hotel for the rest of the week.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.580
 And she trashed the hotel room

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.140
 'cause she was in such a frenzy of embarrassment.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.340
 And then she took the sheets away with her

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.340
 'cause she didn't want the hotel staff to see them.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.180
 But then of course, they just called their home

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.020
 when they got back and said,

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.740
 "You've stolen all of our bedding."

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.900
 Which sort of is more embarrassing, I think.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.100
 - Oh dear.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.220
 - But they did also, I think, at that point of the honeymoon.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.020
 The honeymoon was meant to be the debut sex fest

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.580
 because they hadn't had sex as far as I could tell.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.220
 It seems that they got married really quickly

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.500
 because I think he told Ezra Pound

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.180
 he said, "I want to have sex."

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.740
 And then three months later, he was married to her.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.220
 So he obviously--

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.060
 - The debut sex fest.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.900
 - The debut sex fest.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.860
 (laughing)

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.660
 - Yeah, they should rebrand honeymoon.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.700
 (laughing)

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.620
 - Where are you going on your debut sex fest?

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.180
 - Oh, we're off to stay with the wolves.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.340
 (laughing)

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.060
 - Ashley Virginia Woolf said,

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.020
 "Living with Vivian, who was quite mad,

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.900
 "living with Vivian was like having a bag of ferrets

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.820
 "hung around your neck."

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.300
 - She was very troubled, wasn't she?

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.060
 And you know, I think she was,

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.260
 was she sectioned at one point when he was away

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.140
 and she spent the rest of her life in a hospital?

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.940
 - Yeah, so he went away to America, didn't he?

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.500
 And then his solicitors sent her a letter saying,

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.860
 "I want a separation," rather than him saying it.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.380
 And then when he went back to London,

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.140
 she kind of stalked him and would go to his office

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.020
 and he would always sneak out of the back door

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.780
 so that she wouldn't see him.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.300
 And then she would walk around London with a knife.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.420
 It was like a rubber knife, so it was like a joke.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.620
 She was like, "I'm trying to find my husband

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.980
 "with this rubber knife."

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.300
 - Wait, did she get it from the same shop

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.900
 as the Exploded Cigars and the Wolf Division?

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.820
 - Smithy's absolutely clinked up on the Elias, didn't they?

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.100
 (laughing)

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.060
 - And then she joined the British Union of Fascists

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.620
 in the late 30s, yeah. - Oh, yes, that's right.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.140
 - And she liked to wear the uniform in public.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.580
 - Yeah, 'cause when you hear about the early days

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.300
 of her life, particularly the university years,

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.900
 everyone sort of talked about her as being very flamboyant.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.860
 She was a great dancer, she'd always speak her mind.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.620
 She smoked in public, which you wouldn't usually see

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.060
 women doing, she dressed like an actress.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.260
 Aldous Huxley said that he really liked hanging out with her

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.980
 because she was vulgar, she was just so different,

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.420
 she would say what she thought.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.540
 And then you get to this fascist period

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.900
 where suddenly it seems like a totally different character.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.580
 In fact, the last time she ever saw Elliot

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.660
 was at one of his book talks

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.540
 where she went into the audience.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.300
 She brought three books with her and she brought her dog

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.260
 and he signed her books for her

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.740
 and then went off with someone else.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.580
 It's the weirdest thing,

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.300
 it's the last time they ever saw each other.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.380
 - Wow, wow. - Yeah.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.700
 - But still, you know, she got her book signed.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.180
 - She got what she wanted, she got her book signed.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.780
 - But she not, I've just found his signature

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.100
 on the internet, printed it off

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.900
 and then stuck it in her book.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.900
 - All right, so you've seen my autograph book too, fine.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.940
 - She did, she tried various ways to get him back.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.300
 So one of them seemed to be bringing this dog

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.140
 to his book chat, which is a bad idea.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.100
 Another one was putting an advert out in the times, the 1930s.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.020
 So she thought there was a sort of a conspiracy

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.940
 to keep him apart by other people.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.540
 And so she put an ad in the time saying,

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.460
 "Will T.S. Elliot please return to his home

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.460
 "68 Clarence Gate Gardens, which he abandoned

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.940
 "on the September the 17th, 1932."

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.140
 - Wow.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.540
 - Yeah.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.420
 - Do you know, Elliot himself was really secretive

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.340
 about his correspondence.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.540
 In fact, the whole estate has been very secretive

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.420
 since he died, pretty much.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.380
 'Cause his widow was called Valerie,

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.460
 he married again much later.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.380
 So Peter Eckroyd was trying to write a biography of him

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.740
 and he was forbidden to quote from any correspondence

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.140
 or unpublished work.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.260
 And he was hardly allowed to quote

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.100
 even actual published poems of T.S. Elliot's

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.740
 in this biography of the man.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.340
 Elliot destroyed so much correspondence

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.340
 that between 1905 and 1910,

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.820
 there was just one postcard left by him.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.860
 That's it, that's all there is for those five years.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.060
 - What does it say?

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.540
 Just, dear mom, really sunny here, hope you're well.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.700
 Having a lovely debut sex fest in Yves Bourne.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.280
 (upbeat music)

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:58.620
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.100
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 2001,

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.180
 an artist got lost in Los Angeles

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.260
 and decided to make his own sign

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.260
 to stop other people from getting lost in future.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.500
 Not only did it remain unnoticed for more than a year,

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.300
 but when the city was tipped off,

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.340
 they found that it met all signage rules

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.580
 and they kept it in place for eight years.

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.940
 - It's so charming.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.900
 What was the sign saying?

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.540
 - It said five.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.220
 - And the word north as well. - Five more.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.100
 So this was a sign to get off a highway

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.620
 and get onto another highway.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.100
 And basically the signpost to tell you where to go

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.140
 was really close to the ramp.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.380
 And really there should have been one a lot further back.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.740
 So whenever anyone drove down the 110

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.620
 and wanted to get onto the five,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.340
 they would only realize at the last second

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.260
 that they needed to be in a certain lane

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.860
 and they would kind of swerve in front of the cars.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.660
 And he was like, well, it's just really dangerous.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.340
 So I'm going to put a five,

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.820
 maybe a mile further back or a half mile further back.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.340
 And he put it there and he did it in broad daylight.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.780
 He just one day he just got a load of ladders

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.180
 and just went up there and did it.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.220
 And it was there and no one noticed.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.020
 And I think he tipped them off in the end.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.220
 This artist named Richard Angrom.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.820
 He tipped off the city in the end and they just kept it there.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.740
 And then they decided we're making some new signs now

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.300
 and we're going to have to take this down.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.300
 But actually they put a new five where his five was.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.900
 So they took his down and they put a new one up there.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.700
 So they kind of tacitly admitted that he was right

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.780
 that it should have been there.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.460
 - He planned it for ages as well.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.900
 Like he didn't just go in broad daylight

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.100
 just dressed as he was.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.380
 He absolutely planned the whole thing.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.580
 So he had his haircut.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.580
 Not sure why, but he had his haircut.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.940
 He bought some work clothes.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.020
 He had a hard hat.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.140
 He got an orange vest.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.100
 He even made--

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:46.940
 - The haircut must have been

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.500
 to fit inside the hard hat, maybe.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:49.340
 - Possibly.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.740
 - He had a mohican before that, didn't he?

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.500
 - And he had his truck.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.860
 He did a thing where, as well as making the signage

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.420
 for the actual sign itself,

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.460
 he made signage for the side of his truck

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.420
 to match the Caltrans, which is California Transports.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.540
 The logos and so on to make it look like he was part of them.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.140
 So he was properly planned.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.380
 - And he's an artist, isn't he?

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.940
 - And you can tell because he clearly doesn't have a 95 job.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.020
 - He called his piece "Guerrilla Public Service."

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.940
 And I should just say that I got this fact from a book

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.020
 called "The 99% Invisible City,

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.340
 a Field Guide to the Hidden World of Everyday Design"

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.620
 by Roman Mars.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.900
 And it's a really awesome book

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.180
 based on the 99% Invisible Podcast.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.180
 And it's full of loads of awesome stuff about the streets.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.620
 And if you read it, then you walk down the street

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.740
 and you go, "Oh, you know why that's there?

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.580
 You know why that's there?

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.420
 You know why that's there?"

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.420
 It's a really cool book.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.260
 - Oh, great.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.100
 He's amazing, Roman Mars.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.500
 - Yeah, we did, 99% Invisible

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.460
 did not need any extra advertising from us.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.700
 Yay, cool stuff.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.300
 - Not compared with the new book.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.460
 Funny you should ask.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.460
 It's so cool how people keep doing this around the place.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.460
 And it's kind of all these micro banksies,

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.820
 but with particular bug bears.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.860
 So there is a thing currently going on in Sheffield

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.900
 where people are changing noughts on street signs into queues.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.620
 And no one really knows why they're doing this.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.460
 - Oh, yeah.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.820
 So there is a theory that it's to do with queue and non.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.620
 I was wondering if it might do that.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.180
 - Which is the insane conspiracy that the USA has run

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.540
 by Satan worshiping child sacrificing pedophiles.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.020
 But I don't know why in Sheffield,

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.620
 people will be changing the street signs.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.340
 This will get the word out.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.380
 So maybe nothing to do with that.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.540
 - One of the road based public service that people perform,

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.500
 which I think is very cool is in the Czech Republic,

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.100
 where a group of Czech nerds basically just saved

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.300
 the government $18 million.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.140
 - What?

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.460
 - And they did this because there's this guy called

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.620
 Tomas Von Dracheck, and he is a businessman.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.780
 He runs some tech businesses.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.060
 And he found out that the country was about to pay $18 million

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.460
 to switch their road toll system to a digital system.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.660
 And as someone who knows about coding and programming

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.100
 and stuff, he was really pissed off.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.660
 He put a post on LinkedIn saying,

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.020
 "This is classic bureaucracy gone mad.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.220
 "This task is simple enough for a group of programmers

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.780
 "to do over a weekend."

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.340
 And he just put that on LinkedIn.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.260
 And the prime minister got in touch and was like,

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.660
 "Well, is that true?

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.140
 "And would you mind doing it?"

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.420
 And so he was like, "All right, I'll ask some friends."

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.060
 And he signed up 150 of his programmer friends.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.580
 And over 48 hours, they got together

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.340
 and redesigned the whole Czech road system.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.940
 And they got like meals brought to them

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.620
 by members of the public and saved the country.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.100
 - That's awesome.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.020
 Speaking of European road stuff and road signs,

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.180
 the big story of this year, as we all know,

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.700
 was the town of fucking,

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.140
 which is in, where is the town of?

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.860
 - Austria? - In Austria, yeah.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.700
 And they are sick and tired of all the fucking tourists

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.780
 coming over and stealing their road signs, right?

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.260
 They really... - They're fucking road signs.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.500
 - They're fucking road signs.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.220
 So they decided that they were gonna change their name

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.380
 to "fugging" and they wrote it on it.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.740
 And this has happened and the town of fucking

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.940
 is now called the town of "fugging."

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.460
 But it hasn't stopped the vandalism

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.780
 because there's been a whole load of more vandalism

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.140
 of people changing the signs back to "fugging."

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.260
 (laughing)

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.580
 - "Fugging" is objectively a funny-sounding word as well.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.980
 And it's quite close to the original.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.140
 They should have changed it to "gent" or something.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.260
 - They can't change it to "gent."

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.140
 There's already a "gent." - Well, that'd be confusing.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.100
 - Yeah, something nice sounding like "gent."

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.100
 Vienna, yeah, exactly Vienna, thank you.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:29.700
 - In 2017, in China, in the province of Jiangzhou,

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.900
 a man was arrested for repainting road signs

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.100
 in order to make his commute easier.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.780
 He was really annoyed being stuck in traffic

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.060
 in a lane on the motorway and he was caught

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.100
 on CCTV painting big white paint arrows

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.220
 to redirect all the cars in his lane

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.580
 into the lane next to it to stop the traffic.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.780
 - That is brilliant.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.020
 (laughing)

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.540
 But as if he would get out, paint it, get back in

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.220
 and then all the cars would go, "Whoa!"

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.660
 (laughing)

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.740
 - I couldn't work out for a long...

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.700
 When you started saying this,

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.340
 I couldn't work out how you would choose road signs

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.540
 to make your commute easier

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.660
 'cause I thought he was putting out directions for himself

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.420
 like this way, Derek, or whatever.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.260
 (laughing)

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.100
 Which I would love to do.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.060
 - Do you know that's a thing that exists in Los Angeles?

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.460
 This is another thing I read in that book.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.300
 - What's that?

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.420
 - So if you live in Los Angeles, you would know about this

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.300
 but I'd never heard of it before.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.620
 There are these road signs, rectangular yellow road signs

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.980
 that just turn up every now and then.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.300
 And they tend to be a black arrow with some letters above it

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.980
 and some letters below and the letters below

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:31.340
 are kind of the inverse mirror image of the ones above.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:35.460
 And what these are is their directions to movie sets

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.220
 or to TV show filming locations.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.300
 And when you're in LA and you're filming

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.260
 in some kind of parking lot somewhere,

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.380
 you'll put these signs up.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.180
 So all the techies will know where to go,

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.260
 all the actors will know where to go, stuff like this.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.940
 And obviously the people in LA know what this is

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.660
 but if you're a tourist and you're kind of looking

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.420
 for celebrities and stuff, you just wouldn't know.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.780
 You just see this sign and you think,

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.420
 "Well, it's just nonsense."

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.260
 - Also it doesn't say Batman or whatever.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.340
 - No, but what they do is they tend to put words

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.860
 that the people in the know would know what it is.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.220
 But the people who don't know what it is

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.660
 wouldn't know what it was.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.780
 For instance, it would say, "Magnus Rex this way,

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.100
 Magnus Rex this way."

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.300
 And that was the Batman reboot, the Dark Knight Rises.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.260
 So if you saw those signs, you would know

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.980
 to go to the Dark Knight Rises.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.220
 There were signs for Rasputin.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.580
 So you would think, "Oh, they're just doing some low budget

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.060
 Russian movie but actually it was for Iron Man 2."

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.380
 But that's got a Russian baddie in it.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.220
 - Does it?

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.060
 - Yeah.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.900
 - Does it?

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.220
 - So that's a very tricky clue.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.620
 - Iron Curtain Man.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.940
 - Brilliant, isn't he?

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.500
 - Yeah, I think that's what they actually tried calling it.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.660
 - Well, in ancient Rome,

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.500
 they used to have names on road signs, didn't they?

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.260
 I think I read this, that yeah, you used to have,

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.460
 if you had a road sign, whoever built the road

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.660
 would have their name on it.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.780
 So you could admire the work of this particular person

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.580
 and then it would have the name as well of the person

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.500
 who last repaired it.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.740
 So it's sort of update on who to thank

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.260
 for the smoothness of the road.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.380
 - It's like these toilets were last checked by signs

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.580
 that you get in publics.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.940
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.860
 - So this is kind of about street art

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.140
 and artists mucking around with things.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.180
 So I just thought I'd try and find out a little bit

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.220
 about Banksy and I'm here to tell you who he is.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:15.060
 No, I don't know that.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.420
 But there was a large theory that did the rounds

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.740
 that it's Neil Buchanan from Art Attack.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.540
 If you remember that from your childhood.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.380
 - I do.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.420
 - He's very used to large outdoor multimedia installations.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.020
 There's lots of good circumstantial evidence.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.260
 It got so bad this year that he had to put

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.700
 at the top of his website an announcement saying,

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.660
 "Neil Buchanan is not Banksy.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.500
 We have been inundated with inquiries over the weekend.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.420
 This website does not have the infrastructure

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.620
 to answer all these inquiries individually.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.780
 We can confirm there is no truth in the rumor whatsoever."

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.420
 - Exactly what Banksy would say.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.020
 (all laughing)

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.260
 It's Neil.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.620
 So the Museum of Modern Art in New York

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.900
 has had a few of these over the years.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.580
 There was a guy called Harvey Stromberg

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:04.300
 who in 1971 decided he wanted an exhibition in MoMA.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.020
 But obviously they wouldn't let him

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.020
 'cause he wasn't very famous.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.340
 So what he did was he went in every day

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.980
 and he would take photos of a light socket

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.340
 or of a tile on the floor or of a brick on the wall.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.260
 He would go home.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.140
 He would print it out on his printer

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.020
 and then he would go in and stick it over

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.420
 to the exact place where he'd taken the photo from.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.020
 Like a lot of them, they never found them

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.540
 for years and years and years.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.700
 Whenever you put one on the floor,

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.860
 they would find it on the same day

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.180
 because they had those kind of buffing machines

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.260
 that would go around and clean the floor

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.340
 and they would find them.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.740
 But there were some that were just over a brick on the wall

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.620
 which they didn't find for decades.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.260
 - I'm gonna start doing that in my house

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.980
 to broken bits of wallpaper and, you know,

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.060
 rusting bath handles.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.060
 Just take a photo of a nice bit of wallpaper,

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.900
 stick it over.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.940
 Have you guys been about the Grammar Vigilantes?

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.780
 - No.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:58.100
 - So these are people who go around correcting sign posts.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.180
 They seem to happen in various countries.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.020
 In Bristol, Bristol has the UK's leading grammar vigilante

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.340
 and he specialises in apostrophes.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:11.140
 He began in 2003 when he saw a council sign

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.820
 which said open Mondays to Fridays

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.660
 but with apostrophes in both of those words

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.580
 which obviously is a painful experience.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.940
 And so he invented something called the apostrophizer

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.020
 which is an eight foot long tool

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.020
 which basically has an apostrophe stamp on the end

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.140
 so that he can reach the really high signs

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.900
 and insert the apostrophe.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.060
 And he doesn't like to do damage

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.020
 so he built his own specially made step ladder

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.300
 so it didn't have to be lent up against shops.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.540
 - How much damage is he doing with a normal step ladder?

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.980
 You're using the step ladder wrong

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.140
 if every time you're taken away from the building

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.460
 bricks fall out of it.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.780
 - Yeah, he's not a step ladder pro.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.020
 - I've got a couple of things just on signs,

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.860
 general signs.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.940
 So firstly, I found it quite amazing

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.180
 that signs played quite an important role

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.100
 during World War II in the UK

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.220
 in that there was a message that went around

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.340
 to a lot of people to remove the signs

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.580
 so that if any Germans were coming over

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.980
 they'd be confused and have no idea where to go.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.940
 So people encouraged us to take them down

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:13.020
 and people would arrive, not know where they're going

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.140
 but on the flip side there was also a movement by Hitler

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.220
 to change signs around so you would send people to the rock.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.500
 Apparently that's a thing that was attempted.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.220
 I don't know how successful it was.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.820
 So it must have just been very confusing driving around

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.660
 in World War II.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.620
 - It sounds like your sauce for this is dad's army.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.460
 - Yeah.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.700
 - That's amazing.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.220
 - If you are a Hitler and you've got spies on the ground

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.220
 during the Second World War,

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.340
 I would definitely want to know about troop movements

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.620
 and the state of the country's defense

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.860
 is more than misdirecting people to their local church

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.580
 or whatever the signs are for.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.020
 - Getting a commuter lost on his way home for tea.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.140
 Well, this is why they lost the war, Andy.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.980
 It was definitely a sign of resistance in Norway

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.420
 when the fascists took over Norway.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.620
 A very subtle sign of resistance was apparently

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.100
 you often gave Nazis incorrect directions

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.500
 when they asked the way for somewhere.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.980
 That was a signal that you were on the good guy's side.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.060
 - And they can't find their way back to you

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:08.860
 'cause they're lost.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.900
 So that's actually pretty effective, yeah.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.180
 - Have you ever given someone wrong directions

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.420
 in London, for instance, like a tourist

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.660
 and then realized afterwards that you've done it,

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.060
 you didn't do it on purpose.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.460
 And then you realize, you think,

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.980
 "Oh, fuck, I've just sent them to the wrong place."

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.700
 That is one of the worst feelings in the world, isn't it?

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.900
 - It's bad.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.940
 But if you suspect that they're a foreign spy,

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.300
 then it's actually nothing to do with it, yeah.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.460
 - They were a leftover Nazi still plugging away

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.820
 80 years later.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.660
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.220
 and that is Andy.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:51.140
 - My fact is that King Edward III owned a Yeti mask.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:55.620
 So, riddle me that.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.100
 Okay, so, I've said Yeti mask.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.260
 There is a creature in English mythology,

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.180
 which I think is kind of close,

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.580
 sort of analogous to the Yeti.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.380
 Basically, these were things called woodwoses,

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.700
 and they were wild men who lived in the woods.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.300
 They were big, they were not civilized,

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.980
 they were covered in hair.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.900
 They weren't really human from all the depictions of them.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.500
 They crop up a lot in medieval manuscripts

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.340
 and things like that.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.700
 Normally, kind of trying to carry women off,

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.500
 and then a knight has to turn up and save the day

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.980
 and kill the woodwose.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.180
 And in Edward III's accounts,

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.340
 they have these wardrobe accounts

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.580
 which list everything that the king bought.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.700
 From 1348 AD, there is Capita de Woodwose,

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.300
 which is the head of a woodwose.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.260
 In fact, before it, there is XIV,

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.700
 which is 14 of Roman numerals.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.980
 I don't think that means he bought 14 of them.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.700
 I really hope it was.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.060
 - Could be, yeah. - It was that.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.660
 Yeah, so this is a woodwose.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.980
 - He really liked, he's from the 14th century,

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.340
 Edward III, right?

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.700
 He really enjoyed doing like tournaments

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.660
 and jousts and stuff like that.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.420
 And according to one paper I read,

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.660
 so this is by a guy called A. Chester Beattie,

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.380
 who was like an American billionaire who became a historian.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.820
 He reckons that Edward might have used the mask

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.860
 for one of his Christmas tournaments

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.340
 so that maybe people would be jousting

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.340
 with a woodwose head on.

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.740
 So it might have been like, you know, like the masked singer,

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.460
 where people are kind of jousting,

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.820
 but they're in masks and stuff,

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.380
 because there was also a Capita elefantum,

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.300
 a Capita virginum, a Capita leonum,

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.620
 and a Capita signorum.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.260
 So in his wardrobe, he had an elephant head,

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.740
 a virgin's head, a lion's head, and a swan's head.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.300
 - A virgin's head. - A virgin's head.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.860
 - The virgin's chances in this fight

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.380
 between several wild animals.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.060
 (laughing)

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.860
 How can you tell a virgin's head?

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.700
 I mean, the hymen's not on the head.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.940
 What's gonna give it away?

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.620
 Just on Edward's royal wardrobe,

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.780
 he did have pretty lavish taste,

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.500
 so this might be the same year as the woodwose costume,

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.940
 but in 1337 to 38,

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.100
 the clerk of his wardrobe ordered these huge amounts

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.900
 of like cloth and yarn and full bull's hides

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.340
 and loads of gold leaf,

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:05.340
 and also 86 plain masks and 12 masks with long beards.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.740
 And this was preparation for the King's Games,

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:08.900
 which they had every year.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:09.740
 And along with that,

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.300
 they built an entire fake forest,

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.100
 so out of timber and paint and everything,

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.380
 a massive fake forest,

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.380
 and then they made loads of linen baboons,

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.980
 and they sort of dropped all these linen baboons

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:22.900
 into the forest,

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.100
 and they sewed the baboons into tunics

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.180
 with sort of pearls and hoes and gloves

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.620
 and caps on them and everything.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.180
 So they were wearing the proper gear

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.660
 'cause they're in the royal household.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.980
 And then I guess they galloped through the fake forest

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.540
 and hunted down linen baboons.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.700
 - Oh my God, that sounds amazing.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.580
 A lot of this was because,

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.180
 so Edward was married to Philippa of Hainult, right?

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.460
 And they were very young when they got married.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.220
 And so there was a regency period

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.980
 where Isabella was looking after the country,

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.260
 who was Edward's mother, right?

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.100
 Isabella.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.540
 So Isabella kept Philippa and Edward in real punery,

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.100
 like she wouldn't give them much money to do anything.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.580
 They kind of had to live their life almost,

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.780
 not as normal people, but as normal rich people.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.820
 But then when they became king and queen proper,

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.580
 they just really went for it.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.940
 And Philippa of Hainult just spent so much money

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:18.300
 on all these incredibly lavish clothes and jewels.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.420
 And by 1360, they owed about 16,000 pounds

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.820
 to various different clothing embroiderers

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.380
 and tailors and furriers.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.940
 And that's a couple of million pounds in today's terms

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.100
 that they owed to these people.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.540
 And I was reading about like one robe that she had,

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.340
 which required 952 ventures.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.860
 And I didn't know what a ventra was.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.460
 Apparently it's the fur that you get

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.460
 from the belly of a red squirrel.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:48.460
 So they had to get 952 squirrels for this one robe.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.580
 It's like, whoa.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.580
 - Is the whole blaming the gray squirrels thing?

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.780
 Were they a scapegoat that these guys created

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.180
 'cause they actually caused red squirrels

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.740
 to go almost extinct?

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.100
 - Maybe, yeah.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.700
 - He really went bust later on.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.740
 Edward III had to pawn off the crown jewels

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.540
 so that he could raise money.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.980
 He didn't have a, yeah.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.820
 But he pawned off the great crown of England

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.420
 to Simon de Mirabello.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:13.620
 - Wow.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.660
 - Just one thing that he did own,

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.260
 which is quite similar to something that Dan owns,

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:23.260
 is he had a Yeti mug in as much as he had a silver cup

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.740
 that was decorated with Wodewozes.

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.020
 So if we're saying that there was a Yeti's,

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.700
 then he had a Yeti mug.

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.700
 - I think Dan will,

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.620
 Dan, you've been keeping a very polite diplomatic silence

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.780
 about whether they're Yetis or not.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.300
 I'm pretty sure Dan thinks they're not Yetis.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.940
 - They absolutely aren't Yetis, yeah.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.620
 - It's a completely different species.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.620
 - Completely different species.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:50.620
 Before we get into me absolutely ripping Andy over that,

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.020
 just sticking on Edward III for a second,

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.460
 he's an interesting character that I hadn't heard of him

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:56.460
 as a king, have to say.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.620
 Again, I'm not British,

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.340
 so he's very far back.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.420
 - But you've heard of, you know,

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.060
 Edward's the fifth and sixth,

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.060
 presumably you knew that a third must have happened before.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.980
 - Yeah, I've got all the other in the trilogy of Edwards,

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.220
 but I've not seen that one, unfortunately.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.140
 - No, it went downhill actually.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.380
 - Yeah, so it's interesting in that all of us

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.900
 are probably related to him.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.540
 He's one of those guys where they've done a few reports

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.460
 where they say there's a 99% chance

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.820
 that if you are of British origin,

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.140
 if you were born and your family was through this period,

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.980
 you are directly related to him.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.460
 So all of us are his great, great, great, great grandchildren,

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.420
 but also he created something that still goes on today,

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.140
 which is also connected to clothing,

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.500
 which is the chivalry Knights of the Garter.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.700
 And the garter itself is literally a garter

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.860
 which you would wear.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.740
 There's a story that he was at some dance

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.620
 and he was dancing with the Countess of Salisbury

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.980
 and the garter, and this is one of the stories,

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.940
 there's many stories, but the story is is that

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.860
 the garter slipped down her leg

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.420
 and everyone started laughing, but he got very furious

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.580
 and he yelled, "Shame on him who thinks ill of it,"

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.060
 about the situation.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:07.180
 And that is the motto of the Knights of the Garter,

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.820
 "Shame on him who thinks ill of it."

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.140
 And that is a garter that became the code for these knights,

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.140
 which is a thing still going on today.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.380
 In fact, there's over a thousand Knights of the Garter now,

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.780
 the thousandth of which was Prince William,

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.260
 which is a very convenient number to land on, yeah.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.540
 - Yeah, who had to fill in those last 20?

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.660
 Was it just 20 folks wandering past?

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.500
 - Do you think that they rushed through a load

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.460
 to get to a thousand, or do you think a load of people

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.580
 weren't allowed to become for like 30 years,

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.620
 they weren't allowed to do it?

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.380
 - Yeah, interestingly, it's the two princes,

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.700
 it's Andrew and Edward,

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.340
 and then it's meant to be William next,

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.900
 but they just slipped in an MP in between,

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.380
 so there's one guy just taking up 999.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.220
 - Genuinely at 999.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:50.020
 - Anyway, Woodwosers, Andy, you fucking idiot.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.580
 (all laughing)

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.420
 They are Yetis, then, they're the British Yeti.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.580
 - Wow. - And this is, okay,

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.740
 this is the real thing.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:01.220
 I think they may have a kind of relationship

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.780
 with the real history in that,

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.300
 obviously they're mythical, these Wordwosers,

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.500
 they're not, they don't exist,

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.500
 but after the Norman conquest,

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.140
 you did for many years,

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.980
 you got gangs of wild men living savage in the woods,

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.500
 the swamps, they were social outcasts,

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.820
 they were criminalized,

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:20.700
 so that is a possible origin point for this story,

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.580
 sort of wild man living in the woods.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:23.980
 There are lots of medieval churches

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.020
 which have Woodwosers in their stones,

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.420
 and so there's this weird kind of relationship

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:32.220
 between local myth and newer Christian traditions,

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.060
 that kind of thing.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.500
 - Well, even great scientific minds, actually,

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.300
 for a while thought that these were real,

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.980
 and they didn't think it was a separate species,

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.660
 they thought it was someone, as you say, went wild,

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.580
 became wild, had children that were wild,

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.220
 and they grew up as a sort of subspecies

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.180
 that knew nothing but the wild.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:52.540
 In fact, the person who gave us the name Homo sapiens,

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.140
 he had Linnaeus, that was Linnaeus who did that,

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.980
 and one of the categories was Homo ferris,

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.780
 which was these wild people, and he was convinced,

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.980
 and that's been dropped since,

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.300
 we don't talk about his Homo ferris group,

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.060
 there's a few, but he believed that there were wolf boys,

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.100
 or feral children, that were abandoned by lost parents,

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.220
 and subsequently raised by wolves,

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.460
 that's the actual wolves, not Virginia wolf's family,

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:20.460
 and there's lots of legends like Romulus in Rome and Remus

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.740
 who were suckled by a she-wolf.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.380
 - And there was a belief that they sort of naturally grew hair,

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.020
 I think, in the forest to protect themselves,

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.820
 'cause they were living the elements, wasn't there?

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.820
 - That's right, I quite like that Romulus and Remus

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.820
 were suckled by a she-wolf, because Edward III,

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.260
 who wore a woad-woose, was suckled by a she-wolf as well.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.420
 - No, he wasn't.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.300
 - Was he? - Yeah, that's what his mother

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.900
 was known as, the she-wolf.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.420
 - Oh, very fair, yeah, don't ever switch a roux.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.180
 - These tenuous links to animal themes.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.100
 - Aw, that was a great one, Dan,

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.220
 don't let the bump around that.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.260
 - TS Eliot would have rejected that for publication.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.900
 - Come on.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.620
 - You know, woad-wooses and wild men and stuff like that

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.900
 are in one very famous historical poem,

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.740
 seeing as we're talking about TS Eliot,

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.540
 and that is the 14th century romance poem,

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.180
 "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,"

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.780
 and according to that poem,

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.420
 the woad-wooses in the UK,

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.580
 they live on the Wirral Peninsula,

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.340
 which is just outside Liverpool.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.220
 According to this poem,

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.620
 "In the wilderness of Wirral,

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.180
 dwelt there but few,

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.740
 that God or man with good heart loved."

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.780
 And it is basically, this was such a wild west,

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.300
 wooded, crazy area,

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.660
 that this is where you would get these wild men living.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.820
 - It's a little known fact that if the Beatles

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.220
 didn't shave meticulously every day,

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.460
 it would be covered in air from head to toe.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.660
 The other stuff that Gawain fights

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.020
 in "Gawain and the Green Knight" is quite odd.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.420
 So the Green Knight himself is a kind of woad-woaser

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.580
 in the, like Tolkien does a translation

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.540
 where he translates the Green Knight as being a woad-woaser,

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.980
 and they were often green men as well,

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.420
 were another mythical wild man.

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.420
 But Gawain also fights in that chivalric myth,

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.060
 Wormers, which are dragons.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.540
 Dragons were called worms.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.380
 - Really?

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:09.900
 - I think that's a huge promotion.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.540
 We've given dragons that they were worms.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.900
 People, worms, wolves and word-woats.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.220
 And the reason I'm saying it weirdly

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.260
 is because every time it's spelled, it's spelled differently.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.220
 So you can say word-a-woaz-a-ward-a-ward-a-woaz-a,

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.060
 any way you like.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:21.900
 - It is when, isn't it?

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.020
 And one of the spelling is water house,

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.740
 which is where PG Woodhouse gets his name.

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.860
 - So cool. - That is amazing, isn't it?

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.900
 - PG Woodhouse has descended from Yeti's.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.180
 - Dan, do you agree with that?

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.900
 - I do, but for different theories.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.900
 (laughing)

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.340
 - You guys know, you do remember John Falstoff?

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.260
 We've mentioned him before, friend of the podcast.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.540
 He was maybe the inspiration for Falstoff.

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.860
 - He was, and he was there at the Battle of Agincourt

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.300
 and stuff, and he was there when Joan of Arc came

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.100
 into Paris and all that kind of stuff.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.020
 - Yeah, he had a big old tapestry

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.020
 with word-woaz in his hall.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.860
 Yeah, so they were big.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.780
 - Well, you also said they appear quite a lot

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.600
 in architecture and cathedrals and stuff.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.780
 One example of where word-woaz, or in fact, green men,

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.940
 the sort of descendant of word-woaz appears,

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.380
 is Norwich Cathedral.

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.340
 And that is 'cause they were very common in roof bosses,

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.780
 which we know a lot about, 'cause they featured heavily

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.580
 in our last year's book of the year 2019.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.480
 And that's why, if you remember, in Norwich Cathedral,

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:27.020
 they erected a helter-skelter that you could climb up

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.620
 last year so you could get a better view of the roof bosses.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.500
 And I mentioned it 'cause I love that reference,

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.760
 who was the guy who decided to put the slide in,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.680
 and he was inspired when he visited the Sistine Chapel,

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.680
 and the thing he thought, as he looked over the ceiling

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.640
 of the Sistine Chapel, was that Norwich Cathedral's

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.800
 decorations were every bit as wonderful,

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.680
 but just too high up to be appreciated.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.280
 - Yes.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.880
 The Sistine Chapel, they have recently,

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.960
 'cause it's such a pain to look up constantly.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.200
 You get a kind of crick in your neck if you're in there

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.680
 and you're always having to, you know, crane your neck up.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.960
 So they, I think, have just installed swings

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.180
 so that you get a really good view of that thing.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.020
 (all laughing)

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.180
 - Oh, I was with you for so much of that.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.760
 (upbeat music)

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:18.820
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.020
 and that is N.

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.900
 - My fact this week is that there's a single termite home

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.460
 in Brazil that's the same size as Great Britain.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.100
 - Wow, that's astonishing.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:30.940
 - It's a big home.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.060
 It's not, I don't think a home, yeah.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.040
 I'm gonna preempt to James.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.340
 (all laughing)

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.860
 - Right, I wanna say it.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.900
 - No, stop it, shut your mouth.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.020
 It's not a single termite.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:46.280
 It's a single home, but it is more than one termite

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.640
 living there.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.780
 - Since the kids of left were rattling around the place,

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.380
 it's the size of Great Britain,

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.260
 and I'm the size of a grain of rice.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.460
 - The bedroom tax has taken it as tall on these termites.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.060
 - This is just incredible.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.940
 It was only confirmed a couple of years ago,

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.380
 only sort of discovered a couple of years ago

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.540
 when they've been clearing this pasture in Brazil

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.460
 for agriculture and stuff for 20 or 30 years,

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:15.100
 and people started noticing there were a lot of mounds around,

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.260
 and eventually, 2018,

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.060
 someone decided to do a proper study of it

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.020
 and survey of it.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.260
 They realized there are 200 million termite mounds.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.500
 These piles of excavated termite dirt

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.780
 spread across something the size of Great Britain.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.820
 So all across Brazil, and no one had really noticed before,

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.060
 'cause then the people who lived there knew

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.620
 that there were these termite mounds kind of scattered about.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.500
 - It wasn't that a scientist came along,

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.300
 and he went, "What are these massive mounds doing?"

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.740
 They went, "What? Oh my God."

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.380
 (laughing)

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.620
 - It wasn't quite that.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.060
 - Because their termite mounds are quite solid,

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.860
 they would just build their houses around them,

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:47.700
 wouldn't they?

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.140
 They would, you know, they'd be in your garden,

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.260
 and you'd like turn it into a barbecue or something,

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.380
 or you sit on-- - Slides.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.220
 - You could put a slide down it for their kids.

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.340
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.180
 - It's amazing as well, isn't it?

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.340
 Because it's a single termite species

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.780
 that's been working on this,

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.860
 and they've looked into the amount of soil

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.420
 that they've managed to excavate

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.660
 that sits on top of the earth,

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.060
 and they say that it's equivalent

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.620
 to 4,000 Great Pyramids of Giza.

00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:13.300
 It's the amount that they've managed in all these years.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.140
 - Amazing. - Yeah.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:14.980
 - It's extraordinary.

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.060
 - And some of them are as old as the pyramids,

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.220
 so all of these are at least 700 years old,

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.540
 give or take, a few years,

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.180
 and they're up to 3,800 years old,

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.340
 and that's just from the 11

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.420
 that they've properly studied the age of so far.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.020
 So some of them could be way older than that,

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.340
 but that is roughly the age of a lot of pyramids.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.300
 - Yeah, no, they've said it,

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.540
 that's actually the minimum estimate of their range,

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.500
 and it's like 4,000 years old is the minimum.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.140
 It might be twice as old as that

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.700
 from what they've studied so far.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.500
 And like you say, it is one family,

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.140
 'cause they thought that it must be

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:49.300
 lots of different species of termites that are rivals,

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.620
 but they took a bunch of termites from one pile of dirt

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.100
 and then put them with a bunch of termites from another,

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.900
 and you'd expect them to always fight,

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:59.860
 and they got along like family, like a happy family.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.260
 And so they basically proved that this is just one home,

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.540
 one family house. - So cool.

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:07.340
 Do you know how they found out how old they are?

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.660
 This is quite cool.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.540
 What they did was they dug into the bottom

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.060
 of one of these piles of earth,

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.980
 and they took out a little bit of earth,

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.980
 and there's a technique which is really complicated,

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:16.820
 so I won't go into it,

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.380
 but you can kind of fire lasers at this earth

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.860
 and look at what happens to the electrons,

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.500
 and you work out the last time that it was exposed to sunlight.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.340
 So they can just work.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.180
 It's so clever.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.420
 It's like carbon dating,

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.020
 but for things that have not been alive,

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.700
 and you just fire your little lasers at it,

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.460
 and it'll tell you when the last time it was in the sun.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.300
 - Oh, that's so cool. - It's so clever.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.580
 - We're so clever.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.940
 We're here talking about how clever these termites are,

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.820
 but look at us, kicking ass.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:46.540
 - When we say we, it is the scientist,

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.660
 because when I say it's complicated,

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.540
 I don't wanna go into it.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.940
 Partly it's because I don't really understand it.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:53.620
 (laughing)

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.660
 - We can take credit.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.860
 I bet there were just two termite architects

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:57.820
 that built this whole thing,

00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.340
 but the rest of the termites are going,

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.180
 "God, we're impressive, aren't we?"

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.020
 - That's right, yeah.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.020
 - You take credit for your species.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:07.580
 - But they're not even proper mounds

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.740
 like other termites built.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.820
 So some termites build sort of chimneys or ventilation things.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.700
 These were just described by the scientists

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.380
 who worked on this project as slag piles,

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.620
 because they live underground.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.060
 All it is is they're making space

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.020
 for their chambers underground,

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.420
 so they make a vertical hole to the surface,

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.340
 and then they just chuck the soil out of those holes,

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.860
 and over time that builds up into, however tall these are,

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.460
 two meters, two and a half meters.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.340
 I mean, imagine what's underground,

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:36.700
 this huge cathedral space that they emptied out.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.660
 - Yeah, and they were first discovered by a few scientists,

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.780
 but one in particular, a guy called Stephen Martin,

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.260
 who's an entomologist at the University of Salthard,

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.900
 and he doesn't even care about termites.

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:50.660
 He is an expert in giant killer hornets.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:51.500
 - Is it me?

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.220
 - The things that actually we should just call

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.300
 giant hornets these days, just big old hornets.

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.580
 We're not supposed to call them killer hornets.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.420
 - Murder hornets.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.260
 - Murder hornets, we're not supposed to say that.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.820
 But he's an expert in those guys,

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.300
 and he was in Brazil looking for some bees,

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.180
 because he wanted to see how the bees

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.020
 were getting on in Brazil,

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.460
 and then as he was going down the road,

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.860
 he was like, wait a minute, what are those?

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.180
 What are those things, and why are they so regular,

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.860
 and why are they in like a pattern?

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.580
 And that was when they worked out

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:19.260
 that it was all this same species.

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:20.100
 - Actually, it's worth saying,

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.700
 I don't know if this has been mentioned,

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.260
 or even if it's assumed by the listener,

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:26.140
 but they're still building these mounds.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.820
 This is an active house.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.660
 It's not dead, it's not like a fossilized,

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.580
 old abandoned Great Britain.

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.540
 It's an active thing.

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.380
 - Yeah.

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.540
 - It's an extraordinary house, it's a Great Britain, sorry.

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:38.900
 - Not enough there, are they, Andy?

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:39.740
 - No, no, no.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:44.500
 - So termites are pretty incredible,

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.180
 and possibly the most incredible termite

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.300
 is the queen.

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:48.780
 So they've got a queen-based structure,

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.780
 like bees and other species.

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:51.620
 - And England.

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:54.380
 - And England, and much like in England,

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:57.020
 the termite queen is the only fertile member.

00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:02.020
 And so she is super fertile, the termite, I mean,

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.460
 and she basically spends her entire life

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:06.860
 incessantly mating.

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:10.380
 So she chooses a male to mate with,

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:12.820
 and then she spends the subsequent 15 to 20,

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:15.460
 sometimes years, constantly shagging him,

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.420
 and she'll make one egg every three seconds.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:18.260
 So in her lifetime,

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.540
 she makes over a quarter of a billion eggs,

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.100
 it's constantly producing them.

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:25.260
 - Is there a king termite that produces all the mating?

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.100
 - There's a king termite,

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.540
 and what's quite funny about them

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.540
 is that she's about a hundred times bigger than he is,

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.100
 and than anyone else in the colony.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.700
 So he's this microscopic thing, she's next to him,

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.780
 and the reason she's so large

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.620
 is because she is one giant ovary.

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.340
 And do please look on YouTube

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.020
 at the picture of a queen termite with eggs inside her.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:47.860
 So she's like this big, pulsating, transparent lump

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.860
 that's full of eggs,

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.300
 and you can see the eggs bubbling

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.500
 and moving around inside her under her surface.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.820
 And yeah, she can't move.

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.380
 So it's awful being the queen because you're stuck.

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.900
 She can't fit out of the door of her enclosure anymore.

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:01.860
 She can't move at all.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:04.500
 So she depends totally on members of her colony

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:08.900
 to wash her, to feed her, to lick this weird sweat off her.

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.740
 She's just stuck.

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.700
 - Is this still the termite queen we're talking about?

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.420
 - I'm just gonna leave that ambiguous.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.260
 - Scandal.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:17.340
 - But the door thing seems to be a bit of a mystery

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:20.060
 'cause if you've got a house the size of Great Britain,

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.660
 you'd think you could make the doors a bit bigger

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.300
 to fit your leader out of.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:24.140
 What's going on there?

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.100
 - That's a good point.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.700
 Termites usually have quite small doors.

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.060
 They have like termite-sized doors.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:30.900
 - Indeed.

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.180
 - She doesn't wanna go anywhere either.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.620
 I mean, she's attached to this huge body of,

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.820
 her legs are tiny compared with the breeding mass of her.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.380
 - Yeah, if you gave her a big door,

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.380
 it would actually just be horrifying for her

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:42.820
 knowing she couldn't even get through it

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.460
 'cause she can't move.

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.180
 - So they're tricking her, they're basically saying,

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:48.860
 "Oh, you could go everywhere, but the doors are too small."

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.140
 What a shame, so she never knows.

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.380
 - The door thing is quite important in termites

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:57.180
 because a lot of them can't really defend themselves very well.

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.620
 They can do a little bit of squirting,

00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.980
 horrible stuff out of their anus,

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.900
 but there's not really much they can do if they're attacked.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:06.580
 And so usually what they'll do is like a few different insects,

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.740
 they'll come back into their door and then use their head

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.220
 as a block to stop anything else from coming into the door.

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.380
 And so basically then anything coming in

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.460
 will have to get past that one door head

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:19.820
 and then another door head would go into their place

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.660
 and then that stops anyone from getting into their tunnels.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:26.380
 And that is interesting as well because in 2018, in Japan,

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.860
 they found the first all-female termite colonies

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.420
 where all of the termites,

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.260
 usually you would have kings and you would have lots

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:36.540
 of male soldiers and stuff like that and male workers,

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.540
 but this one is all females.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.540
 And the reason that they think it works

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.780
 is that their males are lots of different sizes,

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.420
 but the females are all exactly the same size.

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.420
 And so they can have a head

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.620
 which will exactly fit in the door every single time.

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:53.260
 And you're not sometimes going to have someone

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.260
 whose head's a bit too big or a bit too small.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:59.380
 And so by just having females in this colony,

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:02.020
 it means that they have less chance of being attacked,

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:05.060
 which makes up for the lack of genetic change

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.180
 that you kind of need males and females for.

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.020
 - So it's kind of interesting. - Nice.

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:09.860
 - That's really cool.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.100
 - It's like they're the IKEA door blockers, you know?

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.380
 It's just like made to very basic specifications.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.820
 It's all the same, it's going to fit together.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.260
 - Smart.

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.860
 - We do take advice from termites on building these days.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:26.700
 So they are particularly good at ventilation,

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.220
 which is something that we are quite bad at

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.820
 because the amount that ventilation costs the atmosphere

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:35.580
 and greenhouse gas emissions, et cetera, is so massive.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.180
 So we're now building buildings

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.020
 that are inspired by their ventilation systems.

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.100
 There's this place in Zimbabwe,

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:43.220
 which was the first massive building,

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.860
 it's a big shopping center called the Eastgate Center

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.380
 and Office Block, inspired by termite systems.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.460
 And what they do is they have this system

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.260
 of opening and closing doors that they're constantly tending to

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.660
 to make sure that air comes in the right places,

00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:57.780
 moves up through the termite mound

00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:59.100
 so that it's heated in the right places,

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.540
 it's cooled in the right places.

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.780
 'Cause it needs to be at one precise temperature

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.100
 the whole time on the inside for them to be able to survive.

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.140
 So yeah, and they make the reason that they work so well

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.500
 is the termite mounds catch the wind,

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:12.580
 so it blows through them.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:16.620
 So a mound is like a lung and the wind comes in to them

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.140
 and then is absorbed by the various bits,

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:21.620
 the cells that need it and then goes out.

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.700
 - If you want to go into this shopping center,

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.500
 there's a security guard with his head blocking the door.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.620
 - Yeah, always female though.

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:31.780
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.460
 And another good thing, because they're ventilated so well,

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.420
 they make really good ovens.

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.780
 So in South Africa, you'll get people

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:41.260
 where they'll take a termite mound

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.460
 and they'll kind of drill a little hole,

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.100
 make the door a little bit bigger.

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.380
 Hopefully it's the termite mound

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.780
 where all the termites aren't there anymore, I hope.

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:50.620
 But they'll set a little fire inside

00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:53.180
 and then the air will be sucked in through the door

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.420
 and then go up through the top of the termite mound

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.980
 because it's so well ventilated.

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:58.020
 - Brilliant.

00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:00.340
 - And it means that you can cook like pizza in there

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.700
 or anything that needs a high temperature, you cook in there.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.740
 - Do they warn the termites like a demolition order?

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.580
 Do they put a sign up saying in three weeks time,

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.860
 this will be turned into an oven,

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.460
 please vacate your home?

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:13.020
 - I'm just hoping that they're old ones.

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:15.580
 - You don't have any ashes of termites on your pizza

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.060
 as you're taking it out of the oven, do you?

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:20.020
 - Maybe it's a delicacy.

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.140
 - Well, people do eat termites, don't they?

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:25.060
 They're infused into muffins in certain countries.

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:25.900
 - Really?

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:29.700
 - Yeah, so it's possible that termite pizza is a thing.

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:30.540
 - Yeah.

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.380
 - Do you know how they transfer water across their mounds?

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:35.420
 So sometimes a bit of the mound gets really dry

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.900
 and it needs moistening lubrication.

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:38.740
 This is so cool.

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.380
 They drink half their body weight in water.

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:43.060
 They go to a dry part of the mound

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.380
 and then they pass it into another termite's mouth.

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:46.220
 It's basically-

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.060
 - All the water?

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.020
 - All the water, yeah, yeah.

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:49.660
 And there's a scientist called J. Scott Turner

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.940
 who fed them fluorescent dyed water

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.380
 and could see it moving from one termite to another.

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.260
 So basically it's like it's as if a bucket chain

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.660
 to put out a fire was people just, you know,

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:03.420
 pushing the water into each other's mouths.

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:05.140
 - It's not very COVID friendly, is it?

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.540
 - It's not very COVID friendly,

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.100
 but it would make firefighting a much sexier profession

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.060
 than it already is.

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.820
 - Is it, wait, so is it to make sure that-

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:13.660
 - Would it?

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.500
 (laughing)

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.340
 - Sorry?

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.180
 - Yeah.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:18.260
 - I think it would make it a much less effective profession

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.660
 because every time you would swallow a little bit

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.180
 of the water and by the time it got to the final fireman,

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.940
 it would just be a little dribble coming out of as well.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:28.980
 - You'd obviously hire people with enormous mouths

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:30.540
 to hold as much water as they could.

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:33.060
 So the physical profile of the firefighter might change.

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.740
 I'm not suggesting a change in the system.

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.540
 I'm sorry, I'd just like to clarify.

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.380
 - Is this to-

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.820
 - As you see your house being burnt down,

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:42.260
 why not at least have something sexy to look at

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:44.780
 while you're watching your life get destroyed?

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.100
 I get it, I get that.

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:47.980
 - Is this to moisten the other side then

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:50.220
 or is this to give a drink to the people on the other side?

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.300
 - It's to moisten the other side.

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.100
 So it's sort of, it's, but they then go and, you know,

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:57.260
 spit the water out on the actual mound itself.

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.140
 - That's incredible.

00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:58.980
 - Yeah.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.020
 - They never sleep as well.

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:01.180
 Turmites don't sleep.

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:02.020
 - Really?

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:05.780
 - Yeah, they're just building 24 hours a day until they die.

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:06.900
 - Do they rest?

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:08.140
 Do they have like a nap?

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:08.980
 Or not even-

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.060
 - They must have downtime, yeah.

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:11.460
 - Yeah, downtime, exactly.

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:13.420
 - They might play the Xbox for a little while.

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.980
 - In fact, I think I've read that they normally,

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.420
 like Dan says, they're just all active,

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.340
 but if they run out of holes to fill,

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.780
 they just stand around touching each other's antennae.

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:26.460
 So that might be their equivalent of downtime.

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.380
 - Well, the Queen rests a lot, rests her entire life.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:30.980
 And then her life ends really tragically

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:33.460
 because her children lick her to death.

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:37.380
 She sort of, she dies in the same sort of tragic way

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:38.320
 that she lives.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.660
 She stops being useful, stops laying eggs.

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:43.020
 And so her kids like lick and lick and lick her,

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.820
 drawing all the fat and fluids out of her.

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.380
 And she just disintegrates away.

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.420
 - God.

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:48.260
 - Yeah.

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:49.580
 - That's another sexy image for you, Loretta.

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.820
 (laughing)

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:52.980
 (upbeat music)

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.940
 Okay, that's it.

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:54.980
 That is all of our facts.

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:56.460
