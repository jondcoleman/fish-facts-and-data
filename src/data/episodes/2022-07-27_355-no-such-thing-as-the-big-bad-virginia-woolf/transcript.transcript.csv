00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:18,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish,"""
00:00:18,00:00:20,a weekly podcast coming from four
00:00:20,00:00:22,undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:22,00:00:23,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:23,00:00:25,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:25,00:00:28,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:28,00:00:30,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:30,00:00:33,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:33,00:00:36,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"Starting with my fact this week,"
00:00:38,00:00:40,"my fact is that while working as a publisher,"
00:00:40,00:00:43,the poet T.S. Eliot liked to sit his visiting authors
00:00:43,00:00:46,on a whoopee cushion before offering them
00:00:46,00:00:47,an exploding cigar.
00:00:47,00:00:48,(laughing)
00:00:48,00:00:51,"- Wow, I mean, did he do this with everybody?"
00:00:51,00:00:53,"- Yeah, I don't know if people were warned about it."
00:00:53,00:00:55,I think most people assumed it wouldn't happen.
00:00:55,00:00:58,He was a very serious guy according to the writings
00:00:58,00:01:01,"that he released, so the idea that you would enter"
00:01:01,00:01:03,the office of the great poet T.S. Eliot
00:01:03,00:01:05,and have a cigar explode in your face
00:01:05,00:01:09,"while making a loud fart seems out of place, doesn't it?"
00:01:09,00:01:12,"- Do you think maybe the very grave, serious persona"
00:01:12,00:01:15,he had throughout his life was all an act
00:01:15,00:01:19,"so that he could do this, jade, without people expecting it?"
00:01:19,00:01:20,- That's a great idea.
00:01:20,00:01:21,- Could have been all building up to this.
00:01:21,00:01:23,"- All the front, yeah."
00:01:23,00:01:24,It wasn't just his authors who came in
00:01:24,00:01:27,who he would turn these sort of practical jokes on to.
00:01:27,00:01:29,He once broke up a board meeting as well
00:01:29,00:01:32,by setting off a bucket full of firecrackers
00:01:32,00:01:33,underneath the chairman's legs.
00:01:33,00:01:35,So he was all over the shop.
00:01:35,00:01:36,He was a nightmare to work with.
00:01:36,00:01:37,- Sounds like a maniac.
00:01:37,00:01:40,That sounds dangerous as a fourth of July prank.
00:01:40,00:01:43,"- Yeah, you'd be fired if you weren't quite senior"
00:01:43,00:01:45,in the company or you weren't about to become
00:01:45,00:01:46,"the greatest poet of the 20th century,"
00:01:46,00:01:47,you would be fired for that.
00:01:47,00:01:49,"- But wait a minute, wouldn't it be quite cool"
00:01:49,00:01:51,"if you were about to be fired and they went,"
00:01:51,00:01:53,"""You're fired,"" and you went, ""No, you're fired, mate."""
00:01:53,00:01:56,"And a lot of firecrackers went, ""Oh, his ass."""
00:01:56,00:01:56,- That'd be amazing.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"- ""Dunning, maybe that's what happened."""
00:01:58,00:01:59,"And it was such an event,"
00:01:59,00:02:01,they completely forgot this accent.
00:02:01,00:02:04,"- So T.S. Eliot, he, famous poet,"
00:02:04,00:02:07,but also was actually a publisher himself.
00:02:07,00:02:09,So he worked for Faber and Faber.
00:02:09,00:02:10,"In fact, he actually worked for,"
00:02:10,00:02:11,"before it was Faber and Faber,"
00:02:11,00:02:14,he worked for it when it was Faber and Gwyer.
00:02:14,00:02:15,Do you know why he became--
00:02:15,00:02:16,"- Can I just say, very, very good publishers,"
00:02:16,00:02:18,Faber and Faber.
00:02:18,00:02:19,"They've got one book out this year,"
00:02:19,00:02:21,"I think it's called ""Funner You Should Ask"""
00:02:21,00:02:22,"by the QALs. - Oh, here we go."
00:02:22,00:02:23,- Here we go.
00:02:23,00:02:24,(laughing)
00:02:24,00:02:26,"- Viral marketing. - They are very, very good."
00:02:26,00:02:27,- Very crafty.
00:02:27,00:02:28,"- Sorry, Dan, you were saying."
00:02:28,00:02:32,"- But so, yeah, so he joined them in the 1920s,"
00:02:32,00:02:35,and he became a director and an editor there.
00:02:35,00:02:37,- We're saying he was one of the great poets
00:02:37,00:02:39,"of the 20th century, which I guess he was, fine."
00:02:39,00:02:42,"But he did, he did also write ""Cats."""
00:02:42,00:02:44,"I mean, he is credited."
00:02:44,00:02:46,- I believe that's what we're referring to
00:02:46,00:02:47,"when we say-- - Oh, I'm sorry, yeah."
00:02:47,00:02:48,(laughing)
00:02:48,00:02:50,"He is the lyricist, credited as the lyricist"
00:02:50,00:02:51,"on the musical ""Cats."""
00:02:51,00:02:54,"Even though he died 20 years before it came out,"
00:02:54,00:02:55,"'cause he wrote this book,"
00:02:55,00:02:57,"""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats"" in 1939,"
00:02:57,00:03:00,"and it was for his godson, it was, you know, it wasn't."
00:03:00,00:03:03,"- Yeah, that's unfair to say that he wrote ""Cats."""
00:03:03,00:03:05,"- I say he wrote ""Cats"" because, for example,"
00:03:05,00:03:09,"he won a Tony Award for ""Cats"" in 1983,"
00:03:09,00:03:10,18 years after he died.
00:03:10,00:03:12,"- And they wheeled him up, didn't they,"
00:03:12,00:03:15,on stage for a very dark award ceremony?
00:03:15,00:03:18,"- And he went, ""Surprise, I haven't been dead all this time."""
00:03:18,00:03:19,(laughing)
00:03:19,00:03:22,"- That huge stink bomb goes off at the back of the room, chaos."
00:03:22,00:03:25,"- I think in his defense, he said about ""Cats"""
00:03:25,00:03:26,"in an interview, and he was asked about it,"
00:03:26,00:03:29,that one wants to keep one's hand in.
00:03:29,00:03:31,"So, you know, you just keep trying stuff out,"
00:03:31,00:03:33,"you just keep writing the practice of writing,"
00:03:33,00:03:35,even if you're not really writing serious stuff.
00:03:35,00:03:37,"But he did really enjoy writing about ""Cats"""
00:03:37,00:03:40,"'cause in this same interview, he basically said,"
00:03:40,00:03:41,"""I've thought about writing about dogs,"
00:03:41,00:03:43,"""but they don't seem to lend themselves to verse"
00:03:43,00:03:47,"""quite so well,"" which I can see that that's true."
00:03:47,00:03:49,- A dog on a log does rhyme.
00:03:49,00:03:52,"But I think there's more rhyming words for ""Cats"""
00:03:52,00:03:52,than there are for dogs.
00:03:52,00:03:54,"Just, I mean, I'm not a poet,"
00:03:54,00:03:56,"as you might be able to tell, but I just--"
00:03:56,00:03:57,"- No, I think that's really good."
00:03:57,00:03:59,He probably hadn't thought of the log thing.
00:03:59,00:04:01,"- Frog, the cat-- - Frog is well actually frog."
00:04:01,00:04:03,"- Yeah, but it's the cat in the hat, isn't it?"
00:04:03,00:04:04,Not the dog on the log.
00:04:04,00:04:05,- With a frog.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"- Okay, he wasn't Dr. Seuss, go on."
00:04:07,00:04:07,(laughing)
00:04:07,00:04:08,- Is that what poetry is?
00:04:08,00:04:11,"I've never read any of his stuff, I must say."
00:04:11,00:04:13,"- Ezra Pound gave him his nickname,"
00:04:13,00:04:15,"which you mentioned a minute ago, which was Possum."
00:04:15,00:04:17,"So it's called Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats,"
00:04:17,00:04:19,'cause that was Elliot's nickname.
00:04:19,00:04:24,And it's related to his serious personality.
00:04:24,00:04:25,"So despite all the practical jokes,"
00:04:25,00:04:28,he was known for being incredibly stiff.
00:04:28,00:04:30,The nickname Possum came after the fact
00:04:30,00:04:32,that Possums are known for faking their own deaths.
00:04:32,00:04:35,"So the idea was that whenever he was at a social gathering,"
00:04:35,00:04:37,it seemed like he was faking being dead.
00:04:37,00:04:40,That's how much life he contributed to the party.
00:04:40,00:04:42,"- Oh, like playing Possum, yeah."
00:04:42,00:04:43,- Exactly.
00:04:43,00:04:46,- But so he liked the name Possum?
00:04:46,00:04:47,Is that what you're saying?
00:04:47,00:04:48,"- He did like it, yeah, it was affectionate."
00:04:48,00:04:51,"And Virginia Woolf said he was so buttoned up,"
00:04:51,00:04:52,he wore a four-piece suit.
00:04:52,00:04:53,"And so he liked the name Possum,"
00:04:53,00:04:56,he kind of embraced this and it was based on--
00:04:56,00:04:57,- That's the joke.
00:04:57,00:05:00,"I understand that, I was just trying to work out."
00:05:00,00:05:03,'Cause I wanted to know if there was a bit of a three-piece suit
00:05:03,00:05:05,I was missing all these years.
00:05:05,00:05:06,(laughing)
00:05:06,00:05:08,"- No, there's a bit of your sense of humor"
00:05:08,00:05:10,you've been missing all these years.
00:05:10,00:05:12,(laughing)
00:05:12,00:05:13,- But that's interesting 'cause he did have a bit
00:05:13,00:05:16,of a lack of a sense of humor about his names generally.
00:05:16,00:05:18,"For example, T.S. Eliot."
00:05:18,00:05:19,Why is the S in there?
00:05:19,00:05:20,Why not T. Eliot?
00:05:20,00:05:21,Do you guys know?
00:05:21,00:05:23,"- Well, all I know really about T.S. Eliot"
00:05:23,00:05:25,before researching this is that his name
00:05:25,00:05:26,is an anagram of toilets.
00:05:26,00:05:27,So is it-- - There you go.
00:05:27,00:05:28,- Is that it?
00:05:28,00:05:31,"- If you take the S out, it's toilet backwards"
00:05:31,00:05:34,"and he did not want that to be the case, yeah."
00:05:34,00:05:36,"- Kidding, that's why he put the S in."
00:05:36,00:05:38,"- This is, a lot of people said it."
00:05:38,00:05:40,"I haven't read him saying it himself,"
00:05:40,00:05:42,"but Samuel Beckett has written about it,"
00:05:42,00:05:44,saying T. Eliot is toilet-spelled backwards.
00:05:44,00:05:47,"Ordon mentioned it, that's what you would get."
00:05:47,00:05:49,I think it was the thing that everyone had noticed.
00:05:49,00:05:51,And so that's why the S was in there.
00:05:51,00:05:52,- Wow.
00:05:52,00:05:54,- So we know he didn't like dogs.
00:05:54,00:05:55,We know he likes cats.
00:05:55,00:05:57,Do you know what other animals he didn't like?
00:05:57,00:06:01,"- Spiders, I guess, is the obvious one."
00:06:01,00:06:03,- Farm yard animals.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"As a group, he famously at,"
00:06:06,00:06:09,"or rather, perhaps not as famous as it should be,"
00:06:09,00:06:10,"while working at Faber,"
00:06:10,00:06:12,turned down George Orwell's Animal Farm.
00:06:12,00:06:14,He was submitted to them.
00:06:14,00:06:16,And he read it and he wrote him a nice long letter
00:06:16,00:06:18,saying it's brilliant.
00:06:18,00:06:20,And I'm very upset that we're not gonna be publishing it
00:06:20,00:06:22,because it means that whoever gets to publish it
00:06:22,00:06:24,will probably get to publish your subsequent work.
00:06:24,00:06:26,"But I just, I can't do it."
00:06:26,00:06:28,It doesn't fit with us.
00:06:28,00:06:31,"- Because he doesn't like farm yard animals, does he?"
00:06:31,00:06:34,"- I'll tell you another animal he didn't like, flies."
00:06:34,00:06:36,"Because they also turned down Lord of the Flies,"
00:06:36,00:06:38,Faber and Faber.
00:06:38,00:06:40,- Is every subsequent fact in this show
00:06:40,00:06:42,gonna have to be linked tangentially to an animal?
00:06:42,00:06:43,- Was it because Lord of the Flies
00:06:43,00:06:44,has a character called Piggy
00:06:44,00:06:46,and you get pigs in farm yards?
00:06:46,00:06:48,"- Brilliant, that's exactly it."
00:06:48,00:06:51,"Yes, they, well, they didn't specify that."
00:06:51,00:06:52,"They turned it down with the notes,"
00:06:52,00:06:55,"rubbish and dull, pointless, reject."
00:06:55,00:06:56,- Wow.
00:06:56,00:06:56,"- Ouch, yeah."
00:06:56,00:06:59,"- God, it sounds like he was quite a bad publisher."
00:06:59,00:07:02,"I wonder he had to write poems to make ends meet,"
00:07:02,00:07:04,turning down all these absolute stone cold hits.
00:07:04,00:07:06,"- Unlike Faber of today, of course,"
00:07:06,00:07:09,who have another stone cold hit on their hands.
00:07:09,00:07:11,"With funny, you should ask."
00:07:11,00:07:13,The new book by the QIL.
00:07:13,00:07:14,- Available now.
00:07:14,00:07:14,- Spawn.
00:07:14,00:07:19,- I didn't know how fun TS Eliot was.
00:07:19,00:07:19,I appreciate we've just said
00:07:19,00:07:21,"that he's not fun all the way through this,"
00:07:21,00:07:24,but I didn't know he really liked Groucho Marx.
00:07:24,00:07:26,He idolized Groucho Marx.
00:07:26,00:07:29,"They had dinner once together, TS Eliot and Groucho Marx,"
00:07:29,00:07:31,but the dinner was a complete disaster
00:07:31,00:07:34,because all Marx wanted to talk about was literature
00:07:34,00:07:36,and all Eliot wanted to talk about
00:07:36,00:07:37,was Marx Brothers films.
00:07:37,00:07:38,- Yeah.
00:07:38,00:07:40,- It's really interesting that if Groucho Marx
00:07:40,00:07:42,"was going to become friends with anyone,"
00:07:42,00:07:43,you would think it wouldn't be someone
00:07:43,00:07:46,who has the big exploding cigar trick up his sleeve.
00:07:46,00:07:52,- Maybe that was his ultimate prey for TS Eliot.
00:07:52,00:07:54,I will get him one day.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"- Well, that actually makes so much sense."
00:07:56,00:07:58,"Sorry, because Eliot once wrote Marx a letter."
00:07:58,00:08:00,"So he'd written Groucho Marx a letter saying,"
00:08:00,00:08:01,"""Can I have a photo of you?"""
00:08:01,00:08:04,And Marx had sent it and TS Eliot put this framed
00:08:04,00:08:06,"on his table, but then Eliot wrote another letter"
00:08:06,00:08:08,"to Marx saying, ""In the photo of you,"
00:08:08,00:08:11,"""you're not smoking your cigar and it's a bit annoying"
00:08:11,00:08:13,"""because all my visitors come, look at it and say,"
00:08:13,00:08:14,"""who's that?"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"""No one recognizes you without the cigar."
00:08:16,00:08:18,"""Can you do one with a cigar?"""
00:08:18,00:08:19,So maybe that was all part of a ploy
00:08:19,00:08:22,to get that exploding cigar into his face.
00:08:22,00:08:23,- That is interesting.
00:08:23,00:08:25,- I think it's interesting that they were so close
00:08:25,00:08:28,"because Eliot was quite anti-Semitic, wasn't he?"
00:08:28,00:08:29,Do you know what I mean?
00:08:29,00:08:30,"We should mention that, I think."
00:08:30,00:08:33,A lot of his poems that before he became famous
00:08:33,00:08:36,do have certain anti-Semitic tropes to them.
00:08:36,00:08:39,And that it was before Second World War.
00:08:39,00:08:41,"And then obviously after the Second World War,"
00:08:41,00:08:42,"people realized that, wait a minute,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,you can't really do this kind of thing.
00:08:44,00:08:47,"But he never really properly backtracked on it, so."
00:08:47,00:08:48,- Yeah.
00:08:48,00:08:50,"Well, actually it was quite tense."
00:08:50,00:08:52,I'm not sure they did like each other that much.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"If you read the exchanges of letters,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,they're full of barbs.
00:08:57,00:09:01,"So there was one where when Marx sent Eliot this photo,"
00:09:01,00:09:02,"Eliot wrote back saying,"
00:09:02,00:09:05,"""I've hung that right next to my photos of Yates"
00:09:05,00:09:07,"""and Paul Valeri, you know, in the pride of place."""
00:09:07,00:09:10,"And then Groucho wrote back to him saying,"
00:09:10,00:09:12,"""That's so weird 'cause I've just read an essay about you"
00:09:12,00:09:14,"""which named those other two pictures,"
00:09:14,00:09:16,"""but there was a conspicuous absence."
00:09:16,00:09:18,"""I trust this was an oversight"
00:09:18,00:09:19,"""on the part of the journalist."""
00:09:19,00:09:23,- What a weird thing to write to someone saying.
00:09:23,00:09:25,The article about you didn't mention a photo of me
00:09:25,00:09:28,"in your home, get a grip, mate."
00:09:28,00:09:30,- But then Eliot's excuse wasn't it?
00:09:30,00:09:32,"- He said, ""Oh, well, your picture was a photo"
00:09:32,00:09:34,"""and the other pictures were drawings or paintings."
00:09:34,00:09:38,"""So maybe the writer had only noticed the paintings"
00:09:38,00:09:40,"""and hadn't noticed photographs"
00:09:40,00:09:41,"""and didn't want to talk about photographs."""
00:09:41,00:09:43,"- Good excuse, very good excuse."
00:09:43,00:09:45,"I mean, it's absolutely mad that in the old days"
00:09:45,00:09:47,you had to write to someone for a photo of them.
00:09:47,00:09:50,Can we just appreciate that as a really stupid system?
00:09:50,00:09:51,Imagine.
00:09:51,00:09:53,- How do you get a photo of someone now again?
00:09:53,00:09:54,Is it easy now?
00:09:54,00:09:55,"- Yeah, Google it."
00:09:55,00:09:56,- Google image.
00:09:56,00:09:58,And then right click and you go print.
00:09:58,00:10:02,"- Yeah, but when you've got a picture of Groucho Marx"
00:10:02,00:10:04,"on your wall with all the other people you've met,"
00:10:04,00:10:07,"you don't want one that you've taken off Google image,"
00:10:07,00:10:08,do you?
00:10:08,00:10:11,- With getty images over the top of it.
00:10:11,00:10:14,"- Oh, my lad, do you?"
00:10:14,00:10:16,- You should come and see my gallery wall.
00:10:16,00:10:19,It's got a lot of lovely watermarks on it.
00:10:19,00:10:20,- So many celebrity friends.
00:10:20,00:10:23,"It's Nicole Kidman's up there, Barack Obama."
00:10:23,00:10:28,- Shall we talk about his sex life?
00:10:28,00:10:29,- Always up for that.
00:10:29,00:10:30,- T.S. Eliot.
00:10:30,00:10:31,"- Okay, sure, yeah."
00:10:31,00:10:35,"- It was very difficult, I think is the headline there."
00:10:35,00:10:38,He was very awkward around women.
00:10:38,00:10:40,He had a lot of relationships in his life.
00:10:40,00:10:44,"And until the end, they were pretty much a disaster."
00:10:44,00:10:46,"- Oh, I was ready for the juicy stuff, James."
00:10:46,00:10:49,"I didn't think it was just, he had bad relationships."
00:10:49,00:10:50,"- Okay, I was just gonna set it up"
00:10:50,00:10:52,for someone else to jump in there.
00:10:52,00:10:52,But fine.
00:10:52,00:10:54,"- We've all got bad relationships, yeah."
00:10:56,00:10:58,- His most famous relationship was with Vivian.
00:10:58,00:11:01,And he told the wolves that he couldn't imagine
00:11:01,00:11:03,shaving in her presence.
00:11:03,00:11:04,That's how awkward the relationship
00:11:04,00:11:06,was between those two people.
00:11:06,00:11:08,"- This is Virginia Woolf's family,"
00:11:08,00:11:09,we should say not actual wolves.
00:11:09,00:11:11,- It was confusing.
00:11:11,00:11:14,"- Sorry, I just, yeah."
00:11:14,00:11:16,"- He didn't like dogs, but he loved wolves."
00:11:16,00:11:18,- I thought I pronounced the word wolf
00:11:18,00:11:20,with the obvious double O.
00:11:20,00:11:23,"It was so obvious that there was a double O in there, guys."
00:11:23,00:11:25,- I heard the F of wolves.
00:11:25,00:11:29,"- And that's what I was, but I think wolves, wolves."
00:11:29,00:11:31,"It's probably, Virginia Woolf always said,"
00:11:31,00:11:32,"""I'm Virginia Woolf."""
00:11:32,00:11:38,- So what did the wolves say about him?
00:11:38,00:11:42,"- They said, ""Oh, that's interesting."""
00:11:42,00:11:49,"- Well, he was part of that Bloomsbury group, wasn't he?"
00:11:49,00:11:50,"With the wolves, Virginia Woolf."
00:11:50,00:11:52,"And Bertrand Russell as well,"
00:11:52,00:11:54,with whom his wife had an affair.
00:11:54,00:11:55,"- Wait, so what did Virginia Woolf say?"
00:11:55,00:11:58,What were you saying about what did the wolves say?
00:11:58,00:12:00,We need to know what the wolves at the door said.
00:12:00,00:12:02,- He said it to the wolves.
00:12:02,00:12:06,"He said, ""I can't imagine shaving in my wife's presence."""
00:12:06,00:12:07,"And then the wolf said,"
00:12:07,00:12:09,"""You really need to make this house out of bricks."""
00:12:09,00:12:16,- He said he couldn't imagine shaving in his wife's presence.
00:12:16,00:12:17,"- Yeah, because he was so awkward."
00:12:17,00:12:19,"They got married really, really quickly,"
00:12:19,00:12:22,"but then it was really obvious very, very quickly"
00:12:22,00:12:24,that they weren't compatible one little bit.
00:12:25,00:12:27,They slept in different rooms as well.
00:12:27,00:12:27,That's another...
00:12:27,00:12:29,"- Well, they tried to sleep in the same room"
00:12:29,00:12:31,"on their honeymoon, as is traditional."
00:12:31,00:12:35,"And it sounds awkward, as is the theme."
00:12:35,00:12:36,So they went on honeymoon in Eastbourne
00:12:36,00:12:39,and she was on her period
00:12:39,00:12:42,and had an embarrassing accident
00:12:42,00:12:45,when they were trying to have their honeymoon moment.
00:12:45,00:12:47,And they were both so incredibly embarrassed
00:12:47,00:12:49,that he went and slept out on a deck chair
00:12:49,00:12:51,outside the hotel for the rest of the week.
00:12:51,00:12:53,And she trashed the hotel room
00:12:53,00:12:56,'cause she was in such a frenzy of embarrassment.
00:12:56,00:12:58,And then she took the sheets away with her
00:12:58,00:13:00,'cause she didn't want the hotel staff to see them.
00:13:00,00:13:02,"But then of course, they just called their home"
00:13:02,00:13:03,"when they got back and said,"
00:13:03,00:13:04,"""You've stolen all of our bedding."""
00:13:04,00:13:07,"Which sort of is more embarrassing, I think."
00:13:07,00:13:09,- Oh dear.
00:13:09,00:13:12,"- But they did also, I think, at that point of the honeymoon."
00:13:12,00:13:16,The honeymoon was meant to be the debut sex fest
00:13:16,00:13:19,because they hadn't had sex as far as I could tell.
00:13:19,00:13:21,It seems that they got married really quickly
00:13:21,00:13:23,because I think he told Ezra Pound
00:13:23,00:13:25,"he said, ""I want to have sex."""
00:13:25,00:13:27,"And then three months later, he was married to her."
00:13:27,00:13:29,So he obviously--
00:13:29,00:13:30,- The debut sex fest.
00:13:30,00:13:30,- The debut sex fest.
00:13:30,00:13:31,(laughing)
00:13:31,00:13:33,"- Yeah, they should rebrand honeymoon."
00:13:33,00:13:35,(laughing)
00:13:35,00:13:38,- Where are you going on your debut sex fest?
00:13:38,00:13:41,"- Oh, we're off to stay with the wolves."
00:13:41,00:13:43,(laughing)
00:13:43,00:13:46,"- Ashley Virginia Woolf said,"
00:13:46,00:13:49,"""Living with Vivian, who was quite mad,"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"""living with Vivian was like having a bag of ferrets"
00:13:51,00:13:53,"""hung around your neck."""
00:13:53,00:13:55,"- She was very troubled, wasn't she?"
00:13:55,00:13:57,"And you know, I think she was,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,was she sectioned at one point when he was away
00:13:59,00:14:01,and she spent the rest of her life in a hospital?
00:14:01,00:14:03,"- Yeah, so he went away to America, didn't he?"
00:14:03,00:14:06,"And then his solicitors sent her a letter saying,"
00:14:06,00:14:09,"""I want a separation,"" rather than him saying it."
00:14:09,00:14:11,"And then when he went back to London,"
00:14:11,00:14:14,she kind of stalked him and would go to his office
00:14:14,00:14:16,and he would always sneak out of the back door
00:14:16,00:14:17,so that she wouldn't see him.
00:14:17,00:14:20,And then she would walk around London with a knife.
00:14:20,00:14:22,"It was like a rubber knife, so it was like a joke."
00:14:22,00:14:24,"She was like, ""I'm trying to find my husband"
00:14:24,00:14:25,"""with this rubber knife."""
00:14:25,00:14:27,"- Wait, did she get it from the same shop"
00:14:27,00:14:29,as the Exploded Cigars and the Wolf Division?
00:14:29,00:14:32,"- Smithy's absolutely clinked up on the Elias, didn't they?"
00:14:32,00:14:34,(laughing)
00:14:34,00:14:37,- And then she joined the British Union of Fascists
00:14:37,00:14:39,"in the late 30s, yeah. - Oh, yes, that's right."
00:14:39,00:14:42,- And she liked to wear the uniform in public.
00:14:42,00:14:44,"- Yeah, 'cause when you hear about the early days"
00:14:44,00:14:47,"of her life, particularly the university years,"
00:14:47,00:14:49,everyone sort of talked about her as being very flamboyant.
00:14:49,00:14:51,"She was a great dancer, she'd always speak her mind."
00:14:51,00:14:54,"She smoked in public, which you wouldn't usually see"
00:14:54,00:14:57,"women doing, she dressed like an actress."
00:14:57,00:15:00,Aldous Huxley said that he really liked hanging out with her
00:15:00,00:15:02,"because she was vulgar, she was just so different,"
00:15:02,00:15:04,she would say what she thought.
00:15:04,00:15:06,And then you get to this fascist period
00:15:06,00:15:09,where suddenly it seems like a totally different character.
00:15:09,00:15:11,"In fact, the last time she ever saw Elliot"
00:15:11,00:15:13,was at one of his book talks
00:15:13,00:15:15,where she went into the audience.
00:15:15,00:15:19,She brought three books with her and she brought her dog
00:15:19,00:15:21,and he signed her books for her
00:15:21,00:15:22,and then went off with someone else.
00:15:22,00:15:23,"It's the weirdest thing,"
00:15:23,00:15:25,it's the last time they ever saw each other.
00:15:25,00:15:26,"- Wow, wow. - Yeah."
00:15:26,00:15:28,"- But still, you know, she got her book signed."
00:15:28,00:15:31,"- She got what she wanted, she got her book signed."
00:15:31,00:15:32,"- But she not, I've just found his signature"
00:15:32,00:15:34,"on the internet, printed it off"
00:15:34,00:15:35,and then stuck it in her book.
00:15:35,00:15:38,"- All right, so you've seen my autograph book too, fine."
00:15:38,00:15:43,"- She did, she tried various ways to get him back."
00:15:43,00:15:46,So one of them seemed to be bringing this dog
00:15:46,00:15:49,"to his book chat, which is a bad idea."
00:15:49,00:15:52,"Another one was putting an advert out in the times, the 1930s."
00:15:52,00:15:54,So she thought there was a sort of a conspiracy
00:15:54,00:15:55,to keep him apart by other people.
00:15:55,00:15:57,"And so she put an ad in the time saying,"
00:15:57,00:15:59,"""Will T.S. Elliot please return to his home"
00:15:59,00:16:02,"""68 Clarence Gate Gardens, which he abandoned"
00:16:02,00:16:04,"""on the September the 17th, 1932."""
00:16:04,00:16:06,- Wow.
00:16:06,00:16:07,- Yeah.
00:16:07,00:16:10,"- Do you know, Elliot himself was really secretive"
00:16:10,00:16:12,about his correspondence.
00:16:12,00:16:14,"In fact, the whole estate has been very secretive"
00:16:14,00:16:16,"since he died, pretty much."
00:16:16,00:16:18,"'Cause his widow was called Valerie,"
00:16:18,00:16:20,he married again much later.
00:16:20,00:16:22,So Peter Eckroyd was trying to write a biography of him
00:16:22,00:16:24,and he was forbidden to quote from any correspondence
00:16:24,00:16:26,or unpublished work.
00:16:26,00:16:27,And he was hardly allowed to quote
00:16:27,00:16:30,even actual published poems of T.S. Elliot's
00:16:30,00:16:32,in this biography of the man.
00:16:32,00:16:34,Elliot destroyed so much correspondence
00:16:34,00:16:36,"that between 1905 and 1910,"
00:16:36,00:16:38,there was just one postcard left by him.
00:16:38,00:16:41,"That's it, that's all there is for those five years."
00:16:41,00:16:43,- What does it say?
00:16:43,00:16:45,"Just, dear mom, really sunny here, hope you're well."
00:16:45,00:16:48,Having a lovely debut sex fest in Yves Bourne.
00:16:48,00:16:51,(upbeat music)
00:16:51,00:16:58,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:16:58,00:17:01,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 2001,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,an artist got lost in Los Angeles
00:17:03,00:17:05,and decided to make his own sign
00:17:05,00:17:08,to stop other people from getting lost in future.
00:17:08,00:17:11,"Not only did it remain unnoticed for more than a year,"
00:17:11,00:17:13,"but when the city was tipped off,"
00:17:13,00:17:15,they found that it met all signage rules
00:17:15,00:17:17,and they kept it in place for eight years.
00:17:17,00:17:19,- It's so charming.
00:17:19,00:17:21,What was the sign saying?
00:17:21,00:17:23,- It said five.
00:17:23,00:17:27,- And the word north as well. - Five more.
00:17:27,00:17:30,So this was a sign to get off a highway
00:17:30,00:17:31,and get onto another highway.
00:17:31,00:17:35,And basically the signpost to tell you where to go
00:17:35,00:17:37,was really close to the ramp.
00:17:37,00:17:39,And really there should have been one a lot further back.
00:17:39,00:17:41,So whenever anyone drove down the 110
00:17:41,00:17:43,"and wanted to get onto the five,"
00:17:43,00:17:45,they would only realize at the last second
00:17:45,00:17:47,that they needed to be in a certain lane
00:17:47,00:17:49,and they would kind of swerve in front of the cars.
00:17:49,00:17:52,"And he was like, well, it's just really dangerous."
00:17:52,00:17:54,"So I'm going to put a five,"
00:17:54,00:17:57,maybe a mile further back or a half mile further back.
00:17:57,00:18:01,And he put it there and he did it in broad daylight.
00:18:01,00:18:03,He just one day he just got a load of ladders
00:18:03,00:18:05,and just went up there and did it.
00:18:05,00:18:08,And it was there and no one noticed.
00:18:08,00:18:10,And I think he tipped them off in the end.
00:18:10,00:18:12,This artist named Richard Angrom.
00:18:12,00:18:15,He tipped off the city in the end and they just kept it there.
00:18:15,00:18:18,And then they decided we're making some new signs now
00:18:18,00:18:20,and we're going to have to take this down.
00:18:20,00:18:23,But actually they put a new five where his five was.
00:18:23,00:18:25,So they took his down and they put a new one up there.
00:18:25,00:18:28,So they kind of tacitly admitted that he was right
00:18:28,00:18:29,that it should have been there.
00:18:29,00:18:31,- He planned it for ages as well.
00:18:31,00:18:33,Like he didn't just go in broad daylight
00:18:33,00:18:35,just dressed as he was.
00:18:35,00:18:37,He absolutely planned the whole thing.
00:18:37,00:18:39,So he had his haircut.
00:18:39,00:18:41,"Not sure why, but he had his haircut."
00:18:41,00:18:42,He bought some work clothes.
00:18:42,00:18:44,He had a hard hat.
00:18:44,00:18:45,He got an orange vest.
00:18:45,00:18:46,He even made--
00:18:46,00:18:46,- The haircut must have been
00:18:46,00:18:48,"to fit inside the hard hat, maybe."
00:18:48,00:18:49,- Possibly.
00:18:49,00:18:51,"- He had a mohican before that, didn't he?"
00:18:51,00:18:54,- And he had his truck.
00:18:54,00:18:56,"He did a thing where, as well as making the signage"
00:18:56,00:18:58,"for the actual sign itself,"
00:18:58,00:19:00,he made signage for the side of his truck
00:19:00,00:19:03,"to match the Caltrans, which is California Transports."
00:19:03,00:19:06,The logos and so on to make it look like he was part of them.
00:19:06,00:19:08,So he was properly planned.
00:19:08,00:19:09,"- And he's an artist, isn't he?"
00:19:09,00:19:12,- And you can tell because he clearly doesn't have a 95 job.
00:19:12,00:19:16,"- He called his piece ""Guerrilla Public Service."""
00:19:16,00:19:18,And I should just say that I got this fact from a book
00:19:18,00:19:22,"called ""The 99% Invisible City,"
00:19:22,00:19:24,"a Field Guide to the Hidden World of Everyday Design"""
00:19:24,00:19:25,by Roman Mars.
00:19:25,00:19:26,And it's a really awesome book
00:19:26,00:19:29,based on the 99% Invisible Podcast.
00:19:29,00:19:32,And it's full of loads of awesome stuff about the streets.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"And if you read it, then you walk down the street"
00:19:34,00:19:35,"and you go, ""Oh, you know why that's there?"
00:19:35,00:19:36,You know why that's there?
00:19:36,00:19:37,"You know why that's there?"""
00:19:37,00:19:38,It's a really cool book.
00:19:38,00:19:39,"- Oh, great."
00:19:39,00:19:40,"He's amazing, Roman Mars."
00:19:40,00:19:42,"- Yeah, we did, 99% Invisible"
00:19:42,00:19:44,did not need any extra advertising from us.
00:19:44,00:19:45,"Yay, cool stuff."
00:19:45,00:19:47,- Not compared with the new book.
00:19:47,00:19:48,Funny you should ask.
00:19:48,00:19:52,It's so cool how people keep doing this around the place.
00:19:52,00:19:54,"And it's kind of all these micro banksies,"
00:19:54,00:19:56,but with particular bug bears.
00:19:56,00:19:59,So there is a thing currently going on in Sheffield
00:19:59,00:20:03,where people are changing noughts on street signs into queues.
00:20:03,00:20:06,And no one really knows why they're doing this.
00:20:06,00:20:07,"- Oh, yeah."
00:20:07,00:20:09,So there is a theory that it's to do with queue and non.
00:20:09,00:20:11,I was wondering if it might do that.
00:20:11,00:20:14,- Which is the insane conspiracy that the USA has run
00:20:14,00:20:18,by Satan worshiping child sacrificing pedophiles.
00:20:18,00:20:20,"But I don't know why in Sheffield,"
00:20:20,00:20:22,people will be changing the street signs.
00:20:22,00:20:24,This will get the word out.
00:20:24,00:20:27,So maybe nothing to do with that.
00:20:27,00:20:30,"- One of the road based public service that people perform,"
00:20:30,00:20:33,"which I think is very cool is in the Czech Republic,"
00:20:33,00:20:36,where a group of Czech nerds basically just saved
00:20:36,00:20:38,the government $18 million.
00:20:38,00:20:39,- What?
00:20:39,00:20:40,- And they did this because there's this guy called
00:20:40,00:20:43,"Tomas Von Dracheck, and he is a businessman."
00:20:43,00:20:44,He runs some tech businesses.
00:20:44,00:20:48,And he found out that the country was about to pay $18 million
00:20:48,00:20:51,to switch their road toll system to a digital system.
00:20:51,00:20:53,And as someone who knows about coding and programming
00:20:53,00:20:55,"and stuff, he was really pissed off."
00:20:55,00:20:56,"He put a post on LinkedIn saying,"
00:20:56,00:20:59,"""This is classic bureaucracy gone mad."
00:20:59,00:21:01,"""This task is simple enough for a group of programmers"
00:21:01,00:21:02,"""to do over a weekend."""
00:21:02,00:21:04,And he just put that on LinkedIn.
00:21:04,00:21:06,"And the prime minister got in touch and was like,"
00:21:06,00:21:07,"""Well, is that true?"
00:21:07,00:21:09,"""And would you mind doing it?"""
00:21:09,00:21:12,"And so he was like, ""All right, I'll ask some friends."""
00:21:12,00:21:15,And he signed up 150 of his programmer friends.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"And over 48 hours, they got together"
00:21:17,00:21:20,and redesigned the whole Czech road system.
00:21:20,00:21:21,And they got like meals brought to them
00:21:21,00:21:24,by members of the public and saved the country.
00:21:24,00:21:26,- That's awesome.
00:21:26,00:21:29,"Speaking of European road stuff and road signs,"
00:21:29,00:21:32,"the big story of this year, as we all know,"
00:21:32,00:21:34,"was the town of fucking,"
00:21:34,00:21:37,"which is in, where is the town of?"
00:21:37,00:21:38,"- Austria? - In Austria, yeah."
00:21:38,00:21:42,And they are sick and tired of all the fucking tourists
00:21:42,00:21:45,"coming over and stealing their road signs, right?"
00:21:45,00:21:47,They really... - They're fucking road signs.
00:21:47,00:21:48,- They're fucking road signs.
00:21:48,00:21:51,So they decided that they were gonna change their name
00:21:51,00:21:55,"to ""fugging"" and they wrote it on it."
00:21:55,00:21:57,And this has happened and the town of fucking
00:21:57,00:21:59,"is now called the town of ""fugging."""
00:21:59,00:22:01,But it hasn't stopped the vandalism
00:22:01,00:22:03,because there's been a whole load of more vandalism
00:22:03,00:22:07,"of people changing the signs back to ""fugging."""
00:22:07,00:22:09,(laughing)
00:22:09,00:22:12,"- ""Fugging"" is objectively a funny-sounding word as well."
00:22:12,00:22:13,And it's quite close to the original.
00:22:13,00:22:16,"They should have changed it to ""gent"" or something."
00:22:16,00:22:17,"- They can't change it to ""gent."""
00:22:17,00:22:20,"There's already a ""gent."" - Well, that'd be confusing."
00:22:20,00:22:22,"- Yeah, something nice sounding like ""gent."""
00:22:22,00:22:24,"Vienna, yeah, exactly Vienna, thank you."
00:22:24,00:22:29,"- In 2017, in China, in the province of Jiangzhou,"
00:22:29,00:22:32,a man was arrested for repainting road signs
00:22:32,00:22:35,in order to make his commute easier.
00:22:35,00:22:37,He was really annoyed being stuck in traffic
00:22:37,00:22:40,in a lane on the motorway and he was caught
00:22:40,00:22:43,on CCTV painting big white paint arrows
00:22:43,00:22:45,to redirect all the cars in his lane
00:22:45,00:22:47,into the lane next to it to stop the traffic.
00:22:47,00:22:48,- That is brilliant.
00:22:48,00:22:50,(laughing)
00:22:50,00:22:53,"But as if he would get out, paint it, get back in"
00:22:53,00:22:55,"and then all the cars would go, ""Whoa!"""
00:22:55,00:22:56,(laughing)
00:22:56,00:22:57,- I couldn't work out for a long...
00:22:57,00:22:58,"When you started saying this,"
00:22:58,00:23:01,I couldn't work out how you would choose road signs
00:23:01,00:23:02,to make your commute easier
00:23:02,00:23:04,'cause I thought he was putting out directions for himself
00:23:04,00:23:06,"like this way, Derek, or whatever."
00:23:06,00:23:07,(laughing)
00:23:07,00:23:08,Which I would love to do.
00:23:08,00:23:11,- Do you know that's a thing that exists in Los Angeles?
00:23:11,00:23:12,This is another thing I read in that book.
00:23:12,00:23:13,- What's that?
00:23:13,00:23:15,"- So if you live in Los Angeles, you would know about this"
00:23:15,00:23:17,but I'd never heard of it before.
00:23:17,00:23:20,"There are these road signs, rectangular yellow road signs"
00:23:20,00:23:22,that just turn up every now and then.
00:23:22,00:23:26,And they tend to be a black arrow with some letters above it
00:23:26,00:23:27,and some letters below and the letters below
00:23:27,00:23:31,are kind of the inverse mirror image of the ones above.
00:23:31,00:23:35,And what these are is their directions to movie sets
00:23:35,00:23:38,or to TV show filming locations.
00:23:38,00:23:40,And when you're in LA and you're filming
00:23:40,00:23:42,"in some kind of parking lot somewhere,"
00:23:42,00:23:43,you'll put these signs up.
00:23:43,00:23:45,"So all the techies will know where to go,"
00:23:45,00:23:48,"all the actors will know where to go, stuff like this."
00:23:48,00:23:50,And obviously the people in LA know what this is
00:23:50,00:23:53,but if you're a tourist and you're kind of looking
00:23:53,00:23:55,"for celebrities and stuff, you just wouldn't know."
00:23:55,00:23:56,"You just see this sign and you think,"
00:23:56,00:23:58,"""Well, it's just nonsense."""
00:23:58,00:24:00,- Also it doesn't say Batman or whatever.
00:24:00,00:24:03,"- No, but what they do is they tend to put words"
00:24:03,00:24:05,that the people in the know would know what it is.
00:24:05,00:24:07,But the people who don't know what it is
00:24:07,00:24:08,wouldn't know what it was.
00:24:08,00:24:10,"For instance, it would say, ""Magnus Rex this way,"
00:24:10,00:24:12,"Magnus Rex this way."""
00:24:12,00:24:15,"And that was the Batman reboot, the Dark Knight Rises."
00:24:15,00:24:17,"So if you saw those signs, you would know"
00:24:17,00:24:18,to go to the Dark Knight Rises.
00:24:18,00:24:20,There were signs for Rasputin.
00:24:20,00:24:22,"So you would think, ""Oh, they're just doing some low budget"
00:24:22,00:24:25,"Russian movie but actually it was for Iron Man 2."""
00:24:25,00:24:27,But that's got a Russian baddie in it.
00:24:27,00:24:28,- Does it?
00:24:28,00:24:29,- Yeah.
00:24:29,00:24:29,- Does it?
00:24:29,00:24:32,- So that's a very tricky clue.
00:24:32,00:24:33,- Iron Curtain Man.
00:24:33,00:24:34,"- Brilliant, isn't he?"
00:24:34,00:24:38,"- Yeah, I think that's what they actually tried calling it."
00:24:38,00:24:39,"- Well, in ancient Rome,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,"they used to have names on road signs, didn't they?"
00:24:41,00:24:44,"I think I read this, that yeah, you used to have,"
00:24:44,00:24:46,"if you had a road sign, whoever built the road"
00:24:46,00:24:47,would have their name on it.
00:24:47,00:24:50,So you could admire the work of this particular person
00:24:50,00:24:52,and then it would have the name as well of the person
00:24:52,00:24:53,who last repaired it.
00:24:53,00:24:55,So it's sort of update on who to thank
00:24:55,00:24:57,for the smoothness of the road.
00:24:57,00:25:00,- It's like these toilets were last checked by signs
00:25:00,00:25:01,that you get in publics.
00:25:01,00:25:03,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:25:03,00:25:06,- So this is kind of about street art
00:25:06,00:25:09,and artists mucking around with things.
00:25:09,00:25:11,So I just thought I'd try and find out a little bit
00:25:11,00:25:14,about Banksy and I'm here to tell you who he is.
00:25:14,00:25:15,"No, I don't know that."
00:25:15,00:25:17,But there was a large theory that did the rounds
00:25:17,00:25:20,that it's Neil Buchanan from Art Attack.
00:25:20,00:25:22,If you remember that from your childhood.
00:25:22,00:25:23,- I do.
00:25:23,00:25:26,- He's very used to large outdoor multimedia installations.
00:25:26,00:25:29,There's lots of good circumstantial evidence.
00:25:29,00:25:31,It got so bad this year that he had to put
00:25:31,00:25:33,"at the top of his website an announcement saying,"
00:25:33,00:25:35,"""Neil Buchanan is not Banksy."
00:25:35,00:25:38,We have been inundated with inquiries over the weekend.
00:25:38,00:25:40,This website does not have the infrastructure
00:25:40,00:25:42,to answer all these inquiries individually.
00:25:42,00:25:46,"We can confirm there is no truth in the rumor whatsoever."""
00:25:46,00:25:48,- Exactly what Banksy would say.
00:25:48,00:25:50,(all laughing)
00:25:50,00:25:51,It's Neil.
00:25:51,00:25:54,So the Museum of Modern Art in New York
00:25:54,00:25:56,has had a few of these over the years.
00:25:56,00:25:59,There was a guy called Harvey Stromberg
00:25:59,00:26:04,who in 1971 decided he wanted an exhibition in MoMA.
00:26:04,00:26:06,But obviously they wouldn't let him
00:26:06,00:26:07,'cause he wasn't very famous.
00:26:07,00:26:09,So what he did was he went in every day
00:26:09,00:26:11,and he would take photos of a light socket
00:26:11,00:26:15,or of a tile on the floor or of a brick on the wall.
00:26:15,00:26:16,He would go home.
00:26:16,00:26:18,He would print it out on his printer
00:26:18,00:26:20,and then he would go in and stick it over
00:26:20,00:26:23,to the exact place where he'd taken the photo from.
00:26:23,00:26:26,"Like a lot of them, they never found them"
00:26:26,00:26:27,for years and years and years.
00:26:27,00:26:28,"Whenever you put one on the floor,"
00:26:28,00:26:29,they would find it on the same day
00:26:29,00:26:32,because they had those kind of buffing machines
00:26:32,00:26:34,that would go around and clean the floor
00:26:34,00:26:35,and they would find them.
00:26:35,00:26:37,But there were some that were just over a brick on the wall
00:26:37,00:26:39,which they didn't find for decades.
00:26:39,00:26:41,- I'm gonna start doing that in my house
00:26:41,00:26:44,"to broken bits of wallpaper and, you know,"
00:26:44,00:26:46,rusting bath handles.
00:26:46,00:26:48,"Just take a photo of a nice bit of wallpaper,"
00:26:48,00:26:48,stick it over.
00:26:49,00:26:52,Have you guys been about the Grammar Vigilantes?
00:26:52,00:26:53,- No.
00:26:53,00:26:58,- So these are people who go around correcting sign posts.
00:26:58,00:27:00,They seem to happen in various countries.
00:27:00,00:27:04,"In Bristol, Bristol has the UK's leading grammar vigilante"
00:27:04,00:27:06,and he specialises in apostrophes.
00:27:06,00:27:11,He began in 2003 when he saw a council sign
00:27:11,00:27:12,which said open Mondays to Fridays
00:27:12,00:27:15,but with apostrophes in both of those words
00:27:15,00:27:17,which obviously is a painful experience.
00:27:17,00:27:20,And so he invented something called the apostrophizer
00:27:20,00:27:24,which is an eight foot long tool
00:27:24,00:27:27,which basically has an apostrophe stamp on the end
00:27:27,00:27:29,so that he can reach the really high signs
00:27:29,00:27:30,and insert the apostrophe.
00:27:30,00:27:32,And he doesn't like to do damage
00:27:32,00:27:34,so he built his own specially made step ladder
00:27:34,00:27:36,so it didn't have to be lent up against shops.
00:27:36,00:27:39,- How much damage is he doing with a normal step ladder?
00:27:39,00:27:40,You're using the step ladder wrong
00:27:40,00:27:43,if every time you're taken away from the building
00:27:43,00:27:44,bricks fall out of it.
00:27:46,00:27:48,"- Yeah, he's not a step ladder pro."
00:27:48,00:27:51,"- I've got a couple of things just on signs,"
00:27:51,00:27:51,general signs.
00:27:51,00:27:54,"So firstly, I found it quite amazing"
00:27:54,00:27:57,that signs played quite an important role
00:27:57,00:27:59,during World War II in the UK
00:27:59,00:28:01,in that there was a message that went around
00:28:01,00:28:03,to a lot of people to remove the signs
00:28:03,00:28:05,so that if any Germans were coming over
00:28:05,00:28:07,they'd be confused and have no idea where to go.
00:28:07,00:28:10,So people encouraged us to take them down
00:28:10,00:28:13,"and people would arrive, not know where they're going"
00:28:13,00:28:16,but on the flip side there was also a movement by Hitler
00:28:16,00:28:19,to change signs around so you would send people to the rock.
00:28:19,00:28:21,Apparently that's a thing that was attempted.
00:28:21,00:28:23,I don't know how successful it was.
00:28:23,00:28:25,So it must have just been very confusing driving around
00:28:25,00:28:26,in World War II.
00:28:26,00:28:28,- It sounds like your sauce for this is dad's army.
00:28:28,00:28:29,- Yeah.
00:28:29,00:28:32,- That's amazing.
00:28:32,00:28:36,- If you are a Hitler and you've got spies on the ground
00:28:36,00:28:37,"during the Second World War,"
00:28:37,00:28:40,I would definitely want to know about troop movements
00:28:40,00:28:41,and the state of the country's defense
00:28:41,00:28:44,is more than misdirecting people to their local church
00:28:44,00:28:46,or whatever the signs are for.
00:28:46,00:28:49,- Getting a commuter lost on his way home for tea.
00:28:49,00:28:52,"Well, this is why they lost the war, Andy."
00:28:52,00:28:55,It was definitely a sign of resistance in Norway
00:28:55,00:28:58,when the fascists took over Norway.
00:28:58,00:29:00,A very subtle sign of resistance was apparently
00:29:00,00:29:03,you often gave Nazis incorrect directions
00:29:03,00:29:04,when they asked the way for somewhere.
00:29:04,00:29:06,That was a signal that you were on the good guy's side.
00:29:06,00:29:08,- And they can't find their way back to you
00:29:08,00:29:08,'cause they're lost.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"So that's actually pretty effective, yeah."
00:29:10,00:29:13,- Have you ever given someone wrong directions
00:29:13,00:29:15,"in London, for instance, like a tourist"
00:29:15,00:29:17,"and then realized afterwards that you've done it,"
00:29:17,00:29:19,you didn't do it on purpose.
00:29:19,00:29:20,"And then you realize, you think,"
00:29:20,00:29:22,"""Oh, fuck, I've just sent them to the wrong place."""
00:29:22,00:29:25,"That is one of the worst feelings in the world, isn't it?"
00:29:25,00:29:26,- It's bad.
00:29:26,00:29:28,"But if you suspect that they're a foreign spy,"
00:29:28,00:29:31,"then it's actually nothing to do with it, yeah."
00:29:31,00:29:34,- They were a leftover Nazi still plugging away
00:29:34,00:29:35,80 years later.
00:29:42,00:29:44,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:29:44,00:29:47,and that is Andy.
00:29:47,00:29:51,- My fact is that King Edward III owned a Yeti mask.
00:29:51,00:29:55,"So, riddle me that."
00:29:55,00:29:58,"Okay, so, I've said Yeti mask."
00:29:58,00:30:00,"There is a creature in English mythology,"
00:30:00,00:30:02,"which I think is kind of close,"
00:30:02,00:30:03,sort of analogous to the Yeti.
00:30:03,00:30:06,"Basically, these were things called woodwoses,"
00:30:06,00:30:08,and they were wild men who lived in the woods.
00:30:08,00:30:11,"They were big, they were not civilized,"
00:30:11,00:30:12,they were covered in hair.
00:30:12,00:30:14,They weren't really human from all the depictions of them.
00:30:14,00:30:16,They crop up a lot in medieval manuscripts
00:30:16,00:30:17,and things like that.
00:30:17,00:30:19,"Normally, kind of trying to carry women off,"
00:30:19,00:30:21,and then a knight has to turn up and save the day
00:30:21,00:30:22,and kill the woodwose.
00:30:22,00:30:25,"And in Edward III's accounts,"
00:30:25,00:30:26,they have these wardrobe accounts
00:30:26,00:30:29,which list everything that the king bought.
00:30:29,00:30:33,"From 1348 AD, there is Capita de Woodwose,"
00:30:33,00:30:36,which is the head of a woodwose.
00:30:36,00:30:38,"In fact, before it, there is XIV,"
00:30:38,00:30:39,which is 14 of Roman numerals.
00:30:39,00:30:41,I don't think that means he bought 14 of them.
00:30:41,00:30:43,I really hope it was.
00:30:43,00:30:45,"- Could be, yeah. - It was that."
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Yeah, so this is a woodwose."
00:30:46,00:30:49,"- He really liked, he's from the 14th century,"
00:30:49,00:30:51,"Edward III, right?"
00:30:51,00:30:53,He really enjoyed doing like tournaments
00:30:53,00:30:55,and jousts and stuff like that.
00:30:55,00:30:57,"And according to one paper I read,"
00:30:57,00:30:59,"so this is by a guy called A. Chester Beattie,"
00:30:59,00:31:03,who was like an American billionaire who became a historian.
00:31:03,00:31:05,He reckons that Edward might have used the mask
00:31:05,00:31:07,for one of his Christmas tournaments
00:31:07,00:31:10,so that maybe people would be jousting
00:31:10,00:31:12,with a woodwose head on.
00:31:12,00:31:14,"So it might have been like, you know, like the masked singer,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,"where people are kind of jousting,"
00:31:16,00:31:17,"but they're in masks and stuff,"
00:31:17,00:31:20,"because there was also a Capita elefantum,"
00:31:20,00:31:23,"a Capita virginum, a Capita leonum,"
00:31:23,00:31:24,and a Capita signorum.
00:31:24,00:31:27,"So in his wardrobe, he had an elephant head,"
00:31:27,00:31:30,"a virgin's head, a lion's head, and a swan's head."
00:31:30,00:31:32,- A virgin's head. - A virgin's head.
00:31:32,00:31:33,- The virgin's chances in this fight
00:31:33,00:31:35,between several wild animals.
00:31:35,00:31:37,(laughing)
00:31:37,00:31:38,How can you tell a virgin's head?
00:31:38,00:31:40,"I mean, the hymen's not on the head."
00:31:40,00:31:42,What's gonna give it away?
00:31:42,00:31:44,"Just on Edward's royal wardrobe,"
00:31:44,00:31:46,"he did have pretty lavish taste,"
00:31:46,00:31:50,"so this might be the same year as the woodwose costume,"
00:31:50,00:31:52,"but in 1337 to 38,"
00:31:52,00:31:56,the clerk of his wardrobe ordered these huge amounts
00:31:56,00:31:58,of like cloth and yarn and full bull's hides
00:31:58,00:32:00,"and loads of gold leaf,"
00:32:00,00:32:05,and also 86 plain masks and 12 masks with long beards.
00:32:05,00:32:07,"And this was preparation for the King's Games,"
00:32:07,00:32:08,which they had every year.
00:32:08,00:32:09,"And along with that,"
00:32:09,00:32:12,"they built an entire fake forest,"
00:32:12,00:32:14,"so out of timber and paint and everything,"
00:32:14,00:32:15,"a massive fake forest,"
00:32:15,00:32:18,"and then they made loads of linen baboons,"
00:32:18,00:32:21,and they sort of dropped all these linen baboons
00:32:21,00:32:22,"into the forest,"
00:32:22,00:32:25,and they sewed the baboons into tunics
00:32:25,00:32:27,with sort of pearls and hoes and gloves
00:32:27,00:32:28,and caps on them and everything.
00:32:28,00:32:30,So they were wearing the proper gear
00:32:30,00:32:31,'cause they're in the royal household.
00:32:31,00:32:33,And then I guess they galloped through the fake forest
00:32:33,00:32:35,and hunted down linen baboons.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"- Oh my God, that sounds amazing."
00:32:37,00:32:39,"A lot of this was because,"
00:32:39,00:32:43,"so Edward was married to Philippa of Hainult, right?"
00:32:43,00:32:45,And they were very young when they got married.
00:32:45,00:32:47,And so there was a regency period
00:32:47,00:32:50,"where Isabella was looking after the country,"
00:32:50,00:32:53,"who was Edward's mother, right?"
00:32:53,00:32:54,Isabella.
00:32:54,00:32:58,"So Isabella kept Philippa and Edward in real punery,"
00:32:58,00:33:01,like she wouldn't give them much money to do anything.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"They kind of had to live their life almost,"
00:33:03,00:33:06,"not as normal people, but as normal rich people."
00:33:06,00:33:09,"But then when they became king and queen proper,"
00:33:09,00:33:11,they just really went for it.
00:33:11,00:33:13,And Philippa of Hainult just spent so much money
00:33:13,00:33:18,on all these incredibly lavish clothes and jewels.
00:33:18,00:33:22,"And by 1360, they owed about 16,000 pounds"
00:33:22,00:33:25,to various different clothing embroiderers
00:33:25,00:33:27,and tailors and furriers.
00:33:27,00:33:29,And that's a couple of million pounds in today's terms
00:33:29,00:33:32,that they owed to these people.
00:33:32,00:33:34,"And I was reading about like one robe that she had,"
00:33:34,00:33:38,which required 952 ventures.
00:33:38,00:33:39,And I didn't know what a ventra was.
00:33:39,00:33:41,Apparently it's the fur that you get
00:33:41,00:33:43,from the belly of a red squirrel.
00:33:43,00:33:48,So they had to get 952 squirrels for this one robe.
00:33:48,00:33:50,"It's like, whoa."
00:33:50,00:33:52,- Is the whole blaming the gray squirrels thing?
00:33:52,00:33:54,Were they a scapegoat that these guys created
00:33:54,00:33:56,'cause they actually caused red squirrels
00:33:56,00:33:57,to go almost extinct?
00:33:57,00:33:59,"- Maybe, yeah."
00:33:59,00:34:00,- He really went bust later on.
00:34:00,00:34:03,Edward III had to pawn off the crown jewels
00:34:03,00:34:05,so that he could raise money.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"He didn't have a, yeah."
00:34:07,00:34:09,But he pawned off the great crown of England
00:34:09,00:34:11,to Simon de Mirabello.
00:34:11,00:34:13,- Wow.
00:34:13,00:34:15,"- Just one thing that he did own,"
00:34:15,00:34:18,"which is quite similar to something that Dan owns,"
00:34:18,00:34:23,is he had a Yeti mug in as much as he had a silver cup
00:34:23,00:34:26,that was decorated with Wodewozes.
00:34:26,00:34:29,"So if we're saying that there was a Yeti's,"
00:34:29,00:34:31,then he had a Yeti mug.
00:34:31,00:34:32,"- I think Dan will,"
00:34:32,00:34:35,"Dan, you've been keeping a very polite diplomatic silence"
00:34:35,00:34:36,about whether they're Yetis or not.
00:34:36,00:34:39,I'm pretty sure Dan thinks they're not Yetis.
00:34:39,00:34:41,"- They absolutely aren't Yetis, yeah."
00:34:41,00:34:43,- It's a completely different species.
00:34:43,00:34:45,- Completely different species.
00:34:45,00:34:50,"Before we get into me absolutely ripping Andy over that,"
00:34:50,00:34:53,"just sticking on Edward III for a second,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,he's an interesting character that I hadn't heard of him
00:34:55,00:34:56,"as a king, have to say."
00:34:56,00:34:57,"Again, I'm not British,"
00:34:57,00:34:59,so he's very far back.
00:34:59,00:35:00,"- But you've heard of, you know,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,"Edward's the fifth and sixth,"
00:35:02,00:35:05,presumably you knew that a third must have happened before.
00:35:05,00:35:07,"- Yeah, I've got all the other in the trilogy of Edwards,"
00:35:07,00:35:12,"but I've not seen that one, unfortunately."
00:35:12,00:35:14,"- No, it went downhill actually."
00:35:14,00:35:17,"- Yeah, so it's interesting in that all of us"
00:35:17,00:35:18,are probably related to him.
00:35:18,00:35:21,He's one of those guys where they've done a few reports
00:35:21,00:35:23,where they say there's a 99% chance
00:35:23,00:35:25,"that if you are of British origin,"
00:35:25,00:35:28,"if you were born and your family was through this period,"
00:35:28,00:35:29,you are directly related to him.
00:35:29,00:35:33,"So all of us are his great, great, great, great grandchildren,"
00:35:33,00:35:36,"but also he created something that still goes on today,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,"which is also connected to clothing,"
00:35:38,00:35:41,which is the chivalry Knights of the Garter.
00:35:41,00:35:44,And the garter itself is literally a garter
00:35:44,00:35:45,which you would wear.
00:35:45,00:35:48,There's a story that he was at some dance
00:35:48,00:35:51,and he was dancing with the Countess of Salisbury
00:35:51,00:35:53,"and the garter, and this is one of the stories,"
00:35:53,00:35:55,"there's many stories, but the story is is that"
00:35:55,00:35:57,the garter slipped down her leg
00:35:57,00:36:00,"and everyone started laughing, but he got very furious"
00:36:00,00:36:02,"and he yelled, ""Shame on him who thinks ill of it,"""
00:36:02,00:36:04,about the situation.
00:36:04,00:36:07,"And that is the motto of the Knights of the Garter,"
00:36:07,00:36:08,"""Shame on him who thinks ill of it."""
00:36:08,00:36:13,"And that is a garter that became the code for these knights,"
00:36:13,00:36:15,which is a thing still going on today.
00:36:15,00:36:17,"In fact, there's over a thousand Knights of the Garter now,"
00:36:17,00:36:19,"the thousandth of which was Prince William,"
00:36:19,00:36:22,"which is a very convenient number to land on, yeah."
00:36:22,00:36:24,"- Yeah, who had to fill in those last 20?"
00:36:24,00:36:26,Was it just 20 folks wandering past?
00:36:26,00:36:28,- Do you think that they rushed through a load
00:36:28,00:36:30,"to get to a thousand, or do you think a load of people"
00:36:30,00:36:32,"weren't allowed to become for like 30 years,"
00:36:32,00:36:33,they weren't allowed to do it?
00:36:33,00:36:35,"- Yeah, interestingly, it's the two princes,"
00:36:35,00:36:36,"it's Andrew and Edward,"
00:36:36,00:36:38,"and then it's meant to be William next,"
00:36:38,00:36:40,"but they just slipped in an MP in between,"
00:36:40,00:36:43,so there's one guy just taking up 999.
00:36:43,00:36:45,- Genuinely at 999.
00:36:45,00:36:50,"- Anyway, Woodwosers, Andy, you fucking idiot."
00:36:50,00:36:52,(all laughing)
00:36:52,00:36:55,"They are Yetis, then, they're the British Yeti."
00:36:55,00:36:56,"- Wow. - And this is, okay,"
00:36:56,00:36:57,this is the real thing.
00:36:57,00:37:01,I think they may have a kind of relationship
00:37:01,00:37:02,"with the real history in that,"
00:37:02,00:37:04,"obviously they're mythical, these Wordwosers,"
00:37:04,00:37:06,"they're not, they don't exist,"
00:37:06,00:37:08,"but after the Norman conquest,"
00:37:08,00:37:10,"you did for many years,"
00:37:10,00:37:12,"you got gangs of wild men living savage in the woods,"
00:37:12,00:37:14,"the swamps, they were social outcasts,"
00:37:14,00:37:15,"they were criminalized,"
00:37:15,00:37:20,"so that is a possible origin point for this story,"
00:37:20,00:37:22,sort of wild man living in the woods.
00:37:22,00:37:23,There are lots of medieval churches
00:37:23,00:37:26,"which have Woodwosers in their stones,"
00:37:26,00:37:28,and so there's this weird kind of relationship
00:37:28,00:37:32,"between local myth and newer Christian traditions,"
00:37:32,00:37:33,that kind of thing.
00:37:33,00:37:36,"- Well, even great scientific minds, actually,"
00:37:36,00:37:38,"for a while thought that these were real,"
00:37:38,00:37:39,"and they didn't think it was a separate species,"
00:37:39,00:37:42,"they thought it was someone, as you say, went wild,"
00:37:42,00:37:44,"became wild, had children that were wild,"
00:37:44,00:37:47,and they grew up as a sort of subspecies
00:37:47,00:37:49,that knew nothing but the wild.
00:37:49,00:37:52,"In fact, the person who gave us the name Homo sapiens,"
00:37:52,00:37:55,"he had Linnaeus, that was Linnaeus who did that,"
00:37:55,00:37:57,"and one of the categories was Homo ferris,"
00:37:57,00:38:00,"which was these wild people, and he was convinced,"
00:38:00,00:38:01,"and that's been dropped since,"
00:38:01,00:38:05,"we don't talk about his Homo ferris group,"
00:38:05,00:38:08,"there's a few, but he believed that there were wolf boys,"
00:38:08,00:38:11,"or feral children, that were abandoned by lost parents,"
00:38:11,00:38:13,"and subsequently raised by wolves,"
00:38:13,00:38:15,"that's the actual wolves, not Virginia wolf's family,"
00:38:15,00:38:20,and there's lots of legends like Romulus in Rome and Remus
00:38:20,00:38:22,who were suckled by a she-wolf.
00:38:22,00:38:25,"- And there was a belief that they sort of naturally grew hair,"
00:38:25,00:38:27,"I think, in the forest to protect themselves,"
00:38:27,00:38:28,"'cause they were living the elements, wasn't there?"
00:38:28,00:38:31,"- That's right, I quite like that Romulus and Remus"
00:38:31,00:38:34,"were suckled by a she-wolf, because Edward III,"
00:38:34,00:38:38,"who wore a woad-woose, was suckled by a she-wolf as well."
00:38:38,00:38:39,"- No, he wasn't."
00:38:39,00:38:41,"- Was he? - Yeah, that's what his mother"
00:38:41,00:38:42,"was known as, the she-wolf."
00:38:42,00:38:46,"- Oh, very fair, yeah, don't ever switch a roux."
00:38:46,00:38:49,- These tenuous links to animal themes.
00:38:49,00:38:51,"- Aw, that was a great one, Dan,"
00:38:51,00:38:53,don't let the bump around that.
00:38:53,00:38:55,- TS Eliot would have rejected that for publication.
00:38:55,00:38:56,- Come on.
00:38:56,00:39:00,"- You know, woad-wooses and wild men and stuff like that"
00:39:00,00:39:03,"are in one very famous historical poem,"
00:39:03,00:39:05,"seeing as we're talking about TS Eliot,"
00:39:05,00:39:08,"and that is the 14th century romance poem,"
00:39:08,00:39:11,"""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,"""
00:39:11,00:39:13,"and according to that poem,"
00:39:13,00:39:15,"the woad-wooses in the UK,"
00:39:15,00:39:17,"they live on the Wirral Peninsula,"
00:39:17,00:39:19,which is just outside Liverpool.
00:39:19,00:39:22,"According to this poem,"
00:39:22,00:39:23,"""In the wilderness of Wirral,"
00:39:23,00:39:25,"dwelt there but few,"
00:39:25,00:39:27,"that God or man with good heart loved."""
00:39:27,00:39:30,"And it is basically, this was such a wild west,"
00:39:30,00:39:32,"wooded, crazy area,"
00:39:32,00:39:34,that this is where you would get these wild men living.
00:39:34,00:39:36,- It's a little known fact that if the Beatles
00:39:36,00:39:39,"didn't shave meticulously every day,"
00:39:39,00:39:41,it would be covered in air from head to toe.
00:39:41,00:39:44,The other stuff that Gawain fights
00:39:44,00:39:47,"in ""Gawain and the Green Knight"" is quite odd."
00:39:47,00:39:50,So the Green Knight himself is a kind of woad-woaser
00:39:50,00:39:52,"in the, like Tolkien does a translation"
00:39:52,00:39:54,"where he translates the Green Knight as being a woad-woaser,"
00:39:54,00:39:56,"and they were often green men as well,"
00:39:56,00:39:59,were another mythical wild man.
00:39:59,00:40:03,"But Gawain also fights in that chivalric myth,"
00:40:03,00:40:06,"Wormers, which are dragons."
00:40:06,00:40:07,Dragons were called worms.
00:40:07,00:40:08,- Really?
00:40:08,00:40:09,- I think that's a huge promotion.
00:40:09,00:40:11,We've given dragons that they were worms.
00:40:11,00:40:13,"People, worms, wolves and word-woats."
00:40:13,00:40:15,And the reason I'm saying it weirdly
00:40:15,00:40:17,"is because every time it's spelled, it's spelled differently."
00:40:17,00:40:20,"So you can say word-a-woaz-a-ward-a-ward-a-woaz-a,"
00:40:20,00:40:21,any way you like.
00:40:21,00:40:21,"- It is when, isn't it?"
00:40:21,00:40:25,"And one of the spelling is water house,"
00:40:25,00:40:27,which is where PG Woodhouse gets his name.
00:40:27,00:40:29,"- So cool. - That is amazing, isn't it?"
00:40:29,00:40:32,- PG Woodhouse has descended from Yeti's.
00:40:32,00:40:34,"- Dan, do you agree with that?"
00:40:34,00:40:35,"- I do, but for different theories."
00:40:36,00:40:38,(laughing)
00:40:38,00:40:41,"- You guys know, you do remember John Falstoff?"
00:40:41,00:40:44,"We've mentioned him before, friend of the podcast."
00:40:44,00:40:46,He was maybe the inspiration for Falstoff.
00:40:46,00:40:49,"- He was, and he was there at the Battle of Agincourt"
00:40:49,00:40:52,"and stuff, and he was there when Joan of Arc came"
00:40:52,00:40:54,into Paris and all that kind of stuff.
00:40:54,00:40:56,"- Yeah, he had a big old tapestry"
00:40:56,00:40:58,with word-woaz in his hall.
00:40:58,00:41:00,"Yeah, so they were big."
00:41:00,00:41:02,"- Well, you also said they appear quite a lot"
00:41:02,00:41:05,in architecture and cathedrals and stuff.
00:41:05,00:41:08,"One example of where word-woaz, or in fact, green men,"
00:41:08,00:41:10,"the sort of descendant of word-woaz appears,"
00:41:10,00:41:12,is Norwich Cathedral.
00:41:12,00:41:15,"And that is 'cause they were very common in roof bosses,"
00:41:15,00:41:17,"which we know a lot about, 'cause they featured heavily"
00:41:17,00:41:20,in our last year's book of the year 2019.
00:41:20,00:41:23,"And that's why, if you remember, in Norwich Cathedral,"
00:41:23,00:41:27,they erected a helter-skelter that you could climb up
00:41:27,00:41:30,last year so you could get a better view of the roof bosses.
00:41:30,00:41:32,"And I mentioned it 'cause I love that reference,"
00:41:32,00:41:35,"who was the guy who decided to put the slide in,"
00:41:35,00:41:38,"and he was inspired when he visited the Sistine Chapel,"
00:41:38,00:41:40,"and the thing he thought, as he looked over the ceiling"
00:41:40,00:41:43,"of the Sistine Chapel, was that Norwich Cathedral's"
00:41:43,00:41:45,"decorations were every bit as wonderful,"
00:41:45,00:41:48,but just too high up to be appreciated.
00:41:48,00:41:50,- Yes.
00:41:50,00:41:52,"The Sistine Chapel, they have recently,"
00:41:52,00:41:54,'cause it's such a pain to look up constantly.
00:41:54,00:41:57,You get a kind of crick in your neck if you're in there
00:41:57,00:41:59,"and you're always having to, you know, crane your neck up."
00:41:59,00:42:01,"So they, I think, have just installed swings"
00:42:01,00:42:05,so that you get a really good view of that thing.
00:42:05,00:42:08,(all laughing)
00:42:08,00:42:10,"- Oh, I was with you for so much of that."
00:42:10,00:42:12,(upbeat music)
00:42:12,00:42:18,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:42:18,00:42:21,and that is N.
00:42:21,00:42:23,- My fact this week is that there's a single termite home
00:42:23,00:42:27,in Brazil that's the same size as Great Britain.
00:42:27,00:42:30,"- Wow, that's astonishing."
00:42:30,00:42:30,- It's a big home.
00:42:30,00:42:33,"It's not, I don't think a home, yeah."
00:42:33,00:42:35,I'm gonna preempt to James.
00:42:35,00:42:37,(all laughing)
00:42:37,00:42:38,"- Right, I wanna say it."
00:42:38,00:42:40,"- No, stop it, shut your mouth."
00:42:40,00:42:43,It's not a single termite.
00:42:43,00:42:46,"It's a single home, but it is more than one termite"
00:42:46,00:42:47,living there.
00:42:47,00:42:50,"- Since the kids of left were rattling around the place,"
00:42:50,00:42:52,"it's the size of Great Britain,"
00:42:52,00:42:55,and I'm the size of a grain of rice.
00:42:55,00:42:59,- The bedroom tax has taken it as tall on these termites.
00:42:59,00:43:01,- This is just incredible.
00:43:01,00:43:02,"It was only confirmed a couple of years ago,"
00:43:02,00:43:05,only sort of discovered a couple of years ago
00:43:05,00:43:08,when they've been clearing this pasture in Brazil
00:43:08,00:43:11,"for agriculture and stuff for 20 or 30 years,"
00:43:11,00:43:15,"and people started noticing there were a lot of mounds around,"
00:43:15,00:43:17,"and eventually, 2018,"
00:43:17,00:43:19,someone decided to do a proper study of it
00:43:19,00:43:20,and survey of it.
00:43:20,00:43:23,They realized there are 200 million termite mounds.
00:43:23,00:43:25,These piles of excavated termite dirt
00:43:25,00:43:27,spread across something the size of Great Britain.
00:43:27,00:43:30,"So all across Brazil, and no one had really noticed before,"
00:43:30,00:43:32,'cause then the people who lived there knew
00:43:32,00:43:34,that there were these termite mounds kind of scattered about.
00:43:34,00:43:36,"- It wasn't that a scientist came along,"
00:43:36,00:43:38,"and he went, ""What are these massive mounds doing?"""
00:43:38,00:43:39,"They went, ""What? Oh my God."""
00:43:39,00:43:41,(laughing)
00:43:41,00:43:42,- It wasn't quite that.
00:43:42,00:43:45,"- Because their termite mounds are quite solid,"
00:43:45,00:43:46,"they would just build their houses around them,"
00:43:46,00:43:47,wouldn't they?
00:43:47,00:43:49,"They would, you know, they'd be in your garden,"
00:43:49,00:43:51,"and you'd like turn it into a barbecue or something,"
00:43:51,00:43:53,or you sit on-- - Slides.
00:43:53,00:43:55,- You could put a slide down it for their kids.
00:43:55,00:43:56,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:43:56,00:43:57,"- It's amazing as well, isn't it?"
00:43:57,00:43:59,Because it's a single termite species
00:43:59,00:44:00,"that's been working on this,"
00:44:00,00:44:03,and they've looked into the amount of soil
00:44:03,00:44:05,that they've managed to excavate
00:44:05,00:44:06,"that sits on top of the earth,"
00:44:06,00:44:08,and they say that it's equivalent
00:44:08,00:44:10,"to 4,000 Great Pyramids of Giza."
00:44:10,00:44:13,It's the amount that they've managed in all these years.
00:44:13,00:44:14,- Amazing. - Yeah.
00:44:14,00:44:14,- It's extraordinary.
00:44:14,00:44:18,"- And some of them are as old as the pyramids,"
00:44:18,00:44:21,"so all of these are at least 700 years old,"
00:44:21,00:44:22,"give or take, a few years,"
00:44:22,00:44:25,"and they're up to 3,800 years old,"
00:44:25,00:44:27,and that's just from the 11
00:44:27,00:44:29,that they've properly studied the age of so far.
00:44:29,00:44:31,"So some of them could be way older than that,"
00:44:31,00:44:33,but that is roughly the age of a lot of pyramids.
00:44:33,00:44:34,"- Yeah, no, they've said it,"
00:44:34,00:44:37,"that's actually the minimum estimate of their range,"
00:44:37,00:44:39,"and it's like 4,000 years old is the minimum."
00:44:39,00:44:41,It might be twice as old as that
00:44:41,00:44:42,from what they've studied so far.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"And like you say, it is one family,"
00:44:44,00:44:46,'cause they thought that it must be
00:44:46,00:44:49,"lots of different species of termites that are rivals,"
00:44:49,00:44:51,but they took a bunch of termites from one pile of dirt
00:44:51,00:44:54,"and then put them with a bunch of termites from another,"
00:44:54,00:44:55,"and you'd expect them to always fight,"
00:44:55,00:44:59,"and they got along like family, like a happy family."
00:44:59,00:45:03,"And so they basically proved that this is just one home,"
00:45:03,00:45:04,one family house. - So cool.
00:45:04,00:45:07,Do you know how they found out how old they are?
00:45:07,00:45:08,This is quite cool.
00:45:08,00:45:10,What they did was they dug into the bottom
00:45:10,00:45:12,"of one of these piles of earth,"
00:45:12,00:45:13,"and they took out a little bit of earth,"
00:45:13,00:45:15,"and there's a technique which is really complicated,"
00:45:15,00:45:16,"so I won't go into it,"
00:45:16,00:45:19,but you can kind of fire lasers at this earth
00:45:19,00:45:21,"and look at what happens to the electrons,"
00:45:21,00:45:25,and you work out the last time that it was exposed to sunlight.
00:45:25,00:45:27,So they can just work.
00:45:27,00:45:28,It's so clever.
00:45:28,00:45:29,"It's like carbon dating,"
00:45:29,00:45:32,"but for things that have not been alive,"
00:45:32,00:45:33,"and you just fire your little lasers at it,"
00:45:33,00:45:37,and it'll tell you when the last time it was in the sun.
00:45:37,00:45:39,"- Oh, that's so cool. - It's so clever."
00:45:39,00:45:40,- We're so clever.
00:45:40,00:45:42,"We're here talking about how clever these termites are,"
00:45:42,00:45:44,"but look at us, kicking ass."
00:45:44,00:45:46,"- When we say we, it is the scientist,"
00:45:46,00:45:48,"because when I say it's complicated,"
00:45:48,00:45:49,I don't wanna go into it.
00:45:49,00:45:51,Partly it's because I don't really understand it.
00:45:51,00:45:53,(laughing)
00:45:53,00:45:54,- We can take credit.
00:45:54,00:45:56,I bet there were just two termite architects
00:45:56,00:45:57,"that built this whole thing,"
00:45:57,00:45:59,"but the rest of the termites are going,"
00:45:59,00:46:01,"""God, we're impressive, aren't we?"""
00:46:01,00:46:02,"- That's right, yeah."
00:46:02,00:46:04,- You take credit for your species.
00:46:04,00:46:07,- But they're not even proper mounds
00:46:07,00:46:08,like other termites built.
00:46:08,00:46:12,So some termites build sort of chimneys or ventilation things.
00:46:12,00:46:14,These were just described by the scientists
00:46:14,00:46:17,"who worked on this project as slag piles,"
00:46:17,00:46:19,because they live underground.
00:46:19,00:46:21,All it is is they're making space
00:46:21,00:46:22,"for their chambers underground,"
00:46:22,00:46:24,"so they make a vertical hole to the surface,"
00:46:24,00:46:26,"and then they just chuck the soil out of those holes,"
00:46:26,00:46:29,"and over time that builds up into, however tall these are,"
00:46:29,00:46:31,"two meters, two and a half meters."
00:46:31,00:46:33,"I mean, imagine what's underground,"
00:46:33,00:46:36,this huge cathedral space that they emptied out.
00:46:36,00:46:39,"- Yeah, and they were first discovered by a few scientists,"
00:46:39,00:46:41,"but one in particular, a guy called Stephen Martin,"
00:46:41,00:46:44,"who's an entomologist at the University of Salthard,"
00:46:44,00:46:46,and he doesn't even care about termites.
00:46:46,00:46:50,He is an expert in giant killer hornets.
00:46:50,00:46:51,- Is it me?
00:46:51,00:46:53,- The things that actually we should just call
00:46:53,00:46:55,"giant hornets these days, just big old hornets."
00:46:55,00:46:56,We're not supposed to call them killer hornets.
00:46:56,00:46:57,- Murder hornets.
00:46:57,00:46:58,"- Murder hornets, we're not supposed to say that."
00:46:58,00:46:59,"But he's an expert in those guys,"
00:46:59,00:47:03,"and he was in Brazil looking for some bees,"
00:47:03,00:47:05,because he wanted to see how the bees
00:47:05,00:47:07,"were getting on in Brazil,"
00:47:07,00:47:08,"and then as he was going down the road,"
00:47:08,00:47:10,"he was like, wait a minute, what are those?"
00:47:10,00:47:13,"What are those things, and why are they so regular,"
00:47:13,00:47:14,and why are they in like a pattern?
00:47:14,00:47:16,And that was when they worked out
00:47:16,00:47:19,that it was all this same species.
00:47:19,00:47:20,"- Actually, it's worth saying,"
00:47:20,00:47:21,"I don't know if this has been mentioned,"
00:47:21,00:47:23,"or even if it's assumed by the listener,"
00:47:23,00:47:26,but they're still building these mounds.
00:47:26,00:47:27,This is an active house.
00:47:27,00:47:30,"It's not dead, it's not like a fossilized,"
00:47:30,00:47:32,old abandoned Great Britain.
00:47:32,00:47:34,It's an active thing.
00:47:34,00:47:35,- Yeah.
00:47:35,00:47:37,"- It's an extraordinary house, it's a Great Britain, sorry."
00:47:37,00:47:38,"- Not enough there, are they, Andy?"
00:47:38,00:47:39,"- No, no, no."
00:47:39,00:47:44,"- So termites are pretty incredible,"
00:47:44,00:47:46,and possibly the most incredible termite
00:47:46,00:47:47,is the queen.
00:47:47,00:47:48,"So they've got a queen-based structure,"
00:47:48,00:47:50,like bees and other species.
00:47:50,00:47:51,- And England.
00:47:51,00:47:54,"- And England, and much like in England,"
00:47:54,00:47:57,the termite queen is the only fertile member.
00:47:57,00:48:02,"And so she is super fertile, the termite, I mean,"
00:48:02,00:48:05,and she basically spends her entire life
00:48:05,00:48:06,incessantly mating.
00:48:06,00:48:10,"So she chooses a male to mate with,"
00:48:10,00:48:12,"and then she spends the subsequent 15 to 20,"
00:48:12,00:48:15,"sometimes years, constantly shagging him,"
00:48:15,00:48:17,and she'll make one egg every three seconds.
00:48:17,00:48:18,"So in her lifetime,"
00:48:18,00:48:20,"she makes over a quarter of a billion eggs,"
00:48:20,00:48:22,it's constantly producing them.
00:48:22,00:48:25,- Is there a king termite that produces all the mating?
00:48:25,00:48:26,"- There's a king termite,"
00:48:26,00:48:27,and what's quite funny about them
00:48:27,00:48:29,"is that she's about a hundred times bigger than he is,"
00:48:29,00:48:31,and than anyone else in the colony.
00:48:31,00:48:33,"So he's this microscopic thing, she's next to him,"
00:48:33,00:48:34,and the reason she's so large
00:48:34,00:48:37,is because she is one giant ovary.
00:48:37,00:48:40,And do please look on YouTube
00:48:40,00:48:43,at the picture of a queen termite with eggs inside her.
00:48:43,00:48:47,"So she's like this big, pulsating, transparent lump"
00:48:47,00:48:48,"that's full of eggs,"
00:48:48,00:48:50,and you can see the eggs bubbling
00:48:50,00:48:53,and moving around inside her under her surface.
00:48:53,00:48:55,"And yeah, she can't move."
00:48:55,00:48:58,So it's awful being the queen because you're stuck.
00:48:58,00:49:00,She can't fit out of the door of her enclosure anymore.
00:49:00,00:49:01,She can't move at all.
00:49:01,00:49:04,So she depends totally on members of her colony
00:49:04,00:49:08,"to wash her, to feed her, to lick this weird sweat off her."
00:49:08,00:49:09,She's just stuck.
00:49:09,00:49:12,- Is this still the termite queen we're talking about?
00:49:12,00:49:14,- I'm just gonna leave that ambiguous.
00:49:14,00:49:15,- Scandal.
00:49:15,00:49:17,- But the door thing seems to be a bit of a mystery
00:49:17,00:49:20,"'cause if you've got a house the size of Great Britain,"
00:49:20,00:49:21,you'd think you could make the doors a bit bigger
00:49:21,00:49:23,to fit your leader out of.
00:49:23,00:49:24,What's going on there?
00:49:24,00:49:25,- That's a good point.
00:49:25,00:49:27,Termites usually have quite small doors.
00:49:27,00:49:30,They have like termite-sized doors.
00:49:30,00:49:30,- Indeed.
00:49:30,00:49:32,- She doesn't wanna go anywhere either.
00:49:32,00:49:34,"I mean, she's attached to this huge body of,"
00:49:34,00:49:37,her legs are tiny compared with the breeding mass of her.
00:49:37,00:49:39,"- Yeah, if you gave her a big door,"
00:49:39,00:49:41,it would actually just be horrifying for her
00:49:41,00:49:42,knowing she couldn't even get through it
00:49:42,00:49:44,'cause she can't move.
00:49:44,00:49:46,"- So they're tricking her, they're basically saying,"
00:49:46,00:49:48,"""Oh, you could go everywhere, but the doors are too small."""
00:49:48,00:49:51,"What a shame, so she never knows."
00:49:51,00:49:53,- The door thing is quite important in termites
00:49:53,00:49:57,because a lot of them can't really defend themselves very well.
00:49:57,00:49:58,"They can do a little bit of squirting,"
00:49:58,00:49:59,"horrible stuff out of their anus,"
00:49:59,00:50:02,but there's not really much they can do if they're attacked.
00:50:02,00:50:06,"And so usually what they'll do is like a few different insects,"
00:50:06,00:50:09,they'll come back into their door and then use their head
00:50:09,00:50:13,as a block to stop anything else from coming into the door.
00:50:13,00:50:15,And so basically then anything coming in
00:50:15,00:50:17,will have to get past that one door head
00:50:17,00:50:19,and then another door head would go into their place
00:50:19,00:50:22,and then that stops anyone from getting into their tunnels.
00:50:22,00:50:26,"And that is interesting as well because in 2018, in Japan,"
00:50:26,00:50:29,they found the first all-female termite colonies
00:50:29,00:50:31,"where all of the termites,"
00:50:31,00:50:33,usually you would have kings and you would have lots
00:50:33,00:50:36,"of male soldiers and stuff like that and male workers,"
00:50:36,00:50:38,but this one is all females.
00:50:38,00:50:40,And the reason that they think it works
00:50:40,00:50:43,"is that their males are lots of different sizes,"
00:50:43,00:50:46,but the females are all exactly the same size.
00:50:46,00:50:48,And so they can have a head
00:50:48,00:50:51,which will exactly fit in the door every single time.
00:50:51,00:50:53,And you're not sometimes going to have someone
00:50:53,00:50:56,whose head's a bit too big or a bit too small.
00:50:56,00:50:59,"And so by just having females in this colony,"
00:50:59,00:51:02,"it means that they have less chance of being attacked,"
00:51:02,00:51:05,which makes up for the lack of genetic change
00:51:05,00:51:07,that you kind of need males and females for.
00:51:07,00:51:09,- So it's kind of interesting. - Nice.
00:51:09,00:51:09,- That's really cool.
00:51:09,00:51:12,"- It's like they're the IKEA door blockers, you know?"
00:51:12,00:51:15,It's just like made to very basic specifications.
00:51:15,00:51:17,"It's all the same, it's going to fit together."
00:51:17,00:51:19,- Smart.
00:51:19,00:51:22,- We do take advice from termites on building these days.
00:51:22,00:51:26,"So they are particularly good at ventilation,"
00:51:26,00:51:29,which is something that we are quite bad at
00:51:29,00:51:32,because the amount that ventilation costs the atmosphere
00:51:32,00:51:35,"and greenhouse gas emissions, et cetera, is so massive."
00:51:35,00:51:37,So we're now building buildings
00:51:37,00:51:39,that are inspired by their ventilation systems.
00:51:39,00:51:41,"There's this place in Zimbabwe,"
00:51:41,00:51:43,"which was the first massive building,"
00:51:43,00:51:45,it's a big shopping center called the Eastgate Center
00:51:45,00:51:48,"and Office Block, inspired by termite systems."
00:51:48,00:51:50,And what they do is they have this system
00:51:50,00:51:53,of opening and closing doors that they're constantly tending to
00:51:53,00:51:55,"to make sure that air comes in the right places,"
00:51:55,00:51:57,moves up through the termite mound
00:51:57,00:51:59,"so that it's heated in the right places,"
00:51:59,00:52:00,it's cooled in the right places.
00:52:00,00:52:02,'Cause it needs to be at one precise temperature
00:52:02,00:52:06,the whole time on the inside for them to be able to survive.
00:52:06,00:52:09,"So yeah, and they make the reason that they work so well"
00:52:09,00:52:11,"is the termite mounds catch the wind,"
00:52:11,00:52:12,so it blows through them.
00:52:12,00:52:16,So a mound is like a lung and the wind comes in to them
00:52:16,00:52:19,"and then is absorbed by the various bits,"
00:52:19,00:52:21,the cells that need it and then goes out.
00:52:21,00:52:23,"- If you want to go into this shopping center,"
00:52:23,00:52:27,there's a security guard with his head blocking the door.
00:52:27,00:52:29,"- Yeah, always female though."
00:52:30,00:52:31,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:52:31,00:52:34,"And another good thing, because they're ventilated so well,"
00:52:34,00:52:36,they make really good ovens.
00:52:36,00:52:38,"So in South Africa, you'll get people"
00:52:38,00:52:41,where they'll take a termite mound
00:52:41,00:52:43,"and they'll kind of drill a little hole,"
00:52:43,00:52:45,make the door a little bit bigger.
00:52:45,00:52:46,Hopefully it's the termite mound
00:52:46,00:52:48,"where all the termites aren't there anymore, I hope."
00:52:48,00:52:50,But they'll set a little fire inside
00:52:50,00:52:53,and then the air will be sucked in through the door
00:52:53,00:52:55,and then go up through the top of the termite mound
00:52:55,00:52:56,because it's so well ventilated.
00:52:56,00:52:58,- Brilliant.
00:52:58,00:53:00,- And it means that you can cook like pizza in there
00:53:00,00:53:03,"or anything that needs a high temperature, you cook in there."
00:53:03,00:53:05,- Do they warn the termites like a demolition order?
00:53:05,00:53:07,"Do they put a sign up saying in three weeks time,"
00:53:07,00:53:08,"this will be turned into an oven,"
00:53:08,00:53:10,please vacate your home?
00:53:10,00:53:13,- I'm just hoping that they're old ones.
00:53:13,00:53:15,- You don't have any ashes of termites on your pizza
00:53:15,00:53:18,"as you're taking it out of the oven, do you?"
00:53:18,00:53:20,- Maybe it's a delicacy.
00:53:20,00:53:22,"- Well, people do eat termites, don't they?"
00:53:22,00:53:25,They're infused into muffins in certain countries.
00:53:25,00:53:25,- Really?
00:53:25,00:53:29,"- Yeah, so it's possible that termite pizza is a thing."
00:53:29,00:53:30,- Yeah.
00:53:30,00:53:33,- Do you know how they transfer water across their mounds?
00:53:33,00:53:35,So sometimes a bit of the mound gets really dry
00:53:35,00:53:37,and it needs moistening lubrication.
00:53:37,00:53:38,This is so cool.
00:53:38,00:53:41,They drink half their body weight in water.
00:53:41,00:53:43,They go to a dry part of the mound
00:53:43,00:53:45,and then they pass it into another termite's mouth.
00:53:45,00:53:46,It's basically-
00:53:46,00:53:47,- All the water?
00:53:47,00:53:48,"- All the water, yeah, yeah."
00:53:48,00:53:49,And there's a scientist called J. Scott Turner
00:53:49,00:53:52,who fed them fluorescent dyed water
00:53:52,00:53:55,and could see it moving from one termite to another.
00:53:55,00:53:58,So basically it's like it's as if a bucket chain
00:53:58,00:54:01,"to put out a fire was people just, you know,"
00:54:01,00:54:03,pushing the water into each other's mouths.
00:54:03,00:54:05,"- It's not very COVID friendly, is it?"
00:54:05,00:54:06,"- It's not very COVID friendly,"
00:54:06,00:54:09,but it would make firefighting a much sexier profession
00:54:09,00:54:11,than it already is.
00:54:11,00:54:12,"- Is it, wait, so is it to make sure that-"
00:54:12,00:54:13,- Would it?
00:54:13,00:54:14,(laughing)
00:54:14,00:54:15,- Sorry?
00:54:15,00:54:16,- Yeah.
00:54:16,00:54:18,- I think it would make it a much less effective profession
00:54:18,00:54:20,because every time you would swallow a little bit
00:54:20,00:54:23,"of the water and by the time it got to the final fireman,"
00:54:23,00:54:25,it would just be a little dribble coming out of as well.
00:54:25,00:54:28,- You'd obviously hire people with enormous mouths
00:54:28,00:54:30,to hold as much water as they could.
00:54:30,00:54:33,So the physical profile of the firefighter might change.
00:54:33,00:54:35,I'm not suggesting a change in the system.
00:54:35,00:54:37,"I'm sorry, I'd just like to clarify."
00:54:37,00:54:38,- Is this to-
00:54:38,00:54:39,"- As you see your house being burnt down,"
00:54:39,00:54:42,why not at least have something sexy to look at
00:54:42,00:54:44,while you're watching your life get destroyed?
00:54:44,00:54:46,"I get it, I get that."
00:54:46,00:54:47,- Is this to moisten the other side then
00:54:47,00:54:50,or is this to give a drink to the people on the other side?
00:54:50,00:54:51,- It's to moisten the other side.
00:54:51,00:54:54,"So it's sort of, it's, but they then go and, you know,"
00:54:54,00:54:57,spit the water out on the actual mound itself.
00:54:57,00:54:58,- That's incredible.
00:54:58,00:54:58,- Yeah.
00:54:58,00:55:00,- They never sleep as well.
00:55:00,00:55:01,Turmites don't sleep.
00:55:01,00:55:02,- Really?
00:55:02,00:55:05,"- Yeah, they're just building 24 hours a day until they die."
00:55:05,00:55:06,- Do they rest?
00:55:06,00:55:08,Do they have like a nap?
00:55:08,00:55:08,Or not even-
00:55:08,00:55:10,"- They must have downtime, yeah."
00:55:10,00:55:11,"- Yeah, downtime, exactly."
00:55:11,00:55:13,- They might play the Xbox for a little while.
00:55:13,00:55:15,"- In fact, I think I've read that they normally,"
00:55:15,00:55:18,"like Dan says, they're just all active,"
00:55:18,00:55:21,"but if they run out of holes to fill,"
00:55:21,00:55:23,they just stand around touching each other's antennae.
00:55:23,00:55:26,So that might be their equivalent of downtime.
00:55:26,00:55:29,"- Well, the Queen rests a lot, rests her entire life."
00:55:29,00:55:30,And then her life ends really tragically
00:55:30,00:55:33,because her children lick her to death.
00:55:33,00:55:37,"She sort of, she dies in the same sort of tragic way"
00:55:37,00:55:38,that she lives.
00:55:38,00:55:40,"She stops being useful, stops laying eggs."
00:55:40,00:55:43,"And so her kids like lick and lick and lick her,"
00:55:43,00:55:44,drawing all the fat and fluids out of her.
00:55:44,00:55:46,And she just disintegrates away.
00:55:46,00:55:47,- God.
00:55:47,00:55:48,- Yeah.
00:55:48,00:55:49,"- That's another sexy image for you, Loretta."
00:55:49,00:55:50,(laughing)
00:55:50,00:55:52,(upbeat music)
00:55:52,00:55:53,"Okay, that's it."
