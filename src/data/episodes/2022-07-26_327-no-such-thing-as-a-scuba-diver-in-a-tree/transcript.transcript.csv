00:00:14,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another Working from Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:19,00:00:23,a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:00:27,00:00:32,"Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tijinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:32,00:00:37,with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:37,00:00:40,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:40,00:00:45,My fact is that spies can tell what people are saying by looking at the lights in the room they're in.
00:00:45,00:00:52,"So this is a new spying technique which has been discovered or, I don't know what you do with spying"
00:00:52,00:00:59,"techniques, but it's been found out by researchers from the Ben Gurion University of the Negev"
00:00:59,00:01:03,and the Weissmann Institute of Science. And what they've found is that there are lots of different
00:01:03,00:01:09,"ways of eavesdropping on people, and this one is called LAMPHONE. And what it means is,"
00:01:09,00:01:14,"if we're all talking in our rooms, if there's a light bulb and it has to be a hanging light bulb,"
00:01:14,00:01:20,"so you know, a classic bulb, your conversation will make tiny, tiny vibrations on the surface"
00:01:20,00:01:25,"and that will slightly affect the light inside the bulb. And you can get very cheap equipment,"
00:01:25,00:01:29,"like cost a couple of hundred dollars, and you just observe the light bulb from outside the room,"
00:01:29,00:01:34,and you can pick up what people are talking about. You can decode speeches.
00:01:34,00:01:39,"Yeah, so you can, it's not like Morse, it's not translating into Morse, you can pick up the actual"
00:01:39,00:01:45,"sound? Well, I think it has to be translated from light bulb language into sound."
00:01:47,00:01:52,"So it is light bulb language? Yeah, but they can even, you can shazam the song that someone is playing"
00:01:52,00:01:59,"in a room. That's how, yeah. It's amazing, isn't it? And they reckon that they took a snippet of a"
00:01:59,00:02:03,"speech by Donald Trump, and they could understand what he was saying, which is quite impressive,"
00:02:03,00:02:06,because most people can't understand what he's saying most of the time anyway.
00:02:06,00:02:12,Can we do a light bulb episode of Fish that we just release in light bulb language and
00:02:12,00:02:16,"people can decode down the line? Yeah, good idea. Yeah, that won't present any technical problems."
00:02:16,00:02:23,"It's hard enough to get on Zoom, Dan. Is this, do they use lasers for this to reflect, because you"
00:02:23,00:02:27,can't just pin your ear to the window and listen to the vibrations coming off the light bulb or
00:02:27,00:02:32,"anything, presumably. Is it lasers they bounce off it? Yeah, it's invisible lasers. So you won't"
00:02:32,00:02:36,"notice a kind of sniper dot on your light bulb, so you won't be able to tell you being spider."
00:02:36,00:02:41,"What it is actually, I believe not a laser, I think. I think it's just a telescope,"
00:02:41,00:02:46,"so you get the light and an electro optical sensor. Now that might have a laser in it,"
00:02:46,00:02:52,"for all I know, but I think what it is, it takes the light in and it can sense the very,"
00:02:52,00:02:56,very slight changes in light. Can I just say why I flubbed that? It's because there's a separate
00:02:56,00:03:03,"thing called a laser microphone, which was, this was used, this is where you fire a laser at the"
00:03:03,00:03:10,windows of a room and you can eavesdrop that way. And this was used in 2013 in a place called a
00:03:10,00:03:15,botter bed and it was used to find out that there was an extra person inside a building in a botter
00:03:15,00:03:20,bed and that extra person who never left the building turned out to be Osama Bin Laden.
00:03:20,00:03:25,So that's how they found out there was an extra person inside that building who never went outside.
00:03:25,00:03:31,"And do you know who invented this, this laser? No. It was Leon Theramen, the inventor of the"
00:03:31,00:03:41,"Theramen. That instrument? Do the noise again, Dan? You should explain what the Theramen is,"
00:03:41,00:03:44,as well as doing that excellent impersonation. I think we have mentioned it before.
00:03:44,00:03:49,"Yeah, so Theramans are, you will have seen them possibly as an instrument that I don't,"
00:03:49,00:03:54,"I actually don't know how they work technically. They give off electromagnetic waves, don't they,"
00:03:54,00:03:59,"and your hand can disrupt them and they make a noise. Yeah, so people use their hand, if you see"
00:03:59,00:04:04,"them sort of pushing forward and backwards their hand, it will sort of make that kind of..."
00:04:04,00:04:08,"Yeah, it's basically a ghost impression is what it sounds like."
00:04:08,00:04:13,So Leon Theramen invented what basically was the precursor to the modern laser microphone that we
00:04:13,00:04:20,"have today and it was used by the Soviet Union and he was given a Stalin prize for inventing this,"
00:04:20,00:04:26,what was advanced espionage technology. So Theramen found Osama Bin Laden.
00:04:27,00:04:30,Wow. That's amazing. That's sort of spooky.
00:04:30,00:04:39,The other thing that Theramen did really interestingly was he had invented basically
00:04:39,00:04:46,like the technology you have on contactless credit cards. He put one of those in a giant wooden seal
00:04:46,00:04:51,"and when I say seal, I don't mean the animal. I mean like kind of a symbol of the United States"
00:04:51,00:04:56,"and then gave it to the US embassy somewhere, I think, and they had it up in their room,"
00:04:56,00:05:00,but what they didn't realise is there was a tiny chip in there and that they could hear
00:05:00,00:05:04,"what was happening by using this contactless technology, I think."
00:05:04,00:05:06,"Yep. Yeah, you're completely right."
00:05:06,00:05:09,They didn't have to go up to the seal. The Soviets didn't have to go up to the seal
00:05:09,00:05:15,"and then sort of tap on it to get the sound files out, but they sort of fired electromagnetic"
00:05:15,00:05:19,"beams at it, didn't they? And that activated it, just like your oyster card is activated"
00:05:19,00:05:21,by the ticket stand. It was called the thing.
00:05:21,00:05:26,The thing? That's what it's called. The seal was called the thing.
00:05:26,00:05:31,Soviet school children gave it to the US embassy or the US ambassador in 1945 and they managed to
00:05:31,00:05:35,"get seven years of espionage recording out of it. Wow, that's so cool."
00:05:35,00:05:38,How did they make sure the US ambassador put it in the right room?
00:05:38,00:05:42,"It was so big, I think, that I had to go on the wall somewhere. I don't think they could guarantee"
00:05:42,00:05:47,"the room, but also it was completely made of wood, so they thought this is definitely safe."
00:05:47,00:05:48,There's no way this is a spying tool.
00:05:48,00:05:52,And the really clever thing about those kind of chips that you have in your credit card and in
00:05:52,00:05:58,"your oyster card is they don't need any power, do they? All the power comes from the thing that's"
00:05:58,00:06:06,"scanning them. You know, Edward Snowden, he has a secret device to stop himself being spied on,"
00:06:06,00:06:11,which is a blanket over his head. Is that what inspires you? Because you do that sometimes
00:06:11,00:06:14,when we record. And I thought it was just to embellish the ghost impression that you've been
00:06:14,00:06:22,"honing. That's just social anxiety. But Edward Snowden has, he calls it his magic mantle of"
00:06:22,00:06:27,"power. And basically, it's to stop targeted video surveillance. Because obviously, if you're"
00:06:27,00:06:31,"Edward Snowden, you know, leaking secrets, there's a chance someone will be trying to"
00:06:31,00:06:34,spy on you. So he just puts a blanket over his head when he types his password in.
00:06:34,00:06:38,"I remember reading an article about, was it Glenn Greenwald who interviewed him?"
00:06:38,00:06:43,"Yeah, someone like that. And they said that whenever they went into his hotel room or his"
00:06:43,00:06:48,"house or whatever, they always made you put your phone in the microwave as soon as you"
00:06:48,00:06:52,walked in. That was what you always had to do. I think Snowden makes people put it in the
00:06:52,00:06:56,"refrigerator. I'll just see. It's his. Yeah. How does it work, Andy, though? If he's put it over"
00:06:56,00:07:01,"his head, he's not going to be able to see what he's typing. A, but also it's just his eyeballs"
00:07:01,00:07:08,"that I'm not seeing. I reckon Edward Snowden can touch type. But still, what are they recording?"
00:07:08,00:07:15,"All of him is under the blanket. Oh, he's in a port. No, he's not. Well, yes. He's got a blanket"
00:07:15,00:07:19,"over his head and his hands, basically. It's in case there's someone, the camera in the room that"
00:07:19,00:07:23,"would fill what he's typing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you've got to assume that he's done the very"
00:07:23,00:07:26,"basic putting masking tape over the camera on his laptop, because if he's missed that trick,"
00:07:26,00:07:32,"he's an absolute nobody. Actually, you know what they can tell what you're typing by just"
00:07:32,00:07:38,listening to the sound of your typing on your keyboard. So there are some researchers at
00:07:38,00:07:46,"the University of California, Berkeley, actually, it's Doug Tiger and his team. And they've worked"
00:07:46,00:07:50,"out every time you click a button, it makes a very, very slightly different sound to the other ones."
00:07:50,00:07:55,But you can't really tell which one is which. But what you can do is you can take all the clicks
00:07:55,00:08:02,"and then work out the one that comes most often is probably E. And if there are two letters together,"
00:08:02,00:08:07,"these researchers, they realize that it could be T H or it could be E R. And it could definitely not"
00:08:07,00:08:12,"be B F, because there are no words with B F next to each other. What the hell of us there are?"
00:08:12,00:08:18,"What if you're like, me and my B F are both hardcore spies? Exactly. If you are Edward Snowden,"
00:08:18,00:08:22,"here's a little tip for him, and he's in his little fort, and you want to trick the FBI,"
00:08:22,00:08:29,just keep writing about your B F F. He's been a major sort of revealer of a lot of these secrets
00:08:29,00:08:35,"that we've been researching, hasn't he? So he, a lot of stuff came out on the back of his revelations."
00:08:35,00:08:38,"So I think, for instance, when the Guardian was doing their investigation and they got"
00:08:38,00:08:42,"hold of a lot of the documents, they were told that they weren't allowed to keep any of the Edward"
00:08:42,00:08:46,Snowden files in their offices because the government thought that they could be spied on
00:08:46,00:08:50,"by laser microphones, just bouncing off their glasses of water and stuff like that. So it's"
00:08:50,00:08:55,"not just the windows. It's if you've got a mug of tea or anything similar to that, they could do that."
00:08:55,00:09:02,"And yeah, he's in the wake of his revelations, a lot of countries took action to make sure that"
00:09:02,00:09:08,"the US or the NSA couldn't spy on them too much anymore. So Germany, for instance, invested in a"
00:09:08,00:09:13,"whole bunch of typewriters, which I don't know if this would have solved the typing issue. But the"
00:09:13,00:09:19,"idea is that if you're writing on a typewriter, there's no digital memory of it anywhere. You've"
00:09:19,00:09:24,just got it on a bit of paper in that weird old school font. And then I guess you just post it
00:09:24,00:09:29,to somebody. But it is quite annoying if you need to share a document with 20 other people.
00:09:31,00:09:36,"But yeah, and Russia, I think, spent 10 grand on antique typewriters after that."
00:09:36,00:09:42,Really? Do any of you guys have a typewriter? I have one. And they're a pain to use compared with a
00:09:42,00:09:48,"computer. They're so annoying. Like they just always get stuck and whenever you make a mistake,"
00:09:48,00:09:50,you can't press delete.
00:09:50,00:09:53,"James, why are you writing on a typewriter? That's a big question for me."
00:09:53,00:09:56,"Well, you know, I'm married to a Russian."
00:09:59,00:10:04,"No, I got one as a gift and I really liked it. And I thought I might try typing on it,"
00:10:04,00:10:06,but it's really a fucking annoying. It does seem like a pain.
00:10:06,00:10:13,It must be so annoying for all these people who work in spy centres coming up with new ways of
00:10:13,00:10:18,"spying on people that some dorky scientists are just publishing these papers going, ""Oh,"
00:10:18,00:10:23,"we found out that they must be reading light bulbs."" Because I'm like, ""Damn it, that took me years."""
00:10:23,00:10:28,I created the technology to read light bulbs and now we're going to look for something else.
00:10:28,00:10:33,"What next? Yeah, because some people do that. People, I think there's a company, a data analysis"
00:10:33,00:10:37,"company called Palantir, which is used by the US Secret Service. So they must know what they're"
00:10:37,00:10:43,doing. And they have designed their windows to have these things that they call acoustic transducers
00:10:43,00:10:47,"on them, which basically, if you try to use the window vibrations, it just sends out white"
00:10:47,00:10:53,noise or something. Maybe it sends out some kind of ha ha prank tube message to anyone.
00:10:53,00:10:58,That would be brilliant if you could hack your window to send other messages out.
00:10:58,00:11:03,"But I think, isn't that why governments would use net curtains? I think that's why,"
00:11:03,00:11:09,"because that supposedly dampened the vibrations. Other governments which use net curtains,"
00:11:09,00:11:14,because I also think them with suburbia in the 1950s. You have to have an old lady peering around
00:11:14,00:11:20,"them to see what the neighbours are doing. You know, the Sopranos, the great TV series,"
00:11:20,00:11:28,the mobster TV series. So it was so realistic. It was so on point for what would happen in the
00:11:28,00:11:33,"real life of a mobster, that mobsters started thinking there must be someone on the inside who"
00:11:33,00:11:39,was leaking information to the writers and producers of the show. And we know that they had those
00:11:39,00:11:45,conversations because the FBI were actually wiretapping the mobsters who had that conversation
00:11:45,00:11:50,and fed that back to the writers and producers of the Sopranos. But they used to listen into
00:11:50,00:11:54,"conversations of mobsters going, ""Did you see the Sopranos on Sunday? How did they know that we"
00:11:54,00:11:58,"do that kind of thing?"" Come on, Dad, you could have done it better. Italian-American accent."
00:11:58,00:12:13,"Nope, he couldn't. Turns out, Dan, you sounded like a Kiwi. You sounded New Zealandish, which is"
00:12:13,00:12:18,the opposite of being a New Jersey you're trying to get. You did New Zealand. Do you think New
00:12:18,00:12:22,Zealand is the opposite of being in the Sopranos? Because that probably is quite close. A harmless
00:12:22,00:12:26,"Kiwi. Pretty much is. Yeah, you're right. Dan, you know what you were saying about"
00:12:26,00:12:30,what is annoying that all these secrets come out? It must be irritating if you're in the
00:12:30,00:12:36,Secret Service. So I have a suspicion that everything we found out is all just fake news
00:12:36,00:12:42,that's subtly put out by the CIA or MI5 to throw us off the scent. Because it's just so much they
00:12:42,00:12:52,"release. Or, Anna, sorry, by Big Lumpshade. Could be them. The Lumpshade companies trying to make us"
00:12:52,00:12:58,"buy Lumpshades. You're absolutely bang on. Or candle. James, you're 1950s house. You've got your"
00:12:58,00:13:07,neck curtains. You've got your big fringe Lumpshade. The typewriter's out. I am from Murder She Wrote.
00:13:07,00:13:15,"She has a kerfletcher on over. Sorry, Anna. So Big Lumpshade, or whoever it is, has put out this"
00:13:15,00:13:20,"fake news. Because this stuff that comes out is amazing. So there's a book called Spycraft,"
00:13:20,00:13:24,"which came out in 2009. And it was written by the head of the Office of Technical Service,"
00:13:24,00:13:29,which is the CIA department that's responsible for all of their gadgets. So it's written by
00:13:29,00:13:35,this former head of that. And he just revealed this amazing stuff. But it sounds so implausible.
00:13:35,00:13:39,"So he said that they used to, when they met business people or politicians or diplomats,"
00:13:39,00:13:44,they'd hand out gifts. And all the gifts would have devices placed in them.
00:13:44,00:13:50,"So a bit like these schoolchildren. So they'd hand out books or lighters or flower pots,"
00:13:50,00:13:55,"apparently. But you just think if you're-- Wait a minute. If you're going to give a gift, right?"
00:13:55,00:13:59,"Don't give a flower pot, which they might put outside. You need to give them something that"
00:13:59,00:14:04,"would-- Oh, here's a milk bottle as a gift. It's like you've got to give them something"
00:14:04,00:14:07,that they'll definitely keep in the house. You're so right. The only noise you get from
00:14:07,00:14:11,that is wind and then squirrels and foxes desperately digging through earth.
00:14:11,00:14:18,"I saw an amazing video online just while we're on the CIA. So the CIA has a chief of disguise,"
00:14:18,00:14:23,which I didn't know. And the former chief of disguise does this video. She's called John
00:14:23,00:14:29,Amendez. And it's amazing. This video is her sitting talking about how you can slip into
00:14:29,00:14:33,"a disguise very quickly or the elaborate ways that they do it. And during the video,"
00:14:33,00:14:38,she slowly goes into different disguises. So sometimes she's an old man. And it's really
00:14:38,00:14:42,"incredible. And she was talking about a lot of the mythology of CIA disguise and what they do,"
00:14:42,00:14:48,particularly the Mission Impossible movies with wearing the sort of fake head. And that's not
00:14:48,00:14:52,far from the truth of what they did. And there's this fantastic set of photos when she went to
00:14:52,00:14:57,"meet George Bush Sr. to tell him about what they were up to, that she sat doing the whole meeting."
00:14:57,00:15:03,"And then near the end, rips off her mask and has a different-- her real head underneath and"
00:15:03,00:15:06,Bush didn't notice the entire time. You can see these photos. Highly recommend.
00:15:06,00:15:09,But he didn't notice her ripping off her own face.
00:15:09,00:15:12,"No, he sort of looked at it. He didn't just carry on with the meeting."
00:15:12,00:15:16,I thought this was late in the presidency where he wasn't really paying attention anymore.
00:15:16,00:15:20,"No, he didn't notice that she had a fake head on during the meeting."
00:15:20,00:15:23,I do not found it suspicious that Mrs. Doubtfire wanted to have a meeting with him in the first
00:15:23,00:15:32,"place. Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is James."
00:15:32,00:15:38,"Okay, my fact this week is that London Bridge was destroyed by a tornado in 1091."
00:15:38,00:15:44,"What? Like, I can't believe I didn't know this already. I thought,"
00:15:44,00:15:45,why are they not teaching it in schools?
00:15:45,00:15:51,"Why is it not a great movie? Yeah, this is incredible, this fact."
00:15:51,00:15:56,"This was one of the first London bridges. In fact, probably the first one we 100%"
00:15:56,00:16:00,"definitely know about. There will have been some before, but we're not quite sure what happened"
00:16:00,00:16:05,to them. But it was William the Conqueror. He came into London in 1066.
00:16:05,00:16:09,And one of his first things that he did when his army came in was they built a new bridge
00:16:09,00:16:14,over the River Thames. And it was just 25 years later that it was completely demolished by a tornado.
00:16:14,00:16:19,And we don't know much about it because obviously people didn't write much down in those days.
00:16:19,00:16:23,But 12th century historian William of Malmesbury says that it was completely wrecked.
00:16:23,00:16:28,"There were also churches that were wrecked, and there were more than 600 houses that were"
00:16:28,00:16:33,"completely flattened. And we now think that it was what's called an F4 tornado,"
00:16:33,00:16:38,which is the second strongest tornado you can get with winds over 200 miles an hour.
00:16:38,00:16:42,Amazing. Is it how? Did he call it a tornado at the time?
00:16:42,00:16:47,"I've just realized, I mean, did he call it a mighty wind or something else like that?"
00:16:47,00:16:49,"Because presumably they didn't have the word then, did they?"
00:16:49,00:16:54,"It's such a good question. They won't have had the word. So that's, yeah, you answered your own"
00:16:54,00:16:59,"question. Actually, what a bad question. You knew the answer. You were wasting everyone's time."
00:16:59,00:17:04,"I didn't know. And only two people were killed, apparently, in this tornado."
00:17:04,00:17:10,That's so weird. Was no one in any of the 600 or whatever houses that were falling down?
00:17:10,00:17:12,"It's so weird, isn't it? Everyone's out at work."
00:17:12,00:17:19,It sounds extraordinarily powerful. So the church of St Mary LeBeau had 26-foot-high
00:17:19,00:17:24,"rafters, and apparently they were driven so far into the earth by this tornado"
00:17:24,00:17:28,"that only four feet of them remained above ground, which I was thinking,"
00:17:28,00:17:33,"because Mary LeBeau is a very famous church in London for those people who aren't Londoners,"
00:17:33,00:17:37,"because that's if you're born within the sound of the bells of Mary LeBeau,"
00:17:37,00:17:41,then you are officially a cockney. And I'm guessing the bells weren't functioning once
00:17:41,00:17:45,it was driven into the ground. So anyone born in that period couldn't be a cockney.
00:17:45,00:17:50,That's incredible. How does that work that it shoved it into the ground? That's like a giant
00:17:50,00:17:56,"screwdriver. I mean, I'm just putting myself in their place. We don't know what this thing was."
00:17:56,00:18:01,"There was a giant spinny screwdriver in the sky, and it's drilled some of our big panels into the"
00:18:01,00:18:05,"ground. Well, that's when they changed traditional church architecture away from the screwdriver"
00:18:05,00:18:12,"design, to less easy to drive into the ground shape. That just seems... But that's a lot that's"
00:18:12,00:18:17,"20 feet to go into the ground. London ground's very swampy. It's a lot. Look, they didn't have"
00:18:17,00:18:22,such good tarmac then. But the other thing that's interesting is that I think the London
00:18:22,00:18:25,Bridge that would have been destroyed by this tornado would have been way bigger than
00:18:25,00:18:30,"modern London Bridge, because the river was so much wider at the time. That's a good point."
00:18:30,00:18:34,"The river used to be about four or five times as wide as it is today. A lot of it's been reclaimed,"
00:18:34,00:18:39,so it would have been absolutely enormous. Yeah. I did read about a potential precursor
00:18:39,00:18:46,"to this London Bridge, which is much debated, but a lot of serious journals do think that"
00:18:46,00:18:51,sides on the fact that it did exist. And it's off the back of something that we know from Nordic
00:18:51,00:18:58,"Law, which was... There was a period in 1014 when Ethel the Unready had been trying to reclaim"
00:18:58,00:19:03,England. Is Ethel the Unready related to Ethel Red the Unready? It was his mum.
00:19:03,00:19:10,"Yeah, it was Ethel Red. Ethel Red. Sorry, I said as they were wrong. Yeah. Annoyingly,"
00:19:10,00:19:15,this fact has so much English history that I have to get to before I can explain the basic thing.
00:19:15,00:19:20,"The basic thing is the Danes were in charge of London at that point, and London Bridge was very"
00:19:20,00:19:25,much a spot where they could arm the whole thing with people of bows and arrows for anyone who
00:19:25,00:19:32,was coming down the Thames. And so there was a Viking called Olaf who tied ropes underneath the
00:19:32,00:19:38,"bridge and went underneath with the tide and pulled London Bridge down, forcing all the soldiers"
00:19:38,00:19:44,to die and perish in the water. It was over 200 soldiers and helped for reclaiming England for
00:19:44,00:19:52,the British as opposed to the Danes. And a poet called Ota Stavte did a poem which was London
00:19:52,00:19:57,"Bridge is Broken Down, Gold is One and Bright Rione. There's more to it, but that line London"
00:19:57,00:20:01,Bridge is Broken Down is thought to have inspired London Bridge is Falling Down.
00:20:01,00:20:05,"What's really interesting is about the London Bridge is Falling Down thing, which is a lot of"
00:20:05,00:20:09,"people think that it might be to do with that story. But then on the other hand, before that,"
00:20:09,00:20:17,"there were other songs throughout the whole of Europe. So you would have Die Magdeburger Brück,"
00:20:17,00:20:22,the Magdeburg Bridge in Germany. And it was basically exactly the same idea of a bridge
00:20:22,00:20:29,that would fall down. And a lot of nursery rhyme historians think that what happened was this was
00:20:29,00:20:34,"quite common kind of European song. And then when it came over to Britain, they just gave it the"
00:20:34,00:20:40,name of the capital city's most famous bridge. My favorite version of the London Bridge was the
00:20:40,00:20:46,one that was there during Shakespearean times. It just sounds like the most fascinating thing to
00:20:46,00:20:52,have ever walked across. It was packed with houses that were up to four stories high.
00:20:52,00:20:57,"It had restaurants on it, restaurants that when you went to them, the way you would order your"
00:20:57,00:21:02,"food is you would get fish as a sandwich, right? And they would open a trapdoor and they would put"
00:21:02,00:21:08,"down a fishing rod. They would catch the fish live, reel it up, and then slap it raw in between"
00:21:08,00:21:14,"bread and give it to you. So many questions. First, worst restaurant ever. If you're just going to"
00:21:14,00:21:21,"raw food, it's sushi. Can I say second, how are you going to guarantee if it's the Thames in the"
00:21:21,00:21:27,"sixtieth century that you're not going to reel in a turd? Bingo. Well, that was the exciting"
00:21:27,00:21:32,element of your dining experience. That's where the phrase comes from. I'd rather eat a shit sandwich
00:21:32,00:21:38,"than this restaurant. And third, as we know, the sandwich in this country hadn't really been invented"
00:21:38,00:21:41,yet. So it doesn't make any sense. They would have reeled the fish up and had two bits of bread and
00:21:41,00:21:48,"gone, God, we don't know how to put this together. So why have you read this stuff? This is amazing."
00:21:48,00:21:54,"I read this in a book by Dr Matthew Green, a book called London, A Travel Guide Through Time."
00:21:54,00:21:59,And this was a book that was published by my wife. And it's the most fascinating chapter
00:21:59,00:22:04,because he takes you back to the time. So he has someone walking across the bridge in Shakespearean
00:22:04,00:22:09,times. It would take you two hours to walk the length of the entire bridge. It was so congested.
00:22:09,00:22:14,"And there's always a bit, apparently, during the day where it came to a standstill, because you know"
00:22:14,00:22:19,"how there was a polar bear tower at the Tower of London. Sorry, what's it called? Tower of London."
00:22:19,00:22:23,At the Tower of London. It was during the hour when he would be taken out to the Thames to be
00:22:23,00:22:28,fed that people would stand and just watch. He would come to a standstill because it was such a
00:22:28,00:22:33,mad thing that a polar bear would be fishing for food. He'd be stealing sandwiches out of the
00:22:33,00:22:38,"mouths of hungry clientele in the restaurant as well. He's run off with my, oh, what's it called?"
00:22:38,00:22:44,"That polar bear wasn't there in Shakespearean times, was he? I thought he was like"
00:22:44,00:22:50,"13th century at the latest, wasn't it? I thought so. But this is the same bridge that I'm talking"
00:22:50,00:22:55,"about. Because it spanned a long time. In the 14th century, we know how many people were actually"
00:22:55,00:23:00,"living on it, because we know the number of rent that was collected from properties. So there were"
00:23:00,00:23:06,198 buildings that were all providing rental revenue from that period. And this was the bridge.
00:23:06,00:23:09,"If you talk about all the London bridges of which there have been dozens of iterations,"
00:23:09,00:23:14,"this was the one that lasted, what, 600 years or whatever, or maybe longer even. But it was because"
00:23:14,00:23:19,"of this that they eventually dismantled that in the 1820s, because it was so congested."
00:23:19,00:23:23,But it's also because it was the only bridge. It was literally the only bridge across
00:23:23,00:23:28,central London until 1739. So it feels weird for them to dismantle it and build another one when
00:23:28,00:23:34,"they could have just built more bridges. Yeah, true. I was reading a count of the dismantling,"
00:23:34,00:23:40,"and then they rebuilt it as a wider, more useful bridge. And when they lay the first stone of a"
00:23:40,00:23:45,"building or a bridge, and there was this account in the British newspaper archive, it was 1925."
00:23:45,00:23:49,And the Lord Mayor was invited to lay the foundation stone. And I didn't understand
00:23:49,00:23:56,"the ritual at all. So basically, he had a gold trowel with which he sort of dug it up, I guess."
00:23:56,00:24:01,"And then he dropped coins into a box. So there's a wooden box. He drops coins into a box, which"
00:24:01,00:24:07,"contains four little glass pillars, seven inches high, a lid to put on the box. And then the box"
00:24:07,00:24:14,is covered in cement and installed into a hole in the foundation stone. And then that's dropped.
00:24:14,00:24:18,"So if you went to the bottom of London Bridge now with your scuba gear,"
00:24:18,00:24:21,"and then you cut away into some of the stones, in one of them,"
00:24:21,00:24:26,there's this little box full of glass pillars and these coins. Isn't that weird?
00:24:26,00:24:30,Cool. That's really cool. I know what happened to the previous foundation stone from the previous
00:24:30,00:24:36,bridge. So was that the 1831 version of London Bridge that you're talking about? Okay. So the
00:24:36,00:24:42,"previous one got, lots of it got sold off as souvenirs. So there are bits of various British"
00:24:42,00:24:47,"country houses which are made of old London Bridge. But the stone got turned into a chair,"
00:24:47,00:24:54,"the foundation stone, in the base of a chair. Where is the chair? It's in Fish Hall, which is"
00:24:54,00:25:00,"kind of the fishing guild, the fisherman's guild. And it's right by modern London Bridge now."
00:25:00,00:25:04,"And it's just a fancy chair, basically. That's so sad for that stone. So it spent"
00:25:04,00:25:09,its entire existence watching live fish swimming happily around. And now it's condemned to this
00:25:09,00:25:14,place full of dead slaughtered fish running for the table. Just have a fisherman's bottom on him
00:25:14,00:25:20,every now and then. We can't leave London Bridge alone without talking about what happened to
00:25:20,00:25:26,"that new 1831 version, which is now in America. So the idea was that it was sold to an American"
00:25:26,00:25:31,"and he got conned, right? That's... Oh, well, people claim that, but he insists he didn't."
00:25:31,00:25:36,"And I suspect he didn't. But yeah, basically, so that London Bridge is now in Havasu,"
00:25:36,00:25:42,"which is in Arizona, because this crazy millionaire in... It was in 1968, wasn't it,"
00:25:42,00:25:46,that it was put up for sale. And this millionaire in America bought it. And there's always been a
00:25:46,00:25:51,rumour that he meant to buy Tower Bridge and got the wrong one. But I think he likes that because
00:25:51,00:25:57,"it drummed up even more publicity for the fact that he was moving London Bridge to the desert,"
00:25:57,00:26:02,which everyone thought was insane. It's amazing because they installed it in a dry bit of the
00:26:02,00:26:05,desert and then they redirected the nearby stream to go under it. So there is water going
00:26:05,00:26:10,"under it now, but the bridge was put there before the water was. Yeah, it is quite weird to have to"
00:26:10,00:26:19,build a river in order to satisfy a bridge means. But the weird thing is that London put the bridge
00:26:19,00:26:25,"on sale in 1968. It wasn't like some mad Yosemite Sam millionaire turns up and says, ""I want to"
00:26:25,00:26:29,"buy that bridge."" It was that London was trying to flog it off. Yeah. But who did they think was"
00:26:29,00:26:33,going to buy it? Probably someone with a river. So they were probably quite surprised with this
00:26:33,00:26:39,"guy got it. They probably, when he came over, they were like, ""Oh, nice. Yeah, what river are you"
00:26:39,00:26:48,"going to put it over?"" No river. Oh, right. Okay. It is worth saying if this guy did make the mistake"
00:26:48,00:26:54,"of Tower Bridge and London Bridge, that possibly a lot of international listeners listening to"
00:26:54,00:26:59,this episode right now are making the very same mistake. The almost iconic bridge that you've
00:26:59,00:27:05,"pictured in your head, that's Tower Bridge. That's one where it opens up in the middle"
00:27:05,00:27:09,"and it's got the huge two giant, I don't know what you call them, arches, whatever,"
00:27:09,00:27:17,"that bridge, the one you're thinking of. London Bridge, very dull. It's terrible. It's horrible."
00:27:17,00:27:22,"So you can understand where this guy is. It's just a road bridge, isn't it? It is. It's just a"
00:27:22,00:27:32,"straight old bridge that an unimaginative child might draw. Exactly. I did read an amazing thing,"
00:27:32,00:27:37,"which was in 1952. This is a fact about Tower Bridge, the one that does open up in the middle."
00:27:37,00:27:42,"If you've ever seen the movie Speed, where they have to jump the gap of a bridge,"
00:27:42,00:27:49,that happened on Tower Bridge with a bus driver in 1952. His name was Albert Gunter
00:27:49,00:27:54,"and he was during December, he was driving the number 78 bus, which goes from Shoreditch to"
00:27:54,00:27:59,Dullitch. The person who would usually ring the bell to say that the bridge was going up
00:27:59,00:28:06,forgot to ring it. He noticed that the bridge was bending upwards as he was driving towards it. He
00:28:06,00:28:09,didn't have enough time to slam on the brakes because that would have been disaster. So he hit
00:28:09,00:28:17,"the accelerator and he jumped. He jumped across. Now, only his side had lifted up and he jumped"
00:28:17,00:28:23,a six-foot drop basically onto the northern side of the bridge. It's still a lot on a massive bus.
00:28:23,00:28:27,"Exactly on a massive bus, but yeah, someone jumped the gap of the bridge in 1952."
00:28:27,00:28:32,"Did they remember to put the sign over the tunnel saying, ""This bus is on diversion?"""
00:28:32,00:28:39,"That was not part of the planned route. Yeah, so he was okay in the end. He broke his leg,"
00:28:39,00:28:45,"which was the only major problem. 12 of the 20 passengers had minor injuries, but so 21 people"
00:28:45,00:28:51,"in total all survived this big bridge jump. And as a reward, he was given £10, which is about"
00:28:51,00:28:58,"£290 in today's money, and a day off for his bravery. Right. Ah, that's enough time for a"
00:28:58,00:29:07,"broken leg to fully heal. Okay, so some stuff on tornadoes. Yeah. It's really difficult to know"
00:29:07,00:29:12,"when you read articles about tornadoes, what's real and what isn't real, because they happen"
00:29:12,00:29:16,in the middle of the countryside. The only people who see it are the people who are there at the
00:29:16,00:29:21,"time, and they often seem to come up with some stories that I don't know if they're real or not."
00:29:21,00:29:28,So there's a story from the start of the 20th century. I think it was in Kansas where there
00:29:28,00:29:33,"was a man with a baby in his arms, and the tornado came and lifted the baby up and deposited it in"
00:29:33,00:29:43,"a tree, which doesn't sound very true. But this apparently in 1976, this one seems like it might"
00:29:43,00:29:48,"have been true. It was in Michigan, there was a tornado, and there was a house which was blown"
00:29:48,00:29:54,"by the tornado, so it went onto its side. So people had to use a ladder to get into the front door."
00:29:54,00:30:00,"Well, apart from the side thing, it's looking pretty good in here."
00:30:01,00:30:10,"But then there are some that are definitely not true. For instance, in this 1915 one in Kansas,"
00:30:10,00:30:14,there was a story that an iron jug was blown inside out.
00:30:14,00:30:18,Pretty sure that one isn't true.
00:30:18,00:30:26,"I read one as well years ago, which was there was a mystery of a scuba diver found in a tree,"
00:30:26,00:30:30,"and he was fully, he was fully clothed. No, Dan, no, I know what you're doing."
00:30:30,00:30:37,"Are you doing the famous mental brain teaser where they've been picked up by a,"
00:30:37,00:30:41,they've been scuba diving and they've been picked up by a helicopter that's trying to put out a
00:30:41,00:30:47,"fire. Was that a mental brain teaser? Yeah, that wasn't a real story. I think he's just come across"
00:30:47,00:30:56,"an amazing fact website. Look at Ollie's anecdotes. Okay, but the room was locked from the inside,"
00:30:56,00:31:02,there were no windows. There's just a puddle of water. The fish were called Romeo and Juliet.
00:31:02,00:31:04,But the doctor is his mum.
00:31:04,00:31:15,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that this year's"
00:31:15,00:31:20,Dutch national headwind championships was canceled during the race because it was too windy.
00:31:20,00:31:27,So this is a cycling championship that's been going for the last six years. And the idea is that
00:31:27,00:31:31,they don't know when it's going to happen. They look out for storms. And as soon as they hear a
00:31:31,00:31:35,"massive storm is on the way, they give everyone three days warning to say, we're going to be doing"
00:31:35,00:31:41,this race. And they have to go down this one strip of 8.5 kilometers. And you just have to ride
00:31:41,00:31:46,"against the wind. And actually, it wasn't the cyclists who pulled out of it. It was the fact"
00:31:46,00:31:50,that it was the trucks carrying the bikes were being toppled over. So they could physically get
00:31:50,00:31:55,"the bikes them. So my friend, Tom Scott, who's a YouTuber was there. Yes. And he did a video about"
00:31:55,00:32:01,"this. And he said that they didn't topple over, I think they just it was too dangerous for high"
00:32:01,00:32:07,"sided vehicles to go across. So I don't think any trucks actually went over, but they were just"
00:32:07,00:32:12,banned from going over. And what happens is everyone has kind of the same bike that these kind of
00:32:12,00:32:17,"single speed upright bikes, and you cycle across and then this big lorry picks up the bikes and"
00:32:17,00:32:22,takes them all back to the start again. So the next lot of people can go down. And the lorry couldn't
00:32:22,00:32:26,"come across the bridge because it was banned. And instead, it would have to go on like a 20 mile"
00:32:26,00:32:32,"route rather than going that way. So they just canceled it halfway through. Yeah, there is another"
00:32:32,00:32:36,way of moving bikes without a truck. And especially is coming back.
00:32:36,00:32:46,This year they were going to they'd gone all out to make it even nicer than the previous events.
00:32:46,00:32:52,And they had storm resistant seating for the spectators and a special designated vomit zone.
00:32:52,00:32:58,It's really funny. You can see it's these three big bin bags that are sort of hung up and it has
00:32:58,00:33:03,a big placard that says vomit zone. And there's little bike handles for you to hold as you're
00:33:03,00:33:06,"vomiting into the rubbish bin. You don't want to be stood down wind of that as well, do you?"
00:33:06,00:33:13,Why do they need a vomit zone? Does it get quite lairy? The endurance of doing this race. So they
00:33:13,00:33:19,say it's it's kind of like if you were going cycling up a hill that was a sort of 10 percent
00:33:19,00:33:25,"incline, it feels and you've got no on a terrible bike as well on a terrible bike. And the whole"
00:33:25,00:33:29,"thing is, you know, there are winners, but everyone is just wanting to finish it. It's an"
00:33:29,00:33:33,endurance thing. And they push themselves to the limit and it forces them to vomit enough so that
00:33:33,00:33:37,they've set up the vomit station. They should have vomit zones shortly at the end of all marathons
00:33:37,00:33:40,and all races and every endurance event. They do. It's called the side of the road.
00:33:40,00:33:46,Wasn't it stopped also in 2017 because it wasn't stormy enough?
00:33:46,00:33:51,"Yeah, I think it was. There was an absolute because they need a certain level of wind,"
00:33:51,00:33:54,"don't they? So if it doesn't come, it doesn't come. And also the wind needs to be"
00:33:54,00:33:58,in exactly the right direction. So that's why they can only do it three days in advance.
00:33:58,00:34:01,"They need to know that the wind is not just going to be there, but it's going to be coming"
00:34:01,00:34:06,"directly over the bridge. Yes. And this bridge is an amazing bridge, right? This is the Ooster"
00:34:06,00:34:12,Shelterkring and it's a bridge that is basically a storm barrier bridge. And they're very proud of
00:34:12,00:34:17,"it there. They have a little inscription on the stone, which says here the tide is ruled by the"
00:34:17,00:34:23,"wind, the moon and us. It's sort of they're so proud of how strong it is, which I saw on a video"
00:34:23,00:34:27,"by your buddy, Tom Scott. Really worth watching if you're listening to us right now. Talk about"
00:34:27,00:34:32,this. He's on the side of the road. The wind is blowing in his head and he's seeing people
00:34:32,00:34:37,ride past him. It's fantastic. Isn't that sort of the beginning of an ancient Greek story about
00:34:37,00:34:41,hubris where you end up going swept away by the tide because you try to control what only God
00:34:41,00:34:46,"can control? Yeah, it's King Canute, isn't it? It's Canute. I think the Dutch are winning at the"
00:34:46,00:34:51,moment. They're nailing it. You're right. Those Dutch bikes are really hard to cycle fast on. The
00:34:51,00:34:58,"ones which don't have a bar at the top from the front to the back, they force you to cycle in"
00:34:58,00:35:04,a really sedate way. Another good race is the Red Bull Time Lapse. And they call that the longest
00:35:04,00:35:13,one day road cycling events. Do you know how many hours it's for? 24. No. 25 because they do it when
00:35:13,00:35:19,"the clocks go back. Is that right? When the clocks go back. Yeah. It's quite cool, isn't it? Yeah. And"
00:35:19,00:35:24,it's just a 6.2km course and they see how many laps they can do in 25 hours. Nice. You could do
00:35:24,00:35:30,the shortest one day cycling event where you just cross the international date line. Yeah. Yeah.
00:35:30,00:35:34,"And you know, it's a second. And you're just like, oh, I've been cycling for a day. Yeah. And actually,"
00:35:34,00:35:38,it's just one second. That's great. Apart from you're probably in the middle of the ocean. You're
00:35:38,00:35:44,"dead, but you're a smug. There's a bunch of cycling things that you can do where it's underwater,"
00:35:44,00:35:49,"so underwater cycling. Oh, cool. And it's quite nice the way that they get the bike to stay"
00:35:49,00:35:53,"at the bottom, which is they take all the air out of the bike wheels and they fill it with water."
00:35:53,00:35:56,"Okay. So when you plunge in, you just sink to the bottom with it and it becomes easy to ride. How"
00:35:56,00:36:02,do they deal with the fact that humans are quite buoyant? They replace all the air in their lungs
00:36:02,00:36:08,"with water. Eventually, that's probably what happens, isn't it? Yeah. Do you have to have"
00:36:08,00:36:11,"weights? Oh, yeah, weights. Yeah, weight belts and things like that to keep you down. Yeah, I'm not"
00:36:11,00:36:15,"sure. Yeah, I didn't see that in the photo that I saw. Because some of them go quite deep, don't"
00:36:15,00:36:18,"they, the underwater ones? Yeah. There's one, the underwater bike race in North Carolina,"
00:36:18,00:36:24,"which seems to be the home of underwater bike racing, where it's 60 feet underwater. And the"
00:36:24,00:36:30,race is across this shipwreck of a German U-boat called the Indra. Wow. And you ride 100 foot.
00:36:30,00:36:33,"Doesn't that, that's the kind of thing you're going to book a holiday to go and do? I don't"
00:36:33,00:36:38,"really like cycling or swimming, but I like the sound of that. That sounds amazing. I don't like"
00:36:38,00:36:47,"chess or boxing, but I like it. I was looking at slipstreams, this is a movement in cycling."
00:36:47,00:36:52,"Absolutely. And so slipstream, of course, is when you're, so you can get in a slipstream,"
00:36:52,00:36:55,"for instance, if you're on a bicycle and you're behind a big vehicle, I do not recommend you do"
00:36:55,00:37:00,this. But the vehicle sort of pushes the air out of the way in front of it. So it creates this
00:37:00,00:37:06,sort of negative pressure around you. But the record for how far someone's cycled in a slipstream
00:37:06,00:37:13,is held by a woman who's Denise Muller-Koroneck and she went at 184 miles an hour in 2018 behind
00:37:13,00:37:18,"a race car. Isn't that incredible? That is incredible. So she's pedaling, right? Yeah, yeah,"
00:37:18,00:37:22,"you've got to be pedaling. So you can't, she's in such a high gear that you couldn't possibly"
00:37:22,00:37:27,start. So they have to get pulled along by the car at first until they're going at 100 miles an hour
00:37:27,00:37:33,and then released and then you peddle along behind the car. Wow. She can move on too. Can I just talk
00:37:33,00:37:38,"about one, can I just talk about one other slipstream guy who I love who's the guy, this guy"
00:37:38,00:37:44,"called Charles Minthorn, mile a minute Murphy, mile a minute was added later. He was the first"
00:37:44,00:37:50,"person to ride a bicycle a mile in under a minute. He was an 18, this is an 1899 and he persuaded a"
00:37:50,00:37:53,train engineer because trains were the only things that could go fast enough at the time
00:37:53,00:37:57,"to build the next track for him that he could cycle along. And then, so two miles of track"
00:37:57,00:38:02,"and then he would get dragged behind it in the slipstream. And so he spent, he spent 12 years"
00:38:02,00:38:07,"planning this, dreaming about it, fantasizing about it. And at first it didn't work because"
00:38:07,00:38:12,"the train couldn't go fast enough. So he was there capable of cycling, the train couldn't go fast"
00:38:12,00:38:17,"enough. Eventually they got a bigger, better, faster train and he ended up going so fast,"
00:38:17,00:38:21,burning rubber was flying up in his face because the track was warping and stuff. But
00:38:21,00:38:26,"lots of people were watching and he, it got to the end of the track. So he's going faster than the"
00:38:26,00:38:30,"train at one point because he got, he fell behind a bit because he lifted his hand up to sort of"
00:38:30,00:38:35,"wave at one of his trainers and I was like, oh fuck, I've just lost 50 feet. So he caught up with"
00:38:35,00:38:39,the train going faster than the train. The bloody guy driving the steam train just cut the steam as
00:38:39,00:38:48,"soon as he got to the end. And so Charles went slamming the track, flew of his bike at 60 miles"
00:38:48,00:38:52,"an hour and somehow got caught, there were two people standing in the train, one caught one"
00:38:52,00:39:03,"on the other side and they saved him. That is amazing. Okay, it is time for our final fact of"
00:39:03,00:39:12,the show and that is Anna. My fact is that every week planes drop 15 million flies on the border
00:39:12,00:39:19,"between Columbia and Panama. Okay, so we're expected to believe that but a scuba diver in a tree"
00:39:21,00:39:26,"is perfect. Maybe the scuba divers hurling them out of the plane and he fell out too,"
00:39:26,00:39:34,"I don't know. This is this incredible, not a story, true, true fact. And I read it in an"
00:39:34,00:39:39,"article in The Atlantic by Sarah Zhang, it's a brilliant article, but it's about how it's 14.7"
00:39:39,00:39:45,million screw worm adults. So the flies of the screw worm are dropped over this border and it's
00:39:45,00:39:51,in order to keep down screw worm populations weirdly and it's been happening for over 50 years
00:39:51,00:39:56,and it's because they're a terrible pest so they were this awful blight in the US because they
00:39:56,00:40:02,destroy livestock for reasons that I have no doubt will go into in disgusting detail. So they started
00:40:02,00:40:06,"looking into how to get rid of them, it was sort of in the 1950s the US Department of Agriculture"
00:40:06,00:40:15,"started looking into eradicating them and decided to sterilize a bunch of screw worms, drop them"
00:40:15,00:40:20,"all over the continent and then those guys would shag, male screw worms they drop, those guys would"
00:40:20,00:40:25,"shag the females who only shag once in their life so if you shag a sterilized male that's it,"
00:40:25,00:40:31,you're not having kids and thusly the screw worm blight is ended. So the screw worm was screwed
00:40:31,00:40:38,"by screwing, you could say. Very nice. I could say that, should be their logo. And we should say,"
00:40:38,00:40:43,"I don't know if you said this Anna, but the reason why it's in Panama, between Colombia and Panama,"
00:40:43,00:40:48,"is they eradicated these flies from the whole of North America, but they still exist in South"
00:40:48,00:40:54,"America and the bit where Panama is is obviously very, very thin bit of land. So if they can make"
00:40:54,00:40:59,"sure that nothing gets past that little bit of land, then it means that nothing will come into"
00:40:59,00:41:04,"North America. So that's why they flood Panama and Colombia with it, just to kind of create a barrier."
00:41:04,00:41:09,"And also to make a big buffer zone, I think, because at first they did try to make it a barrier"
00:41:09,00:41:13,"with Mexico, but because that's just a bit too close, Mexico is right there, they were like,"
00:41:13,00:41:18,we've got to make this big buffer zone. It's like the Eastern Bloc in the Cold War.
00:41:18,00:41:23,"Can we talk about the worms and how horrific they are? They lay their eggs in open wounds,"
00:41:23,00:41:27,that's what their jam is. And sometimes they go for mucus membranes if they can't find an open
00:41:27,00:41:32,"wound, but that's why they're so painful and horrific. So you're living in a mucus membrane,"
00:41:32,00:41:36,"are you? Yes, yeah, but we're saving up and we hope to find an open wound soon."
00:41:36,00:41:42,"Yeah. And then they sort of chew their way. They chew their way really deep as well,"
00:41:42,00:41:46,like they can get two inches down and they're just awful. They're awful animals.
00:41:46,00:41:52,There was a British tourist called Rochelle Harris in 2013 who had a screw fly who went into her ear.
00:41:52,00:41:57,And there was like this weird buzzing and scratching and stuff and she didn't really
00:41:57,00:42:01,know what it was. And eventually they found out that she had these flesh-eating worms
00:42:01,00:42:06,living inside her head. And then they interviewed her afterwards. I think this is mine in the
00:42:06,00:42:10,"Daily Mail. They interviewed her afterwards and she said, ""I no longer as squeamish as I once was"
00:42:10,00:42:16,"about bugs. How can you be after they've been inside your head?"" I just think that would make"
00:42:16,00:42:22,me more squeamish. Way less likely to lie down in the garden if I've had a load of screw worms
00:42:22,00:42:25,in the brain. It sounds like one stayed in there and is running the show now.
00:42:29,00:42:34,"That's such a good idea. Their name, it literally means flesh-eating, which I love."
00:42:34,00:42:42,So their scientific name is the Cochleomia hominivorax. And hominid is man and vorax
00:42:42,00:42:48,"like voracious as eating. So man devouring, which is fitting. Yeah. The actual discovery"
00:42:48,00:42:54,of the idea of sterilizing all of these screw worms and dropping them over had been called in
00:42:54,00:43:00,the New York Times in 1970 the single most original thought in the 20th century. That was
00:43:00,00:43:05,according to a lot of scientists at the time because it was down to a guy called Edward F.
00:43:05,00:43:11,"Kipning. Sorry, Edward F. Knippling. Knippling? Knippling. I'd say it's Knippling. It's usually"
00:43:11,00:43:15,"a silent case, isn't it? Yeah, I think it's Knippling. Either way, we can agree he does not"
00:43:15,00:43:25,"make exceedingly good case. Well, let's say Knippling. And he used to, as a child, he used"
00:43:25,00:43:32,"to watch adult screw worms mate. And he obsessed over it, not in a sexy way. He was watching a lot"
00:43:32,00:43:40,"of his animals on a farm be devoured by these horrible flesh-eating species. And so, yeah,"
00:43:40,00:43:44,apparently that was just such an original thought that some scientists claim it's the single most
00:43:44,00:43:48,"original thought in the 20th century. Yeah, that was before the internet was invented, wasn't it?"
00:43:48,00:43:55,"He was really amazing, this Edward Knippling. He died relatively recently, I think, and I saw"
00:43:55,00:44:00,"a few obituaries of him. Apparently, he named all of his pets after insects. Isn't that cool?"
00:44:00,00:44:08,"But his pets were not insects? No, he had Siamese cats, Colton, Anthonomous, and Culex,"
00:44:08,00:44:12,that were named after a type of cotton ball weevil and a type of mosquito.
00:44:12,00:44:20,Do you know how you get a screw worm out of someone? Do you lure it out somehow?
00:44:20,00:44:26,You do. You use a treatment called bacon therapy. Which sounds like such a much more enjoyable
00:44:26,00:44:33,thing that it actually is. It's just a little jamming raw pork into the breathing holes that
00:44:33,00:44:39,"the worm has. And it either suffocates and pushes its way out, or it finds it yummy and sort of"
00:44:39,00:44:44,"goes towards the bacon. It is like fishing, though, isn't it? I couldn't tell. It's so weird"
00:44:44,00:44:48,"when they say that you use it to block up their air holes, because they're really small. I mean,"
00:44:48,00:44:52,that is a tiny rash of bacon. So I think they're attracting them to them. And once you've got
00:44:52,00:44:57,"sort of 10 or 11 on your bacon, you reel it in, I suppose, don't you? If you think it's like"
00:44:57,00:45:03,"fishing, I'm not coming to your restaurant in the middle of London Bridge. The maggot sandwich."
00:45:03,00:45:08,Flies off the shelves. They're a kind of blow fly. And I was wondering why we call blow flies
00:45:08,00:45:14,blow flies. And I think it's because they... So the first reference to flies being associated with
00:45:14,00:45:19,the word blows comes from Shakespeare and around that time. And it was people would refer to flies
00:45:19,00:45:27,"blowing you. So Cleopatra says, ""Lay me stark naked and let flies blow me."" And that's rather..."
00:45:27,00:45:33,She wants that to happen rather than being taken prisoner. It's not as pleasant as you might
00:45:33,00:45:39,think. It's more about something is referred to being fly blown when flies had laid their eggs
00:45:39,00:45:44,"all over it, basically. I mean, if you go and see a prostitute and ask her to blow you, then make"
00:45:44,00:45:51,sure she doesn't come along with a load of maggots. Tip a pile of maggots on your knee.
00:45:51,00:45:57,"You've got to be very careful. It's possible, is all I'm saying. If she happens to be an entomologist"
00:45:57,00:46:05,"in her spare time. A lot of crossover between the two. So they do actually blow bubbles blow flies,"
00:46:05,00:46:09,even though it's not what they call blow flies. They're forever blowing bubbles.
00:46:09,00:46:14,And it's to keep them cool. This was discovered quite recently and it's blow flies in Brazil.
00:46:14,00:46:19,It's actually latrine blow flies. So they hang around in toilets and they do this really clever
00:46:19,00:46:24,"thing where when they get hot, they blow brown bubbles out of their mouth, which I imagine are"
00:46:24,00:46:30,"brown because they're latrine blow flies. And the brown bubbles, when they're blown, they lose lots"
00:46:30,00:46:35,of heat because heat evaporates off them and then they pop and they suck them back in and then that
00:46:35,00:46:39,"spits a bit cooler. It cools the head right down. It's really clever, that, isn't it?"
00:46:39,00:46:45,Yeah. It's like having bubblegum and then blowing it and then it gets cold on the outside and then
00:46:45,00:46:49,you suck it back into your body and get the coolness. Exactly. If your bubblegum was made of other
00:46:49,00:46:55,"people's feces, which is not a hubba-bubba flavour as far as I know."
00:46:55,00:47:03,I've just got one more thing. I started looking into insect factories off the back of this because
00:47:03,00:47:08,"there's a factory which grows these screwworms. There's a firm called EntoCycle, which is currently"
00:47:08,00:47:15,hoping to breed millions and millions of soldier flies and then turn them into protein powder.
00:47:15,00:47:19,"So you breed millions of flies, which are eating rubbish. They're eating old coffee grounds."
00:47:19,00:47:24,"And then do they give that to like cattle and stuff, is that right?"
00:47:24,00:47:27,Exactly. That's the hope. And then the hope is that you don't need so much
00:47:27,00:47:35,soya to be grown and that takes up land that used to be the Amazon rainforest.
00:47:35,00:47:39,"So yeah, it's a genius idea. And this firm, EntoCycle, is based in London Bridge."
00:47:39,00:47:41,"Oh, yeah."
00:47:41,00:47:51,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening."
