00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,200
 Hello and welcome to another Working from Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,840
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,360
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin,

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,080
 Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tijinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,520
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,320
 Starting with you, Andy.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,600
 My fact is that spies can tell what people are saying by looking at the lights in the room they're in.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,960
 So this is a new spying technique which has been discovered or, I don't know what you do with spying

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,200
 techniques, but it's been found out by researchers from the Ben Gurion University of the Negev

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,520
 and the Weissmann Institute of Science. And what they've found is that there are lots of different

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,680
 ways of eavesdropping on people, and this one is called LAMPHONE. And what it means is,

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,640
 if we're all talking in our rooms, if there's a light bulb and it has to be a hanging light bulb,

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,400
 so you know, a classic bulb, your conversation will make tiny, tiny vibrations on the surface

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,520
 and that will slightly affect the light inside the bulb. And you can get very cheap equipment,

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,840
 like cost a couple of hundred dollars, and you just observe the light bulb from outside the room,

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,960
 and you can pick up what people are talking about. You can decode speeches.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,680
 Yeah, so you can, it's not like Morse, it's not translating into Morse, you can pick up the actual

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,440
 sound? Well, I think it has to be translated from light bulb language into sound.

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,720
 So it is light bulb language? Yeah, but they can even, you can shazam the song that someone is playing

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,440
 in a room. That's how, yeah. It's amazing, isn't it? And they reckon that they took a snippet of a

22
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,520
 speech by Donald Trump, and they could understand what he was saying, which is quite impressive,

23
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,240
 because most people can't understand what he's saying most of the time anyway.

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,560
 Can we do a light bulb episode of Fish that we just release in light bulb language and

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,880
 people can decode down the line? Yeah, good idea. Yeah, that won't present any technical problems.

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,440
 It's hard enough to get on Zoom, Dan. Is this, do they use lasers for this to reflect, because you

27
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,280
 can't just pin your ear to the window and listen to the vibrations coming off the light bulb or

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,880
 anything, presumably. Is it lasers they bounce off it? Yeah, it's invisible lasers. So you won't

29
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,160
 notice a kind of sniper dot on your light bulb, so you won't be able to tell you being spider.

30
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,280
 What it is actually, I believe not a laser, I think. I think it's just a telescope,

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,640
 so you get the light and an electro optical sensor. Now that might have a laser in it,

32
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,240
 for all I know, but I think what it is, it takes the light in and it can sense the very,

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,480
 very slight changes in light. Can I just say why I flubbed that? It's because there's a separate

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,920
 thing called a laser microphone, which was, this was used, this is where you fire a laser at the

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,560
 windows of a room and you can eavesdrop that way. And this was used in 2013 in a place called a

36
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,680
 botter bed and it was used to find out that there was an extra person inside a building in a botter

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,160
 bed and that extra person who never left the building turned out to be Osama Bin Laden.

38
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,200
 So that's how they found out there was an extra person inside that building who never went outside.

39
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,920
 And do you know who invented this, this laser? No. It was Leon Theramen, the inventor of the

40
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:41,120
 Theramen. That instrument? Do the noise again, Dan? You should explain what the Theramen is,

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,720
 as well as doing that excellent impersonation. I think we have mentioned it before.

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,600
 Yeah, so Theramans are, you will have seen them possibly as an instrument that I don't,

43
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,240
 I actually don't know how they work technically. They give off electromagnetic waves, don't they,

44
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,520
 and your hand can disrupt them and they make a noise. Yeah, so people use their hand, if you see

45
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,240
 them sort of pushing forward and backwards their hand, it will sort of make that kind of...

46
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,000
 Yeah, it's basically a ghost impression is what it sounds like.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,120
 So Leon Theramen invented what basically was the precursor to the modern laser microphone that we

48
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,320
 have today and it was used by the Soviet Union and he was given a Stalin prize for inventing this,

49
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,400
 what was advanced espionage technology. So Theramen found Osama Bin Laden.

50
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,000
 Wow. That's amazing. That's sort of spooky.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,360
 The other thing that Theramen did really interestingly was he had invented basically

52
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,240
 like the technology you have on contactless credit cards. He put one of those in a giant wooden seal

53
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,680
 and when I say seal, I don't mean the animal. I mean like kind of a symbol of the United States

54
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,640
 and then gave it to the US embassy somewhere, I think, and they had it up in their room,

55
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,960
 but what they didn't realise is there was a tiny chip in there and that they could hear

56
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,640
 what was happening by using this contactless technology, I think.

57
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,320
 Yep. Yeah, you're completely right.

58
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,520
 They didn't have to go up to the seal. The Soviets didn't have to go up to the seal

59
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,760
 and then sort of tap on it to get the sound files out, but they sort of fired electromagnetic

60
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,760
 beams at it, didn't they? And that activated it, just like your oyster card is activated

61
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,920
 by the ticket stand. It was called the thing.

62
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,080
 The thing? That's what it's called. The seal was called the thing.

63
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,040
 Soviet school children gave it to the US embassy or the US ambassador in 1945 and they managed to

64
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,200
 get seven years of espionage recording out of it. Wow, that's so cool.

65
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,160
 How did they make sure the US ambassador put it in the right room?

66
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,880
 It was so big, I think, that I had to go on the wall somewhere. I don't think they could guarantee

67
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,120
 the room, but also it was completely made of wood, so they thought this is definitely safe.

68
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,880
 There's no way this is a spying tool.

69
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,400
 And the really clever thing about those kind of chips that you have in your credit card and in

70
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,240
 your oyster card is they don't need any power, do they? All the power comes from the thing that's

71
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,080
 scanning them. You know, Edward Snowden, he has a secret device to stop himself being spied on,

72
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,200
 which is a blanket over his head. Is that what inspires you? Because you do that sometimes

73
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,960
 when we record. And I thought it was just to embellish the ghost impression that you've been

74
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,000
 honing. That's just social anxiety. But Edward Snowden has, he calls it his magic mantle of

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,840
 power. And basically, it's to stop targeted video surveillance. Because obviously, if you're

76
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,120
 Edward Snowden, you know, leaking secrets, there's a chance someone will be trying to

77
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,480
 spy on you. So he just puts a blanket over his head when he types his password in.

78
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,560
 I remember reading an article about, was it Glenn Greenwald who interviewed him?

79
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,360
 Yeah, someone like that. And they said that whenever they went into his hotel room or his

80
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,160
 house or whatever, they always made you put your phone in the microwave as soon as you

81
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,480
 walked in. That was what you always had to do. I think Snowden makes people put it in the

82
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,720
 refrigerator. I'll just see. It's his. Yeah. How does it work, Andy, though? If he's put it over

83
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,920
 his head, he's not going to be able to see what he's typing. A, but also it's just his eyeballs

84
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:08,000
 that I'm not seeing. I reckon Edward Snowden can touch type. But still, what are they recording?

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,600
 All of him is under the blanket. Oh, he's in a port. No, he's not. Well, yes. He's got a blanket

86
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,280
 over his head and his hands, basically. It's in case there's someone, the camera in the room that

87
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,120
 would fill what he's typing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you've got to assume that he's done the very

88
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,640
 basic putting masking tape over the camera on his laptop, because if he's missed that trick,

89
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,800
 he's an absolute nobody. Actually, you know what they can tell what you're typing by just

90
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,960
 listening to the sound of your typing on your keyboard. So there are some researchers at

91
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,000
 the University of California, Berkeley, actually, it's Doug Tiger and his team. And they've worked

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,720
 out every time you click a button, it makes a very, very slightly different sound to the other ones.

93
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,520
 But you can't really tell which one is which. But what you can do is you can take all the clicks

94
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,000
 and then work out the one that comes most often is probably E. And if there are two letters together,

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,520
 these researchers, they realize that it could be T H or it could be E R. And it could definitely not

96
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,160
 be B F, because there are no words with B F next to each other. What the hell of us there are?

97
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,480
 What if you're like, me and my B F are both hardcore spies? Exactly. If you are Edward Snowden,

98
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,720
 here's a little tip for him, and he's in his little fort, and you want to trick the FBI,

99
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,840
 just keep writing about your B F F. He's been a major sort of revealer of a lot of these secrets

100
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,760
 that we've been researching, hasn't he? So he, a lot of stuff came out on the back of his revelations.

101
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,880
 So I think, for instance, when the Guardian was doing their investigation and they got

102
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,240
 hold of a lot of the documents, they were told that they weren't allowed to keep any of the Edward

103
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,080
 Snowden files in their offices because the government thought that they could be spied on

104
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,800
 by laser microphones, just bouncing off their glasses of water and stuff like that. So it's

105
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,520
 not just the windows. It's if you've got a mug of tea or anything similar to that, they could do that.

106
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,560
 And yeah, he's in the wake of his revelations, a lot of countries took action to make sure that

107
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,160
 the US or the NSA couldn't spy on them too much anymore. So Germany, for instance, invested in a

108
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,840
 whole bunch of typewriters, which I don't know if this would have solved the typing issue. But the

109
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,200
 idea is that if you're writing on a typewriter, there's no digital memory of it anywhere. You've

110
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,880
 just got it on a bit of paper in that weird old school font. And then I guess you just post it

111
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,040
 to somebody. But it is quite annoying if you need to share a document with 20 other people.

112
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,480
 But yeah, and Russia, I think, spent 10 grand on antique typewriters after that.

113
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,400
 Really? Do any of you guys have a typewriter? I have one. And they're a pain to use compared with a

114
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,800
 computer. They're so annoying. Like they just always get stuck and whenever you make a mistake,

115
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,240
 you can't press delete.

116
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,360
 James, why are you writing on a typewriter? That's a big question for me.

117
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
 Well, you know, I'm married to a Russian.

118
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,400
 No, I got one as a gift and I really liked it. And I thought I might try typing on it,

119
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,720
 but it's really a fucking annoying. It does seem like a pain.

120
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,440
 It must be so annoying for all these people who work in spy centres coming up with new ways of

121
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,480
 spying on people that some dorky scientists are just publishing these papers going, "Oh,

122
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,280
 we found out that they must be reading light bulbs." Because I'm like, "Damn it, that took me years."

123
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,640
 I created the technology to read light bulbs and now we're going to look for something else.

124
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,040
 What next? Yeah, because some people do that. People, I think there's a company, a data analysis

125
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,680
 company called Palantir, which is used by the US Secret Service. So they must know what they're

126
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,600
 doing. And they have designed their windows to have these things that they call acoustic transducers

127
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,920
 on them, which basically, if you try to use the window vibrations, it just sends out white

128
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,840
 noise or something. Maybe it sends out some kind of ha ha prank tube message to anyone.

129
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,160
 That would be brilliant if you could hack your window to send other messages out.

130
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,360
 But I think, isn't that why governments would use net curtains? I think that's why,

131
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,680
 because that supposedly dampened the vibrations. Other governments which use net curtains,

132
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,960
 because I also think them with suburbia in the 1950s. You have to have an old lady peering around

133
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,960
 them to see what the neighbours are doing. You know, the Sopranos, the great TV series,

134
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:28,160
 the mobster TV series. So it was so realistic. It was so on point for what would happen in the

135
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,200
 real life of a mobster, that mobsters started thinking there must be someone on the inside who

136
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,440
 was leaking information to the writers and producers of the show. And we know that they had those

137
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,680
 conversations because the FBI were actually wiretapping the mobsters who had that conversation

138
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,400
 and fed that back to the writers and producers of the Sopranos. But they used to listen into

139
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,560
 conversations of mobsters going, "Did you see the Sopranos on Sunday? How did they know that we

140
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,720
 do that kind of thing?" Come on, Dad, you could have done it better. Italian-American accent.

141
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:13,120
 Nope, he couldn't. Turns out, Dan, you sounded like a Kiwi. You sounded New Zealandish, which is

142
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,400
 the opposite of being a New Jersey you're trying to get. You did New Zealand. Do you think New

143
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,720
 Zealand is the opposite of being in the Sopranos? Because that probably is quite close. A harmless

144
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,720
 Kiwi. Pretty much is. Yeah, you're right. Dan, you know what you were saying about

145
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,560
 what is annoying that all these secrets come out? It must be irritating if you're in the

146
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,240
 Secret Service. So I have a suspicion that everything we found out is all just fake news

147
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,080
 that's subtly put out by the CIA or MI5 to throw us off the scent. Because it's just so much they

148
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:52,000
 release. Or, Anna, sorry, by Big Lumpshade. Could be them. The Lumpshade companies trying to make us

149
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,400
 buy Lumpshades. You're absolutely bang on. Or candle. James, you're 1950s house. You've got your

150
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:07,760
 neck curtains. You've got your big fringe Lumpshade. The typewriter's out. I am from Murder She Wrote.

151
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:15,280
 She has a kerfletcher on over. Sorry, Anna. So Big Lumpshade, or whoever it is, has put out this

152
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,000
 fake news. Because this stuff that comes out is amazing. So there's a book called Spycraft,

153
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,960
 which came out in 2009. And it was written by the head of the Office of Technical Service,

154
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,840
 which is the CIA department that's responsible for all of their gadgets. So it's written by

155
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,360
 this former head of that. And he just revealed this amazing stuff. But it sounds so implausible.

156
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,920
 So he said that they used to, when they met business people or politicians or diplomats,

157
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,320
 they'd hand out gifts. And all the gifts would have devices placed in them.

158
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,160
 So a bit like these schoolchildren. So they'd hand out books or lighters or flower pots,

159
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,440
 apparently. But you just think if you're-- Wait a minute. If you're going to give a gift, right?

160
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,680
 Don't give a flower pot, which they might put outside. You need to give them something that

161
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,560
 would-- Oh, here's a milk bottle as a gift. It's like you've got to give them something

162
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,200
 that they'll definitely keep in the house. You're so right. The only noise you get from

163
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,040
 that is wind and then squirrels and foxes desperately digging through earth.

164
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,480
 I saw an amazing video online just while we're on the CIA. So the CIA has a chief of disguise,

165
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,280
 which I didn't know. And the former chief of disguise does this video. She's called John

166
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,440
 Amendez. And it's amazing. This video is her sitting talking about how you can slip into

167
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,600
 a disguise very quickly or the elaborate ways that they do it. And during the video,

168
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,320
 she slowly goes into different disguises. So sometimes she's an old man. And it's really

169
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,880
 incredible. And she was talking about a lot of the mythology of CIA disguise and what they do,

170
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,160
 particularly the Mission Impossible movies with wearing the sort of fake head. And that's not

171
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,320
 far from the truth of what they did. And there's this fantastic set of photos when she went to

172
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,440
 meet George Bush Sr. to tell him about what they were up to, that she sat doing the whole meeting.

173
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,040
 And then near the end, rips off her mask and has a different-- her real head underneath and

174
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,880
 Bush didn't notice the entire time. You can see these photos. Highly recommend.

175
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,920
 But he didn't notice her ripping off her own face.

176
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,640
 No, he sort of looked at it. He didn't just carry on with the meeting.

177
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,560
 I thought this was late in the presidency where he wasn't really paying attention anymore.

178
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,160
 No, he didn't notice that she had a fake head on during the meeting.

179
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,760
 I do not found it suspicious that Mrs. Doubtfire wanted to have a meeting with him in the first

180
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:32,240
 place. Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is James.

181
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,480
 Okay, my fact this week is that London Bridge was destroyed by a tornado in 1091.

182
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,400
 What? Like, I can't believe I didn't know this already. I thought,

183
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,920
 why are they not teaching it in schools?

184
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,520
 Why is it not a great movie? Yeah, this is incredible, this fact.

185
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,080
 This was one of the first London bridges. In fact, probably the first one we 100%

186
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,480
 definitely know about. There will have been some before, but we're not quite sure what happened

187
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,040
 to them. But it was William the Conqueror. He came into London in 1066.

188
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,200
 And one of his first things that he did when his army came in was they built a new bridge

189
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,400
 over the River Thames. And it was just 25 years later that it was completely demolished by a tornado.

190
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,200
 And we don't know much about it because obviously people didn't write much down in those days.

191
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,920
 But 12th century historian William of Malmesbury says that it was completely wrecked.

192
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,160
 There were also churches that were wrecked, and there were more than 600 houses that were

193
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,360
 completely flattened. And we now think that it was what's called an F4 tornado,

194
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,480
 which is the second strongest tornado you can get with winds over 200 miles an hour.

195
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,320
 Amazing. Is it how? Did he call it a tornado at the time?

196
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,040
 I've just realized, I mean, did he call it a mighty wind or something else like that?

197
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,200
 Because presumably they didn't have the word then, did they?

198
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,720
 It's such a good question. They won't have had the word. So that's, yeah, you answered your own

199
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,760
 question. Actually, what a bad question. You knew the answer. You were wasting everyone's time.

200
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,880
 I didn't know. And only two people were killed, apparently, in this tornado.

201
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,080
 That's so weird. Was no one in any of the 600 or whatever houses that were falling down?

202
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,720
 It's so weird, isn't it? Everyone's out at work.

203
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,360
 It sounds extraordinarily powerful. So the church of St Mary LeBeau had 26-foot-high

204
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,000
 rafters, and apparently they were driven so far into the earth by this tornado

205
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 that only four feet of them remained above ground, which I was thinking,

206
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,120
 because Mary LeBeau is a very famous church in London for those people who aren't Londoners,

207
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,040
 because that's if you're born within the sound of the bells of Mary LeBeau,

208
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,760
 then you are officially a cockney. And I'm guessing the bells weren't functioning once

209
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,920
 it was driven into the ground. So anyone born in that period couldn't be a cockney.

210
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,720
 That's incredible. How does that work that it shoved it into the ground? That's like a giant

211
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,400
 screwdriver. I mean, I'm just putting myself in their place. We don't know what this thing was.

212
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,440
 There was a giant spinny screwdriver in the sky, and it's drilled some of our big panels into the

213
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,920
 ground. Well, that's when they changed traditional church architecture away from the screwdriver

214
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:12,480
 design, to less easy to drive into the ground shape. That just seems... But that's a lot that's

215
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,200
 20 feet to go into the ground. London ground's very swampy. It's a lot. Look, they didn't have

216
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,000
 such good tarmac then. But the other thing that's interesting is that I think the London

217
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,920
 Bridge that would have been destroyed by this tornado would have been way bigger than

218
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,000
 modern London Bridge, because the river was so much wider at the time. That's a good point.

219
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 The river used to be about four or five times as wide as it is today. A lot of it's been reclaimed,

220
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,440
 so it would have been absolutely enormous. Yeah. I did read about a potential precursor

221
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,240
 to this London Bridge, which is much debated, but a lot of serious journals do think that

222
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,680
 sides on the fact that it did exist. And it's off the back of something that we know from Nordic

223
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,480
 Law, which was... There was a period in 1014 when Ethel the Unready had been trying to reclaim

224
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,840
 England. Is Ethel the Unready related to Ethel Red the Unready? It was his mum.

225
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,640
 Yeah, it was Ethel Red. Ethel Red. Sorry, I said as they were wrong. Yeah. Annoyingly,

226
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,200
 this fact has so much English history that I have to get to before I can explain the basic thing.

227
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,240
 The basic thing is the Danes were in charge of London at that point, and London Bridge was very

228
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,040
 much a spot where they could arm the whole thing with people of bows and arrows for anyone who

229
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:32,240
 was coming down the Thames. And so there was a Viking called Olaf who tied ropes underneath the

230
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,880
 bridge and went underneath with the tide and pulled London Bridge down, forcing all the soldiers

231
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,800
 to die and perish in the water. It was over 200 soldiers and helped for reclaiming England for

232
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:52,560
 the British as opposed to the Danes. And a poet called Ota Stavte did a poem which was London

233
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,760
 Bridge is Broken Down, Gold is One and Bright Rione. There's more to it, but that line London

234
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,360
 Bridge is Broken Down is thought to have inspired London Bridge is Falling Down.

235
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,840
 What's really interesting is about the London Bridge is Falling Down thing, which is a lot of

236
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,840
 people think that it might be to do with that story. But then on the other hand, before that,

237
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:17,360
 there were other songs throughout the whole of Europe. So you would have Die Magdeburger Brück,

238
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,560
 the Magdeburg Bridge in Germany. And it was basically exactly the same idea of a bridge

239
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:29,280
 that would fall down. And a lot of nursery rhyme historians think that what happened was this was

240
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,160
 quite common kind of European song. And then when it came over to Britain, they just gave it the

241
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,080
 name of the capital city's most famous bridge. My favorite version of the London Bridge was the

242
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,480
 one that was there during Shakespearean times. It just sounds like the most fascinating thing to

243
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,480
 have ever walked across. It was packed with houses that were up to four stories high.

244
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,280
 It had restaurants on it, restaurants that when you went to them, the way you would order your

245
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,160
 food is you would get fish as a sandwich, right? And they would open a trapdoor and they would put

246
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,320
 down a fishing rod. They would catch the fish live, reel it up, and then slap it raw in between

247
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,480
 bread and give it to you. So many questions. First, worst restaurant ever. If you're just going to

248
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:21,600
 raw food, it's sushi. Can I say second, how are you going to guarantee if it's the Thames in the

249
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,840
 sixtieth century that you're not going to reel in a turd? Bingo. Well, that was the exciting

250
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,560
 element of your dining experience. That's where the phrase comes from. I'd rather eat a shit sandwich

251
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:38,240
 than this restaurant. And third, as we know, the sandwich in this country hadn't really been invented

252
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,520
 yet. So it doesn't make any sense. They would have reeled the fish up and had two bits of bread and

253
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,560
 gone, God, we don't know how to put this together. So why have you read this stuff? This is amazing.

254
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,720
 I read this in a book by Dr Matthew Green, a book called London, A Travel Guide Through Time.

255
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,440
 And this was a book that was published by my wife. And it's the most fascinating chapter

256
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,080
 because he takes you back to the time. So he has someone walking across the bridge in Shakespearean

257
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,840
 times. It would take you two hours to walk the length of the entire bridge. It was so congested.

258
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,080
 And there's always a bit, apparently, during the day where it came to a standstill, because you know

259
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,440
 how there was a polar bear tower at the Tower of London. Sorry, what's it called? Tower of London.

260
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,760
 At the Tower of London. It was during the hour when he would be taken out to the Thames to be

261
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,160
 fed that people would stand and just watch. He would come to a standstill because it was such a

262
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,200
 mad thing that a polar bear would be fishing for food. He'd be stealing sandwiches out of the

263
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,640
 mouths of hungry clientele in the restaurant as well. He's run off with my, oh, what's it called?

264
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,320
 That polar bear wasn't there in Shakespearean times, was he? I thought he was like

265
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,160
 13th century at the latest, wasn't it? I thought so. But this is the same bridge that I'm talking

266
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,600
 about. Because it spanned a long time. In the 14th century, we know how many people were actually

267
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,240
 living on it, because we know the number of rent that was collected from properties. So there were

268
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,560
 198 buildings that were all providing rental revenue from that period. And this was the bridge.

269
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,520
 If you talk about all the London bridges of which there have been dozens of iterations,

270
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,720
 this was the one that lasted, what, 600 years or whatever, or maybe longer even. But it was because

271
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,120
 of this that they eventually dismantled that in the 1820s, because it was so congested.

272
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,920
 But it's also because it was the only bridge. It was literally the only bridge across

273
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,800
 central London until 1739. So it feels weird for them to dismantle it and build another one when

274
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,720
 they could have just built more bridges. Yeah, true. I was reading a count of the dismantling,

275
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,560
 and then they rebuilt it as a wider, more useful bridge. And when they lay the first stone of a

276
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,120
 building or a bridge, and there was this account in the British newspaper archive, it was 1925.

277
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,120
 And the Lord Mayor was invited to lay the foundation stone. And I didn't understand

278
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:56,640
 the ritual at all. So basically, he had a gold trowel with which he sort of dug it up, I guess.

279
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,760
 And then he dropped coins into a box. So there's a wooden box. He drops coins into a box, which

280
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,760
 contains four little glass pillars, seven inches high, a lid to put on the box. And then the box

281
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:14,320
 is covered in cement and installed into a hole in the foundation stone. And then that's dropped.

282
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,160
 So if you went to the bottom of London Bridge now with your scuba gear,

283
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,520
 and then you cut away into some of the stones, in one of them,

284
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,240
 there's this little box full of glass pillars and these coins. Isn't that weird?

285
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,960
 Cool. That's really cool. I know what happened to the previous foundation stone from the previous

286
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,960
 bridge. So was that the 1831 version of London Bridge that you're talking about? Okay. So the

287
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,000
 previous one got, lots of it got sold off as souvenirs. So there are bits of various British

288
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,040
 country houses which are made of old London Bridge. But the stone got turned into a chair,

289
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:54,560
 the foundation stone, in the base of a chair. Where is the chair? It's in Fish Hall, which is

290
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,160
 kind of the fishing guild, the fisherman's guild. And it's right by modern London Bridge now.

291
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,640
 And it's just a fancy chair, basically. That's so sad for that stone. So it spent

292
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,040
 its entire existence watching live fish swimming happily around. And now it's condemned to this

293
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,960
 place full of dead slaughtered fish running for the table. Just have a fisherman's bottom on him

294
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,640
 every now and then. We can't leave London Bridge alone without talking about what happened to

295
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,640
 that new 1831 version, which is now in America. So the idea was that it was sold to an American

296
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,600
 and he got conned, right? That's... Oh, well, people claim that, but he insists he didn't.

297
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,080
 And I suspect he didn't. But yeah, basically, so that London Bridge is now in Havasu,

298
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:42,240
 which is in Arizona, because this crazy millionaire in... It was in 1968, wasn't it,

299
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,160
 that it was put up for sale. And this millionaire in America bought it. And there's always been a

300
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,840
 rumour that he meant to buy Tower Bridge and got the wrong one. But I think he likes that because

301
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,600
 it drummed up even more publicity for the fact that he was moving London Bridge to the desert,

302
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,080
 which everyone thought was insane. It's amazing because they installed it in a dry bit of the

303
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,680
 desert and then they redirected the nearby stream to go under it. So there is water going

304
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,480
 under it now, but the bridge was put there before the water was. Yeah, it is quite weird to have to

305
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:19,280
 build a river in order to satisfy a bridge means. But the weird thing is that London put the bridge

306
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,280
 on sale in 1968. It wasn't like some mad Yosemite Sam millionaire turns up and says, "I want to

307
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,280
 buy that bridge." It was that London was trying to flog it off. Yeah. But who did they think was

308
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,920
 going to buy it? Probably someone with a river. So they were probably quite surprised with this

309
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,680
 guy got it. They probably, when he came over, they were like, "Oh, nice. Yeah, what river are you

310
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:48,960
 going to put it over?" No river. Oh, right. Okay. It is worth saying if this guy did make the mistake

311
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,480
 of Tower Bridge and London Bridge, that possibly a lot of international listeners listening to

312
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,600
 this episode right now are making the very same mistake. The almost iconic bridge that you've

313
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,120
 pictured in your head, that's Tower Bridge. That's one where it opens up in the middle

314
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,680
 and it's got the huge two giant, I don't know what you call them, arches, whatever,

315
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:17,120
 that bridge, the one you're thinking of. London Bridge, very dull. It's terrible. It's horrible.

316
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,480
 So you can understand where this guy is. It's just a road bridge, isn't it? It is. It's just a

317
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:32,080
 straight old bridge that an unimaginative child might draw. Exactly. I did read an amazing thing,

318
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,440
 which was in 1952. This is a fact about Tower Bridge, the one that does open up in the middle.

319
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,960
 If you've ever seen the movie Speed, where they have to jump the gap of a bridge,

320
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,520
 that happened on Tower Bridge with a bus driver in 1952. His name was Albert Gunter

321
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,400
 and he was during December, he was driving the number 78 bus, which goes from Shoreditch to

322
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,680
 Dullitch. The person who would usually ring the bell to say that the bridge was going up

323
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:06,160
 forgot to ring it. He noticed that the bridge was bending upwards as he was driving towards it. He

324
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,840
 didn't have enough time to slam on the brakes because that would have been disaster. So he hit

325
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:17,040
 the accelerator and he jumped. He jumped across. Now, only his side had lifted up and he jumped

326
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:23,360
 a six-foot drop basically onto the northern side of the bridge. It's still a lot on a massive bus.

327
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,920
 Exactly on a massive bus, but yeah, someone jumped the gap of the bridge in 1952.

328
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,560
 Did they remember to put the sign over the tunnel saying, "This bus is on diversion?"

329
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:39,040
 That was not part of the planned route. Yeah, so he was okay in the end. He broke his leg,

330
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,920
 which was the only major problem. 12 of the 20 passengers had minor injuries, but so 21 people

331
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,920
 in total all survived this big bridge jump. And as a reward, he was given £10, which is about

332
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:58,000
 £290 in today's money, and a day off for his bravery. Right. Ah, that's enough time for a

333
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,520
 broken leg to fully heal. Okay, so some stuff on tornadoes. Yeah. It's really difficult to know

334
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,240
 when you read articles about tornadoes, what's real and what isn't real, because they happen

335
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,480
 in the middle of the countryside. The only people who see it are the people who are there at the

336
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,840
 time, and they often seem to come up with some stories that I don't know if they're real or not.

337
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,720
 So there's a story from the start of the 20th century. I think it was in Kansas where there

338
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,760
 was a man with a baby in his arms, and the tornado came and lifted the baby up and deposited it in

339
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:43,360
 a tree, which doesn't sound very true. But this apparently in 1976, this one seems like it might

340
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,160
 have been true. It was in Michigan, there was a tornado, and there was a house which was blown

341
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,400
 by the tornado, so it went onto its side. So people had to use a ladder to get into the front door.

342
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:00,800
 Well, apart from the side thing, it's looking pretty good in here.

343
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:10,880
 But then there are some that are definitely not true. For instance, in this 1915 one in Kansas,

344
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,160
 there was a story that an iron jug was blown inside out.

345
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,720
 Pretty sure that one isn't true.

346
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:26,320
 I read one as well years ago, which was there was a mystery of a scuba diver found in a tree,

347
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,720
 and he was fully, he was fully clothed. No, Dan, no, I know what you're doing.

348
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,680
 Are you doing the famous mental brain teaser where they've been picked up by a,

349
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,360
 they've been scuba diving and they've been picked up by a helicopter that's trying to put out a

350
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,440
 fire. Was that a mental brain teaser? Yeah, that wasn't a real story. I think he's just come across

351
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:56,880
 an amazing fact website. Look at Ollie's anecdotes. Okay, but the room was locked from the inside,

352
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,880
 there were no windows. There's just a puddle of water. The fish were called Romeo and Juliet.

353
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
 But the doctor is his mum.

354
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:15,600
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that this year's

355
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,880
 Dutch national headwind championships was canceled during the race because it was too windy.

356
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,840
 So this is a cycling championship that's been going for the last six years. And the idea is that

357
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,920
 they don't know when it's going to happen. They look out for storms. And as soon as they hear a

358
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,680
 massive storm is on the way, they give everyone three days warning to say, we're going to be doing

359
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,600
 this race. And they have to go down this one strip of 8.5 kilometers. And you just have to ride

360
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,160
 against the wind. And actually, it wasn't the cyclists who pulled out of it. It was the fact

361
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,720
 that it was the trucks carrying the bikes were being toppled over. So they could physically get

362
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,440
 the bikes them. So my friend, Tom Scott, who's a YouTuber was there. Yes. And he did a video about

363
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,600
 this. And he said that they didn't topple over, I think they just it was too dangerous for high

364
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,280
 sided vehicles to go across. So I don't think any trucks actually went over, but they were just

365
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,480
 banned from going over. And what happens is everyone has kind of the same bike that these kind of

366
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,440
 single speed upright bikes, and you cycle across and then this big lorry picks up the bikes and

367
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,080
 takes them all back to the start again. So the next lot of people can go down. And the lorry couldn't

368
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,960
 come across the bridge because it was banned. And instead, it would have to go on like a 20 mile

369
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,080
 route rather than going that way. So they just canceled it halfway through. Yeah, there is another

370
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,960
 way of moving bikes without a truck. And especially is coming back.

371
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:46,640
 This year they were going to they'd gone all out to make it even nicer than the previous events.

372
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,080
 And they had storm resistant seating for the spectators and a special designated vomit zone.

373
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,560
 It's really funny. You can see it's these three big bin bags that are sort of hung up and it has

374
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,280
 a big placard that says vomit zone. And there's little bike handles for you to hold as you're

375
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,960
 vomiting into the rubbish bin. You don't want to be stood down wind of that as well, do you?

376
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,680
 Why do they need a vomit zone? Does it get quite lairy? The endurance of doing this race. So they

377
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,040
 say it's it's kind of like if you were going cycling up a hill that was a sort of 10 percent

378
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:25,200
 incline, it feels and you've got no on a terrible bike as well on a terrible bike. And the whole

379
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,040
 thing is, you know, there are winners, but everyone is just wanting to finish it. It's an

380
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,120
 endurance thing. And they push themselves to the limit and it forces them to vomit enough so that

381
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,040
 they've set up the vomit station. They should have vomit zones shortly at the end of all marathons

382
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,960
 and all races and every endurance event. They do. It's called the side of the road.

383
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,240
 Wasn't it stopped also in 2017 because it wasn't stormy enough?

384
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,200
 Yeah, I think it was. There was an absolute because they need a certain level of wind,

385
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,640
 don't they? So if it doesn't come, it doesn't come. And also the wind needs to be

386
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,480
 in exactly the right direction. So that's why they can only do it three days in advance.

387
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,680
 They need to know that the wind is not just going to be there, but it's going to be coming

388
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,960
 directly over the bridge. Yes. And this bridge is an amazing bridge, right? This is the Ooster

389
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,160
 Shelterkring and it's a bridge that is basically a storm barrier bridge. And they're very proud of

390
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,760
 it there. They have a little inscription on the stone, which says here the tide is ruled by the

391
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,280
 wind, the moon and us. It's sort of they're so proud of how strong it is, which I saw on a video

392
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,440
 by your buddy, Tom Scott. Really worth watching if you're listening to us right now. Talk about

393
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,400
 this. He's on the side of the road. The wind is blowing in his head and he's seeing people

394
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:37,040
 ride past him. It's fantastic. Isn't that sort of the beginning of an ancient Greek story about

395
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,120
 hubris where you end up going swept away by the tide because you try to control what only God

396
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:46,320
 can control? Yeah, it's King Canute, isn't it? It's Canute. I think the Dutch are winning at the

397
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,200
 moment. They're nailing it. You're right. Those Dutch bikes are really hard to cycle fast on. The

398
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:58,080
 ones which don't have a bar at the top from the front to the back, they force you to cycle in

399
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,480
 a really sedate way. Another good race is the Red Bull Time Lapse. And they call that the longest

400
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:13,520
 one day road cycling events. Do you know how many hours it's for? 24. No. 25 because they do it when

401
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,200
 the clocks go back. Is that right? When the clocks go back. Yeah. It's quite cool, isn't it? Yeah. And

402
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,720
 it's just a 6.2km course and they see how many laps they can do in 25 hours. Nice. You could do

403
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,000
 the shortest one day cycling event where you just cross the international date line. Yeah. Yeah.

404
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,320
 And you know, it's a second. And you're just like, oh, I've been cycling for a day. Yeah. And actually,

405
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,720
 it's just one second. That's great. Apart from you're probably in the middle of the ocean. You're

406
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,800
 dead, but you're a smug. There's a bunch of cycling things that you can do where it's underwater,

407
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,440
 so underwater cycling. Oh, cool. And it's quite nice the way that they get the bike to stay

408
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,040
 at the bottom, which is they take all the air out of the bike wheels and they fill it with water.

409
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,960
 Okay. So when you plunge in, you just sink to the bottom with it and it becomes easy to ride. How

410
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,720
 do they deal with the fact that humans are quite buoyant? They replace all the air in their lungs

411
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,560
 with water. Eventually, that's probably what happens, isn't it? Yeah. Do you have to have

412
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,680
 weights? Oh, yeah, weights. Yeah, weight belts and things like that to keep you down. Yeah, I'm not

413
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,440
 sure. Yeah, I didn't see that in the photo that I saw. Because some of them go quite deep, don't

414
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,880
 they, the underwater ones? Yeah. There's one, the underwater bike race in North Carolina,

415
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,480
 which seems to be the home of underwater bike racing, where it's 60 feet underwater. And the

416
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,400
 race is across this shipwreck of a German U-boat called the Indra. Wow. And you ride 100 foot.

417
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,120
 Doesn't that, that's the kind of thing you're going to book a holiday to go and do? I don't

418
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,880
 really like cycling or swimming, but I like the sound of that. That sounds amazing. I don't like

419
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:47,040
 chess or boxing, but I like it. I was looking at slipstreams, this is a movement in cycling.

420
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,080
 Absolutely. And so slipstream, of course, is when you're, so you can get in a slipstream,

421
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,840
 for instance, if you're on a bicycle and you're behind a big vehicle, I do not recommend you do

422
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,320
 this. But the vehicle sort of pushes the air out of the way in front of it. So it creates this

423
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,080
 sort of negative pressure around you. But the record for how far someone's cycled in a slipstream

424
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:13,600
 is held by a woman who's Denise Muller-Koroneck and she went at 184 miles an hour in 2018 behind

425
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,800
 a race car. Isn't that incredible? That is incredible. So she's pedaling, right? Yeah, yeah,

426
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,640
 you've got to be pedaling. So you can't, she's in such a high gear that you couldn't possibly

427
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,360
 start. So they have to get pulled along by the car at first until they're going at 100 miles an hour

428
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:33,040
 and then released and then you peddle along behind the car. Wow. She can move on too. Can I just talk

429
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,880
 about one, can I just talk about one other slipstream guy who I love who's the guy, this guy

430
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,240
 called Charles Minthorn, mile a minute Murphy, mile a minute was added later. He was the first

431
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,080
 person to ride a bicycle a mile in under a minute. He was an 18, this is an 1899 and he persuaded a

432
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,040
 train engineer because trains were the only things that could go fast enough at the time

433
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,680
 to build the next track for him that he could cycle along. And then, so two miles of track

434
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,480
 and then he would get dragged behind it in the slipstream. And so he spent, he spent 12 years

435
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,440
 planning this, dreaming about it, fantasizing about it. And at first it didn't work because

436
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,240
 the train couldn't go fast enough. So he was there capable of cycling, the train couldn't go fast

437
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,280
 enough. Eventually they got a bigger, better, faster train and he ended up going so fast,

438
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,360
 burning rubber was flying up in his face because the track was warping and stuff. But

439
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,240
 lots of people were watching and he, it got to the end of the track. So he's going faster than the

440
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,000
 train at one point because he got, he fell behind a bit because he lifted his hand up to sort of

441
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,040
 wave at one of his trainers and I was like, oh fuck, I've just lost 50 feet. So he caught up with

442
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,440
 the train going faster than the train. The bloody guy driving the steam train just cut the steam as

443
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:48,160
 soon as he got to the end. And so Charles went slamming the track, flew of his bike at 60 miles

444
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,960
 an hour and somehow got caught, there were two people standing in the train, one caught one

445
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:03,920
 on the other side and they saved him. That is amazing. Okay, it is time for our final fact of

446
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:12,320
 the show and that is Anna. My fact is that every week planes drop 15 million flies on the border

447
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:19,200
 between Columbia and Panama. Okay, so we're expected to believe that but a scuba diver in a tree

448
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,960
 is perfect. Maybe the scuba divers hurling them out of the plane and he fell out too,

449
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,240
 I don't know. This is this incredible, not a story, true, true fact. And I read it in an

450
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,280
 article in The Atlantic by Sarah Zhang, it's a brilliant article, but it's about how it's 14.7

451
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,680
 million screw worm adults. So the flies of the screw worm are dropped over this border and it's

452
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,920
 in order to keep down screw worm populations weirdly and it's been happening for over 50 years

453
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,880
 and it's because they're a terrible pest so they were this awful blight in the US because they

454
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,880
 destroy livestock for reasons that I have no doubt will go into in disgusting detail. So they started

455
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,960
 looking into how to get rid of them, it was sort of in the 1950s the US Department of Agriculture

456
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:15,440
 started looking into eradicating them and decided to sterilize a bunch of screw worms, drop them

457
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,400
 all over the continent and then those guys would shag, male screw worms they drop, those guys would

458
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,680
 shag the females who only shag once in their life so if you shag a sterilized male that's it,

459
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,760
 you're not having kids and thusly the screw worm blight is ended. So the screw worm was screwed

460
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,480
 by screwing, you could say. Very nice. I could say that, should be their logo. And we should say,

461
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,840
 I don't know if you said this Anna, but the reason why it's in Panama, between Colombia and Panama,

462
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:48,640
 is they eradicated these flies from the whole of North America, but they still exist in South

463
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,400
 America and the bit where Panama is is obviously very, very thin bit of land. So if they can make

464
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,280
 sure that nothing gets past that little bit of land, then it means that nothing will come into

465
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,640
 North America. So that's why they flood Panama and Colombia with it, just to kind of create a barrier.

466
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,520
 And also to make a big buffer zone, I think, because at first they did try to make it a barrier

467
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,920
 with Mexico, but because that's just a bit too close, Mexico is right there, they were like,

468
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,320
 we've got to make this big buffer zone. It's like the Eastern Bloc in the Cold War.

469
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,520
 Can we talk about the worms and how horrific they are? They lay their eggs in open wounds,

470
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,840
 that's what their jam is. And sometimes they go for mucus membranes if they can't find an open

471
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,080
 wound, but that's why they're so painful and horrific. So you're living in a mucus membrane,

472
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,240
 are you? Yes, yeah, but we're saving up and we hope to find an open wound soon.

473
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,160
 Yeah. And then they sort of chew their way. They chew their way really deep as well,

474
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,560
 like they can get two inches down and they're just awful. They're awful animals.

475
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,960
 There was a British tourist called Rochelle Harris in 2013 who had a screw fly who went into her ear.

476
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,680
 And there was like this weird buzzing and scratching and stuff and she didn't really

477
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,840
 know what it was. And eventually they found out that she had these flesh-eating worms

478
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,400
 living inside her head. And then they interviewed her afterwards. I think this is mine in the

479
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,880
 Daily Mail. They interviewed her afterwards and she said, "I no longer as squeamish as I once was

480
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,800
 about bugs. How can you be after they've been inside your head?" I just think that would make

481
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,560
 me more squeamish. Way less likely to lie down in the garden if I've had a load of screw worms

482
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,840
 in the brain. It sounds like one stayed in there and is running the show now.

483
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,960
 That's such a good idea. Their name, it literally means flesh-eating, which I love.

484
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:42,000
 So their scientific name is the Cochleomia hominivorax. And hominid is man and vorax

485
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,880
 like voracious as eating. So man devouring, which is fitting. Yeah. The actual discovery

486
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,880
 of the idea of sterilizing all of these screw worms and dropping them over had been called in

487
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,720
 the New York Times in 1970 the single most original thought in the 20th century. That was

488
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,280
 according to a lot of scientists at the time because it was down to a guy called Edward F.

489
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,200
 Kipning. Sorry, Edward F. Knippling. Knippling? Knippling. I'd say it's Knippling. It's usually

490
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,840
 a silent case, isn't it? Yeah, I think it's Knippling. Either way, we can agree he does not

491
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:25,600
 make exceedingly good case. Well, let's say Knippling. And he used to, as a child, he used

492
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:32,880
 to watch adult screw worms mate. And he obsessed over it, not in a sexy way. He was watching a lot

493
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:40,240
 of his animals on a farm be devoured by these horrible flesh-eating species. And so, yeah,

494
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,320
 apparently that was just such an original thought that some scientists claim it's the single most

495
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,160
 original thought in the 20th century. Yeah, that was before the internet was invented, wasn't it?

496
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:55,600
 He was really amazing, this Edward Knippling. He died relatively recently, I think, and I saw

497
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,880
 a few obituaries of him. Apparently, he named all of his pets after insects. Isn't that cool?

498
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:08,160
 But his pets were not insects? No, he had Siamese cats, Colton, Anthonomous, and Culex,

499
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,320
 that were named after a type of cotton ball weevil and a type of mosquito.

500
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:20,640
 Do you know how you get a screw worm out of someone? Do you lure it out somehow?

501
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,560
 You do. You use a treatment called bacon therapy. Which sounds like such a much more enjoyable

502
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:33,440
 thing that it actually is. It's just a little jamming raw pork into the breathing holes that

503
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,360
 the worm has. And it either suffocates and pushes its way out, or it finds it yummy and sort of

504
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:44,080
 goes towards the bacon. It is like fishing, though, isn't it? I couldn't tell. It's so weird

505
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:48,000
 when they say that you use it to block up their air holes, because they're really small. I mean,

506
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,800
 that is a tiny rash of bacon. So I think they're attracting them to them. And once you've got

507
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,360
 sort of 10 or 11 on your bacon, you reel it in, I suppose, don't you? If you think it's like

508
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:03,280
 fishing, I'm not coming to your restaurant in the middle of London Bridge. The maggot sandwich.

509
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,720
 Flies off the shelves. They're a kind of blow fly. And I was wondering why we call blow flies

510
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,240
 blow flies. And I think it's because they... So the first reference to flies being associated with

511
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,520
 the word blows comes from Shakespeare and around that time. And it was people would refer to flies

512
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:27,360
 blowing you. So Cleopatra says, "Lay me stark naked and let flies blow me." And that's rather...

513
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:33,120
 She wants that to happen rather than being taken prisoner. It's not as pleasant as you might

514
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:39,200
 think. It's more about something is referred to being fly blown when flies had laid their eggs

515
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,960
 all over it, basically. I mean, if you go and see a prostitute and ask her to blow you, then make

516
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,120
 sure she doesn't come along with a load of maggots. Tip a pile of maggots on your knee.

517
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:57,280
 You've got to be very careful. It's possible, is all I'm saying. If she happens to be an entomologist

518
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:05,680
 in her spare time. A lot of crossover between the two. So they do actually blow bubbles blow flies,

519
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,440
 even though it's not what they call blow flies. They're forever blowing bubbles.

520
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,080
 And it's to keep them cool. This was discovered quite recently and it's blow flies in Brazil.

521
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:19,120
 It's actually latrine blow flies. So they hang around in toilets and they do this really clever

522
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,240
 thing where when they get hot, they blow brown bubbles out of their mouth, which I imagine are

523
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,240
 brown because they're latrine blow flies. And the brown bubbles, when they're blown, they lose lots

524
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,200
 of heat because heat evaporates off them and then they pop and they suck them back in and then that

525
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,680
 spits a bit cooler. It cools the head right down. It's really clever, that, isn't it?

526
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,120
 Yeah. It's like having bubblegum and then blowing it and then it gets cold on the outside and then

527
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,920
 you suck it back into your body and get the coolness. Exactly. If your bubblegum was made of other

528
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,840
 people's feces, which is not a hubba-bubba flavour as far as I know.

529
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:03,360
 I've just got one more thing. I started looking into insect factories off the back of this because

530
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,640
 there's a factory which grows these screwworms. There's a firm called EntoCycle, which is currently

531
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:15,440
 hoping to breed millions and millions of soldier flies and then turn them into protein powder.

532
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,600
 So you breed millions of flies, which are eating rubbish. They're eating old coffee grounds.

533
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,160
 And then do they give that to like cattle and stuff, is that right?

534
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,440
 Exactly. That's the hope. And then the hope is that you don't need so much

535
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:35,200
 soya to be grown and that takes up land that used to be the Amazon rainforest.

536
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,520
 So yeah, it's a genius idea. And this firm, EntoCycle, is based in London Bridge.

537
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,360
 Oh, yeah.

538
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:51,040
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.
