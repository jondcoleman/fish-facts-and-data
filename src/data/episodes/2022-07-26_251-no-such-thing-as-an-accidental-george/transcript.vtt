00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.240
 Oh hello and welcome to No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.720
 the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Anagentsky, not Dan Shriver and I am sitting

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.440
 here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Anne Miller. Once again we've gathered

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.000
 round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.160
 particular order here we go. Starting with My Facts, which is Cockroaches can carry 900

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.800
 times their own body weight on their backs. Amazing. It's impressive isn't it? So what

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.520
 is 900 times bigger than a Cockroach? 900 Cockroaches. Oh wow. Cockroaches, fire fighters

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.400
 must be very good indeed. I'll take everyone. Oh I'm just going to everything from your

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.120
 house don't worry about it. Well what the whole house? Oh no it's still a fire. I worked

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.560
 out that that would mean that I would be able to carry the biggest dinosaur that ever

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.520
 walked the earth, which is Argentinosaurus. Wow. So if I was a Cockroach. That would

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.840
 look really impressive. If you were a Cockroach, as in as a human you would be able to.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.080
 If I was a human sized Cockroach and the laws of physics didn't really apply to me but

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.440
 just this one particular fact applied to me, then I'd be able to carry that. Oh and if

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.560
 dinosaurs still existed. There were a lot of bigifs in there, but it's still impressive.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.000
 So yeah, this is I read this in an article which was published by the science, the journal

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.560
 science. The article is actually written by someone called Elizabeth Penisi. This is a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.120
 report on Cockroaches and how they're basically impossible to squash and it looked into

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.760
 why. So they're extremely flexible and extremely hard and really good at lifting stuff. And

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.520
 so they they worked that out obviously by how you'd think they did, by putting heavier and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.480
 heavier stuff on Cockroaches backs and seeing at what point they crushed. But we haven't said

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.640
 there are 4,500 species of Cockroach. So is this only one species of Cockroach? Oh, that's

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.680
 strong one. This was an American Cockroach, famously strong. It's been to the gym, yeah.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:18.040
 Exactly. A Jock. Jockroach. I already think about how we had this image of Cockroaches is sort

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.280
 of being very hardy and surviving everything, but it really varies. There are 64 rays can

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.680
 kill 93% of German Cockroaches, which is 10 times more than humans can take, but like way,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.440
 way, way less than a fruit fly can take. So a fruit fly can survive more radiation.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.360
 Oh, radiation. Yeah. Yeah. So because they might play some Cockroaches, they're really

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.040
 hardy and somewhat. But we sort of think of Cockroaches as this one uniform thing and actually

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.920
 they're very different individuals. Yeah. I think that's good. That's good speaking

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.720
 up for Cockroaches. Yeah. And not just horrible things. They're each very special in their

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.800
 own way. Do you know what happens to elderly Cockroaches?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.080
 Oh, I read about this experiment and it's amazing. It's great. Well, they get dodgery. So

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.680
 the scientists looked at elderly Cockroaches and they found that their joint sees up and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.560
 they have trouble walking up hills. Oh, yeah. And they spend less time moving around.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.560
 They move more slowly when they do move around. They develop slightly racist views.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.800
 The other kinds of Cockroaches. So basically they did this experiment. They

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.520
 tried to make them walk up slopes and things. They only found one method which could rejuvenate

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.840
 an elderly Cockroach and make it, you know, this was testing whether a particular species

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.160
 could run off after being nudge. Right. And the best way to ensure that elderly Cockroaches

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.720
 can run off after being nudge is to decapitate them. Oh. But it's a bit of an extreme.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.280
 Yeah. I'd rather be dodgery. Yeah. So in this experiment that I got this

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.200
 fact from, they were mainly actually looking at how Cockroaches can squeeze through such

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.360
 tiny spaces. So the American Cockroach, for instance, which is about 9mm tall can squeeze

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.760
 through a slit that's 3mm high. And so they looked at exactly how they do that. And it's

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.560
 really cool. They'll come across a little hole. And first of all, they inspect it with

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.000
 their antenna. So, you know, to feel around, feel how small it is. Then they jam their

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.760
 head through. And then they squeeze their front legs through after it. So they're really

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.400
 pushing their body down, squeezing their front legs through. And then they sort of drag

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.960
 the rest of the body behind them. And their back legs are really split out. So when you

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.520
 look at it, they're completely flat. They're back legs are split out, but sort of still

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.280
 pushing them. And it takes them one second to do that. Wow. And they're much better than

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.760
 any animal squeezing except an octopus, I think, which can squeeze itself quite small

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.520
 as well. That's fast enough. That's terrifying. So what they're also really good at is

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.840
 fighting. So they can fight with five times more relative strength than humans can, which

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.240
 is terrifying. And cockroaches will eat everything, including other cockroaches and humans.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.280
 And the thing about sailors. Cockroaches don't eat humans. No, they don't. Not all of

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.320
 you, because they're only small, but if they were big enough. So sailors on ships, apparently,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.720
 where some sailors wear gloves, because our cockroaches will sneak up in the night and

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.080
 eat their finger nails. Really? That's quite good. Yeah. Don't need to take nails as

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:07.240
 day one. So here's something I have in common with cockroaches. They don't like mornings.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.520
 Inasmuch as they're literally unable to form any new memories at the start of the day. So

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.320
 if you teach them something at the start of the day, they'll just forget it. And if you

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.120
 teach them in the afternoon, then they'll remember it. Is there a reason, do they think behind

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.360
 that or they just go out really late? Yeah, we just like to stay up late. You and your cockroach

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.720
 friends. I'm glad you can speak on behalf of the cockroaches now, James. But they don't

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.960
 like the light today. So I wonder if it's something to do with that. Because their name,

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.480
 'blatterdaya' in Latin means insect that shuns the light. And also, the creepy ones might

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.480
 eat your finger nails, but I'm sure when I started at QI's, really, in fact, that was if

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.680
 we don't like the idea of cockroaches, but they don't like the idea of us. Some of them

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.840
 if they touch a human will run away and clean themselves. That's weird because they love touching,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.320
 don't they? I think we've said this before, but that's why they like being in really tiny spaces

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.520
 and they're like crawling into it is. And that's because they really like touching the edges of things.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.640
 And this comes in handy for a guy called Stephen Kutcher, who is Hollywood's bug artist.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.840
 So he's got this super cool job if anyone is using this. He's got a super cool job, but his brother

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.440
 Raston's doing a lot better. Well, it depends what you mean by better. But can you imagine

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.480
 those Christmas dinners of the Kutcher household? Well, you'd be doing. Well, Stephen gets to say,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.680
 I'm at the very top of my fields. Which I don't think can be true. We don't need to get into the

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.120
 Ashton Kutcher debate here, but anyway, so Stephen sort of recruits bugs for films like Spider-Man

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.360
 and recruits. Are you around? Are you free? Yes, there's fingernails out. I hope they come to him.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.880
 Yeah, it's like that. And then he trains them up. And so he did this interview for MPR, where he was

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.840
 talking about a film called Race the Sun. And what he had to do was he had to get a cockroach to

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.000
 emerge from a shoe, walk onto a bag of cheetos, turn left, and then walk through some cheetos that

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.400
 had spilled out of it, and then stop on a magazine. So we had to get a cockroach to do all of this

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.360
 without any prompting. And he did it by folding the bag of cheetos in a certain way. And because

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.760
 they really like touching things, he just folded it in a way that they'd follow the folds around.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.480
 And it steered it exactly. That's so clever. I would just glue a magnet to the underside

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.880
 of the cockroach and then move that around under the filming surface. I would do it in post.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.120
 Hollywood secrets from the NOSX thing is a fish team. Yeah, that's really cool.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:38.520
 You know, you don't get that in Heat magazine. In Russia, in 2008, they wanted to find some

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.440
 cockroaches in Moscow to send into space. They needed a 54. They sort of recruited my friend,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:52.440
 Stephen Kutcher. Well, it took them three months to find 54 cockroaches in Russia. And then

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.280
 everyone was like, oh my god, what's happened to all our cockroaches in Russia? And there was a big

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:04.120
 worry about it. People blamed like cell tower radiation or GM food or probably foreigners. So,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:10.200
 you know, like people blame whatever they blame. And we don't really know what happened. But then

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:17.400
 around 2011, they started coming back. And then in the early 2010s, there was a huge plague of cockroaches

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.680
 in Moscow. So they kind of just disappeared and then they all came back. And what it might have been

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.640
 is maybe they started using some pesticide the government did. And then it killed them all. But then

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.640
 they got used to it. And then when they got used to it, they really came back with a vengeance.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.040
 God, wow. It's a big holiday. Big cockroach holiday.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.680
 That's because whenever I go on holiday, there's always cockroaches in the room.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:45.560
 You have to start improving your accommodation on that. Whenever.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.720
 Oh, I did find one thing I liked, which is that as female cockroaches get older,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.320
 they gradually lower their standards of what they think is acceptable in a mate.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.520
 Yeah, I think we can all feel for that. But the male cockroach, we can all hope for that.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:06.840
 Males are completely unable to assess females age or assess their reproductive fitness. They're

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.800
 just willing to mate at all times. But females start out with quite high standards. And then

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:18.040
 as time goes by, they broaden their standards. They're all cockroaches, you're dating them, so.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:25.560
 They don't move on to more attractive animals. That would be amazing, wouldn't it? If all animals

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:33.560
 were dating all other animals. Well, they aren't very sexual, aren't they? The only thing they like

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:39.160
 more than food, I think, is sex cockroaches. I think the males are very sexual. The females actually

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.760
 aren't as intersex. And so if a male is starving to death, and it's got a bit of food in front of him,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.400
 but then you spray some female pheromone 16 feet away, it will run to the female pheromone and

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:56.680
 die of starvation because it wants sex more than food. Yeah. Do you guys know that cockroach milk

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.840
 is the most nutritious substance on earth, or one of the most nutritious substances on earth? Maybe he's

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.800
 running to the woman cockroach to get some milk rather than for sex. You're right, he must have

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:13.240
 read the same article that I did. Yeah, so I didn't know that they've milked the Pacific beetle cockroach,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.720
 and they found that it has four times more calories than cow's milk. And yeah, it's full of protein

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.600
 and fats and sugars, and this cockroach is the only cockroach that gives birth to live young,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.280
 and then it sort of pumps out this special milk for its babies. And it's really cool, it looks

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.240
 really glittery, because it's got protein crystals in it. Wow. Great. Well, I'll look for a tiny, tiny bottle

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.360
 of milk in the supermarket next time I'm in. It's not milk per se, is it? Is something slightly

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:41.960
 different to milk, I think? Yeah, I don't know why, but... It's a creation. Yeah, it doesn't. Lovely.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.120
 What I mean is, when you're in the supermarket, you won't be able to call it cockroach milk. Like,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.320
 these days, they're stopping people from calling things almond milk, aren't they? If it doesn't contain

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.080
 lactose or something. You're saying the dairy industry might get annoyed if I start selling my

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.960
 cockroach milk. I think they will. I think you might have to call it cockroach secretion, like

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.920
 hand suggests. And I don't want to buy that, but I'm only one person, so. No, I do think we need to work

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:15.240
 on the branding. Okay, let's move on to our next facts, and that is Am's facts. My fact is that the

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.040
 first British travellers aboard the Orient Express were advised to bring a revolver and the tea pot

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:28.440
 with them, all the essentials. So when the Orient Express began, it wasn't quite the luxurious

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.080
 train ride we imagined. So actually, it went from Paris to Constantinople, but twice the passengers

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.640
 had to get off and get on boats instead. So I think the idea was they had once to bring protection

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:43.000
 in case there was a rocus at the ports. And the tea pots. Making tea? Making tea?

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:51.480
 Pass the time. If you were coming from a rocus, what do you need? You need a nice cup of tea. That's true.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:12:02.120
 So the Orient Express was founded by the company Wagon Lee, Wagon's Lits in English, and that was

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:09.800
 founded by George Knuckle Knackers, who that's how you pronounce that in every language. And he

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:15.240
 is quite interesting because he decided to do the sleeper carriages when he went to the United States

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:20.520
 for America. And he went to the USA because he was encouraged to go there because while in Europe,

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:27.640
 he fell in love with his cousin and his family decided that he should go to the USA to kind of get over

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.240
 her. So it's strange because falling in love with your cousin was an occupational hazard in the 19th

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.680
 century. It must have been an unsuitable cousin. I think it was a cousin did not like him back.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.840
 But Knuckle Knackers, so he set out that first trip to Constantinople and actually there wasn't

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.880
 a full railing for six years after his first Orient Express ran. But also the Orient Express,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.360
 we have this idea of it being this beautiful long train. And that sort of, I think the idea

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.200
 of like redness effect in night trains, but Andrew Martin. And he says, because it's went on a long

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.640
 journey, we sort of assume it was long, but actually that first train, there are only five carriages.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.840
 And one of them was a Wagon carrying post, which helped them recoup some of their costs.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:10.600
 Express, you think of it as being, you know, 15 carriages long. Yeah. It's got all this stuff in

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.120
 there. It's only five carriages. That's tiny. Yeah. So many fewer suspects.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.760
 But also, I got the Christie. I used to take the Orient Express a lot because she, her husband,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.920
 second husband was an archaeologist. They take it to go to digs. But she was apparently one time

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.760
 between Venice and Paris was attacked by bedbugs. I shouldn't write that into the book.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.480
 Oh, that's not what you want from your luxury train. You imagine like, you know, like really

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.720
 grand and lovely. Yeah. Wasn't Knuckle Knackers, was it Pullman carriages that he was inspired by?

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.320
 Yes, he went to America and he fell in love with them. He was by the name of his cousin.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:48.600
 But Pullman carriages were a huge deal. So they were these, yeah, this luxury way of traveling that

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:54.120
 was pioneered in America. And they also gave rise to Pullman porters. And I didn't really say

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.280
 Pullman porters with the people who carried your luggage on a Pullman carriage. And George Pullman

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.080
 came up with the idea straight after the Civil War of only employing ex slaves as these Pullman

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.640
 porters. So every single Pullman porter was black. And they ended up being really important in

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.280
 the Civil Rights movement because they formed the first union of black people, the first union

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.720
 that involved black people. And that allowed them to get together and to fight for their rights

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.280
 and things like that. But they all, when they were working on the Pullman carriages, had to be called

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:26.040
 George. So every Pullman porter was called George after George Pullman, which some of them ejected

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.840
 to because most of them weren't actually called George. Yeah. You'd think the majority. It didn't turn

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.640
 out to be most of them had other names. And there was a society. There was a society called

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.760
 the Society for the Prevention of Calling Sleeper Carporteurs George. And this was actually a genuinely

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.520
 really important society. But it wasn't porters. I mean cruelty to animals and cruelty to

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:52.200
 children is shortly higher up the list of prevention of. No, it's not. Okay. Prevention of calling

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:58.200
 people George. This society was actually formed by other people who were called George in America.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:03.640
 So it had 31,000 members and they were saying George is our name. Stop just randomly giving this name

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.120
 to train porters. I mean, I don't think they should have been calling these porters, George. But you

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:13.160
 can't stop other people from having your name. Well, these George's, you know, they didn't want it.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.320
 You can't think that your name's a bit too common. You don't want to make it more and more common.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:22.440
 Yeah. There is a phrase in fiction or things like saying leave it to George, which I thought was

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.400
 a sort of 40s phrase or calling everyone George was a thing that happened. I think it comes from that.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.640
 Yeah. But then you couldn't because eventually this society for the prevention of calling people George

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:37.480
 actually persuaded the Pullman Company to ban it. So by 1926, there had to be a little rack installed

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.560
 in each carriage that said the name of your porter to ensure that you didn't call him George because

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.800
 the George was objected so much. If they were accidentally called George, not accidentally. If they

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.400
 happened to call George, you're forced to not be called George. You're all called Herbert.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:57.720
 And the interesting thing about Pullman, he was seen as this great entrepreneur, etc. But there was a

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:04.760
 depression in 1893 and it meant that he cut the wages of all of his staff, but they were all staying

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:10.360
 in a town that he built and he didn't reduce the rent. So he meant that workman might make $9.7

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:17.000
 in a fortnight, but he would take $9 of it as rent, leaving them a paycheck of just $0.7 for everything

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.760
 else. It's not worth caching, is it? It really isn't. It's really bad. So they strike because of this.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:29.240
 And then the soldiers came in and I think quite a few people died. And then Pullman's reputation just

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:36.040
 went from hero to absolutely nothing, which is not the same. You're right, it's the phrase, yeah.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.400
 But yeah, he became really, really hated to such an extent that when he was buried, his family

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:47.240
 covered his coffin in a large block of cement because they were worried people would abuse his corpse

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.720
 because he was hated so much. It must have been very difficult for the poor poor bearers. Yes.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:59.240
 You're right. Did you know that? In 1936, you could travel from England to France by train,

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:06.440
 completely by train. Still come. You still come. But it's surprising then. So you could do it.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:11.000
 It's not surprising. There was no tunnel. No, there was no tunnel, but there were ferries. So there was this

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.320
 thing called the night ferry, which took trains on board it. So it was only if you were traveling

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:20.120
 first class. There was a special, there were special trains. And they went, I think from Paddington

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.520
 actually. And if you were in first class, your train just ran straight onto the ferry. You stayed

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.120
 aboard it and then it ran straight off the ferry at the other end. But if you're in economy class,

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:33.480
 you had to get off the carriage. So with a tracks leading up onto the ferry and then at the other

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.920
 end, there were tracks leading off. So that meant they'd have to have the same gauge. Yeah, because they

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.400
 have different gauges in Europe, don't they? Or is it the... It's like a universal plug, you know,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:47.400
 when you go on holiday and you can adapt it to it. The carriage might go onto another gauged.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.040
 Of course. Because the carriage sometimes lifts up. You've got a flatbed truck with a different

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.880
 gauge and then the whole carriage is lifted up. It's lifted up. Yeah, yeah. It would be a weird journey,

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.240
 wouldn't it? Your carriage being lifted up and swung a little bit. Waking up at the wrong point,

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:06.840
 I mean, like, where are we? That's so cool. So I've got a fact about modern trains, which is about

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:12.760
 the Queen, who, as we know, has the royal train. So when she's travelling on the royal train and

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.040
 when she's been travelling overnight, there's a special instruction that gets given out. And that is

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.000
 that the Queen has a bath at 7.30 in the morning. So if the train is going then, the driver is ordered

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:29.160
 the driver is ordered to avoid any bumpy bits of track so that her bath doesn't slosh around too much.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.520
 That's weird knowing when the Queen has a bath. I think you'd be freaked out as the train driver.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:41.000
 Every morning at 7.30 you'd think, "Oh, she's passing now." Don't make any mistakes. She's naked,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.760
 ten yards from me. It's a weird thought. It's a big train. I don't think it's any ten metres.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:52.680
 She's like in the cab, in the tub. He puts the bath next to the driver seat. More coal.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:59.960
 Just one thing I had on suitcases. So this is about luggage and suitcases. And I was wondering what

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:07.160
 the history of luggage is. And I read that. The first wheelie suitcases were in 11.53. And

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:12.840
 they were used by the night time. They were meant to be my lifetime. Well, you're a very old man.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:19.000
 I can't believe the night went to the crusades with Trunkey's face.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.400
 Little Trunkey. You don't see that. Do you? You don't see them running into the bathroom with it?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.400
 A little trolley behind them. You would leave it behind, wouldn't you? Back up the hotel.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.400
 But no, I read this. It was in a lowly planet guide and another book actually. And I can't find

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.800
 any source for it. But apparently, yeah. And they would use these wheelie suitcases to carry their

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:41.960
 chainmail and their arms and their tools and stuff. And I guess a wheelie suitcase is really just a

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:47.240
 bag on wheels, just a cart on wheels, isn't it? It would have to be wooden, wouldn't it? It wouldn't

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.120
 carriage with spokes. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know when something starts being a suitcase and starts

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.840
 being a carriage. Size. Is it just choice? I'm obviously size.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.880
 The race wheel carriage for the night's template. Anyway, if anyone has an actual source for

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.880
 the crusades being people galloping into the crusades pulling their wheelie suitcases.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:16.040
 It just doesn't sound very true. It sure doesn't. Okay, onto our next fight and that is James'

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:24.760
 fact. Okay, my fact this week is that the largest known prime number has 24 million 862,088

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:34.920
 digits. When written in binary, it has 82,589,933 digits, but they are all the number one.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:43.240
 That is unbelievable. It seems not a coincidence. It's not a coincidence. Okay, so I will quickly go

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:49.560
 through this. Take your time, please. So prime number is something that has only two

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.560
 multiple multiples one in itself. So 12 is not prime because you can have three, four or two

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.360
 sixes, but 11 is because you can't divide it by anything else apart from itself. That's a

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.400
 lulled everyone into a full sense of security thinking, yeah, I know that. Okay. And now, binary,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.120
 binary is a number that's made of zeros and ones. Rather than writing in ones, tens and hundreds,

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:14.520
 you write in ones, twos, fours, eights, 16s, 32s, stuff like that. And so each zero or one represents

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:20.840
 two or four and eight to 16, etc. So the binary number 1111 is one plus two plus four plus eight,

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:26.840
 which is 15. Anyway, so the large prime numbers that we're all finding at the moment are called

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.640
 the send primes and they're all in the form of two times two times two times two times two times two times

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:36.600
 two times two, etc, etc, etc, etc, minus one. And they keep looking for all these different two

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.640
 times two times two things and check if they're prime. And some of them are, and it also happens,

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:46.520
 if you write any number that's two times two times two times two minus one, it can be written as a

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:52.120
 string of ones in binary. It's one, one, one, one, one, one, one. And so this particular number,

00:21:52.120 --> 00:22:00.200
 which is two to the power of 82,589,933 minus one, is a prime number. And it's also written as one,

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:06.040
 one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one in binary. Wow. Yeah, okay. That's almost there. That was

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:10.680
 well explained. Yeah. Impressive. You should be a math teacher. So I saw this in scientific

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.720
 American, this fact, which was really good. But here's a slightly more accessible maths fact

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.160
 from that article. And that is that the word 29, if you write it in capital letters, can be written

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:28.200
 with 29 straight line segments. That's quite nice, isn't it? Sorry, if you write that. So the T is a

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.960
 line and a down was like W is four, four, five, six. And then if you add them all up, let's not do it

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:39.560
 all, but they count to 29. That's really cool. That's how you convince the kids that you're a cool

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:45.160
 teacher and stuff like that. And then you make your calculator spell boobless. And then you launch

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:50.200
 into the prime number stuff. Yeah, most and primes, is it, so most and primes, like you say, are two

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.200
 to the power something and then minus one. But we now keep finding these as the largest prime numbers.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.720
 Yes. So I think it's just because that's where people are looking. Got it. And they're kind of

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.440
 easier to find because we know the kind of format that they take so we can keep looking for all the

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.840
 different two to the power of n minus one. We can look at the next one, the next one, the next one,

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.280
 eventually we'll find the prime number. Got it. The gap gets bigger, doesn't it? Because once you're

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.880
 up to more than 74 million, the prime number theorem says only one and every 50 million numbers is prime.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:26.600
 So you're exactly quite a big gap. So if you start at two, two is prime and three is prime.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.800
 So at that stage, everything's prime. Yeah. But then you get to four and it all goes wrong. Yeah.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.280
 But then you get to five and then prime again. And then as you go up, there's fewer and fewer as

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:42.440
 you go in. So Marin Mercen of Mercen prime fame was a monk. He was in the Minim's, he was a,

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:48.760
 what was called a Minim monk. And he was also known as the post box of Europe because he was

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:57.640
 eight letters. He was large and red. He was a really crucial scientific figure in the 1600s.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.400
 And he was called the post box of Europe because he was unbelievably well connected. So he was like one

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.440
 of these society ladies who brings people together. So he was like really great mates with Galileo,

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.560
 with Descartes, with Pascal, with Hobbes. And he used to communicate between them all and pass

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:17.560
 their letters to each other. And that was what he was going around. Spreading gossip. He was the

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:23.880
 postman of Europe, not the post box of Europe. So yeah. And in that way, he sort of spread ideas.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.880
 And then they were able to make discoveries based on each other's ideas. That's very cool. Very good.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:33.080
 You can earn money from discovering new prime numbers, which is nice. So this thing called Gimps,

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:38.200
 what is it? The great internet Mercen prime search. It means that it's a little bit of software.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.120
 You can install on your computer and your computer will just in the background. So hunt for prime

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.320
 numbers. But the prices are really variable. So currently, if you find a prime number that is

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:54.120
 fewer than a hundred million digits long, you only get $3,000. That's still not bad for doing

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.720
 literally nothing. It's better than a poke in the eye. But the first person to find a prime number

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:05.960
 which had one million digits, so that's a hundred times smaller, got $50,000. Oh, that's a big jump,

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:12.760
 isn't it? I know. And when the record passed 10 million digits in 2008, the price was $100,000.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.960
 Yeah, not worth it. I think you should get a prize if your number is particularly pleasing,

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.960
 because I found that I've called the best prime numbers of 2016. So I was very excited.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:30.840
 And among the nominees is 314,159. Why is that special? It's 3.14.

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:36.040
 Yeah, it's basically 100,000 times five. Isn't that beautiful? I think I'm going to propose that

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.520
 as best prime number of all years, not just 2060. That is a really good one. I've got a rival.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:47.560
 Mine's maybe an evil prime number. Maybe that's a good one. What's it done? It's basically that,

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:53.880
 yeah, but with some stuff around it, yeah. This is called Belfagore's prime. And it's a

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:59.560
 palindrobe and it's also very pleasing number. So it's one, followed by 13 zeros, 13, very unlucky

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:05.000
 number, followed by 666, followed by another 13 zeros, followed by one. Could you get unlucky?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.240
 And that's a prime number. That's a prime number. That's really strong. It's a cool one, isn't it? That's

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:14.440
 very good. Yeah. My favorite prime number is... That's a sense you didn't think you'd say this.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:22.520
 Is it going to be a spin-off podcast? My favorite prime. My favorite is the number 524,287,

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:29.320
 because that was proved to be prime by a guy called Kataldy in 1588. And then that was the largest

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:36.120
 known prime number for 200 years. Wow. Yeah, until Euler came along. That's spoiled sport Euler.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:42.920
 Andy, what's your favorite prime number? 17. Any reason? I like it. I genuinely find it pleasing.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:47.000
 And I've liked it for years as well, by the way, guys. I didn't just make one up for my life.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.520
 Can I say another pie thing? Because I really like this. So he wants to memorize pie. You can use

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:58.680
 a sentence. So this is the first few digits of pie. How I want to drink. Alcoholic, of course,

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:05.240
 after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics, which is 3.141592653879.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:14.440
 And that's a number of letters in each word. I said again, how do I want to drink? How I want to drink?

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:24.840
 How I want to drink 3.14155. Oh, clever. Alcoholic. 9, of course.2626. And you can go on forever. I mean,

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.840
 pie goes on a long time. And I was hoping we could, I was going to make one up for James's prime number,

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:37.800
 but yeah, 23 million digits. We said we did a prime number podcast in episode 98. I don't know if

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:43.400
 you remember that. I'm sure the list is a whole remember. This was when the last really big

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.720
 prime number was found. And we said that if you were to write it out, it would take three months.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.840
 But I worked out that this one, if you were to write it down, would take you nine months.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:02.040
 And, but then again, that's the 24,862,000 version. If you're to write it in binary,

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:07.640
 it's 82 million digits, but they're all the number one. And so I tied myself right in the number

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:14.280
 one as quickly as I could do five or second for ten seconds. Don't want to show off. I did that

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:21.960
 quite recently. And so I worked out that even though it's a lot longer, it would only take me six

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.280
 months to write the binary version out. And it would take me nine months to write. Are you

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.120
 factoring in the inevitable arthritis that's going to hit you in about a month? Three. I was thinking

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:39.080
 getting half way through and forgetting how many ones you've written. There are other good ways

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:45.320
 of doing it. So, for example, you could write with all four limbs at once. You could put a pencil

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:51.240
 in each hand in each foot. Does it have to be coherently written or does it have to be just all over the

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:57.160
 place? I think you need to be able to tell that they're ones and not just... Okay, what you could do is

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:02.200
 you could get a pencil and you could just draw a long line, just run along a very long wall. And then

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:07.080
 someone after you goes along with a rubber, just rubbing out gaps. And then turn it kind of nice as

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:12.600
 horizontal, isn't it? Or have you been drawing ones the wrong way? Well, and these dashes are actually

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:18.840
 ones. My taxes were in a very bad shape. But all these methods are going to be considered cheating

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:24.280
 in this fictional and absurd game that you've finished. And actually in these versions, I don't sleep

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:30.600
 in any of them either. Right. I think in this one. There's no sleeping. Okay, anyone got anything else?

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.880
 You have some illegal prime numbers. Oh yeah. Yeah, ones that you're not allowed to say.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:42.520
 Say one, I tell you. Four, eight, five, six, five. Actually, it's got 1,401 digits in it, so I'm not

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.920
 going to say them all. That's the only reason I'm not going to say them all. Because you're afraid.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:56.040
 No, not afraid of the people who make DVDs anymore. So this is a decryption algorithm which could

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.640
 theoretically be used by a computer to circumvent a DVDs copy protection. If you know what this

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:07.000
 prime number is. And people wanted to put it on t-shirts and stuff like that because they were so

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.680
 annoyed by the man telling them what prime numbers they've got, they can't say. But I suppose DVDs

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:17.880
 aren't really used that much anymore. Does it matter? That's one of those archaic laws that you find

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.520
 on the books, thousands of years later. Like anyone who has a black capsule allowed to urinate on the

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.560
 back wheel and carry a bayonet of hay or something. Exactly. Yeah, let's strike it from the macrocarza.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:38.760
 Okay, let's move on to our final fact. And that is Andrew Antamari. My fact is that to preserve

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:44.120
 their anonymity, Michelin restaurant reviewers are advised to not tell even their parents what they do

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:51.800
 for a living. Wow, it's really secretive. Yeah, that's why it's so secretive is that so the restaurants

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:57.880
 can't spot them. Basically, yeah. Yeah, because Michelin pride themselves on their anonymity.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.760
 This comes from a huge feature that the New Yorker wrote about this about 10 years ago actually.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.000
 So a lot of Michelin company executives have never met an inspector.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.840
 You are kind of allowed to tell your spouse, for example, but it's otherwise they'd be a bit suspicious

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:20.760
 that you're taking them to restaurants every day. Oh, we're forwarding this. You don't have a job.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:29.480
 And they do eat out a lot. Yeah, they have to dine out two hundred days a year. Oh,

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:34.200
 didams. All they're driving in between places and they have to fill out reports for hours and hours

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.600
 a day about these places. They have to eat the maximum number of courses offered. They can't skip

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:44.920
 putting ever. They have to eat everything on their plate. It's like, no, it's true. Well, they have

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.680
 to judge, you know, whether they're the seared, whatever. You know, I've been putting until you've

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.520
 eaten your vegetables. It's basically like being a child. Wait, but they don't have to eat all of

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.120
 everything surely. What is it? If they've had one piece, it's not like the last piece. You don't

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.880
 have to have all the peas. Yeah, if the peas are all full, the article says they have to eat everything

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.040
 on their plate. That's true, actually, because what happens if one of the peas is off the people

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.280
 who read this review, they want to know that, don't they? But if they also, if they bring you 500

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.120
 peas and you think there's too many peas, you can't just have one piece. Oh, yeah, the peas are great.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:17.160
 You should make a note. They bring too many peas. I think the reviews are normally more complex than

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:23.400
 going to 80 peas. Why don't they keep sending into little shits? We're never going to give them a star guy.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:30.600
 Well, I like the, um, Michelin is sort of, we think of it as sort of fine dining, but it wasn't meant

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.360
 to mean that. It was meant to mean one star was very good cooking, two was exceptional worth a

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.360
 detour, and three was exceptional, worth a special journey. It was supposed to be how much it was worth

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.760
 making the trip, so it couldn't be how there's a really good little chef. So two is worth a detour. So

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:48.760
 basically a one Michelin star restaurant is not worth making a detour to go. If you're passing.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:54.360
 If you only go to a one Michelin star restaurant, if you're walking past them. Yeah, they were saying

00:32:54.360 --> 00:33:00.600
 next door. That was pretty fun. I was reading about restaurant reviewers in newspapers, which is a

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:07.000
 similar kind of thing, isn't it? There's a famous one whose name is Frank Bruney, who I really like

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:15.640
 because his name is the plural of Frank Bruney. And he says that, um, he always wears a wig and fake

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:21.240
 moustaches, but the problem was that one of his books, his early books had his face on the cover,

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.240
 and then the dust jacket got put on the internet. But you think you wouldn't put your face on the

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.680
 cover of your own book, wouldn't you? No, you can't complain about your book cover appearing on the

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.520
 internet. Maybe he didn't know that he was going to be in a anonymous restaurant reviewer,

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:38.280
 maybe it's different back. The UK doesn't have many anonymous reviewers. There's Marina O'Lachlan,

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:43.800
 who writes for the Sunday Times, and she always covers her face with a plate. Not where she dines at the

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.640
 Oh, you're a piece of it in your lap Marina.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:55.560
 And she says it's a real struggle because obviously it's quite a small, you know,

00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:00.520
 hut cuisine food scene. Yeah. And she also, she's done interviews saying, my husband is incapable of

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:06.120
 going out for dinner with me without bellowing Marina at the top of his voice. But I have read about

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.640
 people who, when they're dying by themselves, like to take a notebook, because it sort of freaks people

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:13.400
 out as if you go in and sit there with your notepad on the pen. Excellent. Everyone's like,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.520
 we'll miss you, because so Michelin Reviews aren't allowed, are they? They're not allowed to take

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.720
 notes, because yeah, it gives the game away. They're in great bluff to pretend that you're not a

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.720
 Michelin Reviewer. That's what I always do. I go to Michelin Star restaurants and I don't take a

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:31.560
 note pad. As soon as they see that, they become a reviewer. They're sent into a panic every single customer.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:36.520
 It's like being a really low stake spy, isn't it? It's like if you're, if you're a coward, but you

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:44.040
 want to be a spy, you should be one of these people. It's so stressful. There's one, I really like

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:49.480
 Ruth Riker. I think that's how you say her name. And she goes to enormous lengths. So she was a

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.520
 reviewer for The New York Times as well. And she started Wayne Disguises because she realised that

00:34:54.520 --> 00:35:00.040
 restaurants were offering rewards of up to $1,500 for people who could spot her so they would know

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:05.480
 if she was going. And so she created all these alteriegos and she really lives the part. So she said,

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:11.320
 her first alteriego was a mousey woman called Molly Hollis. She was a woman who had 30 years and

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:16.120
 40 pounds on the real me. I said Rachel, so she would be dressed it up. And then she turned into Chloe,

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:21.640
 a brazen blonde who flirted with waiters, and then sweet earthy red-headed Brenda. And then

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:30.520
 after a time she was followed by Frumpy Old Betty. But I think the thing about being spies

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.120
 is really interesting. So obviously, spies don't know how to tell people what they do for a living.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.600
 And there was a former CIA agent called Douglas Lang, who did an AMA on Reddit. And he said he

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.040
 told his family he was a low-level salesman. He just didn't tend to be like more questions.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.160
 But when he got sent to Afghanistan, he told his family he's going to Hawaii because he thought

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.800
 it's far enough away. For the kept running visit him. And he was like, yeah, we can't do that.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.880
 Because that's the same thing as the restaurant guys. Like, why are we going to these casinos

00:35:53.880 --> 00:36:00.120
 everything? But the best thing I read about the spies thing is that there's not really a way of

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.720
 testing who's psychologically sort of good to be a spy and what sort of effect keeping the

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.240
 secrets has on you. Because there aren't enough spies who've come out about being a spy. He will

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.440
 volunteer for your survey. And there was a paper in the Journal of the Association of Former

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.360
 Intelligence Officers, which I would love to read, about, yeah, there's problem that you can't

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.040
 study the spies because it's all secrets. So we don't really know what impact

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.880
 creating a false identity has for the spies and presumably for the restaurant critics as well.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:29.160
 I read the, what I think is the first restaurant review of all time. It's from 1859.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.960
 What the hell was that? I just experienced.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:40.760
 It was like having a meal at home, but I was in someone else's building.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:47.480
 Yes, I know it was better than that actually. If you can believe it, it was written in 1859.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.400
 It's really long. And actually, it's a review of lots of restaurants. They went to about

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:56.120
 10 different restaurants. A lot of it is taken up by the first full page of the paper is taken up

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.480
 with the person saying how bizarre it is that the editors sent them on this mission in the first

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:05.080
 place. It's a stupid idea that will never catch up. Is it English? Or is it French or is it?

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:11.480
 It's New York Times American in New York. And it's so good actually. It really, it starts the

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:16.520
 tradition from the start of the AA Guild style. Great reviewing. So it describes one of the restaurants

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:21.400
 he goes into. He says, you walk in. There's a pervading atmosphere of gravy of which you become more

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:28.280
 sensual. He had a lot of stuff. He said for any amount of gravy of which you become more sensual as

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.760
 you penetrate further into the crowded room. A guest has no sooner seated himself than a plate

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:40.280
 as flung at him by an irritated and perspiring wacer. It's so good. I'm going to go to this restaurant.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.800
 You like a perspiring wacer. The jerking of the plate at customers is closely followed up by a

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:51.080
 similar performance with the knife and fork. And he's very strong on waiter's outfits. That seems

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.800
 to be the thing that this reviewer most cares about. He says, I prefer the man who is so good as to

00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:03.320
 bring me what I'm about to eat should not appear in soiled garments. Where were the standards they are?

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:11.240
 That too is my bare minimum. Another waiter shot himself. But the food was delicious. You can't

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:19.000
 charge by the shitting himself. I'm going to put you off a bit. One of the first professional restaurant

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:31.720
 critics was Grimo de la Reineur, who was French. He became a gomonde because something that happened

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.720
 in an early age. His parents were away and his father returned from wherever they were to find a pig,

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:44.120
 dressed up and presiding at his dinner table. And the story made the rounds in Paris and became

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:51.880
 quite famous. And so the family disinherited him and sent him to an abbey close to Nancy where he

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:57.880
 became friends with the abbot and the abbot taught him the art of good eating. And then eventually he

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.800
 became the restaurant critic. And did he learn that the art of good eating does not involve dressing up

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.480
 a pig? He didn't say that you're a guy who came up with the dishes afterwards. We would love this.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.080
 There was a pig in the most immaculate dress. He had not the chance himself.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:17.080
 I read about him and he was really cool. De la Reineur. And he created this jury. So the first restaurant

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:24.440
 critic was there was 17 of him because it was him and 16 buddies. Prime number. Right, my fave.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.960
 And they met every week to taste food. But obviously you couldn't have 17 people going to

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.280
 the same restaurant as a critic because it would definitely be pretty obvious. But they met.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:39.080
 So it's so hard to book a table for any people. Yeah, that's true. But they met every week at the same

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:46.280
 place and the restaurants sent their food to them. No, yeah. That's such a good idea. It's weird,

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.080
 isn't it? So yeah. Although I would have thought the food quality might degrade in transit.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:59.320
 Delivery was nice. He also gave his own funeral to see who would come before he was dead.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.040
 Before he was dead. Yeah, yeah. And then he rose from the dead halfway through.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.480
 Oh, brilliant. It sounds amazing. It's a dramatic guy, really fun.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.920
 I look a bit more into the history of Michelin. So when they started doing the guides,

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:13.160
 there were only 3000 cars in France. So it's a bit more of a, wasn't he? Everybody had.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:17.000
 And so I didn't rose. The Michelin man, you're the guy made out of tires, was really posh when

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.080
 he first came out to appeal to the, he's like, oh, for classless. So he had a monocle as cigar,

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:29.000
 cufflinks and a cigarette ring. And then as cars became more of a, for everyone, they had to like,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.400
 turn him down. That's really fun, really good. Well, this, because I don't think people

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.400
 know the reason that the Michelin stars came about really, the reason Michelin guy came about was

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:41.240
 because they made tires and they wanted to encourage people to use their tires by driving to lots of

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.920
 restaurants. So they wore them out so that they would have to buy new tires, which does seem like a

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.680
 convoluted way of selling more tires. Should we just pull tires out of the tires now?

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:54.600
 That must be why he's made of white tires, because we've said tires used to be white.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:59.560
 Tires used to be white. They actually collared him black for a brief period when tires became black

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.360
 with asphalt, but because it was bound for printing, it didn't really work. So they made him white again.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:11.320
 Wow. But you know what he's called? He has name, which is Bebendum. And his, his name means

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.840
 now is the time for drinking, or there's drinking to be done. But not driving. Well, no, there's exactly.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:23.400
 And he was always, he was initially known as the road drunkard, genuinely. And basically,

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:28.040
 the posters for him originally showed him as, as Anne says, with, you know, with a monocle and with

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:34.120
 champagne and everything. But he was drinking a big glass. And the glass was full of nails and broken

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:39.560
 glass and all this horrible stuff. And the idea behind the poster is that Michelin tires

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:45.000
 drink up obstacles without puncturing. So he can soak up all this broken glass and all these nails

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.680
 and he won't deflate. He'll be fine. That's not an easy message to get from that image.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.640
 I think I know. It's weird. It's a weird image.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:56.280
 Also, it's strange for something that, you know, is associated with high quality food and drink

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:01.960
 to sort of be recommending a glass filled with crap. And that does show that they didn't really adapt

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.400
 the original logo, because it was originally designed for a beer company, wasn't it? And I think

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.480
 it was rejected. The guy who drew the Michelin man Bebendum. That's why he was called that.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.880
 And why he was drinking. But what was he? Why was he made of tires?

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:19.160
 That they did adjust it to make him taste of tires. He's a portly man. They thought I will add

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.880
 some tires. You could see why the beer company rejected it.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:28.040
 The only reason why he is made of tires is just what it would work. He used to do live gigs,

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:33.560
 the Michelin man. So this is, in 1898, he had his first ever live gig, which is Andre Michelin,

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:38.440
 one of the brothers behind the company. He hired a stall at a Paris cycle show. He set up a big

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:43.880
 cardboard cutout of the Michelin man. And then he hired a cabaret comedian to crouch behind it

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:50.120
 and provide banter with the audience. That's brilliant. And he was apparently so good and drew

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.440
 such a massive crowd that rival storeholders started pushing and shoving and getting angry,

00:42:54.440 --> 00:43:00.040
 because he was taking all their custom. And they had to call the police. Wow, he was a comedian.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:06.840
 Yeah, a big hard-drinking comedian, little swimming, cufflink wearing. You two had a lot of cover.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:16.200
