00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:18,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:19,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:19,00:00:22,from four mysterious locations in the UK.
00:00:22,00:00:23,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:23,00:00:26,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:26,00:00:28,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.
00:00:28,00:00:30,"Once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:30,00:00:33,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:33,00:00:36,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:39,"Starting with fact number one, that is Andy."
00:00:39,00:00:42,"- My fact is that from 1925 until 1936,"
00:00:42,00:00:45,the town of Eastbourne had two phone booths
00:00:45,00:00:47,with thatched roofs.
00:00:47,00:00:50,"- Wow, that sounds very Eastbourne to me."
00:00:50,00:00:51,- It does.
00:00:51,00:00:54,It feels like phones and thatched roofs belong
00:00:54,00:00:56,to quite different eras.
00:00:56,00:00:58,So why would they get the thatched roof?
00:00:58,00:01:00,"I mean, what I would call the post-thatch era."
00:01:00,00:01:03,"- Well, they weren't, see, Eastbourne adapted a bit later"
00:01:03,00:01:06,than the rest of the world to the post-thatch.
00:01:06,00:01:09,"To everything, but to the end of thatch."
00:01:09,00:01:11,"Basically, it was the beginning of the 20th century,"
00:01:11,00:01:12,very exciting.
00:01:12,00:01:15,"You know, we've got phones now and we've got phone boxes."
00:01:15,00:01:19,"And early days, local authorities didn't like"
00:01:19,00:01:21,getting standard designs for what was going on
00:01:21,00:01:24,"in their parish council, their town council, whatever."
00:01:24,00:01:26,And so they had these two kiosks on the seafront
00:01:26,00:01:28,"and they thought, no, this doesn't look very Eastbourne"
00:01:28,00:01:29,to us.
00:01:29,00:01:32,So they insisted that they got a local thatcher
00:01:32,00:01:35,to come on and build them a thatched roof.
00:01:35,00:01:37,And it looks so stupid.
00:01:37,00:01:39,It obviously looks like a sort of magic toadstool
00:01:39,00:01:41,that you'd see a pixie living in.
00:01:41,00:01:45,- And is this on the classic red phone box?
00:01:45,00:01:48,"The K6, as it's known, or is this earlier?"
00:01:48,00:01:50,- These weren't K6 models.
00:01:50,00:01:52,These were very early models.
00:01:52,00:01:53,- They were the Kons.
00:01:53,00:01:54,- Yeah.
00:01:54,00:01:55,"- Still red, right?"
00:01:55,00:01:57,- I looked at the full K1 to 6 range
00:01:57,00:01:59,"and aside from a couple of exceptions,"
00:01:59,00:02:01,they all look the same to me.
00:02:01,00:02:03,I can't believe there's so much fuss about the progress.
00:02:03,00:02:05,- Maybe you've got phone box blindness
00:02:05,00:02:07,like James has face blindness.
00:02:07,00:02:12,"- Sorry, so it's on the K1 that is red,"
00:02:12,00:02:14,but very different to the K6.
00:02:14,00:02:15,- These are the K1s.
00:02:15,00:02:17,"And in fact, they were not universally disliked"
00:02:17,00:02:19,"because in 1936, there was a letter"
00:02:19,00:02:20,"to the Eastbourne Chronicles saying,"
00:02:20,00:02:22,I can't believe you've taken the thatch roof
00:02:22,00:02:22,off the phone boxes.
00:02:22,00:02:25,What are standards coming to in Eastbourne?
00:02:25,00:02:28,"- Well, they did say that, but in that letter,"
00:02:28,00:02:29,they said that the original one looked like
00:02:29,00:02:32,a cross between a Chinese pagoda and a mushroom.
00:02:32,00:02:34,"So they didn't like the new ones,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,but I'm not sure they liked the old ones that much either.
00:02:36,00:02:38,- No one likes anything in Eastbourne.
00:02:38,00:02:40,That's the message.
00:02:40,00:02:40,- It's not a bad thing.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"I know you hate mushrooms, so you're very biased,"
00:02:42,00:02:44,but I don't know if I automatically assume
00:02:44,00:02:48,a Chinese pagoda cross with a mushroom is a negative thing.
00:02:48,00:02:49,It sounds kind of beautiful.
00:02:49,00:02:50,"- Yeah, okay."
00:02:50,00:02:53,"Well, I'm sure that Boris Johnson will be bringing you in"
00:02:53,00:02:55,to do his interior design sometime soon.
00:02:55,00:02:59,- Don't you think it's so sad that they stopped at the K6?
00:02:59,00:03:01,"'Cause if they got to the K9,"
00:03:01,00:03:03,we would have had dog-shaped phone boxes.
00:03:03,00:03:05,"- There was a K7 and a K8, definitely."
00:03:05,00:03:07,"- Oh, God damn it."
00:03:07,00:03:07,- They stopped.
00:03:07,00:03:09,"- Maybe it was a trademark issue, right?"
00:03:09,00:03:12,Maybe K9 came out and they just didn't have access.
00:03:12,00:03:15,"- Yeah, because it's like Dr. Who had a dog called K9,"
00:03:15,00:03:16,didn't he?
00:03:16,00:03:19,"And he had a, like not a telephone box,"
00:03:19,00:03:21,"but he had a, what did he have?"
00:03:21,00:03:22,A police box.
00:03:22,00:03:22,- There's a police box.
00:03:22,00:03:24,"- There wouldn't have been all sorts of confusion there,"
00:03:24,00:03:25,wouldn't there?
00:03:25,00:03:26,- Yeah.
00:03:26,00:03:28,- But there was a KX model.
00:03:28,00:03:31,So that was kind of a K10 or a Latin 10.
00:03:31,00:03:33,So it feels like there's something going on here
00:03:33,00:03:34,that we're not being told.
00:03:34,00:03:36,"- The KX100 is the one you're talking about maybe,"
00:03:36,00:03:38,which is the glass modern-ish one
00:03:38,00:03:41,that everyone will kind of remember from the '90s.
00:03:41,00:03:42,- That is what I'm talking about.
00:03:42,00:03:44,- Maybe the KX is the rude one
00:03:44,00:03:46,"when we started putting up all those, you know,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,sex worker call numbers inside.
00:03:48,00:03:51,"KXXX, known as the K30."
00:03:51,00:03:55,- I found out about those in the course of researching this.
00:03:55,00:03:58,"And only in the course of researching this, I'd like to say."
00:03:58,00:04:00,But do you know where the world's largest collection is
00:04:00,00:04:04,of what get called Tarte's Cards in phone boxes?
00:04:04,00:04:05,- Did they still get called that?
00:04:05,00:04:06,Wow.
00:04:06,00:04:07,- They do in academics.
00:04:07,00:04:09,"- So they, righty."
00:04:09,00:04:11,Is it in the British Library?
00:04:11,00:04:12,- So close.
00:04:12,00:04:13,You're about 100 meters away.
00:04:13,00:04:15,"It's the Welcome Library,"
00:04:15,00:04:17,"the amazing Institute of, you know,"
00:04:17,00:04:18,they've got all sorts of collections
00:04:18,00:04:22,and they have 17 boxes of them.
00:04:22,00:04:22,- What is that?
00:04:22,00:04:25,- Collected by one employee called Steven.
00:04:25,00:04:27,"He still collects new ones, doesn't he?"
00:04:27,00:04:29,He goes around London
00:04:29,00:04:31,'cause he's updating the collection all the time.
00:04:31,00:04:31,- Wow.
00:04:31,00:04:33,"And what a coincidence that he works for the Welcome Library,"
00:04:33,00:04:35,which is also a place that collects things.
00:04:35,00:04:36,- Yeah.
00:04:36,00:04:39,Is it advertised as part of the collection
00:04:39,00:04:40,or is it like once you've been round
00:04:40,00:04:43,"a relatively dry selection of old manuscripts,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,you might want a fun time at the end?
00:04:45,00:04:47,"- Actually, at the Welcome Collection,"
00:04:47,00:04:48,they do have a lovely little cafe
00:04:48,00:04:51,that has a selection of various tarts.
00:04:51,00:04:52,So they do.
00:04:52,00:04:53,- Thanks.
00:04:53,00:04:54,- It's good to know.
00:04:54,00:04:55,- It's really interesting.
00:04:55,00:04:56,"Just on those, it sort of started"
00:04:56,00:04:59,the idea of these tart cards in phone boxes
00:04:59,00:05:02,started supposedly in Soho area.
00:05:02,00:05:03,"And when they first went up,"
00:05:03,00:05:05,they were done purely with words.
00:05:05,00:05:09,"And in order to go past obscenity laws and so on,"
00:05:09,00:05:11,they had to do coded advertisement.
00:05:11,00:05:12,"So for example,"
00:05:12,00:05:16,you might see one that said large chest for sale.
00:05:16,00:05:19,"And you would know that that was some,"
00:05:19,00:05:22,"I mean, there was reports that the worker in question"
00:05:22,00:05:25,did have to field lots of calls from furniture buyers
00:05:25,00:05:26,as a result of that.
00:05:26,00:05:29,But it would be all these kind of innuendo.
00:05:29,00:05:29,- Wow.
00:05:29,00:05:30,- Early phone boxes were so cool.
00:05:30,00:05:32,"Some of them had carpets inside,"
00:05:32,00:05:36,just one tiny square of carpet on the ground indoors.
00:05:36,00:05:38,They all had cigarette rests.
00:05:38,00:05:40,"So you could rest your fag while you were smoking,"
00:05:40,00:05:41,which I love.
00:05:41,00:05:42,- Nice.
00:05:42,00:05:43,"- Yeah, oak finishes."
00:05:43,00:05:45,They were quite gorgeous things in the early days.
00:05:45,00:05:48,"You know, now almost all phone boxes have been adapted"
00:05:48,00:05:49,into other things like many libraries
00:05:49,00:05:51,"or what internet cafes or whatever,"
00:05:51,00:05:53,because people aren't using them to phone anymore.
00:05:53,00:05:56,"Even in 1938, I read a letter,"
00:05:56,00:05:58,"furious letter, into the Belfast Telegraph"
00:05:58,00:06:00,"by a man who said, ""I had to make a phone call."
00:06:00,00:06:03,"""So I went to a phone box and I was held up for 10 minutes"
00:06:03,00:06:05,"""by two ladies inside."
00:06:05,00:06:08,"""And of course the two ladies were not using the phone."
00:06:08,00:06:11,"""There was a mirror in the phone box as a lot of them had"
00:06:11,00:06:12,"""and they were penciling their eyebrows"
00:06:12,00:06:15,"""and powdering their noses."""
00:06:15,00:06:17,"And as he said, ""Surely we see enough"
00:06:17,00:06:19,"""of these empty-headed, useless, modern girls"
00:06:19,00:06:21,"""applying makeup on trams and buses,"
00:06:21,00:06:23,"""without having to wait for them outside the home boxes."""
00:06:23,00:06:25,- I'm trying to buy a chest.
00:06:25,00:06:27,(laughing)
00:06:27,00:06:29,- He signed off bachelor bill
00:06:29,00:06:31,"and like it remained so, I imagined."
00:06:31,00:06:32,- Wow.
00:06:32,00:06:33,- Yeah.
00:06:33,00:06:35,"- Well, they do, they are being repurposed at the moment"
00:06:35,00:06:37,just to jump to current times.
00:06:37,00:06:39,"There's basically a graveyard, isn't there,"
00:06:39,00:06:42,of where they've been collected by restorers
00:06:42,00:06:44,who field calls from around the world of people
00:06:44,00:06:49,wanting to own a precious historical K6 phone box.
00:06:49,00:06:50,And they get all sorts of real--
00:06:50,00:06:52,- Is that what you would say at graveyarders?
00:06:52,00:06:53,"- Well, you take things--"
00:06:53,00:06:55,- It's your graveyards where you send your dad
00:06:55,00:06:57,"and they get refurbished and sent back to you, right?"
00:06:57,00:06:59,(laughing)
00:06:59,00:07:01,"- You're right, what is it?"
00:07:01,00:07:04,"Yeah, it's like a hospital."
00:07:04,00:07:06,(laughing)
00:07:06,00:07:07,- It's a plastic surgery.
00:07:07,00:07:10,"- Yeah, that's what it is. - Yeah, that's it, yeah."
00:07:10,00:07:13,"And they, yeah, so they're restoring them."
00:07:13,00:07:15,And the people who buy them sort of have a request
00:07:15,00:07:16,that there was a guy in Saudi Arabia
00:07:16,00:07:18,who really wanted his turned into a shower.
00:07:18,00:07:20,So they've sort of had to look into doing that.
00:07:20,00:07:23,And there's a huge waiting list
00:07:23,00:07:27,and they can only restore so many per year
00:07:27,00:07:28,'cause it's a big job.
00:07:28,00:07:31,"You have to match the color, which is post office red,"
00:07:31,00:07:35,which is quite an easy thing to do 'cause it is available.
00:07:35,00:07:36,"But, so that's not--"
00:07:36,00:07:38,"- It sounds like a nightmare, Dad, no, no."
00:07:38,00:07:40,(laughing)
00:07:40,00:07:42,"- You've got to put the new glass in,"
00:07:42,00:07:43,which they use just classic glass.
00:07:43,00:07:45,So you've got to source that.
00:07:45,00:07:46,(laughing)
00:07:46,00:07:49,Very accessible wood involved and just your basic steel.
00:07:49,00:07:51,So it's a nightmare over there.
00:07:51,00:07:53,"- Yeah, gosh."
00:07:53,00:07:56,"- Dad, is that Merstem you're talking about?"
00:07:56,00:07:59,"- Yeah, I mean, how many graveyards are there?"
00:07:59,00:08:02,"- I just, I know the village of Merstem and it's lovely."
00:08:02,00:08:03,That's worth it.
00:08:03,00:08:06,- I think I've been to the place where the graveyard is.
00:08:06,00:08:07,- It's in Surrey. - Yeah.
00:08:07,00:08:08,"- Surrey, bit beyond Croydon."
00:08:08,00:08:10,- I have a feeling that I deliberately drove my wife
00:08:10,00:08:12,about 50 miles out of our direction
00:08:12,00:08:14,just to see that graveyard once.
00:08:14,00:08:16,"- It doesn't sound like you, Jaws."
00:08:16,00:08:19,(laughing)
00:08:19,00:08:23,"Did they let you in, James, to browse the dead?"
00:08:23,00:08:24,- I can't remember.
00:08:24,00:08:27,- They were too busy frantically trying to find some glass.
00:08:27,00:08:29,(laughing)
00:08:29,00:08:37,"The guy who invented, designed many of the models"
00:08:37,00:08:39,"in the phone box, he did the two, the three,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,and the K6 as well.
00:08:41,00:08:44,"Giles Gilbert Scott, he was an unbelievable guy."
00:08:44,00:08:45,"In fact, we've mentioned him once or twice before"
00:08:45,00:08:48,"'cause Dan, you said ages ago that he did"
00:08:48,00:08:51,Battersea Power Station and the phone boxes
00:08:51,00:08:51,and other stuff.
00:08:51,00:08:53,"- Yeah, and he did Waterloo Bridge"
00:08:53,00:08:55,and he did the Tate Modern Building.
00:08:55,00:08:57,"I mean, his imprint."
00:08:57,00:08:58,- House of Commons.
00:08:58,00:08:59,- House of Commons.
00:08:59,00:09:01,"- The, yes."
00:09:01,00:09:03,"- After it, definitely."
00:09:03,00:09:04,"- No, he did the phone box"
00:09:04,00:09:06,outside the front of the house of commas.
00:09:06,00:09:09,"- No, no, I'm not letting that go."
00:09:09,00:09:10,It was bombed in the war.
00:09:10,00:09:13,"And he, I mean, he basically, he did the redesign"
00:09:13,00:09:15,"of the recreation of the chamber after the war,"
00:09:15,00:09:18,but he did do it the same as Pugin's design.
00:09:18,00:09:22,"But his family, so he was Giles Gilbert Scott, right?"
00:09:22,00:09:26,"His father was George Gilbert Scott, also an architect."
00:09:26,00:09:29,His father was also called George Gilbert Scott
00:09:29,00:09:31,"and was also an architect, right?"
00:09:31,00:09:32,- Wow.
00:09:32,00:09:33,"- His son, Richard, was another architect."
00:09:33,00:09:37,"Richard Gilbert Scott, also an architect, died in 2017."
00:09:37,00:09:39,"There was an Elizabeth Gilbert Scott,"
00:09:39,00:09:41,"or Elizabeth Scott, who was the cousin of Giles"
00:09:41,00:09:44,and did the Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford.
00:09:44,00:09:45,- This whole family. - Wow.
00:09:45,00:09:47,- Of Scots and Gilbert Scots.
00:09:47,00:09:48,They've just done so much.
00:09:48,00:09:49,- Yeah.
00:09:49,00:09:50,"- George Gilbert Scott Jr.,"
00:09:50,00:09:52,"the son of the first George Gilbert Scott,"
00:09:52,00:09:55,"died in the Midland Hotel at St. Pancras,"
00:09:55,00:09:57,which his own father had designed.
00:09:57,00:09:58,- Wow.
00:09:58,00:09:59,I really thought you were gonna say he died
00:09:59,00:10:01,"in the phone box, which would have been so tragic."
00:10:01,00:10:03,(laughing)
00:10:03,00:10:06,"- That St. Pancras Hotel, which he designed,"
00:10:06,00:10:10,is where they filmed the wannabe video for the Skies Girls.
00:10:10,00:10:11,- Is it?
00:10:11,00:10:13,- Which I think of all these things that they did
00:10:13,00:10:14,is probably the absolute pinnacle.
00:10:14,00:10:15,- Wow.
00:10:15,00:10:16,- So yeah.
00:10:16,00:10:19,"- And the takeaway fact of this whole episode,"
00:10:19,00:10:20,that is awesome.
00:10:20,00:10:22,"- If you go there, and I don't think"
00:10:22,00:10:24,"we should encourage everyone to go there,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,you can just go and stand on that staircase
00:10:26,00:10:28,where they kind of come down at the start
00:10:28,00:10:29,and do their little-
00:10:29,00:10:31,"- Oh, I remember that scene."
00:10:31,00:10:32,"Okay, that's part of the context."
00:10:32,00:10:34,"- I really hope when you check in at Concierge,"
00:10:34,00:10:36,"they say, ""What do you want?"""
00:10:36,00:10:37,(laughing)
00:10:37,00:10:38,- I'll tell you what I want.
00:10:38,00:10:40,(laughing)
00:10:40,00:10:42,"- There was originally gonna be a George Gilbert Scotty spice,"
00:10:42,00:10:44,but they had to reject the idea.
00:10:44,00:10:47,(laughing)
00:10:47,00:10:52,- Did he design George Gilbert Scotty the K-4?
00:10:52,00:10:54,"I guess he did, 'cause again, it looked like all the rest."
00:10:54,00:10:56,- I think he was all Ks.
00:10:56,00:10:57,I thought he was all the Ks.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"- I believe not, actually."
00:10:59,00:11:00,"- Oh, wow, really?"
00:11:00,00:11:01,- Really?
00:11:01,00:11:03,"- Then he was plagiarized in the K-4, which was the best."
00:11:03,00:11:05,So it's my favorite of the Ks.
00:11:05,00:11:06,"- Okay, wow."
00:11:06,00:11:09,- And that's because it was also a self-service post office.
00:11:09,00:11:14,So it had a stump dispenser and a letterbox
00:11:14,00:11:15,added to the back of it.
00:11:15,00:11:16,There are only 50 made.
00:11:16,00:11:17,It was actually a bit of a disaster.
00:11:17,00:11:19,I think it was quite expensive.
00:11:19,00:11:22,"But yeah, it had a post machine"
00:11:22,00:11:23,"where you could put your money in,"
00:11:23,00:11:26,"you get some stamps out, you post your letter,"
00:11:26,00:11:28,and there are five remaining.
00:11:28,00:11:30,"So if you live in the village with any of those five,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,then go and visit and pay it a respect.
00:11:32,00:11:35,"- Yeah, if you want to make a online call or send a letter,"
00:11:35,00:11:37,which we all do every single day these days.
00:11:37,00:11:41,- I'm out of phone box stuff.
00:11:41,00:11:42,A couple of things on thatch.
00:11:42,00:11:44,"- Yeah, sure."
00:11:44,00:11:49,"- So thatch is no longer a major thing in the UK,"
00:11:49,00:11:52,but there are still some outputs.
00:11:52,00:11:54,"So I think about 60,000, 50 or 60,000 homes"
00:11:54,00:11:57,"in the UK are thatched, which is quite a lot to me."
00:11:57,00:11:59,"Loads of Norfolk, loads in Suffolk."
00:11:59,00:12:03,"There's one thatched Brewery, which is in Bridport in Dorset."
00:12:03,00:12:07,"And Dorset actually, it's got two model thatched villages"
00:12:07,00:12:12,"and in the village of Sheterton, a thatched wall."
00:12:12,00:12:14,- Really?
00:12:14,00:12:15,- What?
00:12:15,00:12:19,"- Okay, which, am I allowed to pick you up on the town today?"
00:12:19,00:12:21,"- The village of, yeah."
00:12:21,00:12:22,- So that's a real place?
00:12:22,00:12:23,"- Sheterton is a real place,"
00:12:23,00:12:26,and it's not the point of the fact.
00:12:26,00:12:27,"- No, I'm sorry, yeah."
00:12:27,00:12:29,"- No, you must have been so frustrated"
00:12:29,00:12:31,"when you found that fact and you thought,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,"what I want them to talk about is the thatched wall,"
00:12:33,00:12:36,but you know what they're going to focus on?
00:12:36,00:12:38,It's bloody Sheterton.
00:12:38,00:12:40,Why do they need to thatch the wall?
00:12:40,00:12:42,"Is it to protect it from, you know?"
00:12:42,00:12:45,"- I think there might be a summer house somewhere,"
00:12:45,00:12:47,"halfway along it, but it is basically a wall"
00:12:47,00:12:50,that's just covered in a thatched roof all the way along.
00:12:50,00:12:51,That's pretty sweet.
00:12:51,00:12:51,- That's pretty good.
00:12:51,00:12:53,Good reason to go to Sheterton.
00:12:53,00:12:56,"Do you know what in thatching,"
00:12:56,00:12:58,do you know what a butt is?
00:12:58,00:12:58,- I don't know.
00:12:58,00:13:01,"- It's if you have a bundle of reeds or straw,"
00:13:01,00:13:03,it's the thicker end of that.
00:13:03,00:13:04,It's called the butt.
00:13:04,00:13:06,Do you know what a cheek is?
00:13:06,00:13:08,- Is it the opposite of the butt?
00:13:08,00:13:09,"- No, it's the thinner end."
00:13:09,00:13:11,"- It's just a word for the side of a window,"
00:13:11,00:13:14,but that means if you put your thick ends of your straw
00:13:14,00:13:16,"up against your window, you have a butt cheek."
00:13:16,00:13:17,(laughing)
00:13:17,00:13:21,"- Ah, lovely butt cheeks in Sheterton."
00:13:21,00:13:22,- He's not official.
00:13:22,00:13:24,(laughing)
00:13:24,00:13:26,- I'd be so confused if I went into the pay phones
00:13:26,00:13:27,and saw the tarot cards there.
00:13:27,00:13:30,Would you like your butt cheeks plumped?
00:13:30,00:13:32,(laughing)
00:13:32,00:13:34,"- I don't know, plumping butt cheeks"
00:13:34,00:13:37,is actually a service offered by most cool girls.
00:13:37,00:13:38,Could be wrong.
00:13:38,00:13:43,"There's this amazing website called thatchinginfo.com,"
00:13:43,00:13:46,which I don't know how this man who is a thatcher
00:13:46,00:13:49,"has also had time to put together this vast resource,"
00:13:49,00:13:52,but it's everything you ever needed to know about thatching.
00:13:52,00:13:54,"And he, one of the things he reports on"
00:13:54,00:13:57,is the difference in thatches around the country.
00:13:57,00:14:00,So the UK is split into five thatching regions
00:14:00,00:14:04,and they more broadly fall into two categories.
00:14:04,00:14:06,"So you've got the rounded, soft,"
00:14:06,00:14:07,"kind of squishy looking thatch,"
00:14:07,00:14:10,which I would say is your classic thatch.
00:14:10,00:14:12,And then you've got your much more angular thatch
00:14:12,00:14:14,and you know which thatch you're gonna see
00:14:14,00:14:17,because it exactly depends on
00:14:17,00:14:19,if you're North or South of the A5.
00:14:19,00:14:21,(laughing)
00:14:21,00:14:22,"- Oh, wow."
00:14:22,00:14:24,- It's so weird and so cool.
00:14:24,00:14:26,And this is something that he discovered photographing them.
00:14:26,00:14:29,And that's 'cause the A5 goes along the old road
00:14:29,00:14:31,that was called Wattling Street.
00:14:31,00:14:32,And that was a really ancient road.
00:14:32,00:14:34,It's been around since ancient Rome.
00:14:34,00:14:36,And that was where Wattling Street was used
00:14:36,00:14:38,as the dividing line between Dane Law.
00:14:38,00:14:40,So when the Danes came over and took over
00:14:40,00:14:42,sort of the North of England.
00:14:42,00:14:45,And the dividing line between Dane Law
00:14:45,00:14:47,and then the Anglo-Saxons on the South.
00:14:47,00:14:49,So the thatch to the North of the A6
00:14:49,00:14:52,"all looks a bit like Danish or German style thatch,"
00:14:52,00:14:55,"angular, and the South all looks like Anglo-Saxon thatch."
00:14:55,00:14:56,Isn't that cool?
00:14:56,00:14:57,- That is amazing.
00:14:57,00:14:58,But what everyone wants to know
00:14:58,00:15:00,is what kind of thatch is shittaton.
00:15:00,00:15:02,(laughing)
00:15:02,00:15:03,"- Right, where's shittaton again?"
00:15:03,00:15:05,"- That'll be around it, it's in Dorset."
00:15:05,00:15:06,- Yeah.
00:15:06,00:15:09,"- I read that on thatchinginfo.com,"
00:15:09,00:15:11,"which I have to say is, I agree with Anna,"
00:15:11,00:15:13,is an amazing website.
00:15:13,00:15:15,They said that the thatcher was like one
00:15:15,00:15:18,of the most important people in the village
00:15:18,00:15:20,and he was full of infinite gossip.
00:15:21,00:15:24,Because obviously he's kind of in the eaves
00:15:24,00:15:28,"of the buildings, literally eaves dropping"
00:15:28,00:15:29,'cause that's where he's hiding
00:15:29,00:15:32,and he could hear everything that was happening.
00:15:32,00:15:34,They have lots of examples of the people
00:15:34,00:15:35,who were doing the work
00:15:35,00:15:37,and a lot of them were women as well.
00:15:37,00:15:41,They have an example from Ripon from 1399
00:15:41,00:15:43,"of some female helpers who were,"
00:15:43,00:15:44,they weren't doing like the main work
00:15:44,00:15:47,but they would tend to do like the collecting
00:15:47,00:15:49,of the straw and stuff like that.
00:15:49,00:15:52,"For instance, Tess, from Tess of the Durba Bills,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,she was in that novel.
00:15:54,00:15:57,"She kind of works alongside the threshing machine,"
00:15:57,00:16:00,which is getting the cereal off the stalk
00:16:00,00:16:01,so that you can wrap them together
00:16:01,00:16:03,"and turn them into thatch, so yeah."
00:16:03,00:16:05,- Right.
00:16:05,00:16:05,- Cool.
00:16:05,00:16:06,- I thought you were about to ruin the ending
00:16:06,00:16:09,of Tess of the Dourba Bills as well.
00:16:09,00:16:11,"- I haven't read it, so I can't, I would."
00:16:11,00:16:14,"- Right, she leans too far over into the thatching machine"
00:16:14,00:16:15,and her head comes right off.
00:16:15,00:16:18,(laughing)
00:16:18,00:16:20,(upbeat music)
00:16:20,00:16:24,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two"
00:16:24,00:16:27,and that is James.
00:16:27,00:16:30,"- Okay, my fact this week is that dinosaurs migrated."
00:16:30,00:16:33,That's it.
00:16:33,00:16:35,- We left a pause for where the rest
00:16:35,00:16:39,"of the sentence should be, but it's such brevity,"
00:16:39,00:16:40,we couldn't fill it.
00:16:40,00:16:44,"- It is merely a two-word fact, which I didn't know."
00:16:44,00:16:44,- How?
00:16:44,00:16:46,- So where are they going from and to?
00:16:46,00:16:48,"What are they looking for, Sonia Climes?"
00:16:48,00:16:51,"- I think more food, definitely,"
00:16:51,00:16:53,which obviously Sonia Climes can often give you that.
00:16:53,00:16:57,And this was in North America specifically
00:16:57,00:16:59,and it was a new study by a guy called Josh Malone
00:16:59,00:17:02,who was at the Jackson School of Geosciences
00:17:02,00:17:04,at the University of Texas in Austin.
00:17:04,00:17:06,"And it's really cool, what happened was"
00:17:06,00:17:10,he was visiting his dad and he was in one part of America
00:17:10,00:17:13,"and he said, ""One of these weird stones on the floor."""
00:17:13,00:17:15,"And his dad said, ""Oh, they're gastroliths."""
00:17:15,00:17:18,"And gastrolith is something that if you're a bird,"
00:17:18,00:17:19,you will swallow bits of stone
00:17:19,00:17:21,and it helps you to digest things
00:17:21,00:17:22,'cause it crushes up the food.
00:17:22,00:17:24,And dinosaurs had these as well.
00:17:24,00:17:27,And so he went back to school and started studying
00:17:27,00:17:31,and then decided to do a paper on these stones.
00:17:31,00:17:33,And what he found is that the stones that they found
00:17:33,00:17:37,in Wisconsin actually originated in Wyoming.
00:17:37,00:17:39,And he looked for all the different ways
00:17:39,00:17:41,that they could have gotten from Wyoming to Wisconsin
00:17:41,00:17:43,and he couldn't find a single other way.
00:17:43,00:17:44,There were no rivers that went there.
00:17:44,00:17:46,There was no other way they could have gone.
00:17:46,00:17:48,So they've worked out that they must have come
00:17:48,00:17:49,in the stomachs of dinosaurs.
00:17:49,00:17:51,And this is the best evidence that we have so far.
00:17:51,00:17:53,"There's quite a bit of other evidence,"
00:17:53,00:17:54,but this is the best evidence that we have
00:17:54,00:17:57,that dinosaurs moved from one place to another
00:17:57,00:18:00,on regular occurrences to get more food.
00:18:00,00:18:02,- And what's one of the things he considered
00:18:02,00:18:04,the possibility of extremely explosive diarrhea?
00:18:04,00:18:06,(laughing)
00:18:06,00:18:09,"I mean, how far is it from Wyoming to Wisconsin?"
00:18:09,00:18:11,If you're really propelling it.
00:18:11,00:18:13,- It's about 600 miles.
00:18:14,00:18:15,- Okay.
00:18:15,00:18:16,- It's bad.
00:18:16,00:18:17,"- You know, it's possible."
00:18:17,00:18:18,I'm just saying.
00:18:18,00:18:21,A T-Rex looks like it could fire it that far.
00:18:21,00:18:22,"- The earth was closer back then, wasn't it?"
00:18:22,00:18:23,'Cause of Gondwana land.
00:18:23,00:18:27,So maybe it was six meters and it's just expanded.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"- Yeah, the theory's falling apart, James."
00:18:29,00:18:30,I'm so sorry.
00:18:30,00:18:36,- But these were the really big dinosaurs.
00:18:36,00:18:39,The big long-necked sauropods that you'll know
00:18:39,00:18:42,from your models as a child.
00:18:42,00:18:45,And we know that they had to eat all the time.
00:18:45,00:18:47,"And we know that if they'd have stayed where they were,"
00:18:47,00:18:48,they wouldn't be enough food.
00:18:48,00:18:50,So they would have to move.
00:18:50,00:18:51,But this is just the first evidence of it.
00:18:51,00:18:52,- That's interesting.
00:18:52,00:18:56,Sauropods are also responsible for what we know
00:18:56,00:18:59,is the longest obvious journey
00:18:59,00:19:02,that one single sauropod has made.
00:19:02,00:19:04,"There's a trackway, which is in France,"
00:19:04,00:19:05,"which has been found,"
00:19:05,00:19:10,which covers 150 meters of one sauropod walking.
00:19:10,00:19:10,"- Oh, wow."
00:19:10,00:19:15,- There's 500 feet worth of foot impressions
00:19:15,00:19:17,from this dinosaur.
00:19:17,00:19:20,And it's the longest one singular walk
00:19:20,00:19:23,that's been sort of held in the ground that we have.
00:19:23,00:19:27,"And that's just, there's little two records there"
00:19:27,00:19:30,for migration and for longest obvious walk.
00:19:30,00:19:34,"- Well, we can definitely take from that that they did walk,"
00:19:34,00:19:36,which is more evidence that they migrated.
00:19:36,00:19:37,- I'm just trying to help you out
00:19:37,00:19:39,because I know we ruined your theory earlier.
00:19:39,00:19:42,And I just wanna help build it back up.
00:19:42,00:19:43,- Just on dinosaurs.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"- Oh, yeah."
00:19:44,00:19:47,- I really liked the fact that there were dinosaurs
00:19:47,00:19:48,"living at the poles,"
00:19:48,00:19:50,which I had never considered before studying
00:19:50,00:19:51,for research this fact.
00:19:51,00:19:55,"Yeah, the poles were much friendlier places"
00:19:55,00:19:57,during the time of the dinosaurs.
00:19:57,00:19:58,They were still cold.
00:19:58,00:19:59,"They had snow and ice in the winter months,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,but it looks like there were dinosaurs.
00:20:01,00:20:03,"And again, this is a recent discovery,"
00:20:03,00:20:05,living there all year round.
00:20:05,00:20:07,"And they even, we think, slowed their growth down"
00:20:07,00:20:08,during the colder seasons
00:20:08,00:20:12,"so that they could cope with being a bit colder,"
00:20:12,00:20:13,"having a bit less resources,"
00:20:13,00:20:14,which is what shrews do today.
00:20:14,00:20:17,I think we've mentioned that before.
00:20:17,00:20:18,"So, yeah."
00:20:18,00:20:21,- The wear of dinosaurs in what is now the UK
00:20:21,00:20:23,"or the British Isles,"
00:20:23,00:20:26,we know that there are guanodons lived here
00:20:26,00:20:28,'cause we found their bones.
00:20:28,00:20:30,"But actually, if you think about it,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,they weren't exactly where we are today.
00:20:32,00:20:35,"They were about 50,000 light years away."
00:20:35,00:20:39,And that is because the solar system moves around
00:20:39,00:20:43,"the center of the galaxy, right?"
00:20:43,00:20:45,And it's always moving.
00:20:45,00:20:46,"Like we move around the sun,"
00:20:46,00:20:49,the entire solar system moves around the universe.
00:20:49,00:20:53,"And so the entire solar system is 50,000 light years away"
00:20:53,00:20:55,from where it was when the dinosaurs were alive.
00:20:55,00:20:57,So even though they lived on the same bit of land
00:20:57,00:20:59,"where we are, if you think about it,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,"space-wise, they were nowhere near us."
00:21:01,00:21:02,- Wow.
00:21:02,00:21:04,"- Yeah, I saw there's online."
00:21:04,00:21:06,It's really worth checking out on Twitter.
00:21:06,00:21:09,There's a video by Dr. Jesse Christensen.
00:21:09,00:21:11,And it's an animation that shows
00:21:11,00:21:13,"exactly what you're talking about, James."
00:21:13,00:21:17,"And during, yeah, the guanodon and the gigantosaurus era,"
00:21:17,00:21:21,they're literally on the other side of the galaxy
00:21:21,00:21:23,to where we are in space-time.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"And if you picture our position right now,"
00:21:25,00:21:26,"if it was, say, a compass,"
00:21:26,00:21:29,"we're sort of southwest on the compass,"
00:21:29,00:21:32,"just close, very close to the south, but southwest."
00:21:32,00:21:36,"And as you go up, sort of on the west angle of the compass"
00:21:36,00:21:38,"is when stegosaurus comes in,"
00:21:38,00:21:41,in terms of the spacing of our entire galaxy.
00:21:41,00:21:43,Then you get to the top.
00:21:43,00:21:45,And that's when you suddenly get the guanodon
00:21:45,00:21:47,and the gigantosaurus.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"And then if you were east on the compass,"
00:21:49,00:21:50,that's when things like the T-Rex
00:21:50,00:21:53,and the Velociraptor are coming in.
00:21:53,00:21:54,"Then finally, in space-time,"
00:21:54,00:21:58,you have the big moment where the extinction moment happened.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"And that is roughly southeast,"
00:22:00,00:22:04,sort of in-between east and south on the compass.
00:22:04,00:22:06,But the dinosaur period did start
00:22:06,00:22:10,in the period of the galaxy that we are now in.
00:22:10,00:22:12,That was the initial bit.
00:22:12,00:22:14,"- Oh, so we've gone round once?"
00:22:14,00:22:15,- Yeah.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"- Oh, I see."
00:22:16,00:22:19,So we've done one circumnavigation of the clock face already.
00:22:19,00:22:20,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:22:20,00:22:23,And the spot we're in is basically in a similar area
00:22:23,00:22:27,to where dinosaurs became in existence.
00:22:27,00:22:29,"- One galactic year ago,"
00:22:29,00:22:33,"there were dinosaurs on Earth, is kind of what I was saying."
00:22:33,00:22:34,- Exactly.
00:22:34,00:22:36,"- So we might, once we get all the way round,"
00:22:36,00:22:38,we might bump into them again.
00:22:38,00:22:40,"It's possible one of them may have got left behind,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,still hanging there in space.
00:22:42,00:22:43,A brontosaurus.
00:22:43,00:22:48,- The aliens we met on our way around the last time
00:22:48,00:22:51,"have been busy sewing us cool new costumes,"
00:22:51,00:22:54,but they think we're still dinosaurs.
00:22:54,00:22:57,- That's why dinosaur onesies became so popular
00:22:57,00:22:58,a few years ago.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"- Hang on, you think if we meet aliens,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,they're going to deliver us gifts of outfits
00:23:03,00:23:05,they think we might like?
00:23:05,00:23:07,"- Yeah, because we already know that the dinosaurs lived"
00:23:07,00:23:08,in the North Pole and the South Pole.
00:23:08,00:23:10,They must be cold.
00:23:10,00:23:12,They needed something knitting for them.
00:23:12,00:23:14,It's like when you get people knitting little jumpers
00:23:14,00:23:15,for penguins.
00:23:15,00:23:16,- Got it.
00:23:16,00:23:18,This is a very benevolent alien theory.
00:23:18,00:23:21,"- Like a charity case, basically."
00:23:21,00:23:21,"In the course of this,"
00:23:21,00:23:24,I was reading a bit about the asteroid
00:23:24,00:23:25,which killed the dinosaurs.
00:23:25,00:23:27,"- Oh, yeah."
00:23:27,00:23:30,"- And you know, exactly what it was like physically."
00:23:30,00:23:32,And there was so much that I hadn't really considered it.
00:23:32,00:23:37,"Firstly, it was about 15 kilometers across, right?"
00:23:37,00:23:39,And I hadn't really considered it
00:23:39,00:23:41,"'cause you think of it just being a crater now,"
00:23:41,00:23:44,"but basically when it hit, just before it vaporized,"
00:23:44,00:23:46,it would have been twice the height of Mount Everest.
00:23:46,00:23:50,"As in if it had just bumped into the earth slightly,"
00:23:50,00:23:52,it would now be two times as high as Mount Everest.
00:23:52,00:23:55,"- Oh, as in if it had just very softly landed on the earth."
00:23:55,00:23:56,(laughing)
00:23:56,00:23:58,- Still hasn't that.
00:23:58,00:23:58,- I see.
00:23:58,00:23:59,- Exactly.
00:23:59,00:24:00,Isn't that incredible?
00:24:00,00:24:01,Twice the height of Mount Everest.
00:24:01,00:24:05,- Have you seen that simulation that the BBC put on their site
00:24:05,00:24:08,"about how basically when it hit,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,"it effectively, the heat was so great"
00:24:10,00:24:13,that it kind of liquefied the rock
00:24:13,00:24:15,that it rammed into.
00:24:15,00:24:18,So it kind of created a wave
00:24:18,00:24:21,"and the highest point went as high,"
00:24:21,00:24:23,if not higher than Mount Everest.
00:24:23,00:24:27,"So in the 10 minutes after we were hit,"
00:24:27,00:24:28,we had a mountain on this planet
00:24:28,00:24:30,that was taller than Mount Everest
00:24:30,00:24:31,and it collapsed on itself
00:24:31,00:24:34,into lots of different less high mountains
00:24:34,00:24:37,and then eventually became part of the landscape.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"But just in that moment, yeah,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,we had a mountain taller than Mount Everest.
00:24:41,00:24:43,- Was it like a liquid rock mountain though?
00:24:43,00:24:44,You won't be able to climb it.
00:24:44,00:24:46,"You might be able to surf that, I suppose."
00:24:46,00:24:47,"- Yeah, and you only had,"
00:24:47,00:24:49,you'd have to be really prepared
00:24:49,00:24:51,with your crampods and so on.
00:24:51,00:24:53,(laughing)
00:24:53,00:24:55,You'd have to have inside knowledge that was coming.
00:24:55,00:24:56,- Yeah.
00:24:56,00:24:58,- Do you know that dinosaurs to impress each other
00:24:58,00:25:01,had whole digging competitions?
00:25:01,00:25:02,- Wow. - We think.
00:25:02,00:25:03,- They must have been so impressed
00:25:03,00:25:05,when that meteorite came down.
00:25:05,00:25:06,(laughing)
00:25:06,00:25:09,- The sexiest dinosaur ever.
00:25:09,00:25:11,- You can imagine a particularly good
00:25:11,00:25:13,whole digging dinosaur coming back up
00:25:13,00:25:15,and having missed the whole event.
00:25:15,00:25:16,Where is everyone?
00:25:16,00:25:19,- All for nothing.
00:25:19,00:25:20,"- Anna, what do you mean?"
00:25:20,00:25:21,- We think they did this.
00:25:21,00:25:22,So this is a recent discovery.
00:25:22,00:25:25,"Researchers in Colorado have found these kind of borrows,"
00:25:25,00:25:27,"these long trenches, ancient trenches"
00:25:27,00:25:29,from the Cretaceous period.
00:25:29,00:25:31,And they have a few footprints inside them
00:25:31,00:25:33,"that match at theropods,"
00:25:33,00:25:35,which are things like velociraptors.
00:25:35,00:25:38,"And so these big trenches,"
00:25:38,00:25:39,and there aren't any fossils inside them
00:25:39,00:25:42,that would imply they use them for things like storage
00:25:42,00:25:43,or they lived in them
00:25:43,00:25:46,or they were for protection or anything.
00:25:46,00:25:50,And they deduce basically that it must have been showing up
00:25:50,00:25:52,'cause basically dinosaurs are digging these big trenches
00:25:52,00:25:53,for absolutely no reason whatsoever.
00:25:53,00:25:57,So they believe now it's a way to attract a mate.
00:25:57,00:25:59,Let's dig a big hole and still works.
00:25:59,00:26:02,(laughing)
00:26:02,00:26:05,"- You see that on the phone booth cards, don't you?"
00:26:05,00:26:07,- But phone me for a big hole.
00:26:07,00:26:10,That's not even trying on the euphemism stakes.
00:26:10,00:26:13,(laughing)
00:26:13,00:26:16,Do you know that there were no medium sized dinosaurs?
00:26:16,00:26:18,I find this amazing.
00:26:18,00:26:21,"- Goldilocks would have had a terrible time, wouldn't you?"
00:26:21,00:26:22,Dinosaur era.
00:26:22,00:26:24,- Goldilocks and the three dinosaurs.
00:26:24,00:26:25,(laughing)
00:26:25,00:26:26,"- No, the two dinosaurs"
00:26:26,00:26:29,'cause there was no medium sized ones.
00:26:29,00:26:31,And this was a study by Catlin Schroeder
00:26:31,00:26:33,at the University of New Mexico.
00:26:33,00:26:36,And they've looked at all the different dinosaur species
00:26:36,00:26:38,looking at different communities.
00:26:38,00:26:40,"And they found that generally speaking,"
00:26:40,00:26:43,they all had a weight of under 100 kilograms
00:26:43,00:26:45,"or over 1,000 kilograms,"
00:26:45,00:26:47,but there was nothing in between.
00:26:47,00:26:49,I just find that absolutely amazing.
00:26:49,00:26:54,"And the reason, what they think is that the big dinosaurs,"
00:26:54,00:26:56,their children or teenage children
00:26:56,00:26:59,would have been eating all of the food
00:26:59,00:27:01,that would have been normally eaten
00:27:01,00:27:04,by carnivores of that size.
00:27:04,00:27:06,And so basically their children filled in
00:27:06,00:27:08,the niche in the ecosystem
00:27:08,00:27:11,that normally a medium sized animal would take.
00:27:11,00:27:12,"- Oh, really?"
00:27:12,00:27:13,- Isn't that cool?
00:27:13,00:27:15,"- Such a good theory, I really like that, yeah."
00:27:15,00:27:16,- Yeah.
00:27:16,00:27:18,"- And there was the other thing recently,"
00:27:18,00:27:20,"which I also can't believe that,"
00:27:20,00:27:22,"you know, the maximum T-Rex population,"
00:27:22,00:27:23,I'm sure you guys all saw that.
00:27:23,00:27:24,- No.
00:27:24,00:27:26,- The study that found that the total T-Rex population
00:27:26,00:27:29,"over the years was something like 2.5 billion,"
00:27:29,00:27:31,"meaning that if they all came back,"
00:27:31,00:27:34,every three people on earth would be able to share one T-Rex.
00:27:34,00:27:35,(laughing)
00:27:35,00:27:36,- Wow.
00:27:36,00:27:38,"- Well, hey, speaking of living with dinosaurs,"
00:27:38,00:27:41,I have a survey question for you guys.
00:27:41,00:27:43,"If Jurassic Park happened,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,as in if we managed to clone dinosaurs
00:27:46,00:27:49,"and create a big park where they hung out,"
00:27:49,00:27:51,would you visit?
00:27:51,00:27:52,- Yes.
00:27:52,00:27:53,"- Yeah, of course."
00:27:53,00:27:55,"- Well, I've got a thatched wall to see it shitted,"
00:27:55,00:27:58,"but after I've been through that, yes."
00:27:58,00:28:00,"- I'm trying to close a deal on a chest,"
00:28:00,00:28:01,but when I've got that sorted.
00:28:01,00:28:02,(laughing)
00:28:02,00:28:05,"- Okay, I get it, you've all got lives to lead."
00:28:05,00:28:06,You're all a yes.
00:28:06,00:28:08,"Right, there was this poll that was done,"
00:28:08,00:28:10,"and it was in the headlines,"
00:28:10,00:28:13,"'cause it was YouGov Research in 2015,"
00:28:13,00:28:16,and the headline was that 25% of Americans
00:28:16,00:28:20,think that dinosaurs and humans definitely didn't coexist.
00:28:20,00:28:22,So only a quarter of Americans think
00:28:22,00:28:24,"that they definitely didn't coexist,"
00:28:24,00:28:26,"which obviously they didn't, dinosaurs and humans,"
00:28:26,00:28:27,by the way.
00:28:27,00:28:28,"And overall, 14%--"
00:28:28,00:28:30,"- Oh, well, we know what side you fall on there."
00:28:30,00:28:32,(laughing)
00:28:32,00:28:33,Showing your cards.
00:28:33,00:28:34,- It's not my opinion.
00:28:34,00:28:38,"So, 14% thought they definitely did coexist,"
00:28:38,00:28:40,27% thought they probably did coexist.
00:28:40,00:28:42,So like 41% of Americans think
00:28:42,00:28:46,that probably humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time.
00:28:46,00:28:47,Very surprising.
00:28:47,00:28:50,"In the same poll though, downloaded this poll,"
00:28:50,00:28:52,"and the next question after that was,"
00:28:52,00:28:54,"if Jurassic Park existed, would you go?"
00:28:54,00:28:57,Only 40% of people said yes.
00:28:57,00:28:59,Half of people said absolutely not.
00:28:59,00:29:01,"- Well, if your species has already coexisted"
00:29:01,00:29:03,"with the Boston Point, you know?"
00:29:03,00:29:05,(laughing)
00:29:05,00:29:06,"- So you know this poll, Anna?"
00:29:06,00:29:08,Does it distinguish between the people
00:29:08,00:29:12,who actually think that cavemen were living with dinosaurs
00:29:12,00:29:14,"and people who go, ""Well, actually,"
00:29:14,00:29:17,"""I think you'll find that birds are really modern dinosaurs?"""
00:29:17,00:29:18,(laughing)
00:29:18,00:29:19,- That's a good point.
00:29:19,00:29:22,"It doesn't ask, and maybe all of that 41%"
00:29:22,00:29:24,"were terrible pedants like that,"
00:29:24,00:29:26,which might be just worse than people
00:29:26,00:29:28,who genuinely think we live with dinosaurs.
00:29:28,00:29:31,(upbeat music)
00:29:31,00:29:36,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:29:36,00:29:37,and that is my fact.
00:29:37,00:29:39,My fact this week is that in the first half
00:29:39,00:29:42,"of the 20th century, thousands of premature babies"
00:29:42,00:29:46,were treated in amusement parks and fairgrounds
00:29:46,00:29:48,in Europe and the United States.
00:29:48,00:29:50,- How were they treated?
00:29:50,00:29:54,Like in the teacups or in the loop-a-loop or what?
00:29:54,00:29:56,- By clowns.
00:29:56,00:29:59,"- Yeah, this is an extraordinary story."
00:29:59,00:30:03,"This is the story of a man called Dr. Martin Cooney,"
00:30:03,00:30:05,who was known as the incubator doctor.
00:30:05,00:30:08,"And basically, within the amusement parks,"
00:30:08,00:30:11,he set up what you would now see in hospitals
00:30:11,00:30:14,as where premature babies would be resting.
00:30:14,00:30:16,"That started not in hospitals,"
00:30:16,00:30:18,but at the fairgrounds of the world
00:30:18,00:30:22,because doctors didn't believe that incubators could work.
00:30:22,00:30:25,They didn't think there was a purpose to them really
00:30:25,00:30:27,"at the time, premature babies were seen as weaklings."
00:30:27,00:30:31,And this was one guy who very weirdly
00:30:31,00:30:33,was a sort of Petey Barnum-esque kind of character.
00:30:33,00:30:37,He was a real showman who decided
00:30:37,00:30:40,he wanted to try and save children's lives.
00:30:40,00:30:44,"And he created what were known as the infantoriums,"
00:30:44,00:30:48,where you would pay 25 cents to walk into a building
00:30:48,00:30:50,and basically look at children
00:30:50,00:30:53,that were sitting in incubators and watch them growing.
00:30:53,00:30:56,"The nurses used to dress the babies in overgrown clothes,"
00:30:56,00:31:00,really to sort of show how tiny these little babies were.
00:31:00,00:31:01,"- Oh, wow."
00:31:01,00:31:04,"Yeah, you could watch the children being fed milk"
00:31:04,00:31:05,in various different ways.
00:31:05,00:31:08,Either they were fed it via bottle
00:31:08,00:31:09,or they were fed it by the breast
00:31:09,00:31:12,or they were fed it through the nose.
00:31:12,00:31:13,- The feeding through the nose thing is weird
00:31:13,00:31:15,because obviously doesn't work unless you actually
00:31:15,00:31:17,put a feeding tube through someone's nose
00:31:17,00:31:20,"and into someone's, you know, esophagus,"
00:31:20,00:31:22,then you're just inhaling stuff.
00:31:22,00:31:25,"But yeah, they had a special nose feeding spoon."
00:31:25,00:31:28,I think I saw this in another earlier one even.
00:31:28,00:31:31,This was something called the lion incubator
00:31:31,00:31:32,"'cause he didn't actually invent the incubator,"
00:31:32,00:31:35,we should say that came actually a while before him.
00:31:35,00:31:36,But the lion incubator came
00:31:36,00:31:38,and displays were put on of the lion incubator
00:31:38,00:31:40,and there was a nose feeding spoon
00:31:40,00:31:42,and it's basically like a teaspoon.
00:31:42,00:31:45,"And then at the very end, it had a little pointy fold"
00:31:45,00:31:47,and apparently you put milk in it
00:31:47,00:31:49,"and you held it about in the baby's nose,"
00:31:49,00:31:52,kind of shoving the little pointy fold up the baby's nose
00:31:52,00:31:55,"and the baby would breathe the milk in drop by drop,"
00:31:55,00:31:57,like inhaling the fumes.
00:31:57,00:32:00,"Now, I don't believe that that would work."
00:32:00,00:32:02,So I'm surprised that these babies made it.
00:32:02,00:32:06,"- Yeah, so lion, these were the original ones"
00:32:06,00:32:10,"and it's not only that Cooney didn't invent the incubators,"
00:32:10,00:32:12,he didn't invent the idea of showing them off
00:32:12,00:32:14,because lion did that as well.
00:32:14,00:32:15,"And he would rent out shop fronts,"
00:32:15,00:32:18,"wouldn't he, where you could walk down boulevards"
00:32:18,00:32:20,and you could see these babies in the shop fronts.
00:32:20,00:32:23,"And the reason was that his incubators were so expensive,"
00:32:23,00:32:25,the only way they could get the money for them
00:32:25,00:32:29,was to charge people a couple of son teams here
00:32:29,00:32:30,and there to see the babies.
00:32:30,00:32:32,"- Yeah, but what's extraordinary about it?"
00:32:32,00:32:35,"I mean, there's a lot to unpack in the story"
00:32:35,00:32:38,"about this guy, Cooney, because in theory,"
00:32:38,00:32:41,a lot of ethical practices were breached
00:32:41,00:32:43,by a guy who wasn't actually a doctor
00:32:43,00:32:45,as far as we can tell.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"But in his time, he's said to have saved"
00:32:47,00:32:52,"over 6,500 babies, he had a success rate of 85%."
00:32:52,00:32:56,"And not only that, it was basically a version of healthcare"
00:32:56,00:32:58,because the parents didn't have to pay
00:32:58,00:32:59,for the babies to be looked after.
00:32:59,00:33:02,That was the whole point of him going to fairgrounds.
00:33:02,00:33:04,And certain babies would be a bit famous.
00:33:04,00:33:05,They would come and root for a baby
00:33:05,00:33:07,that was growing particularly well.
00:33:07,00:33:09,"It became the place where parents were able to go,"
00:33:09,00:33:13,I have no other option because hospitals don't do this.
00:33:13,00:33:16,I can take it to Dr. Cooney and he can save my child.
00:33:16,00:33:17,And he did.
00:33:17,00:33:18,- I think we're okay with him faking the doctor thing.
00:33:18,00:33:21,"We rarely are, usually we don't like that."
00:33:21,00:33:22,He was a quack who happened upon a cure
00:33:22,00:33:24,that actually worked.
00:33:24,00:33:26,Premature babies survival rates were 15%
00:33:26,00:33:29,before the incubator was invented and marketed.
00:33:29,00:33:31,And they went up to 75% in his time.
00:33:31,00:33:32,- It's really amazing.
00:33:32,00:33:34,But the really nice thing is that some of these babies
00:33:34,00:33:36,will still be alive today.
00:33:36,00:33:37,We're talking about this as though it's a historical thing.
00:33:37,00:33:41,"But in 2015, NPR in the USA,"
00:33:41,00:33:44,they interviewed a lady who was about 94 years old
00:33:44,00:33:46,at the time called Lucille Horn.
00:33:46,00:33:51,And she had been one of the Coney Island babies born in 1920.
00:33:51,00:33:53,"Like you say, Dan, her father had had no other option."
00:33:53,00:33:56,Hospital wasn't providing the right care.
00:33:56,00:33:59,"So he wrapped her in a towel, took her to Martin Cooney,"
00:33:59,00:34:00,who put her in one of the incubators
00:34:00,00:34:03,and she was being interviewed age 94 after that.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"She went back later in life and introduced herself to him,"
00:34:05,00:34:07,"said, ""I used to be one of your babies."""
00:34:07,00:34:08,Which I think is so nice.
00:34:08,00:34:10,"- The most wonderful thing for me about this story,"
00:34:10,00:34:13,"particularly is that Lucille Conan Horn,"
00:34:13,00:34:17,she was a twin and her twin died
00:34:17,00:34:19,and she was prematurely born.
00:34:19,00:34:20,And they were told this is not gonna happen.
00:34:20,00:34:24,So he rushed the child to Dr. Cooney
00:34:24,00:34:26,and had them put him in the incubator.
00:34:26,00:34:28,"And as you say, she died 96 years old."
00:34:28,00:34:30,"And when she died, she was buried"
00:34:30,00:34:32,at the Evergreen Cemetery in Brooklyn
00:34:32,00:34:36,"next to her twin sister who she was told she was gonna be,"
00:34:36,00:34:39,the parents were told she was gonna be buried next to
00:34:39,00:34:40,immediately after.
00:34:40,00:34:43,They in fact told the parents to hold off on the funeral
00:34:43,00:34:46,because they would be bearing two children.
00:34:46,00:34:47,- Wow.
00:34:47,00:34:50,- Another thing about the kids who were in these incubators
00:34:50,00:34:52,is that they were extremely high achieving
00:34:52,00:34:55,'cause they all graduated incredibly early.
00:34:56,00:35:00,Because they graduated from the incubators.
00:35:00,00:35:02,They had a proper graduation ceremony.
00:35:02,00:35:03,So this was part of the showmanship.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"- Proper, when you say proper, how proper we talking?"
00:35:05,00:35:08,- This was an aunt's class reading
00:35:08,00:35:10,"from the St. Louis World Fair in,"
00:35:10,00:35:11,"I think that was 1904, wasn't it?"
00:35:11,00:35:14,"And it was talking about these twins, Jack and Catherine,"
00:35:14,00:35:17,"who had been in the incubators, their lives had been saved."
00:35:17,00:35:19,"And they all get dressed up in special,"
00:35:19,00:35:23,"specially bought new gowns, slash clothes and dresses."
00:35:23,00:35:24,The cradles are decorated in flags
00:35:24,00:35:27,and bunting and everything and big crowds are invited.
00:35:27,00:35:29,And then they are given little paper diplomas.
00:35:29,00:35:32,"- Okay, all right, that passes my benchmark."
00:35:32,00:35:36,"- That's probably, I mean, to be honest,"
00:35:36,00:35:40,that's probably how Dr. Cody got his degree.
00:35:40,00:35:44,"But the, like I say, the original of all this stuff"
00:35:44,00:35:45,"was in Europe, wasn't it?"
00:35:45,00:35:48,"And it was this guy, Alexander Leon or Lyon."
00:35:48,00:35:50,And then it was Cooney who kind of took it on
00:35:50,00:35:52,and then took it to the States.
00:35:52,00:35:55,But he was so popular with his things
00:35:55,00:35:56,that he called child hatcheries
00:35:56,00:35:59,"and that they wrote drinking songs about him,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,about how he was saving our children.
00:36:01,00:36:04,"Yeah, and the reason his incubator was so much better"
00:36:04,00:36:06,than any of the other ones that he had
00:36:06,00:36:08,is 'cause you didn't really need to give it any attention
00:36:08,00:36:10,"at all, you could put the baby in there"
00:36:10,00:36:13,and it would be fine because all you would have to do
00:36:13,00:36:14,is feed it and wash it.
00:36:14,00:36:16,There was like water pipes that went underneath it
00:36:16,00:36:17,that would keep it warm.
00:36:17,00:36:19,And then there was like air pipes
00:36:19,00:36:20,that would pump the air through there
00:36:20,00:36:23,to keep them kind of plenty of air there as well.
00:36:23,00:36:25,"Yeah, 'cause maybe we should say why it is"
00:36:25,00:36:27,that premature babies need to be incubated anyway.
00:36:27,00:36:30,And it's just that they've left the womb earlier than planned.
00:36:30,00:36:32,"And so you're trying to simulate the womb,"
00:36:32,00:36:33,"essentially, aren't you?"
00:36:33,00:36:36,"And it is that very stable environment around you,"
00:36:36,00:36:38,a huge amount of warmth which you wouldn't normally get.
00:36:38,00:36:41,That's why I think sometimes when you have to improvise
00:36:41,00:36:43,"an incubator, if you can't get to the hospital on time"
00:36:43,00:36:46,"or, so I think there was a story of a nurse"
00:36:46,00:36:48,who had to transport premature baby to hospital
00:36:48,00:36:51,and she improvised an incubator by fitting one box
00:36:51,00:36:56,inside of another and then filling the gap with hot water.
00:36:56,00:36:57,And so you just got to warm them up
00:36:57,00:36:58,and keep the environment stable.
00:36:58,00:37:00,"- Was that recently, Anna?"
00:37:00,00:37:01,"- Yeah, quite recently, yeah."
00:37:01,00:37:03,- That's amazing 'cause that's how a lot
00:37:03,00:37:07,of the early ones operated in essence.
00:37:07,00:37:09,When was this Leon guy?
00:37:09,00:37:11,- He was 1889. - 1889.
00:37:11,00:37:12,He got his first patent.
00:37:12,00:37:14,"- So there was a guy, there were a few before even these."
00:37:14,00:37:16,So there were some from the 1830s onwards
00:37:16,00:37:19,and then one of the really successful ones
00:37:19,00:37:22,was a French obstetrician called Stéphane Tarnier
00:37:22,00:37:25,and his inspiration was going to the zoo
00:37:25,00:37:27,because incubators were used for eggs
00:37:27,00:37:29,and he then worked with the zoo's instrument maker
00:37:29,00:37:31,who was a guy called Odile Martin.
00:37:31,00:37:33,That was based on hot water as well
00:37:33,00:37:36,"and you know, double walls filled with sawdust"
00:37:36,00:37:38,to provide the temperature and the stability.
00:37:38,00:37:39,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:37:39,00:37:43,"- But yeah, nothing like as effective, was it really?"
00:37:43,00:37:44,Negligible impact compared to when you have
00:37:44,00:37:46,a natural incubator. - Yes.
00:37:46,00:37:49,- It was a Leon and they did weird stuff though.
00:37:49,00:37:52,"When so in the Alexandra Lyon incubator,"
00:37:52,00:37:55,"which as you say, about 50,000 people came"
00:37:55,00:37:58,and looked and paid their duty to look at these babies
00:37:58,00:37:59,in its first year.
00:37:59,00:38:00,"When people came and looked,"
00:38:00,00:38:02,there was a reporter journalist wrote about it.
00:38:02,00:38:04,"First of all, it's so funny how journalists write"
00:38:04,00:38:06,in a different way a hundred years ago.
00:38:06,00:38:09,"So this was 1896 and he said, it was very annoying"
00:38:09,00:38:12,because Lyons explaining the science of his incubator
00:38:12,00:38:15,and suddenly were interrupted by this wailing child
00:38:15,00:38:18,and it was described as an insignificant lump
00:38:18,00:38:20,that was disturbing the neighborhood.
00:38:20,00:38:24,"And he said it was, it was hustled into a glass window"
00:38:24,00:38:26,department called a baby's dining room
00:38:26,00:38:28,by one of the nurses.
00:38:28,00:38:30,And then a nurse put powder on its face
00:38:30,00:38:33,"with a powder puff, which I found so confusing."
00:38:33,00:38:34,"And he said, she put powder on his face"
00:38:34,00:38:36,to bring him to a state of immaculate perfection
00:38:36,00:38:39,even though the baby was screaming and crying
00:38:39,00:38:41,and then gave it some milk.
00:38:41,00:38:44,"And I think this was just once a day, they made them up."
00:38:44,00:38:47,- Just to stop being so read from all the screaming
00:38:47,00:38:48,"and stuff, it's just-"
00:38:48,00:38:50,"- Yeah, 'cause especially premature babies,"
00:38:50,00:38:51,they're very red-faced aren't they?
00:38:51,00:38:52,"- Yeah, cosmetically."
00:38:52,00:38:55,"Well, you wanna see that they're looking"
00:38:55,00:38:56,like they're having a good time
00:38:56,00:38:58,"even though they're premature, right?"
00:38:58,00:39:00,"If it turned into a horror show, you would have it shut down."
00:39:00,00:39:02,Like what's going on with these babies?
00:39:02,00:39:04,"Yeah, you just wanna make sure they're fine."
00:39:04,00:39:05,Do you know what?
00:39:05,00:39:06,"Cooney, when he accepted children,"
00:39:06,00:39:08,"and again, this is a guy who,"
00:39:08,00:39:10,"as far as we know, was not an actual doctor,"
00:39:10,00:39:13,he would bathe them in lukewarm water.
00:39:13,00:39:17,"And then if they were capable, the article I read said,"
00:39:17,00:39:19,they were given a small dose of brandy
00:39:19,00:39:21,and then they went in.
00:39:21,00:39:24,"But that's, I mean, for a premature baby, I don't know,"
00:39:24,00:39:26,like maybe when they're teething-
00:39:26,00:39:29,"- If you haven't even supposed to be born yet,"
00:39:29,00:39:31,that is early to be starting on the album.
00:39:31,00:39:33,- I normally don't have anything before six p.m.
00:39:33,00:39:36,But I think not having anything before you're born
00:39:36,00:39:38,"is quite a good rule, isn't it?"
00:39:38,00:39:40,- You've got a bill of intolerance.
00:39:40,00:39:43,"- Yeah, I mean, that is just the absolute definition"
00:39:43,00:39:45,of it was a different time
00:39:45,00:39:47,and that babies just were given alcohol.
00:39:47,00:39:49,That was just the way it was.
00:39:49,00:39:50,- In terms of what we're saying about it
00:39:50,00:39:52,"being a different time, la-la-la, which it definitely was."
00:39:52,00:39:55,"This is, I'm gonna quote directly from the Atlantic Magazine"
00:39:55,00:39:57,now who wrote a brilliant article
00:39:57,00:40:00,about the Cooney Island babies.
00:40:00,00:40:01,"Here we go, I'm just quoting now."
00:40:01,00:40:04,The visitors at Cooney Island approached Cooney's incubators
00:40:04,00:40:07,with a combination of excitement and confusion.
00:40:07,00:40:10,The doctor was frequently asked where he obtained the eggs
00:40:10,00:40:12,gestated in the incubators
00:40:12,00:40:14,and he got the occasional request
00:40:14,00:40:17,to have sexual intercourse with the incubator device
00:40:17,00:40:18,in an attempt to conceive.
00:40:18,00:40:20,Close one.
00:40:20,00:40:21,(laughing)
00:40:21,00:40:22,- What?
00:40:22,00:40:25,"So people thought that like a chicken incubator,"
00:40:25,00:40:29,you put an egg in there and it would turn into a child.
00:40:29,00:40:32,But they also knew that children came from sperm and eggs.
00:40:32,00:40:34,"And so they decided to say,"
00:40:34,00:40:36,"""Well, you can have some of my sperm if you need it."""
00:40:36,00:40:37,Is that what we're saying?
00:40:37,00:40:38,(laughing)
00:40:38,00:40:40,- I'm just quoting.
00:40:40,00:40:44,I'm not getting into it beyond that.
00:40:44,00:40:46,People apparently sometimes wanted to have sex
00:40:46,00:40:47,with the incubators.
00:40:47,00:40:49,I don't know if they were good looking incubators.
00:40:49,00:40:52,"- Well, it's just an act of generosity, isn't it?"
00:40:52,00:40:54,They think they're doing him a favor.
00:40:54,00:40:56,That I will inseminate this incubator for you.
00:40:56,00:40:57,"- People, men."
00:40:57,00:40:59,"We're talking about men, we're talking about gross men."
00:40:59,00:41:01,"- Well, obviously it's not gonna work if women do it."
00:41:01,00:41:03,- That is where the word incubator comes from.
00:41:03,00:41:06,"It's the beta comes from masturbator, doesn't it?"
00:41:06,00:41:07,Because that's...
00:41:07,00:41:08,(laughing)
00:41:08,00:41:09,- Same route.
00:41:09,00:41:11,- Same route.
00:41:11,00:41:14,"- So Coney Island, which is where obviously this,"
00:41:14,00:41:16,"you know, one of these big exhibitions was,"
00:41:16,00:41:18,I just was looking up a few other things
00:41:18,00:41:20,that they had at Coney Island.
00:41:20,00:41:22,One of the things they had there was a recreation
00:41:22,00:41:24,"of the Boer War by a thousand soldiers,"
00:41:24,00:41:27,including veterans from both sides.
00:41:27,00:41:30,And it happened two or three years after
00:41:30,00:41:33,the actual pivotal battle of the Boer War had happened.
00:41:33,00:41:35,They were doing recreations.
00:41:35,00:41:38,"And the soldiers loved it because they were being paid,"
00:41:38,00:41:39,but they weren't being shot at.
00:41:39,00:41:41,There was zero risk of them dying.
00:41:41,00:41:43,And they just were doing a show now.
00:41:43,00:41:44,And they had to pause it once a day
00:41:44,00:41:47,because there was a horse race happening nearby
00:41:47,00:41:50,and the horse race got freaked out by the gunfire.
00:41:50,00:41:52,So they had to just temporarily pause the Boer War
00:41:52,00:41:53,recreation.
00:41:53,00:41:56,- Did the Premon Shaw babies next door
00:41:56,00:41:58,not get freaked out by the gunfire?
00:41:58,00:42:00,(laughing)
00:42:00,00:42:01,"- I'm sure they did, yeah."
00:42:01,00:42:04,Just sounds crazy.
00:42:04,00:42:07,"- Sigmund Freud, big fan of Coney Island."
00:42:07,00:42:10,The only thing about America that interests me
00:42:10,00:42:13,is Coney Island is a quote from Sigmund Freud.
00:42:13,00:42:16,He was obsessed by the idea of the debauchery
00:42:16,00:42:17,that was going on behind the scenes there.
00:42:17,00:42:20,He said it was almost like an epicenter
00:42:20,00:42:22,of hedonism and sexuality.
00:42:22,00:42:22,He thought gamble--
00:42:22,00:42:23,"- I mean, there were people trying to have sex"
00:42:23,00:42:25,"with incubators, so he was a bar off."
00:42:25,00:42:27,(laughing)
00:42:27,00:42:29,"- Yeah, he was bang on, yeah."
00:42:29,00:42:31,- That incubator remind you of your father.
00:42:31,00:42:33,(laughing)
00:42:33,00:42:36,(upbeat music)
00:42:36,00:42:41,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:42:41,00:42:43,and that is Anna.
00:42:43,00:42:46,- My fact this week is that giving someone the finger
00:42:46,00:42:50,"has been an insult for 2,300 years."
00:42:50,00:42:51,(laughing)
00:42:51,00:42:52,- So old.
00:42:52,00:42:54,- And I just love that.
00:42:54,00:42:57,"I love that you go back 2,300 years to Athens"
00:42:57,00:42:59,and stick your middle finger up
00:42:59,00:43:01,and someone will be offended.
00:43:01,00:43:02,"- It's a good tip, isn't it,"
00:43:02,00:43:03,if you're ever going back in time?
00:43:03,00:43:06,"- It really is, yeah."
00:43:06,00:43:07,I think the first reference we have to it
00:43:07,00:43:09,is from 4th century BC in Athens
00:43:09,00:43:12,"and it's from Diogenes, who we've mentioned before,"
00:43:12,00:43:15,who was big old character and philosopher.
00:43:15,00:43:18,"And it was recorded that someone said to him,"
00:43:18,00:43:19,"someone in the crowd said to him,"
00:43:19,00:43:20,"""Hey, where's Demosthenes?"""
00:43:20,00:43:23,I love Demosthenes as in famous orator Demosthenes
00:43:23,00:43:26,and Diogenes thought Demosthenes was shit.
00:43:26,00:43:30,"And so he said, ""Oh, there goes that great demagogue,"
00:43:30,00:43:32,"sarcastically, while gesturing"
00:43:32,00:43:34,"with his middle finger at him."""
00:43:34,00:43:35,And it was given to understand in this report
00:43:35,00:43:37,that was a very rude way to gesture.
00:43:37,00:43:40,So it was sort of like a pointing thing.
00:43:40,00:43:43,"- There's another theory behind it is that he was saying,"
00:43:43,00:43:45,"""Here is Demosthenes."""
00:43:45,00:43:47,And he's saying that he is my middle finger
00:43:47,00:43:49,'cause my middle finger looks like a penis
00:43:49,00:43:52,and Demosthenes is a big old penis.
00:43:52,00:43:54,"- Nice, nice, could have had a double meaning."
00:43:54,00:43:56,- I think it was both.
00:43:56,00:43:59,And it just ran from there.
00:43:59,00:44:01,"So by the time you got to ancient Rome,"
00:44:01,00:44:04,"it was Digitus impudicus or Digitus impudicus,"
00:44:04,00:44:05,they probably would have said.
00:44:05,00:44:09,And as in literally indecent or unchaste finger.
00:44:09,00:44:12,"I mean, you know, such a rude finger."
00:44:12,00:44:16,"- That's another thing you can ask for in a phone box,"
00:44:16,00:44:17,can't you?
00:44:17,00:44:19,(laughing)
00:44:19,00:44:19,- Yeah.
00:44:19,00:44:21,- I'd like an unchaste finger.
00:44:21,00:44:22,(laughing)
00:44:22,00:44:24,- I just love the time travel element
00:44:24,00:44:28,"that it's sort of like, I'm so pissed off in the year 2021"
00:44:28,00:44:29,about this play.
00:44:29,00:44:32,I'm just gonna go back and just give them the finger
00:44:32,00:44:35,"just to say, ""Fuck you and your play, this is bullshit."""
00:44:35,00:44:36,And they'll get it.
00:44:36,00:44:39,There's no translation issues.
00:44:39,00:44:40,"- Yeah, it's perfect."
00:44:40,00:44:43,- It was mentioned in some plays in Aristophanes.
00:44:43,00:44:45,"He wrote in his play, ""Peace."""
00:44:45,00:44:47,He wrote about giving someone the finger.
00:44:47,00:44:50,But he used the word eschimalesan
00:44:50,00:44:52,to mean sticking a finger up.
00:44:52,00:44:54,"That comes from a word,"
00:44:54,00:44:57,which means to shove a finger into a bird's anus.
00:44:57,00:45:00,And that was the word that he used to mean
00:45:00,00:45:02,to show the finger to give the finger.
00:45:02,00:45:03,- Wouldn't have thought you needed
00:45:03,00:45:04,to have a specific word for that.
00:45:04,00:45:04,- Why've you got a word?
00:45:04,00:45:05,- Yeah.
00:45:05,00:45:07,"- Well, why would you think, for instance,"
00:45:07,00:45:10,you might need to put your finger up a bird's anus?
00:45:10,00:45:11,- Cavity search.
00:45:11,00:45:12,"- Nice, bug smugglers."
00:45:12,00:45:14,"- Oh, no, not that, no, not that."
00:45:14,00:45:15,- Customs.
00:45:15,00:45:16,- No.
00:45:16,00:45:18,"- Anything to declare, Mr. Pigeon."
00:45:18,00:45:20,"- You're getting, you wanted a boiled egg for breakfast"
00:45:20,00:45:21,and you're getting really impatient
00:45:21,00:45:22,and it hasn't laid yet.
00:45:22,00:45:23,So you just go in there yourself.
00:45:23,00:45:25,"- That's pretty much it, Anna."
00:45:25,00:45:26,It is it.
00:45:26,00:45:28,Apparently this was a thing that people would do to check
00:45:28,00:45:31,"if a chicken was about to lay an egg,"
00:45:31,00:45:34,you would stick your finger into its cloaca
00:45:34,00:45:35,to see if it was ready.
00:45:35,00:45:37,And there was a word for it in Greek.
00:45:37,00:45:39,And then that word became a word for an insult
00:45:39,00:45:40,of giving someone the finger.
00:45:40,00:45:44,- So you know how we were saying that it's a penis gesture
00:45:44,00:45:46,"that when Diogenes was using the gesture,"
00:45:46,00:45:48,he was saying this is a penis.
00:45:48,00:45:52,"There is a theory, I'm not sure how firm it is"
00:45:52,00:45:57,"that just as we use our fingers to represent a penis,"
00:45:57,00:46:00,squirrel monkeys in South America
00:46:00,00:46:02,use their penises as a finger.
00:46:02,00:46:06,So they have these gestures with their erect penises
00:46:06,00:46:07,to show dominance.
00:46:07,00:46:09,"- This is Desmond Morris's theory, isn't it?"
00:46:09,00:46:09,- Yeah.
00:46:09,00:46:10,- He's done a lot of work on this
00:46:10,00:46:12,who claimed the comparison.
00:46:12,00:46:13,But it makes kind of sense.
00:46:13,00:46:17,"They do it as sort of go away to rivals, I think."
00:46:17,00:46:21,- So they don't point directions with their penises
00:46:21,00:46:23,"or if they're playing cricket,"
00:46:23,00:46:24,they don't say someone's out
00:46:24,00:46:26,by sticking their penis in the air.
00:46:26,00:46:27,- Yeah.
00:46:27,00:46:29,- I don't even think they can play cricket.
00:46:29,00:46:31,This is a sad truth.
00:46:31,00:46:31,"- It's weird, isn't it?"
00:46:31,00:46:34,Did you guys read this?
00:46:34,00:46:36,"And I don't know if I've been had,"
00:46:36,00:46:39,but the idea of a thumbs up in Afghanistan
00:46:39,00:46:41,is virtually the middle finger
00:46:41,00:46:43,that we would present to each other.
00:46:43,00:46:44,And I'd never heard that before.
00:46:44,00:46:47,"And I know different countries have their variations,"
00:46:47,00:46:48,but I don't have to.
00:46:48,00:46:50,"- No, it's in lots of places."
00:46:50,00:46:53,"'Cause it's like a thumb up the bum, basically, isn't it?"
00:46:53,00:46:54,- But it's genuinely offensive.
00:46:54,00:46:57,It's caused controversy in the past.
00:46:57,00:47:01,"I think in the '90s, there was a minister in Bangladesh"
00:47:01,00:47:02,where it's also very offensive.
00:47:02,00:47:04,So it's quite a lot of Middle Eastern countries
00:47:04,00:47:06,and in West Africa.
00:47:06,00:47:08,"But in Bangladesh as well,"
00:47:08,00:47:09,a minister gave a thumbs up
00:47:09,00:47:12,at the end of a parliamentary session.
00:47:12,00:47:14,And I couldn't work out if it was quite a Westernized minister
00:47:14,00:47:16,who'd picked up the thumbs up in a friendly way.
00:47:16,00:47:17,It seemed like it was.
00:47:17,00:47:19,"And he was like, ""Hey, good job guys, well done."""
00:47:19,00:47:21,And there was this huge scandal afterwards
00:47:21,00:47:22,"where I think the prime minister was like,"
00:47:22,00:47:23,"""This guy's gotta apologize."
00:47:23,00:47:26,"That is outrageous, he's done that."""
00:47:26,00:47:26,So yeah.
00:47:26,00:47:31,"- It is interesting when you consider that the top sort of,"
00:47:31,00:47:34,"let's say the president of the United States,"
00:47:34,00:47:35,"prime minister of UK,"
00:47:35,00:47:39,that is the preferred hand signal in a photo.
00:47:39,00:47:43,But they know that that is like effectively sending a message
00:47:43,00:47:46,"to countries we're in trouble with, let's say."
00:47:46,00:47:48,"- There's a thing that's always mentioned,"
00:47:48,00:47:50,which is the Richard Nixon once made a similar mistake
00:47:50,00:47:52,when he stepped off a plane in South America.
00:47:52,00:47:54,This is when he was vice president in the '50s
00:47:54,00:47:57,and he did the sign for like A-O-K
00:47:57,00:47:59,where you put your thumb and your forefinger together
00:47:59,00:48:00,in a circle.
00:48:00,00:48:02,"It's like A-O-K, that's okay."
00:48:02,00:48:04,So he stepped off a plane and he did that.
00:48:04,00:48:06,"And in South America, that is very bad."
00:48:06,00:48:11,It's got scatological implications and is insulting.
00:48:11,00:48:13,"And so the story goes, he was very badly booed"
00:48:13,00:48:15,and it started the tour of very badly.
00:48:15,00:48:17,"A, I can't find any instance."
00:48:17,00:48:19,"I mean, literally every book, every article,"
00:48:19,00:48:21,"every history says that, I can't find a photo."
00:48:21,00:48:24,"And B, this was when America was doing"
00:48:24,00:48:26,some seriously dodgy stuff in South America
00:48:26,00:48:28,and they weren't super popular anyway.
00:48:28,00:48:30,It was famous this tour for him being sort of spat out
00:48:30,00:48:33,and sworn out and having stuff thrown at him.
00:48:33,00:48:36,"So I think the implication that, oh, they were just upset"
00:48:36,00:48:40,'cause he did that circle with the fingers gesture.
00:48:40,00:48:42,It's probably concealing a lot of other stuff
00:48:42,00:48:44,they were upset about as well.
00:48:44,00:48:47,"But yeah, if anyone's got a photo, I'd love to see it"
00:48:47,00:48:49,'cause it's repeated all the time.
00:48:49,00:48:51,- There was a study done in 2019 about middle fingers
00:48:51,00:48:54,which I really like and it was trying to work out
00:48:54,00:48:58,whether the penis connection of diogenes
00:48:58,00:49:01,actually holds water and it was an experiment
00:49:01,00:49:03,testing whether the middle finger primes people
00:49:03,00:49:06,"think about either penises or the word penis, okay?"
00:49:06,00:49:11,"And it was basically, they showed people, participants"
00:49:12,00:49:16,either an A-O-K sign or a middle finger
00:49:16,00:49:17,and then they showed them a word
00:49:17,00:49:18,with a couple of letters missing.
00:49:18,00:49:21,"I showed them P-E-N and then dot, dot."
00:49:21,00:49:24,So the idea is that if they had seen the middle finger
00:49:24,00:49:26,"and then when they were shown P-E-N,"
00:49:26,00:49:28,they completed it more often with penis
00:49:28,00:49:30,"instead of, you know, penny or penne"
00:49:30,00:49:32,"or other words that began P-E-N,"
00:49:32,00:49:35,"then that was an example of priming, okay?"
00:49:35,00:49:40,"And the study showed that people did not, as a result,"
00:49:40,00:49:42,think more about the word penis.
00:49:42,00:49:43,They didn't automatically leap to it
00:49:43,00:49:44,even after seeing a middle finger.
00:49:44,00:49:48,They did if they had been shown the finger bang gesture
00:49:48,00:49:51,which is where you put one finger into a hole
00:49:51,00:49:52,you've made with your other hand.
00:49:52,00:49:54,That did prime people to complete with the word penis.
00:49:54,00:49:56,"So that makes people think of penis,"
00:49:56,00:49:57,the other thing does not.
00:49:57,00:49:58,- That's really interesting.
00:49:58,00:50:00,- Because I would have thought that if you give people
00:50:00,00:50:03,"the letters P-E-N blank blank,"
00:50:03,00:50:06,100% of people would just write penis every single time.
00:50:06,00:50:09,No matter what else is happening in the room.
00:50:09,00:50:10,- Don't know what you're talking about.
00:50:10,00:50:12,"- First thing I thought was penultimate, okay?"
00:50:12,00:50:14,And then penarius.
00:50:14,00:50:17,- These are not five letter words.
00:50:17,00:50:19,"- Oh, so there have to be five letters."
00:50:19,00:50:20,- Yes.
00:50:20,00:50:23,"- I would say that not only would I write the word penis,"
00:50:23,00:50:25,the I would look quite a lot like a penis.
00:50:25,00:50:29,- Yeah.
00:50:29,00:50:31,And then how can you write the word more penis
00:50:31,00:50:32,once you see the middle finger?
00:50:32,00:50:32,That's the thing.
00:50:32,00:50:34,How can you really emphasise?
00:50:34,00:50:35,You've underlined it lots of times.
00:50:35,00:50:37,Like I'm really thinking about this now.
00:50:40,00:50:42,"Another gesture which I hadn't heard of,"
00:50:42,00:50:46,"and this is I think maybe it's Middle Eastern thing,"
00:50:46,00:50:48,is the five fathers gesture.
00:50:48,00:50:49,I don't think we've discussed this before.
00:50:49,00:50:52,Basically you bunch together five fingers on one hand
00:50:52,00:50:56,and then you touch them with one finger of the other hand.
00:50:56,00:50:59,"And what the implication there, it's incredibly obscene."
00:50:59,00:51:02,The implication there is that your mother had so many suitors
00:51:02,00:51:04,that it's hard to know who your father is.
00:51:04,00:51:06,That's what is happening when you do that.
00:51:06,00:51:07,That's Middle Eastern thing.
00:51:07,00:51:08,And that really is not one to do
00:51:08,00:51:10,as you're getting off the plane.
00:51:10,00:51:12,- That's very clever.
00:51:12,00:51:13,"So if you wanted to be really insulting,"
00:51:13,00:51:15,"you take both your shoes off, go barefoot,"
00:51:15,00:51:19,and then get 15 digits up against one index finger.
00:51:19,00:51:21,And then you're saying someone's mum
00:51:21,00:51:23,has really been around the block.
00:51:23,00:51:25,"- It's like a goose's head, isn't it?"
00:51:25,00:51:27,What you were doing a little bit.
00:51:27,00:51:28,"- Oh, if you were doing shot of goose?"
00:51:28,00:51:30,"- Yeah, on one of your hands."
00:51:30,00:51:31,Yes.
00:51:31,00:51:32,- Like a shadow.
00:51:32,00:51:33,- Like a shadow.
00:51:33,00:51:33,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:51:33,00:51:35,"- Eating a bread stick, basically."
00:51:35,00:51:37,- Yes.
00:51:37,00:51:39,"- Goose eating a bread stick, exactly."
00:51:39,00:51:41,But do you know that the word goose
00:51:41,00:51:43,means to prod someone in the bum?
00:51:43,00:51:45,Do you know where that comes from?
00:51:45,00:51:46,"- Oh, interesting, no."
00:51:46,00:51:50,"- Well, there are two possible reasons."
00:51:50,00:51:54,One is that the finger might look a bit like a goose's beak
00:51:54,00:51:56,or the thumb might look a bit like a goose's beak
00:51:56,00:51:58,that you're prodding with.
00:51:58,00:52:00,And the other one is that you might cause
00:52:00,00:52:03,enough nervous excitement that the person you prod
00:52:03,00:52:05,makes a noise a bit like a goose
00:52:05,00:52:08,that flaps around and stuff like that.
00:52:08,00:52:10,And that's your two versions.
00:52:10,00:52:11,"- Okay, good to know."
00:52:11,00:52:13,"Pick your poison, pick your favorite."
00:52:13,00:52:17,"- Do you know the, this is not a rude gesture,"
00:52:17,00:52:20,"but it's a gesture that I didn't ever think about,"
00:52:20,00:52:23,the hang loose gesture for surfing.
00:52:23,00:52:26,"So if you were about to pull this as a listener right now,"
00:52:26,00:52:28,"it is keep your pinky up, keep your thumb up"
00:52:28,00:52:29,and put the other three fingers down.
00:52:29,00:52:31,"The surf's up, the kind of."
00:52:31,00:52:35,And supposedly that is from Hawaii.
00:52:35,00:52:36,And this is the story.
00:52:36,00:52:39,It's from a guy called Hamana Kalali
00:52:39,00:52:42,who was someone who lost three fingers.
00:52:42,00:52:44,He lost those three fingers.
00:52:44,00:52:46,"And so, and he was working at a sugar mill"
00:52:46,00:52:47,and that's where he lost them.
00:52:47,00:52:49,And so he used to do that all the time.
00:52:49,00:52:52,"That was just his natural state of holding his hand,"
00:52:52,00:52:54,but he would shake it around.
00:52:54,00:52:56,And it was called the shaka in Hawaii.
00:52:56,00:52:57,That's what you know it as.
00:52:57,00:52:58,- Hell yeah.
00:52:58,00:53:01,"- Is that, is it true?"
00:53:01,00:53:01,When was he around?
00:53:01,00:53:04,- There's a few theories about where it came from.
00:53:04,00:53:05,He's recent.
00:53:05,00:53:07,"I don't have his dates, but he's, he's not, you know,"
00:53:07,00:53:08,ancient Rome.
00:53:08,00:53:10,"He's, he's."
00:53:10,00:53:11,- I get it.
00:53:11,00:53:13,Some people have more up to date facts than I do.
00:53:13,00:53:17,"- And it made me think that,"
00:53:17,00:53:18,'cause we had that fact a long time ago
00:53:18,00:53:23,about the high five was supposedly originated
00:53:23,00:53:25,or popularized by a man with four fingers.
00:53:25,00:53:28,And I just like that that is by one finger and one thumb.
00:53:28,00:53:31,- It's kind of lucky that he lost those fingers
00:53:31,00:53:33,and not all of the fingers apart from his middle finger.
00:53:33,00:53:35,'Cause then all the surfers would just be flipping
00:53:35,00:53:38,"everyone the bird all the time, wouldn't they?"
00:53:38,00:53:39,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:53:39,00:53:42,"Speaking of flipping the bird, which is obviously,"
00:53:42,00:53:43,"at least in America,"
00:53:43,00:53:44,"that's the term for doing,"
00:53:44,00:53:46,giving someone the middle finger.
00:53:46,00:53:50,I found the most epic flipping of the bird
00:53:50,00:53:52,that could possibly ever have happened.
00:53:52,00:53:54,And that was a bunch of twitchers
00:53:54,00:53:57,were watching starlings flying in the sky
00:53:57,00:54:00,and caught in this beautiful moment in a photo
00:54:00,00:54:04,is a giant group of starlings sort of shaping
00:54:04,00:54:08,the biggest screw you middle finger
00:54:08,00:54:10,that has ever been caught on camera.
00:54:10,00:54:13,"- Wow, a admiration. - It is stunning."
00:54:13,00:54:14,"- Well, just looking back going,"
00:54:14,00:54:16,"stop staring at us, you perverts."
00:54:16,00:54:20,- Maybe they were giving a sign that they wanted someone
00:54:20,00:54:22,to check if they had an egg in them.
00:54:22,00:54:26,"- But it is awesome, check it out online."
00:54:26,00:54:29,It's a group of birds flipping the bird at humans.
00:54:29,00:54:30,It's awesome.
00:54:31,00:54:32,(upbeat music)
00:54:32,00:54:33,"- Okay, that's it."
00:54:33,00:54:34,That is all of our facts.
