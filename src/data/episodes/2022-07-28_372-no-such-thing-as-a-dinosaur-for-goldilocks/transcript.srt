00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,520
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,080
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,720
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,880
 from four mysterious locations in the UK.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,960
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,480
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,720
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,640
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,480
 And in a particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,900
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,880
 - My fact is that from 1925 until 1936,

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,600
 the town of Eastbourne had two phone booths

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,560
 with thatched roofs.

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,920
 - Wow, that sounds very Eastbourne to me.

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,920
 - It does.

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,080
 It feels like phones and thatched roofs belong

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,120
 to quite different eras.

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,240
 So why would they get the thatched roof?

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,560
 I mean, what I would call the post-thatch era.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,200
 - Well, they weren't, see, Eastbourne adapted a bit later

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,480
 than the rest of the world to the post-thatch.

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,480
 To everything, but to the end of thatch.

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,400
 Basically, it was the beginning of the 20th century,

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,660
 very exciting.

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,760
 You know, we've got phones now and we've got phone boxes.

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,400
 And early days, local authorities didn't like

29
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,320
 getting standard designs for what was going on

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,200
 in their parish council, their town council, whatever.

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,480
 And so they had these two kiosks on the seafront

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,600
 and they thought, no, this doesn't look very Eastbourne

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,440
 to us.

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,880
 So they insisted that they got a local thatcher

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,760
 to come on and build them a thatched roof.

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,640
 And it looks so stupid.

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,640
 It obviously looks like a sort of magic toadstool

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,680
 that you'd see a pixie living in.

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,640
 - And is this on the classic red phone box?

40
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,840
 The K6, as it's known, or is this earlier?

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,200
 - These weren't K6 models.

42
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,360
 These were very early models.

43
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,480
 - They were the Kons.

44
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,320
 - Yeah.

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,160
 - Still red, right?

46
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,800
 - I looked at the full K1 to 6 range

47
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,480
 and aside from a couple of exceptions,

48
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,120
 they all look the same to me.

49
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,840
 I can't believe there's so much fuss about the progress.

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
 - Maybe you've got phone box blindness

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,640
 like James has face blindness.

52
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,240
 - Sorry, so it's on the K1 that is red,

53
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,160
 but very different to the K6.

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,000
 - These are the K1s.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,400
 And in fact, they were not universally disliked

56
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,040
 because in 1936, there was a letter

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,480
 to the Eastbourne Chronicles saying,

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
 I can't believe you've taken the thatch roof

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,960
 off the phone boxes.

60
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,920
 What are standards coming to in Eastbourne?

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,040
 - Well, they did say that, but in that letter,

62
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,800
 they said that the original one looked like

63
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,680
 a cross between a Chinese pagoda and a mushroom.

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,280
 So they didn't like the new ones,

65
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,880
 but I'm not sure they liked the old ones that much either.

66
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,440
 - No one likes anything in Eastbourne.

67
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,000
 That's the message.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
 - It's not a bad thing.

69
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,880
 I know you hate mushrooms, so you're very biased,

70
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,720
 but I don't know if I automatically assume

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,000
 a Chinese pagoda cross with a mushroom is a negative thing.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,880
 It sounds kind of beautiful.

73
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,720
 - Yeah, okay.

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,640
 Well, I'm sure that Boris Johnson will be bringing you in

75
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,680
 to do his interior design sometime soon.

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,920
 - Don't you think it's so sad that they stopped at the K6?

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,320
 'Cause if they got to the K9,

78
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,240
 we would have had dog-shaped phone boxes.

79
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,800
 - There was a K7 and a K8, definitely.

80
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,040
 - Oh, God damn it.

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,880
 - They stopped.

82
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,080
 - Maybe it was a trademark issue, right?

83
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,000
 Maybe K9 came out and they just didn't have access.

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,480
 - Yeah, because it's like Dr. Who had a dog called K9,

85
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,600
 didn't he?

86
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,720
 And he had a, like not a telephone box,

87
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,240
 but he had a, what did he have?

88
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,080
 A police box.

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,920
 - There's a police box.

90
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,360
 - There wouldn't have been all sorts of confusion there,

91
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,200
 wouldn't there?

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,040
 - Yeah.

93
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,320
 - But there was a KX model.

94
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,360
 So that was kind of a K10 or a Latin 10.

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
 So it feels like there's something going on here

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,040
 that we're not being told.

97
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,440
 - The KX100 is the one you're talking about maybe,

98
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 which is the glass modern-ish one

99
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,640
 that everyone will kind of remember from the '90s.

100
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,640
 - That is what I'm talking about.

101
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,040
 - Maybe the KX is the rude one

102
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,720
 when we started putting up all those, you know,

103
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,920
 sex worker call numbers inside.

104
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,520
 KXXX, known as the K30.

105
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,560
 - I found out about those in the course of researching this.

106
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,000
 And only in the course of researching this, I'd like to say.

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,600
 But do you know where the world's largest collection is

108
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,240
 of what get called Tarte's Cards in phone boxes?

109
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,400
 - Did they still get called that?

110
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,280
 Wow.

111
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,520
 - They do in academics.

112
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,360
 - So they, righty.

113
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
 Is it in the British Library?

114
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,200
 - So close.

115
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,440
 You're about 100 meters away.

116
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,600
 It's the Welcome Library,

117
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,720
 the amazing Institute of, you know,

118
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,960
 they've got all sorts of collections

119
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,080
 and they have 17 boxes of them.

120
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,920
 - What is that?

121
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,680
 - Collected by one employee called Steven.

122
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,800
 He still collects new ones, doesn't he?

123
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,040
 He goes around London

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,000
 'cause he's updating the collection all the time.

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,840
 - Wow.

126
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,720
 And what a coincidence that he works for the Welcome Library,

127
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,840
 which is also a place that collects things.

128
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
 - Yeah.

129
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,000
 Is it advertised as part of the collection

130
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,440
 or is it like once you've been round

131
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,080
 a relatively dry selection of old manuscripts,

132
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,520
 you might want a fun time at the end?

133
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,000
 - Actually, at the Welcome Collection,

134
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,640
 they do have a lovely little cafe

135
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,280
 that has a selection of various tarts.

136
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,640
 So they do.

137
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,480
 - Thanks.

138
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,320
 - It's good to know.

139
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,160
 - It's really interesting.

140
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,680
 Just on those, it sort of started

141
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,280
 the idea of these tart cards in phone boxes

142
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,120
 started supposedly in Soho area.

143
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,480
 And when they first went up,

144
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,600
 they were done purely with words.

145
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,160
 And in order to go past obscenity laws and so on,

146
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,520
 they had to do coded advertisement.

147
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,800
 So for example,

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,320
 you might see one that said large chest for sale.

149
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
 And you would know that that was some,

150
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,640
 I mean, there was reports that the worker in question

151
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,240
 did have to field lots of calls from furniture buyers

152
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
 as a result of that.

153
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,120
 But it would be all these kind of innuendo.

154
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,960
 - Wow.

155
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,880
 - Early phone boxes were so cool.

156
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,760
 Some of them had carpets inside,

157
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,760
 just one tiny square of carpet on the ground indoors.

158
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,560
 They all had cigarette rests.

159
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,640
 So you could rest your fag while you were smoking,

160
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
 which I love.

161
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,560
 - Nice.

162
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,680
 - Yeah, oak finishes.

163
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,840
 They were quite gorgeous things in the early days.

164
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,160
 You know, now almost all phone boxes have been adapted

165
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,880
 into other things like many libraries

166
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,360
 or what internet cafes or whatever,

167
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,720
 because people aren't using them to phone anymore.

168
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,000
 Even in 1938, I read a letter,

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
 furious letter, into the Belfast Telegraph

170
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,960
 by a man who said, "I had to make a phone call.

171
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,760
 "So I went to a phone box and I was held up for 10 minutes

172
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,800
 "by two ladies inside.

173
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,920
 "And of course the two ladies were not using the phone.

174
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,120
 "There was a mirror in the phone box as a lot of them had

175
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,600
 "and they were penciling their eyebrows

176
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,000
 "and powdering their noses."

177
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,320
 And as he said, "Surely we see enough

178
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,760
 "of these empty-headed, useless, modern girls

179
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,800
 "applying makeup on trams and buses,

180
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,760
 "without having to wait for them outside the home boxes."

181
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,280
 - I'm trying to buy a chest.

182
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,800
 (laughing)

183
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,720
 - He signed off bachelor bill

184
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,560
 and like it remained so, I imagined.

185
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,880
 - Wow.

186
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,720
 - Yeah.

187
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,480
 - Well, they do, they are being repurposed at the moment

188
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,080
 just to jump to current times.

189
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,120
 There's basically a graveyard, isn't there,

190
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,000
 of where they've been collected by restorers

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
 who field calls from around the world of people

192
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,040
 wanting to own a precious historical K6 phone box.

193
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,720
 And they get all sorts of real--

194
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,920
 - Is that what you would say at graveyarders?

195
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,760
 - Well, you take things--

196
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,000
 - It's your graveyards where you send your dad

197
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,400
 and they get refurbished and sent back to you, right?

198
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,920
 (laughing)

199
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,360
 - You're right, what is it?

200
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,600
 Yeah, it's like a hospital.

201
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,200
 (laughing)

202
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,520
 - It's a plastic surgery.

203
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,760
 - Yeah, that's what it is. - Yeah, that's it, yeah.

204
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,280
 And they, yeah, so they're restoring them.

205
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,240
 And the people who buy them sort of have a request

206
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,560
 that there was a guy in Saudi Arabia

207
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,840
 who really wanted his turned into a shower.

208
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,960
 So they've sort of had to look into doing that.

209
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,560
 And there's a huge waiting list

210
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,000
 and they can only restore so many per year

211
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
 'cause it's a big job.

212
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,680
 You have to match the color, which is post office red,

213
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,320
 which is quite an easy thing to do 'cause it is available.

214
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,760
 But, so that's not--

215
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,880
 - It sounds like a nightmare, Dad, no, no.

216
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
 (laughing)

217
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,200
 - You've got to put the new glass in,

218
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,800
 which they use just classic glass.

219
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,140
 So you've got to source that.

220
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,400
 (laughing)

221
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,640
 Very accessible wood involved and just your basic steel.

222
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
 So it's a nightmare over there.

223
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,360
 - Yeah, gosh.

224
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,200
 - Dad, is that Merstem you're talking about?

225
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,320
 - Yeah, I mean, how many graveyards are there?

226
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,960
 - I just, I know the village of Merstem and it's lovely.

227
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,800
 That's worth it.

228
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,240
 - I think I've been to the place where the graveyard is.

229
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,520
 - It's in Surrey. - Yeah.

230
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,720
 - Surrey, bit beyond Croydon.

231
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,920
 - I have a feeling that I deliberately drove my wife

232
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,840
 about 50 miles out of our direction

233
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,720
 just to see that graveyard once.

234
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,640
 - It doesn't sound like you, Jaws.

235
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,720
 (laughing)

236
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,400
 Did they let you in, James, to browse the dead?

237
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,240
 - I can't remember.

238
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,400
 - They were too busy frantically trying to find some glass.

239
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,660
 (laughing)

240
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:37,400
 The guy who invented, designed many of the models

241
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,160
 in the phone box, he did the two, the three,

242
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,400
 and the K6 as well.

243
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,320
 Giles Gilbert Scott, he was an unbelievable guy.

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,720
 In fact, we've mentioned him once or twice before

245
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,360
 'cause Dan, you said ages ago that he did

246
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,120
 Battersea Power Station and the phone boxes

247
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,960
 and other stuff.

248
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,440
 - Yeah, and he did Waterloo Bridge

249
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,220
 and he did the Tate Modern Building.

250
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,120
 I mean, his imprint.

251
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,080
 - House of Commons.

252
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
 - House of Commons.

253
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
 - The, yes.

254
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,040
 - After it, definitely.

255
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,360
 - No, he did the phone box

256
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,120
 outside the front of the house of commas.

257
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,400
 - No, no, I'm not letting that go.

258
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
 It was bombed in the war.

259
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,320
 And he, I mean, he basically, he did the redesign

260
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,960
 of the recreation of the chamber after the war,

261
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,960
 but he did do it the same as Pugin's design.

262
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,400
 But his family, so he was Giles Gilbert Scott, right?

263
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,400
 His father was George Gilbert Scott, also an architect.

264
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,080
 His father was also called George Gilbert Scott

265
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,680
 and was also an architect, right?

266
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,520
 - Wow.

267
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,880
 - His son, Richard, was another architect.

268
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,960
 Richard Gilbert Scott, also an architect, died in 2017.

269
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,600
 There was an Elizabeth Gilbert Scott,

270
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,920
 or Elizabeth Scott, who was the cousin of Giles

271
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,600
 and did the Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford.

272
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,640
 - This whole family. - Wow.

273
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,240
 - Of Scots and Gilbert Scots.

274
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,800
 They've just done so much.

275
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,640
 - Yeah.

276
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
 - George Gilbert Scott Jr.,

277
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,280
 the son of the first George Gilbert Scott,

278
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,320
 died in the Midland Hotel at St. Pancras,

279
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,800
 which his own father had designed.

280
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,640
 - Wow.

281
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,520
 I really thought you were gonna say he died

282
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,440
 in the phone box, which would have been so tragic.

283
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,280
 (laughing)

284
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,600
 - That St. Pancras Hotel, which he designed,

285
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,440
 is where they filmed the wannabe video for the Skies Girls.

286
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,280
 - Is it?

287
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,200
 - Which I think of all these things that they did

288
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,960
 is probably the absolute pinnacle.

289
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,800
 - Wow.

290
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,640
 - So yeah.

291
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,000
 - And the takeaway fact of this whole episode,

292
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
 that is awesome.

293
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,160
 - If you go there, and I don't think

294
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,440
 we should encourage everyone to go there,

295
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,480
 you can just go and stand on that staircase

296
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,160
 where they kind of come down at the start

297
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,000
 and do their little-

298
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,040
 - Oh, I remember that scene.

299
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,800
 Okay, that's part of the context.

300
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,760
 - I really hope when you check in at Concierge,

301
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,480
 they say, "What do you want?"

302
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,640
 (laughing)

303
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,920
 - I'll tell you what I want.

304
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,080
 (laughing)

305
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,640
 - There was originally gonna be a George Gilbert Scotty spice,

306
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,840
 but they had to reject the idea.

307
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,480
 (laughing)

308
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,480
 - Did he design George Gilbert Scotty the K-4?

309
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,960
 I guess he did, 'cause again, it looked like all the rest.

310
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,200
 - I think he was all Ks.

311
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
 I thought he was all the Ks.

312
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,120
 - I believe not, actually.

313
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,240
 - Oh, wow, really?

314
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
 - Really?

315
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,760
 - Then he was plagiarized in the K-4, which was the best.

316
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,440
 So it's my favorite of the Ks.

317
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,280
 - Okay, wow.

318
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,360
 - And that's because it was also a self-service post office.

319
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,640
 So it had a stump dispenser and a letterbox

320
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,560
 added to the back of it.

321
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,920
 There are only 50 made.

322
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,960
 It was actually a bit of a disaster.

323
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,880
 I think it was quite expensive.

324
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,040
 But yeah, it had a post machine

325
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,080
 where you could put your money in,

326
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,000
 you get some stamps out, you post your letter,

327
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,160
 and there are five remaining.

328
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,480
 So if you live in the village with any of those five,

329
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,680
 then go and visit and pay it a respect.

330
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,680
 - Yeah, if you want to make a online call or send a letter,

331
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,840
 which we all do every single day these days.

332
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,240
 - I'm out of phone box stuff.

333
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,680
 A couple of things on thatch.

334
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,000
 - Yeah, sure.

335
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 - So thatch is no longer a major thing in the UK,

336
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,240
 but there are still some outputs.

337
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,640
 So I think about 60,000, 50 or 60,000 homes

338
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,400
 in the UK are thatched, which is quite a lot to me.

339
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,280
 Loads of Norfolk, loads in Suffolk.

340
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,960
 There's one thatched Brewery, which is in Bridport in Dorset.

341
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,920
 And Dorset actually, it's got two model thatched villages

342
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,920
 and in the village of Sheterton, a thatched wall.

343
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,880
 - Really?

344
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,720
 - What?

345
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,760
 - Okay, which, am I allowed to pick you up on the town today?

346
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,000
 - The village of, yeah.

347
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,440
 - So that's a real place?

348
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,960
 - Sheterton is a real place,

349
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,280
 and it's not the point of the fact.

350
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,720
 - No, I'm sorry, yeah.

351
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,840
 - No, you must have been so frustrated

352
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,560
 when you found that fact and you thought,

353
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,480
 what I want them to talk about is the thatched wall,

354
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,480
 but you know what they're going to focus on?

355
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,640
 It's bloody Sheterton.

356
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,040
 Why do they need to thatch the wall?

357
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,680
 Is it to protect it from, you know?

358
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,600
 - I think there might be a summer house somewhere,

359
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,840
 halfway along it, but it is basically a wall

360
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,240
 that's just covered in a thatched roof all the way along.

361
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,080
 That's pretty sweet.

362
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,920
 - That's pretty good.

363
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,440
 Good reason to go to Sheterton.

364
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,360
 Do you know what in thatching,

365
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,120
 do you know what a butt is?

366
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,960
 - I don't know.

367
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,160
 - It's if you have a bundle of reeds or straw,

368
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,120
 it's the thicker end of that.

369
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
 It's called the butt.

370
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,520
 Do you know what a cheek is?

371
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,160
 - Is it the opposite of the butt?

372
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,520
 - No, it's the thinner end.

373
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,760
 - It's just a word for the side of a window,

374
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,360
 but that means if you put your thick ends of your straw

375
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,720
 up against your window, you have a butt cheek.

376
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,640
 (laughing)

377
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,160
 - Ah, lovely butt cheeks in Sheterton.

378
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,480
 - He's not official.

379
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
 (laughing)

380
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,320
 - I'd be so confused if I went into the pay phones

381
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,880
 and saw the tarot cards there.

382
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,080
 Would you like your butt cheeks plumped?

383
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,840
 (laughing)

384
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,320
 - I don't know, plumping butt cheeks

385
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,680
 is actually a service offered by most cool girls.

386
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,520
 Could be wrong.

387
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,800
 There's this amazing website called thatchinginfo.com,

388
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,360
 which I don't know how this man who is a thatcher

389
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,600
 has also had time to put together this vast resource,

390
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,160
 but it's everything you ever needed to know about thatching.

391
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,800
 And he, one of the things he reports on

392
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,200
 is the difference in thatches around the country.

393
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,640
 So the UK is split into five thatching regions

394
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,280
 and they more broadly fall into two categories.

395
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,360
 So you've got the rounded, soft,

396
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,640
 kind of squishy looking thatch,

397
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,000
 which I would say is your classic thatch.

398
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,680
 And then you've got your much more angular thatch

399
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,960
 and you know which thatch you're gonna see

400
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,640
 because it exactly depends on

401
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,960
 if you're North or South of the A5.

402
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,000
 (laughing)

403
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,360
 - Oh, wow.

404
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,320
 - It's so weird and so cool.

405
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,680
 And this is something that he discovered photographing them.

406
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,160
 And that's 'cause the A5 goes along the old road

407
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,120
 that was called Wattling Street.

408
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
 And that was a really ancient road.

409
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,480
 It's been around since ancient Rome.

410
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,520
 And that was where Wattling Street was used

411
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,440
 as the dividing line between Dane Law.

412
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,800
 So when the Danes came over and took over

413
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,880
 sort of the North of England.

414
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,040
 And the dividing line between Dane Law

415
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,120
 and then the Anglo-Saxons on the South.

416
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,760
 So the thatch to the North of the A6

417
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,320
 all looks a bit like Danish or German style thatch,

418
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,560
 angular, and the South all looks like Anglo-Saxon thatch.

419
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,400
 Isn't that cool?

420
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,240
 - That is amazing.

421
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,360
 But what everyone wants to know

422
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,440
 is what kind of thatch is shittaton.

423
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,160
 (laughing)

424
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,520
 - Right, where's shittaton again?

425
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,040
 - That'll be around it, it's in Dorset.

426
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,160
 - Yeah.

427
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,080
 - I read that on thatchinginfo.com,

428
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,720
 which I have to say is, I agree with Anna,

429
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,440
 is an amazing website.

430
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,880
 They said that the thatcher was like one

431
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,280
 of the most important people in the village

432
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,520
 and he was full of infinite gossip.

433
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,400
 Because obviously he's kind of in the eaves

434
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,000
 of the buildings, literally eaves dropping

435
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,480
 'cause that's where he's hiding

436
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,040
 and he could hear everything that was happening.

437
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,640
 They have lots of examples of the people

438
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,600
 who were doing the work

439
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,640
 and a lot of them were women as well.

440
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,400
 They have an example from Ripon from 1399

441
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,560
 of some female helpers who were,

442
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,960
 they weren't doing like the main work

443
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,360
 but they would tend to do like the collecting

444
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,800
 of the straw and stuff like that.

445
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,640
 For instance, Tess, from Tess of the Durba Bills,

446
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,520
 she was in that novel.

447
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,800
 She kind of works alongside the threshing machine,

448
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,360
 which is getting the cereal off the stalk

449
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,720
 so that you can wrap them together

450
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,760
 and turn them into thatch, so yeah.

451
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,000
 - Right.

452
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,840
 - Cool.

453
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,920
 - I thought you were about to ruin the ending

454
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,040
 of Tess of the Dourba Bills as well.

455
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,240
 - I haven't read it, so I can't, I would.

456
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,400
 - Right, she leans too far over into the thatching machine

457
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,880
 and her head comes right off.

458
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,120
 (laughing)

459
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,700
 (upbeat music)

460
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,960
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

461
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,120
 and that is James.

462
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,520
 - Okay, my fact this week is that dinosaurs migrated.

463
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,800
 That's it.

464
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,320
 - We left a pause for where the rest

465
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,360
 of the sentence should be, but it's such brevity,

466
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,280
 we couldn't fill it.

467
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,080
 - It is merely a two-word fact, which I didn't know.

468
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,920
 - How?

469
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,120
 - So where are they going from and to?

470
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,160
 What are they looking for, Sonia Climes?

471
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,000
 - I think more food, definitely,

472
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,760
 which obviously Sonia Climes can often give you that.

473
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,000
 And this was in North America specifically

474
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,840
 and it was a new study by a guy called Josh Malone

475
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,040
 who was at the Jackson School of Geosciences

476
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,300
 at the University of Texas in Austin.

477
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,720
 And it's really cool, what happened was

478
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,840
 he was visiting his dad and he was in one part of America

479
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,080
 and he said, "One of these weird stones on the floor."

480
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,360
 And his dad said, "Oh, they're gastroliths."

481
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,080
 And gastrolith is something that if you're a bird,

482
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,880
 you will swallow bits of stone

483
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,280
 and it helps you to digest things

484
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,760
 'cause it crushes up the food.

485
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,960
 And dinosaurs had these as well.

486
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,680
 And so he went back to school and started studying

487
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,120
 and then decided to do a paper on these stones.

488
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
 And what he found is that the stones that they found

489
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,680
 in Wisconsin actually originated in Wyoming.

490
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,280
 And he looked for all the different ways

491
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,800
 that they could have gotten from Wyoming to Wisconsin

492
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,320
 and he couldn't find a single other way.

493
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,600
 There were no rivers that went there.

494
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,200
 There was no other way they could have gone.

495
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
 So they've worked out that they must have come

496
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,640
 in the stomachs of dinosaurs.

497
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,880
 And this is the best evidence that we have so far.

498
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,120
 There's quite a bit of other evidence,

499
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,600
 but this is the best evidence that we have

500
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,200
 that dinosaurs moved from one place to another

501
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,280
 on regular occurrences to get more food.

502
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,080
 - And what's one of the things he considered

503
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,880
 the possibility of extremely explosive diarrhea?

504
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,280
 (laughing)

505
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,200
 I mean, how far is it from Wyoming to Wisconsin?

506
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,000
 If you're really propelling it.

507
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,520
 - It's about 600 miles.

508
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,360
 - Okay.

509
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,200
 - It's bad.

510
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,480
 - You know, it's possible.

511
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,320
 I'm just saying.

512
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,040
 A T-Rex looks like it could fire it that far.

513
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,680
 - The earth was closer back then, wasn't it?

514
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,720
 'Cause of Gondwana land.

515
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,480
 So maybe it was six meters and it's just expanded.

516
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,920
 - Yeah, the theory's falling apart, James.

517
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,760
 I'm so sorry.

518
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,240
 - But these were the really big dinosaurs.

519
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,560
 The big long-necked sauropods that you'll know

520
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,080
 from your models as a child.

521
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,320
 And we know that they had to eat all the time.

522
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,360
 And we know that if they'd have stayed where they were,

523
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,400
 they wouldn't be enough food.

524
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
 So they would have to move.

525
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,960
 But this is just the first evidence of it.

526
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,800
 - That's interesting.

527
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,480
 Sauropods are also responsible for what we know

528
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,600
 is the longest obvious journey

529
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,400
 that one single sauropod has made.

530
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,600
 There's a trackway, which is in France,

531
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,840
 which has been found,

532
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,120
 which covers 150 meters of one sauropod walking.

533
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,960
 - Oh, wow.

534
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,720
 - There's 500 feet worth of foot impressions

535
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,160
 from this dinosaur.

536
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,480
 And it's the longest one singular walk

537
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,720
 that's been sort of held in the ground that we have.

538
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,520
 And that's just, there's little two records there

539
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,320
 for migration and for longest obvious walk.

540
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,000
 - Well, we can definitely take from that that they did walk,

541
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,800
 which is more evidence that they migrated.

542
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,880
 - I'm just trying to help you out

543
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,680
 because I know we ruined your theory earlier.

544
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,880
 And I just wanna help build it back up.

545
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,920
 - Just on dinosaurs.

546
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,760
 - Oh, yeah.

547
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,720
 - I really liked the fact that there were dinosaurs

548
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,560
 living at the poles,

549
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,760
 which I had never considered before studying

550
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,600
 for research this fact.

551
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,200
 Yeah, the poles were much friendlier places

552
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,000
 during the time of the dinosaurs.

553
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 They were still cold.

554
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,440
 They had snow and ice in the winter months,

555
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,560
 but it looks like there were dinosaurs.

556
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,200
 And again, this is a recent discovery,

557
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,040
 living there all year round.

558
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,440
 And they even, we think, slowed their growth down

559
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,600
 during the colder seasons

560
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,280
 so that they could cope with being a bit colder,

561
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,440
 having a bit less resources,

562
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,960
 which is what shrews do today.

563
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,040
 I think we've mentioned that before.

564
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,120
 So, yeah.

565
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,880
 - The wear of dinosaurs in what is now the UK

566
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,560
 or the British Isles,

567
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,240
 we know that there are guanodons lived here

568
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,080
 'cause we found their bones.

569
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,440
 But actually, if you think about it,

570
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,640
 they weren't exactly where we are today.

571
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,480
 They were about 50,000 light years away.

572
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,200
 And that is because the solar system moves around

573
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,360
 the center of the galaxy, right?

574
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,000
 And it's always moving.

575
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,880
 Like we move around the sun,

576
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,880
 the entire solar system moves around the universe.

577
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,040
 And so the entire solar system is 50,000 light years away

578
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,400
 from where it was when the dinosaurs were alive.

579
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,680
 So even though they lived on the same bit of land

580
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,400
 where we are, if you think about it,

581
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,880
 space-wise, they were nowhere near us.

582
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,720
 - Wow.

583
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
 - Yeah, I saw there's online.

584
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,600
 It's really worth checking out on Twitter.

585
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,280
 There's a video by Dr. Jesse Christensen.

586
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,520
 And it's an animation that shows

587
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,600
 exactly what you're talking about, James.

588
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,880
 And during, yeah, the guanodon and the gigantosaurus era,

589
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,000
 they're literally on the other side of the galaxy

590
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 to where we are in space-time.

591
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,560
 And if you picture our position right now,

592
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,760
 if it was, say, a compass,

593
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,200
 we're sort of southwest on the compass,

594
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,520
 just close, very close to the south, but southwest.

595
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,560
 And as you go up, sort of on the west angle of the compass

596
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,400
 is when stegosaurus comes in,

597
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,320
 in terms of the spacing of our entire galaxy.

598
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,080
 Then you get to the top.

599
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,840
 And that's when you suddenly get the guanodon

600
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,400
 and the gigantosaurus.

601
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,120
 And then if you were east on the compass,

602
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,960
 that's when things like the T-Rex

603
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,000
 and the Velociraptor are coming in.

604
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,480
 Then finally, in space-time,

605
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,120
 you have the big moment where the extinction moment happened.

606
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,840
 And that is roughly southeast,

607
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,400
 sort of in-between east and south on the compass.

608
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,360
 But the dinosaur period did start

609
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,480
 in the period of the galaxy that we are now in.

610
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,200
 That was the initial bit.

611
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
 - Oh, so we've gone round once?

612
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,240
 - Yeah.

613
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,080
 - Oh, I see.

614
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,280
 So we've done one circumnavigation of the clock face already.

615
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,400
 - Exactly, yeah.

616
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,480
 And the spot we're in is basically in a similar area

617
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,680
 to where dinosaurs became in existence.

618
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,720
 - One galactic year ago,

619
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,280
 there were dinosaurs on Earth, is kind of what I was saying.

620
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,120
 - Exactly.

621
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,160
 - So we might, once we get all the way round,

622
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,000
 we might bump into them again.

623
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,200
 It's possible one of them may have got left behind,

624
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,720
 still hanging there in space.

625
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,840
 A brontosaurus.

626
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,800
 - The aliens we met on our way around the last time

627
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,800
 have been busy sewing us cool new costumes,

628
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,000
 but they think we're still dinosaurs.

629
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,840
 - That's why dinosaur onesies became so popular

630
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,880
 a few years ago.

631
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,840
 - Hang on, you think if we meet aliens,

632
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,920
 they're going to deliver us gifts of outfits

633
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,040
 they think we might like?

634
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,400
 - Yeah, because we already know that the dinosaurs lived

635
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,760
 in the North Pole and the South Pole.

636
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,000
 They must be cold.

637
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,160
 They needed something knitting for them.

638
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,520
 It's like when you get people knitting little jumpers

639
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,960
 for penguins.

640
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,800
 - Got it.

641
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
 This is a very benevolent alien theory.

642
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,120
 - Like a charity case, basically.

643
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,960
 In the course of this,

644
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,640
 I was reading a bit about the asteroid

645
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,760
 which killed the dinosaurs.

646
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,100
 - Oh, yeah.

647
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,680
 - And you know, exactly what it was like physically.

648
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,800
 And there was so much that I hadn't really considered it.

649
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,800
 Firstly, it was about 15 kilometers across, right?

650
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
 And I hadn't really considered it

651
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,500
 'cause you think of it just being a crater now,

652
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,920
 but basically when it hit, just before it vaporized,

653
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,960
 it would have been twice the height of Mount Everest.

654
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,000
 As in if it had just bumped into the earth slightly,

655
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,440
 it would now be two times as high as Mount Everest.

656
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,660
 - Oh, as in if it had just very softly landed on the earth.

657
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,880
 (laughing)

658
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,040
 - Still hasn't that.

659
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,880
 - I see.

660
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,720
 - Exactly.

661
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,540
 Isn't that incredible?

662
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,920
 Twice the height of Mount Everest.

663
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,120
 - Have you seen that simulation that the BBC put on their site

664
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,280
 about how basically when it hit,

665
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,800
 it effectively, the heat was so great

666
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,200
 that it kind of liquefied the rock

667
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,640
 that it rammed into.

668
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,520
 So it kind of created a wave

669
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,680
 and the highest point went as high,

670
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,960
 if not higher than Mount Everest.

671
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,020
 So in the 10 minutes after we were hit,

672
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,580
 we had a mountain on this planet

673
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,100
 that was taller than Mount Everest

674
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,700
 and it collapsed on itself

675
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,660
 into lots of different less high mountains

676
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,780
 and then eventually became part of the landscape.

677
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,380
 But just in that moment, yeah,

678
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,280
 we had a mountain taller than Mount Everest.

679
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,180
 - Was it like a liquid rock mountain though?

680
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,220
 You won't be able to climb it.

681
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,340
 You might be able to surf that, I suppose.

682
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,780
 - Yeah, and you only had,

683
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,420
 you'd have to be really prepared

684
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,580
 with your crampods and so on.

685
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,260
 (laughing)

686
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,960
 You'd have to have inside knowledge that was coming.

687
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
 - Yeah.

688
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,520
 - Do you know that dinosaurs to impress each other

689
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,260
 had whole digging competitions?

690
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,480
 - Wow. - We think.

691
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,640
 - They must have been so impressed

692
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,080
 when that meteorite came down.

693
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,720
 (laughing)

694
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,640
 - The sexiest dinosaur ever.

695
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,160
 - You can imagine a particularly good

696
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,080
 whole digging dinosaur coming back up

697
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,200
 and having missed the whole event.

698
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,240
 Where is everyone?

699
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,040
 - All for nothing.

700
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,240
 - Anna, what do you mean?

701
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,440
 - We think they did this.

702
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,940
 So this is a recent discovery.

703
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,620
 Researchers in Colorado have found these kind of borrows,

704
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,900
 these long trenches, ancient trenches

705
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,660
 from the Cretaceous period.

706
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,780
 And they have a few footprints inside them

707
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,340
 that match at theropods,

708
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,980
 which are things like velociraptors.

709
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,020
 And so these big trenches,

710
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,940
 and there aren't any fossils inside them

711
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,580
 that would imply they use them for things like storage

712
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,660
 or they lived in them

713
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,500
 or they were for protection or anything.

714
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,020
 And they deduce basically that it must have been showing up

715
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,080
 'cause basically dinosaurs are digging these big trenches

716
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,960
 for absolutely no reason whatsoever.

717
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,120
 So they believe now it's a way to attract a mate.

718
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,840
 Let's dig a big hole and still works.

719
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,280
 (laughing)

720
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,000
 - You see that on the phone booth cards, don't you?

721
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,040
 - But phone me for a big hole.

722
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,740
 That's not even trying on the euphemism stakes.

723
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,840
 (laughing)

724
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,840
 Do you know that there were no medium sized dinosaurs?

725
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,480
 I find this amazing.

726
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,620
 - Goldilocks would have had a terrible time, wouldn't you?

727
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,620
 Dinosaur era.

728
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,500
 - Goldilocks and the three dinosaurs.

729
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,420
 (laughing)

730
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,620
 - No, the two dinosaurs

731
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,120
 'cause there was no medium sized ones.

732
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,780
 And this was a study by Catlin Schroeder

733
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,700
 at the University of New Mexico.

734
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,660
 And they've looked at all the different dinosaur species

735
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,580
 looking at different communities.

736
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,620
 And they found that generally speaking,

737
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,820
 they all had a weight of under 100 kilograms

738
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,860
 or over 1,000 kilograms,

739
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,900
 but there was nothing in between.

740
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,880
 I just find that absolutely amazing.

741
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,400
 And the reason, what they think is that the big dinosaurs,

742
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,920
 their children or teenage children

743
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,840
 would have been eating all of the food

744
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,240
 that would have been normally eaten

745
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,040
 by carnivores of that size.

746
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,920
 And so basically their children filled in

747
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,200
 the niche in the ecosystem

748
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,380
 that normally a medium sized animal would take.

749
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,720
 - Oh, really?

750
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,560
 - Isn't that cool?

751
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,760
 - Such a good theory, I really like that, yeah.

752
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,900
 - Yeah.

753
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,200
 - And there was the other thing recently,

754
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,760
 which I also can't believe that,

755
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,500
 you know, the maximum T-Rex population,

756
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,660
 I'm sure you guys all saw that.

757
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,500
 - No.

758
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,840
 - The study that found that the total T-Rex population

759
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,040
 over the years was something like 2.5 billion,

760
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,020
 meaning that if they all came back,

761
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,100
 every three people on earth would be able to share one T-Rex.

762
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,260
 (laughing)

763
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,100
 - Wow.

764
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,960
 - Well, hey, speaking of living with dinosaurs,

765
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,360
 I have a survey question for you guys.

766
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,720
 If Jurassic Park happened,

767
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,980
 as in if we managed to clone dinosaurs

768
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,920
 and create a big park where they hung out,

769
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,260
 would you visit?

770
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,100
 - Yes.

771
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,040
 - Yeah, of course.

772
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,800
 - Well, I've got a thatched wall to see it shitted,

773
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,420
 but after I've been through that, yes.

774
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,300
 - I'm trying to close a deal on a chest,

775
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,840
 but when I've got that sorted.

776
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,680
 (laughing)

777
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,300
 - Okay, I get it, you've all got lives to lead.

778
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,380
 You're all a yes.

779
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,520
 Right, there was this poll that was done,

780
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,720
 and it was in the headlines,

781
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,000
 'cause it was YouGov Research in 2015,

782
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,160
 and the headline was that 25% of Americans

783
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,600
 think that dinosaurs and humans definitely didn't coexist.

784
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,840
 So only a quarter of Americans think

785
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,640
 that they definitely didn't coexist,

786
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,340
 which obviously they didn't, dinosaurs and humans,

787
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,580
 by the way.

788
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,760
 And overall, 14%--

789
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,600
 - Oh, well, we know what side you fall on there.

790
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,120
 (laughing)

791
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,080
 Showing your cards.

792
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
 - It's not my opinion.

793
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,560
 So, 14% thought they definitely did coexist,

794
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,960
 27% thought they probably did coexist.

795
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,600
 So like 41% of Americans think

796
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,120
 that probably humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time.

797
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,360
 Very surprising.

798
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,200
 In the same poll though, downloaded this poll,

799
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,440
 and the next question after that was,

800
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,920
 if Jurassic Park existed, would you go?

801
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,000
 Only 40% of people said yes.

802
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,440
 Half of people said absolutely not.

803
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,600
 - Well, if your species has already coexisted

804
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,400
 with the Boston Point, you know?

805
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,040
 (laughing)

806
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,440
 - So you know this poll, Anna?

807
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,280
 Does it distinguish between the people

808
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,760
 who actually think that cavemen were living with dinosaurs

809
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,440
 and people who go, "Well, actually,

810
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,560
 "I think you'll find that birds are really modern dinosaurs?"

811
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,840
 (laughing)

812
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,680
 - That's a good point.

813
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,440
 It doesn't ask, and maybe all of that 41%

814
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,760
 were terrible pedants like that,

815
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,480
 which might be just worse than people

816
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,560
 who genuinely think we live with dinosaurs.

817
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,140
 (upbeat music)

818
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,200
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

819
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,520
 and that is my fact.

820
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,880
 My fact this week is that in the first half

821
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,920
 of the 20th century, thousands of premature babies

822
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,200
 were treated in amusement parks and fairgrounds

823
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,120
 in Europe and the United States.

824
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,660
 - How were they treated?

825
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,040
 Like in the teacups or in the loop-a-loop or what?

826
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,600
 - By clowns.

827
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,760
 - Yeah, this is an extraordinary story.

828
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,080
 This is the story of a man called Dr. Martin Cooney,

829
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,880
 who was known as the incubator doctor.

830
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,720
 And basically, within the amusement parks,

831
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,600
 he set up what you would now see in hospitals

832
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,920
 as where premature babies would be resting.

833
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,840
 That started not in hospitals,

834
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,920
 but at the fairgrounds of the world

835
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,940
 because doctors didn't believe that incubators could work.

836
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,040
 They didn't think there was a purpose to them really

837
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,920
 at the time, premature babies were seen as weaklings.

838
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,000
 And this was one guy who very weirdly

839
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,760
 was a sort of Petey Barnum-esque kind of character.

840
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,080
 He was a real showman who decided

841
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,200
 he wanted to try and save children's lives.

842
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,280
 And he created what were known as the infantoriums,

843
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,200
 where you would pay 25 cents to walk into a building

844
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,040
 and basically look at children

845
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,520
 that were sitting in incubators and watch them growing.

846
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,700
 The nurses used to dress the babies in overgrown clothes,

847
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,000
 really to sort of show how tiny these little babies were.

848
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,140
 - Oh, wow.

849
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,240
 Yeah, you could watch the children being fed milk

850
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,920
 in various different ways.

851
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,080
 Either they were fed it via bottle

852
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,600
 or they were fed it by the breast

853
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,080
 or they were fed it through the nose.

854
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,640
 - The feeding through the nose thing is weird

855
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,720
 because obviously doesn't work unless you actually

856
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,600
 put a feeding tube through someone's nose

857
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,480
 and into someone's, you know, esophagus,

858
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,160
 then you're just inhaling stuff.

859
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,440
 But yeah, they had a special nose feeding spoon.

860
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,600
 I think I saw this in another earlier one even.

861
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,000
 This was something called the lion incubator

862
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,360
 'cause he didn't actually invent the incubator,

863
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,140
 we should say that came actually a while before him.

864
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,500
 But the lion incubator came

865
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,980
 and displays were put on of the lion incubator

866
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,540
 and there was a nose feeding spoon

867
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,220
 and it's basically like a teaspoon.

868
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,420
 And then at the very end, it had a little pointy fold

869
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,380
 and apparently you put milk in it

870
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,860
 and you held it about in the baby's nose,

871
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,300
 kind of shoving the little pointy fold up the baby's nose

872
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,740
 and the baby would breathe the milk in drop by drop,

873
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,540
 like inhaling the fumes.

874
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,220
 Now, I don't believe that that would work.

875
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,880
 So I'm surprised that these babies made it.

876
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,200
 - Yeah, so lion, these were the original ones

877
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,160
 and it's not only that Cooney didn't invent the incubators,

878
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,240
 he didn't invent the idea of showing them off

879
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,040
 because lion did that as well.

880
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,840
 And he would rent out shop fronts,

881
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,000
 wouldn't he, where you could walk down boulevards

882
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,360
 and you could see these babies in the shop fronts.

883
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,480
 And the reason was that his incubators were so expensive,

884
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,360
 the only way they could get the money for them

885
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,080
 was to charge people a couple of son teams here

886
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,740
 and there to see the babies.

887
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,760
 - Yeah, but what's extraordinary about it?

888
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,300
 I mean, there's a lot to unpack in the story

889
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,380
 about this guy, Cooney, because in theory,

890
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,620
 a lot of ethical practices were breached

891
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,580
 by a guy who wasn't actually a doctor

892
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,140
 as far as we can tell.

893
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,820
 But in his time, he's said to have saved

894
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,820
 over 6,500 babies, he had a success rate of 85%.

895
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,500
 And not only that, it was basically a version of healthcare

896
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,460
 because the parents didn't have to pay

897
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,680
 for the babies to be looked after.

898
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,160
 That was the whole point of him going to fairgrounds.

899
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,180
 And certain babies would be a bit famous.

900
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,600
 They would come and root for a baby

901
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,880
 that was growing particularly well.

902
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,960
 It became the place where parents were able to go,

903
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,200
 I have no other option because hospitals don't do this.

904
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,160
 I can take it to Dr. Cooney and he can save my child.

905
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,000
 And he did.

906
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,800
 - I think we're okay with him faking the doctor thing.

907
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,120
 We rarely are, usually we don't like that.

908
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,680
 He was a quack who happened upon a cure

909
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,320
 that actually worked.

910
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,840
 Premature babies survival rates were 15%

911
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,260
 before the incubator was invented and marketed.

912
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,980
 And they went up to 75% in his time.

913
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,820
 - It's really amazing.

914
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,980
 But the really nice thing is that some of these babies

915
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,020
 will still be alive today.

916
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,900
 We're talking about this as though it's a historical thing.

917
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,020
 But in 2015, NPR in the USA,

918
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,420
 they interviewed a lady who was about 94 years old

919
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,460
 at the time called Lucille Horn.

920
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,020
 And she had been one of the Coney Island babies born in 1920.

921
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,660
 Like you say, Dan, her father had had no other option.

922
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,220
 Hospital wasn't providing the right care.

923
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,000
 So he wrapped her in a towel, took her to Martin Cooney,

924
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,960
 who put her in one of the incubators

925
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,520
 and she was being interviewed age 94 after that.

926
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,680
 She went back later in life and introduced herself to him,

927
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,040
 said, "I used to be one of your babies."

928
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,280
 Which I think is so nice.

929
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,520
 - The most wonderful thing for me about this story,

930
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,880
 particularly is that Lucille Conan Horn,

931
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,320
 she was a twin and her twin died

932
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,120
 and she was prematurely born.

933
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,880
 And they were told this is not gonna happen.

934
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,480
 So he rushed the child to Dr. Cooney

935
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,120
 and had them put him in the incubator.

936
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,700
 And as you say, she died 96 years old.

937
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,620
 And when she died, she was buried

938
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,720
 at the Evergreen Cemetery in Brooklyn

939
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,840
 next to her twin sister who she was told she was gonna be,

940
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,680
 the parents were told she was gonna be buried next to

941
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,940
 immediately after.

942
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,980
 They in fact told the parents to hold off on the funeral

943
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,220
 because they would be bearing two children.

944
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,060
 - Wow.

945
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,580
 - Another thing about the kids who were in these incubators

946
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,100
 is that they were extremely high achieving

947
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,140
 'cause they all graduated incredibly early.

948
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,140
 Because they graduated from the incubators.

949
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,060
 They had a proper graduation ceremony.

950
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,400
 So this was part of the showmanship.

951
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,940
 - Proper, when you say proper, how proper we talking?

952
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,260
 - This was an aunt's class reading

953
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,220
 from the St. Louis World Fair in,

954
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,980
 I think that was 1904, wasn't it?

955
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,580
 And it was talking about these twins, Jack and Catherine,

956
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,300
 who had been in the incubators, their lives had been saved.

957
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,540
 And they all get dressed up in special,

958
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,200
 specially bought new gowns, slash clothes and dresses.

959
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,980
 The cradles are decorated in flags

960
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,260
 and bunting and everything and big crowds are invited.

961
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,700
 And then they are given little paper diplomas.

962
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,840
 - Okay, all right, that passes my benchmark.

963
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,560
 - That's probably, I mean, to be honest,

964
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,220
 that's probably how Dr. Cody got his degree.

965
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,940
 But the, like I say, the original of all this stuff

966
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,940
 was in Europe, wasn't it?

967
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,840
 And it was this guy, Alexander Leon or Lyon.

968
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,780
 And then it was Cooney who kind of took it on

969
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,940
 and then took it to the States.

970
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,040
 But he was so popular with his things

971
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,880
 that he called child hatcheries

972
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,680
 and that they wrote drinking songs about him,

973
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,480
 about how he was saving our children.

974
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,400
 Yeah, and the reason his incubator was so much better

975
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,160
 than any of the other ones that he had

976
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,920
 is 'cause you didn't really need to give it any attention

977
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,440
 at all, you could put the baby in there

978
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,120
 and it would be fine because all you would have to do

979
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,760
 is feed it and wash it.

980
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,960
 There was like water pipes that went underneath it

981
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,880
 that would keep it warm.

982
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,360
 And then there was like air pipes

983
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,680
 that would pump the air through there

984
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,780
 to keep them kind of plenty of air there as well.

985
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,260
 Yeah, 'cause maybe we should say why it is

986
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,580
 that premature babies need to be incubated anyway.

987
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,780
 And it's just that they've left the womb earlier than planned.

988
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,740
 And so you're trying to simulate the womb,

989
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,580
 essentially, aren't you?

990
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,620
 And it is that very stable environment around you,

991
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,980
 a huge amount of warmth which you wouldn't normally get.

992
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,060
 That's why I think sometimes when you have to improvise

993
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,740
 an incubator, if you can't get to the hospital on time

994
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,180
 or, so I think there was a story of a nurse

995
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,540
 who had to transport premature baby to hospital

996
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,760
 and she improvised an incubator by fitting one box

997
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,000
 inside of another and then filling the gap with hot water.

998
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,740
 And so you just got to warm them up

999
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,720
 and keep the environment stable.

1000
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,400
 - Was that recently, Anna?

1001
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,480
 - Yeah, quite recently, yeah.

1002
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,240
 - That's amazing 'cause that's how a lot

1003
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,760
 of the early ones operated in essence.

1004
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,280
 When was this Leon guy?

1005
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,400
 - He was 1889. - 1889.

1006
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,680
 He got his first patent.

1007
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,920
 - So there was a guy, there were a few before even these.

1008
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,880
 So there were some from the 1830s onwards

1009
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,660
 and then one of the really successful ones

1010
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,860
 was a French obstetrician called Stéphane Tarnier

1011
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,540
 and his inspiration was going to the zoo

1012
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,140
 because incubators were used for eggs

1013
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,460
 and he then worked with the zoo's instrument maker

1014
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,980
 who was a guy called Odile Martin.

1015
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,680
 That was based on hot water as well

1016
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,020
 and you know, double walls filled with sawdust

1017
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,580
 to provide the temperature and the stability.

1018
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,660
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1019
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,060
 - But yeah, nothing like as effective, was it really?

1020
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,900
 Negligible impact compared to when you have

1021
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,980
 a natural incubator. - Yes.

1022
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,600
 - It was a Leon and they did weird stuff though.

1023
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,920
 When so in the Alexandra Lyon incubator,

1024
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,480
 which as you say, about 50,000 people came

1025
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,360
 and looked and paid their duty to look at these babies

1026
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,440
 in its first year.

1027
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,680
 When people came and looked,

1028
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,960
 there was a reporter journalist wrote about it.

1029
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,800
 First of all, it's so funny how journalists write

1030
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,920
 in a different way a hundred years ago.

1031
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,880
 So this was 1896 and he said, it was very annoying

1032
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,760
 because Lyons explaining the science of his incubator

1033
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,820
 and suddenly were interrupted by this wailing child

1034
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,540
 and it was described as an insignificant lump

1035
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,660
 that was disturbing the neighborhood.

1036
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,580
 And he said it was, it was hustled into a glass window

1037
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,980
 department called a baby's dining room

1038
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,380
 by one of the nurses.

1039
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,580
 And then a nurse put powder on its face

1040
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,140
 with a powder puff, which I found so confusing.

1041
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,760
 And he said, she put powder on his face

1042
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,980
 to bring him to a state of immaculate perfection

1043
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,340
 even though the baby was screaming and crying

1044
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,140
 and then gave it some milk.

1045
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,920
 And I think this was just once a day, they made them up.

1046
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,160
 - Just to stop being so read from all the screaming

1047
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,000
 and stuff, it's just-

1048
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,280
 - Yeah, 'cause especially premature babies,

1049
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,800
 they're very red-faced aren't they?

1050
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,640
 - Yeah, cosmetically.

1051
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,280
 Well, you wanna see that they're looking

1052
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,720
 like they're having a good time

1053
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,080
 even though they're premature, right?

1054
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,440
 If it turned into a horror show, you would have it shut down.

1055
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,400
 Like what's going on with these babies?

1056
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,200
 Yeah, you just wanna make sure they're fine.

1057
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,040
 Do you know what?

1058
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,560
 Cooney, when he accepted children,

1059
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,600
 and again, this is a guy who,

1060
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,920
 as far as we know, was not an actual doctor,

1061
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,380
 he would bathe them in lukewarm water.

1062
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,140
 And then if they were capable, the article I read said,

1063
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,620
 they were given a small dose of brandy

1064
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,620
 and then they went in.

1065
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,740
 But that's, I mean, for a premature baby, I don't know,

1066
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,740
 like maybe when they're teething-

1067
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,100
 - If you haven't even supposed to be born yet,

1068
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,500
 that is early to be starting on the album.

1069
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,780
 - I normally don't have anything before six p.m.

1070
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,380
 But I think not having anything before you're born

1071
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,700
 is quite a good rule, isn't it?

1072
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,300
 - You've got a bill of intolerance.

1073
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,920
 - Yeah, I mean, that is just the absolute definition

1074
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,120
 of it was a different time

1075
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,680
 and that babies just were given alcohol.

1076
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,440
 That was just the way it was.

1077
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
 - In terms of what we're saying about it

1078
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,920
 being a different time, la-la-la, which it definitely was.

1079
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,600
 This is, I'm gonna quote directly from the Atlantic Magazine

1080
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,200
 now who wrote a brilliant article

1081
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,040
 about the Cooney Island babies.

1082
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,900
 Here we go, I'm just quoting now.

1083
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,800
 The visitors at Cooney Island approached Cooney's incubators

1084
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,440
 with a combination of excitement and confusion.

1085
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,660
 The doctor was frequently asked where he obtained the eggs

1086
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,580
 gestated in the incubators

1087
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,460
 and he got the occasional request

1088
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,260
 to have sexual intercourse with the incubator device

1089
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,780
 in an attempt to conceive.

1090
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,780
 Close one.

1091
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,740
 (laughing)

1092
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,660
 - What?

1093
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,980
 So people thought that like a chicken incubator,

1094
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,460
 you put an egg in there and it would turn into a child.

1095
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,660
 But they also knew that children came from sperm and eggs.

1096
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,020
 And so they decided to say,

1097
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,180
 "Well, you can have some of my sperm if you need it."

1098
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,500
 Is that what we're saying?

1099
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,720
 (laughing)

1100
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,080
 - I'm just quoting.

1101
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,180
 I'm not getting into it beyond that.

1102
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,280
 People apparently sometimes wanted to have sex

1103
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,120
 with the incubators.

1104
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,760
 I don't know if they were good looking incubators.

1105
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,520
 - Well, it's just an act of generosity, isn't it?

1106
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,240
 They think they're doing him a favor.

1107
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,480
 That I will inseminate this incubator for you.

1108
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,320
 - People, men.

1109
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,800
 We're talking about men, we're talking about gross men.

1110
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,800
 - Well, obviously it's not gonna work if women do it.

1111
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,560
 - That is where the word incubator comes from.

1112
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,220
 It's the beta comes from masturbator, doesn't it?

1113
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,280
 Because that's...

1114
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,380
 (laughing)

1115
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,400
 - Same route.

1116
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,740
 - Same route.

1117
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,300
 - So Coney Island, which is where obviously this,

1118
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,500
 you know, one of these big exhibitions was,

1119
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,100
 I just was looking up a few other things

1120
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,180
 that they had at Coney Island.

1121
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,420
 One of the things they had there was a recreation

1122
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,780
 of the Boer War by a thousand soldiers,

1123
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,340
 including veterans from both sides.

1124
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,480
 And it happened two or three years after

1125
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,860
 the actual pivotal battle of the Boer War had happened.

1126
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,980
 They were doing recreations.

1127
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,060
 And the soldiers loved it because they were being paid,

1128
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,140
 but they weren't being shot at.

1129
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,060
 There was zero risk of them dying.

1130
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,500
 And they just were doing a show now.

1131
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,980
 And they had to pause it once a day

1132
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,020
 because there was a horse race happening nearby

1133
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,540
 and the horse race got freaked out by the gunfire.

1134
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,580
 So they had to just temporarily pause the Boer War

1135
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,420
 recreation.

1136
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,060
 - Did the Premon Shaw babies next door

1137
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,220
 not get freaked out by the gunfire?

1138
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,020
 (laughing)

1139
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,520
 - I'm sure they did, yeah.

1140
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,200
 Just sounds crazy.

1141
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,080
 - Sigmund Freud, big fan of Coney Island.

1142
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,680
 The only thing about America that interests me

1143
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,440
 is Coney Island is a quote from Sigmund Freud.

1144
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,240
 He was obsessed by the idea of the debauchery

1145
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,760
 that was going on behind the scenes there.

1146
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,080
 He said it was almost like an epicenter

1147
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,120
 of hedonism and sexuality.

1148
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,960
 He thought gamble--

1149
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,720
 - I mean, there were people trying to have sex

1150
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,800
 with incubators, so he was a bar off.

1151
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,000
 (laughing)

1152
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,240
 - Yeah, he was bang on, yeah.

1153
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,500
 - That incubator remind you of your father.

1154
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
 (laughing)

1155
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,080
 (upbeat music)

1156
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,020
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1157
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,100
 and that is Anna.

1158
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,220
 - My fact this week is that giving someone the finger

1159
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:50,300
 has been an insult for 2,300 years.

1160
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,140
 (laughing)

1161
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,980
 - So old.

1162
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,100
 - And I just love that.

1163
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,700
 I love that you go back 2,300 years to Athens

1164
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,320
 and stick your middle finger up

1165
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,120
 and someone will be offended.

1166
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,160
 - It's a good tip, isn't it,

1167
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,760
 if you're ever going back in time?

1168
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,080
 - It really is, yeah.

1169
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,400
 I think the first reference we have to it

1170
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,560
 is from 4th century BC in Athens

1171
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,440
 and it's from Diogenes, who we've mentioned before,

1172
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,240
 who was big old character and philosopher.

1173
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,400
 And it was recorded that someone said to him,

1174
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
 someone in the crowd said to him,

1175
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,560
 "Hey, where's Demosthenes?"

1176
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,920
 I love Demosthenes as in famous orator Demosthenes

1177
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,700
 and Diogenes thought Demosthenes was shit.

1178
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,640
 And so he said, "Oh, there goes that great demagogue,

1179
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
 sarcastically, while gesturing

1180
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,040
 with his middle finger at him."

1181
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,680
 And it was given to understand in this report

1182
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,980
 that was a very rude way to gesture.

1183
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,280
 So it was sort of like a pointing thing.

1184
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,040
 - There's another theory behind it is that he was saying,

1185
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,400
 "Here is Demosthenes."

1186
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,680
 And he's saying that he is my middle finger

1187
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,720
 'cause my middle finger looks like a penis

1188
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,440
 and Demosthenes is a big old penis.

1189
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,960
 - Nice, nice, could have had a double meaning.

1190
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,940
 - I think it was both.

1191
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,220
 And it just ran from there.

1192
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,100
 So by the time you got to ancient Rome,

1193
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,860
 it was Digitus impudicus or Digitus impudicus,

1194
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,940
 they probably would have said.

1195
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,700
 And as in literally indecent or unchaste finger.

1196
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,020
 I mean, you know, such a rude finger.

1197
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,700
 - That's another thing you can ask for in a phone box,

1198
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,540
 can't you?

1199
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,100
 (laughing)

1200
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,940
 - Yeah.

1201
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,000
 - I'd like an unchaste finger.

1202
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,700
 (laughing)

1203
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,600
 - I just love the time travel element

1204
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,420
 that it's sort of like, I'm so pissed off in the year 2021

1205
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,540
 about this play.

1206
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,260
 I'm just gonna go back and just give them the finger

1207
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,700
 just to say, "Fuck you and your play, this is bullshit."

1208
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,800
 And they'll get it.

1209
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,020
 There's no translation issues.

1210
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,460
 - Yeah, it's perfect.

1211
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,380
 - It was mentioned in some plays in Aristophanes.

1212
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,500
 He wrote in his play, "Peace."

1213
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,700
 He wrote about giving someone the finger.

1214
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,060
 But he used the word eschimalesan

1215
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,900
 to mean sticking a finger up.

1216
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,360
 That comes from a word,

1217
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,240
 which means to shove a finger into a bird's anus.

1218
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,760
 And that was the word that he used to mean

1219
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,440
 to show the finger to give the finger.

1220
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,280
 - Wouldn't have thought you needed

1221
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,120
 to have a specific word for that.

1222
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:04,960
 - Why've you got a word?

1223
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,800
 - Yeah.

1224
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,600
 - Well, why would you think, for instance,

1225
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,000
 you might need to put your finger up a bird's anus?

1226
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,200
 - Cavity search.

1227
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,560
 - Nice, bug smugglers.

1228
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,720
 - Oh, no, not that, no, not that.

1229
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,560
 - Customs.

1230
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,400
 - No.

1231
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,000
 - Anything to declare, Mr. Pigeon.

1232
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,520
 - You're getting, you wanted a boiled egg for breakfast

1233
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,760
 and you're getting really impatient

1234
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,720
 and it hasn't laid yet.

1235
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,900
 So you just go in there yourself.

1236
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,360
 - That's pretty much it, Anna.

1237
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,480
 It is it.

1238
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,880
 Apparently this was a thing that people would do to check

1239
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,120
 if a chicken was about to lay an egg,

1240
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,140
 you would stick your finger into its cloaca

1241
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,460
 to see if it was ready.

1242
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,040
 And there was a word for it in Greek.

1243
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,400
 And then that word became a word for an insult

1244
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,880
 of giving someone the finger.

1245
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,480
 - So you know how we were saying that it's a penis gesture

1246
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,640
 that when Diogenes was using the gesture,

1247
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,240
 he was saying this is a penis.

1248
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,700
 There is a theory, I'm not sure how firm it is

1249
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:57,580
 that just as we use our fingers to represent a penis,

1250
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,080
 squirrel monkeys in South America

1251
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,640
 use their penises as a finger.

1252
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,200
 So they have these gestures with their erect penises

1253
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,440
 to show dominance.

1254
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,040
 - This is Desmond Morris's theory, isn't it?

1255
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,880
 - Yeah.

1256
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,720
 - He's done a lot of work on this

1257
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,240
 who claimed the comparison.

1258
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,600
 But it makes kind of sense.

1259
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,640
 They do it as sort of go away to rivals, I think.

1260
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,720
 - So they don't point directions with their penises

1261
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,380
 or if they're playing cricket,

1262
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,520
 they don't say someone's out

1263
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,460
 by sticking their penis in the air.

1264
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,300
 - Yeah.

1265
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,120
 - I don't even think they can play cricket.

1266
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,100
 This is a sad truth.

1267
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:31,940
 - It's weird, isn't it?

1268
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,060
 Did you guys read this?

1269
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,140
 And I don't know if I've been had,

1270
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,180
 but the idea of a thumbs up in Afghanistan

1271
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,380
 is virtually the middle finger

1272
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,540
 that we would present to each other.

1273
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,700
 And I'd never heard that before.

1274
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,500
 And I know different countries have their variations,

1275
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,340
 but I don't have to.

1276
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,740
 - No, it's in lots of places.

1277
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,120
 'Cause it's like a thumb up the bum, basically, isn't it?

1278
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,880
 - But it's genuinely offensive.

1279
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,320
 It's caused controversy in the past.

1280
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,320
 I think in the '90s, there was a minister in Bangladesh

1281
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,320
 where it's also very offensive.

1282
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,680
 So it's quite a lot of Middle Eastern countries

1283
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,700
 and in West Africa.

1284
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,240
 But in Bangladesh as well,

1285
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,680
 a minister gave a thumbs up

1286
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,040
 at the end of a parliamentary session.

1287
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,360
 And I couldn't work out if it was quite a Westernized minister

1288
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,320
 who'd picked up the thumbs up in a friendly way.

1289
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,200
 It seemed like it was.

1290
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,520
 And he was like, "Hey, good job guys, well done."

1291
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,260
 And there was this huge scandal afterwards

1292
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,460
 where I think the prime minister was like,

1293
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,860
 "This guy's gotta apologize.

1294
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,140
 That is outrageous, he's done that."

1295
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,980
 So yeah.

1296
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:31,260
 - It is interesting when you consider that the top sort of,

1297
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,100
 let's say the president of the United States,

1298
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,960
 prime minister of UK,

1299
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,560
 that is the preferred hand signal in a photo.

1300
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,500
 But they know that that is like effectively sending a message

1301
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,940
 to countries we're in trouble with, let's say.

1302
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,420
 - There's a thing that's always mentioned,

1303
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,680
 which is the Richard Nixon once made a similar mistake

1304
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,760
 when he stepped off a plane in South America.

1305
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,780
 This is when he was vice president in the '50s

1306
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,560
 and he did the sign for like A-O-K

1307
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,200
 where you put your thumb and your forefinger together

1308
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,040
 in a circle.

1309
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,020
 It's like A-O-K, that's okay.

1310
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,000
 So he stepped off a plane and he did that.

1311
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,540
 And in South America, that is very bad.

1312
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:11,440
 It's got scatological implications and is insulting.

1313
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,280
 And so the story goes, he was very badly booed

1314
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,160
 and it started the tour of very badly.

1315
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,120
 A, I can't find any instance.

1316
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,180
 I mean, literally every book, every article,

1317
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,980
 every history says that, I can't find a photo.

1318
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,540
 And B, this was when America was doing

1319
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,580
 some seriously dodgy stuff in South America

1320
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,220
 and they weren't super popular anyway.

1321
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,820
 It was famous this tour for him being sort of spat out

1322
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,060
 and sworn out and having stuff thrown at him.

1323
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,220
 So I think the implication that, oh, they were just upset

1324
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:40,860
 'cause he did that circle with the fingers gesture.

1325
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,620
 It's probably concealing a lot of other stuff

1326
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,380
 they were upset about as well.

1327
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,280
 But yeah, if anyone's got a photo, I'd love to see it

1328
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,800
 'cause it's repeated all the time.

1329
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,960
 - There was a study done in 2019 about middle fingers

1330
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,080
 which I really like and it was trying to work out

1331
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,080
 whether the penis connection of diogenes

1332
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,000
 actually holds water and it was an experiment

1333
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 testing whether the middle finger primes people

1334
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,520
 think about either penises or the word penis, okay?

1335
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,520
 And it was basically, they showed people, participants

1336
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,240
 either an A-O-K sign or a middle finger

1337
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,600
 and then they showed them a word

1338
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,600
 with a couple of letters missing.

1339
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,280
 I showed them P-E-N and then dot, dot.

1340
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,560
 So the idea is that if they had seen the middle finger

1341
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,120
 and then when they were shown P-E-N,

1342
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,480
 they completed it more often with penis

1343
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,540
 instead of, you know, penny or penne

1344
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,960
 or other words that began P-E-N,

1345
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,320
 then that was an example of priming, okay?

1346
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:40,480
 And the study showed that people did not, as a result,

1347
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,040
 think more about the word penis.

1348
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,300
 They didn't automatically leap to it

1349
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,760
 even after seeing a middle finger.

1350
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,720
 They did if they had been shown the finger bang gesture

1351
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,240
 which is where you put one finger into a hole

1352
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,240
 you've made with your other hand.

1353
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,680
 That did prime people to complete with the word penis.

1354
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,360
 So that makes people think of penis,

1355
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,520
 the other thing does not.

1356
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,360
 - That's really interesting.

1357
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,840
 - Because I would have thought that if you give people

1358
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,360
 the letters P-E-N blank blank,

1359
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,880
 100% of people would just write penis every single time.

1360
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,720
 No matter what else is happening in the room.

1361
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,720
 - Don't know what you're talking about.

1362
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,720
 - First thing I thought was penultimate, okay?

1363
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,200
 And then penarius.

1364
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,600
 - These are not five letter words.

1365
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,200
 - Oh, so there have to be five letters.

1366
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,520
 - Yes.

1367
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,280
 - I would say that not only would I write the word penis,

1368
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,520
 the I would look quite a lot like a penis.

1369
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,120
 - Yeah.

1370
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,040
 And then how can you write the word more penis

1371
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,120
 once you see the middle finger?

1372
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,960
 That's the thing.

1373
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,200
 How can you really emphasise?

1374
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,720
 You've underlined it lots of times.

1375
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,720
 Like I'm really thinking about this now.

1376
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,760
 Another gesture which I hadn't heard of,

1377
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,480
 and this is I think maybe it's Middle Eastern thing,

1378
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,480
 is the five fathers gesture.

1379
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,840
 I don't think we've discussed this before.

1380
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,560
 Basically you bunch together five fingers on one hand

1381
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,360
 and then you touch them with one finger of the other hand.

1382
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,360
 And what the implication there, it's incredibly obscene.

1383
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,520
 The implication there is that your mother had so many suitors

1384
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,760
 that it's hard to know who your father is.

1385
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,320
 That's what is happening when you do that.

1386
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,160
 That's Middle Eastern thing.

1387
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,680
 And that really is not one to do

1388
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,520
 as you're getting off the plane.

1389
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,080
 - That's very clever.

1390
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,840
 So if you wanted to be really insulting,

1391
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,880
 you take both your shoes off, go barefoot,

1392
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,600
 and then get 15 digits up against one index finger.

1393
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,800
 And then you're saying someone's mum

1394
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,560
 has really been around the block.

1395
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,680
 - It's like a goose's head, isn't it?

1396
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,720
 What you were doing a little bit.

1397
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,560
 - Oh, if you were doing shot of goose?

1398
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,600
 - Yeah, on one of your hands.

1399
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,440
 Yes.

1400
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,280
 - Like a shadow.

1401
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,120
 - Like a shadow.

1402
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,960
 - Exactly, yeah.

1403
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,880
 - Eating a bread stick, basically.

1404
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,200
 - Yes.

1405
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,480
 - Goose eating a bread stick, exactly.

1406
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,440
 But do you know that the word goose

1407
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,400
 means to prod someone in the bum?

1408
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,160
 Do you know where that comes from?

1409
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,800
 - Oh, interesting, no.

1410
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,640
 - Well, there are two possible reasons.

1411
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,480
 One is that the finger might look a bit like a goose's beak

1412
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,520
 or the thumb might look a bit like a goose's beak

1413
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,360
 that you're prodding with.

1414
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,880
 And the other one is that you might cause

1415
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,920
 enough nervous excitement that the person you prod

1416
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,680
 makes a noise a bit like a goose

1417
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,160
 that flaps around and stuff like that.

1418
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,080
 And that's your two versions.

1419
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,560
 - Okay, good to know.

1420
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,640
 Pick your poison, pick your favorite.

1421
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:17,520
 - Do you know the, this is not a rude gesture,

1422
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,400
 but it's a gesture that I didn't ever think about,

1423
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,000
 the hang loose gesture for surfing.

1424
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,200
 So if you were about to pull this as a listener right now,

1425
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,520
 it is keep your pinky up, keep your thumb up

1426
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,840
 and put the other three fingers down.

1427
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,920
 The surf's up, the kind of.

1428
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,000
 And supposedly that is from Hawaii.

1429
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,480
 And this is the story.

1430
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,640
 It's from a guy called Hamana Kalali

1431
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,400
 who was someone who lost three fingers.

1432
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,120
 He lost those three fingers.

1433
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,240
 And so, and he was working at a sugar mill

1434
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,760
 and that's where he lost them.

1435
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,920
 And so he used to do that all the time.

1436
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,760
 That was just his natural state of holding his hand,

1437
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,320
 but he would shake it around.

1438
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,840
 And it was called the shaka in Hawaii.

1439
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,840
 That's what you know it as.

1440
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,680
 - Hell yeah.

1441
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,120
 - Is that, is it true?

1442
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:01,960
 When was he around?

1443
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,720
 - There's a few theories about where it came from.

1444
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,560
 He's recent.

1445
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,600
 I don't have his dates, but he's, he's not, you know,

1446
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,440
 ancient Rome.

1447
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,280
 He's, he's.

1448
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,120
 - I get it.

1449
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,160
 Some people have more up to date facts than I do.

1450
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,280
 - And it made me think that,

1451
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,760
 'cause we had that fact a long time ago

1452
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,160
 about the high five was supposedly originated

1453
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,200
 or popularized by a man with four fingers.

1454
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,440
 And I just like that that is by one finger and one thumb.

1455
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,080
 - It's kind of lucky that he lost those fingers

1456
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,600
 and not all of the fingers apart from his middle finger.

1457
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,640
 'Cause then all the surfers would just be flipping

1458
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,080
 everyone the bird all the time, wouldn't they?

1459
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,760
 - Yeah, exactly.

1460
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,760
 Speaking of flipping the bird, which is obviously,

1461
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,600
 at least in America,

1462
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,800
 that's the term for doing,

1463
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,960
 giving someone the middle finger.

1464
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,280
 I found the most epic flipping of the bird

1465
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,400
 that could possibly ever have happened.

1466
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
 And that was a bunch of twitchers

1467
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,600
 were watching starlings flying in the sky

1468
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,640
 and caught in this beautiful moment in a photo

1469
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,520
 is a giant group of starlings sort of shaping

1470
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,240
 the biggest screw you middle finger

1471
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,320
 that has ever been caught on camera.

1472
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,040
 - Wow, a admiration. - It is stunning.

1473
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,480
 - Well, just looking back going,

1474
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,520
 stop staring at us, you perverts.

1475
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,880
 - Maybe they were giving a sign that they wanted someone

1476
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,680
 to check if they had an egg in them.

1477
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,280
 - But it is awesome, check it out online.

1478
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,360
 It's a group of birds flipping the bird at humans.

1479
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,200
 It's awesome.

1480
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,280
 (upbeat music)

1481
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,560
 - Okay, that's it.

1482
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,840
 That is all of our facts.

1483
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,400
