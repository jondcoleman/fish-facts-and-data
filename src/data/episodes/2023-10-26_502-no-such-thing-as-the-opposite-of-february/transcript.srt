00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,100
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show wanted to announce our special guest.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:13,160
 This one is really exciting guys. Our special guest this week is none other than David Mitchell.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,380
 That's right. If you haven't heard of David Mitchell, you haven't seen any British comedy recently because he's been in absolutely everything.

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,020
 Of course, peep show, upstart crow, would I lie to you, the unbelievable truth,

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:33,460
 every single panel show going and he's here. He's on fish this week. David is here partly because he has, as you are about to hear in the show, a new book out.

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,380
 And it is a fantastic book. I genuinely finished it this morning and I loved it. It's called Unruly.

7
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,260
 It's a history book. It's a history of England's kings and queens.

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:48,540
 It goes all the way from King Arthur, fictional, to Queen Elizabeth I, not fictional.

9
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,360
 And it is so funny and yet you also are being educated all the way along the way.

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,060
 It's been described as horrible histories for grown-ups and that's exactly what it's like.

11
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,560
 You'll laugh, you'll learn. It's got that classic Mitchell wit all the way through.

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,660
 It's absolutely fantastic. There are lengthy digressions about things like where you can get a nice coffee in Oxford or the James Bond films, all of that.

13
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,260
 It's so good. And it's not even just me saying this. It has already been a number one Sunday Times bestseller.

14
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,060
 So if you have a history fan in your life who you think would like a laugh as well, this is a perfect present.

15
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:26,660
 Also, if you'd like even more David Mitchell in your life after this episode, his new show Outsiders has just started its third series.

16
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,760
 That's on Dave. It's a kind of outdoor challenge survival show hosted by David.

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,260
 And the guests this series include Alan Davis of QI and of course, former fish guest.

18
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,760
 So that's it from me. I'll stop wagging on now. Hope you enjoy this episode.

19
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,360
 We really enjoyed recording it. On with the podcast.

20
00:01:44,060 --> 00:02:00,160
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

21
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,160
 My name is Dan Shriver. I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and David Mitchell.

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,460
 And once again, we have David Mitchell here.

23
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,360
 My name is Dan Shriver. I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and David Mitchell.

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,260
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

25
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,360
 And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is David.

26
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:31,560
 My fact is that King Stephen owed his throne to food poisoning or, you know, the shit.

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,460
 Right. I haven't asked about swearing. How much so? You're allowed to go for it. Yeah, that's fucking great.

28
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,060
 Yes, so to diarrhea, probably caused by food poisoning.

29
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,460
 Okay. Previous King's Diarrhea, not his own.

30
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,260
 His own? His own? Wait, not a previous King's Diarrhea.

31
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,260
 What? And so people saw him shit himself and thought this man must be King? No, no, he didn't go like that.

32
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,460
 I mean, obviously, there was a lot of diarrhea back then. It was, you know, there's a lot now.

33
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:07,860
 It's one of the ways you can empathize for people in the past. They too had liquid shit, but more often died of them.

34
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,260
 You know, King John, shot himself to death. Henry V shot himself to death.

35
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,060
 So you've got a good King and a bad King there, both dying of dysentery.

36
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,560
 But King Stephen didn't have dysentery. It was more of a short term thing.

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,260
 I don't know if it was a bug or something yet. And he certainly didn't know.

38
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,560
 But because he got diarrhea, he got off a ship.

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,160
 And the ship he got off was the White Ship.

40
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,360
 It was a state of the art, lovely craft in Barfleur Harbour.

41
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,760
 And all of the most important young people of the reign, the in-crowd, were on this ship and they were about to sail to England.

42
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,260
 But the not yet King Stephen, Stephen of Blois, was on it.

43
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,360
 And he got diarrhea and he got off it to go into Barfleur and relax on a privy.

44
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,960
 And the ship sailed without him and sank and everyone on board died apart from a butcher.

45
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,260
 Oh, that's interesting.

46
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:11,960
 Then he survived, but that's the last, then he's lost to, he went on, presumably being a butcher, and then died.

47
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,060
 He had a good anecdote.

48
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,160
 I was like, he absolutely had a good anecdote.

49
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,960
 Did he survive because of the butchery? Was that, but as in, does history relate whether he clung to some, some of the meat?

50
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,060
 No, it wasn't the buoyancy of pork chops that saved him.

51
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,360
 Was it him who provided the meal that provided the diarrhea for the future King?

52
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
 I don't think so.

53
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,760
 I'm not clear as to why there was a butcher on board, but ships have, like, they have, you know, they must have livestock.

54
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,560
 Well, you get on a cruise ship, they've got, you know, a swimming pool and a casino.

55
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,360
 So, you know, I don't think this ship had that.

56
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,860
 But, you know, they had some, they might not have had livestock because they're only going across the channel, but they would have had food.

57
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,960
 Yeah, I don't think there's any connection.

58
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,760
 There's no suggestion that it was his meat that he retailed that caused Stephen, King Stevens, not yet King Steve.

59
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,360
 So I can't help calling him King Stephen.

60
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,660
 He's not King Stephen yet.

61
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,860
 It's like Prince Charles calling him King Charles.

62
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,660
 It's impossible to get into your head or it is for me anyway.

63
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,960
 I've managed, I'm, I'm now saying King Prince Charles, which is a way of easing myself into it.

64
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,360
 And eventually I'd be able to drop the prince.

65
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,960
 I was saying it two years previous, just to make sure I was running with it.

66
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:27,160
 This ship though, it does sound, it sounds amazing as in it was obviously stated with the art, but I mean everyone who was anyone was on one ship at one time,

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,060
 which I presume wasn't thought of as being fine.

68
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,060
 I mean, clearly wasn't fine.

69
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,860
 Yeah, because like, is it like the Royal Family aren't really supposed to be on the same airplane or something?

70
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,260
 I heard that.

71
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,860
 Is that right?

72
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,060
 Yeah.

73
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,760
 Oh, wow.

74
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,060
 Yeah.

75
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,460
 But the air, the real air to the throne was on that ship, right?

76
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,760
 That's the key thing.

77
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,560
 Yes, the real air to the throne, doesn't it?

78
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,460
 The King at the time, King Henry I, he wasn't on it.

79
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:57,960
 He was on a less snazzy ship with older, important people, but the younger, cool, important people, including William Atherling, the air to the throne.

80
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,760
 They were all on the white ship and they all died because obviously the butcher wasn't part of that team.

81
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,260
 He was staff.

82
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:13,360
 And so the only survivor was one of the staff, which I'm sure at the time they thought was absolutely the wrong way round.

83
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:27,660
 Well, one of the other staff, I've read that one of the other staff, the ship's captain, also survived the initial shipwreck, came to the surface, heard that the air to the throne, William Atherling had drowned and then just decided to drown himself.

84
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,160
 The only person who could possibly have told us that story is the butcher.

85
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,360
 Yeah, you're right.

86
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,160
 It feels like as the anecdote has gone on, he's kind of added little bits to it.

87
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,460
 Obviously, if you were the captain's fact, that's a very positive anecdote for the butcher to say.

88
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,760
 And the thing is, obviously, the butcher, we don't know what happened to him other than he didn't die in that shipwreck.

89
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,560
 He probably murdered the captain is what I would think of, possibly, and maybe he made a hole in the ship.

90
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:01,660
 But the thing is, he didn't even get a book deal out of it, which just shows you what primitive times these were, because nowadays that would have been on the gravy train for life.

91
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,560
 Yeah, what a ship show, something like that.

92
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,360
 Yes, it's unbelievable.

93
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,560
 So what year are we talking here?

94
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,660
 1120.

95
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,660
 1120, OK.

96
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,060
 So that's ages ago, didn't even know we had proper ships crossing the channel at that point.

97
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,660
 1120, you must have guessed, because 1066, quite famously.

98
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,960
 How do you think they got here to get across the total?

99
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,360
 Not a swimming operation.

100
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,760
 I'm sorry, I had the whole lifeguard swimming pool, because you know, think of my head.

101
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,660
 Oh, I see, no.

102
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,460
 I don't think they hadn't bought tickets.

103
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,460
 It wasn't a scheduled cross.

104
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,060
 I think it was absolutely just, it was commissioned for the...

105
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
 Right, specifically.

106
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,460
 ...just for the posh people to go across, because they were having a very nice time at the point.

107
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,260
 Henry I had just won a small war against the King of France.

108
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,360
 William Athling had been confirmed as the heir to the Dukedom of Normandy.

109
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,060
 At that point, the King of England was also Duke of Normandy, and he was running this cross channel regime.

110
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:03,260
 And so they've shored up their position on the continent in this sort of weird situation where the King of France is King in Normandy, but not in control of it.

111
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:10,660
 And the Duke of Normandy runs Normandy, but has to sort of pay lip service to the feudal seniority of the King of France.

112
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,860
 But that's all been lined up for William Athling, the King of France is back in his box.

113
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,160
 He didn't live in a box.

114
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,260
 There will have been French kings who lived in boxes.

115
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,660
 There was a French king who thought he was made out of glass, but this one I think was sort of comparatively normal.

116
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,360
 So, Henry I is very happy.

117
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,060
 Let's all go back to England, this other country we own, and hang out there for a bit.

118
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,560
 So it was a happy day, very successful period of Henry I's reign.

119
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:44,460
 And then it was a bit like a sort of mega-som in the heirs to the whole ruling class just died in one go.

120
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,560
 Is it true that they were all drunk as well?

121
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,460
 I read that.

122
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,260
 Yes, basically they decided to get the boat across at night time.

123
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,660
 Yeah.

124
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,160
 We're not sure why, but it might have been just so they could get pissed in the meantime.

125
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,560
 Right.

126
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,860
 Apparently everyone on board was absolutely shit-faced, and that could have been one of the reasons that they crashed.

127
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,760
 That's interesting.

128
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,560
 It seems quite likely to be one of the reasons, doesn't it?

129
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,060
 Because they were obviously quite, I mean, those days there were more shipwrecks than there are now.

130
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,060
 You know, it wasn't a dumb deal crossing the channel, but I don't think the weather was bad.

131
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,060
 People were nipping back and forth all the time.

132
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,060
 But yeah, William Atherling essentially declared it a party boat and said we're all going to have a drink.

133
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:30,160
 And you know, not to be a snob, he very much included the staff, the crew, the butcher and crucially the people driving the ship,

134
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,460
 as they didn't call it then.

135
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,260
 So one set of people they didn't include was the priests.

136
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,760
 So usually the priests would bless the ship before it set off.

137
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,960
 And because it was a party boat, they decided to dismiss the priests, and so they didn't get blessed.

138
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,460
 Right.

139
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,660
 And so later on some people said that may have been the reason that they crashed.

140
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,260
 Yeah.

141
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,760
 That's, do you think that's the reason they crashed?

142
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,260
 I'm only reporting what some people said.

143
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,260
 I mean, that sounds tremendously convenient, the prevailing religious ethos of the time.

144
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,760
 Oh yeah.

145
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,960
 Because they blamed everything on religion, because obviously they lived in baffling times where they didn't understand much of what was happening to them.

146
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:14,260
 So they were very keen in the Middle Ages to say it's not that we're, you know, tiny little creatures in a universe of which we have no comprehension.

147
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
 It's that we didn't pray enough.

148
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,360
 So there was something we could have done.

149
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,960
 Yes.

150
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:25,260
 And I think it probably made living in the Middle Ages a little bit more relaxing than it otherwise would have been.

151
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,860
 Anyway, the white ship, yeah, thanks.

152
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:35,660
 And the future king, Stephen, is probably equally uncomfortable, but in a way with fewer long term consequences to his survival.

153
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,660
 Was he seen as someone who is, you know, useful?

154
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,560
 Did they look at him and go, OK, at least we've got someone who might be a good king?

155
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,960
 Or was he a sort of, well, dear with Stephen, just Stephen?

156
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,660
 No, no, because Henry I, who they say after the white ship disaster, he never smiled again.

157
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,860
 And I don't know how they know, but I'm not going to call them liars.

158
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,660
 But he was very, very upset and he was upset in two ways.

159
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,360
 His, obviously his beloved son was dead.

160
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,060
 Lots of other people's beloved sons were dead.

161
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:10,960
 But crucially, his plan for the succession of the English crown is in absolute ruins.

162
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,260
 Because he's had lots of children, Henry I, but only two of them with his wife.

163
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,960
 And the two with his wife are William Atherling, who drowns, and Matilda, who goes...

164
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,260
 Told dreadful lies, no.

165
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:33,860
 She is the former wife of the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, as it wasn't then called.

166
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,860
 But the Emperor would be the expression.

167
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,960
 So she went around calling herself Empress Matilda with some justification.

168
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,960
 And he quickly married someone else to try and get a new son going.

169
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,360
 Because they didn't like the idea of women ruling then.

170
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,760
 Totally fails to beget any children with his new wife, even though he's begat children all over the place.

171
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,560
 And she begets a load after he's dead.

172
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
 So I don't know, whatever.

173
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,860
 His sperm and her eggs, they don't make a good team.

174
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,260
 Probably because he's so desperately trying to beget an heir.

175
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,660
 And it's just the whole begetting vibe is so unromantic, isn't it?

176
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,360
 So anyway, so he doesn't get any more legitimate children before he dies.

177
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,060
 So he's stuck with only Matilda.

178
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,560
 And he says, OK, well, the only way my bloodline can continue, which is the main thing.

179
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:32,960
 So he makes everyone say, look, I know I've only got a daughter and everyone thinks women shouldn't be in charge of things,

180
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,260
 because this is the past and it's sexist.

181
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,660
 I'm quoting him directly.

182
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,060
 But please come on so that my DNA can carry on.

183
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,660
 Please say that she can be the next king, effectively ruler, queen, and everyone goes.

184
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:55,960
 Your Majesty, of course, for you, anything and twice all of the big shots of the rain, all of the men.

185
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,660
 They didn't ask the women, which perhaps a sign that this is a problematic strategy for the age.

186
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,360
 But nevertheless, all of the men go, we absolutely as soon as you're dead, your Majesty,

187
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,160
 she's in charge and will absolutely do everything she says like we did to you.

188
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:16,860
 And they all swear, including Stephen of Blois and Henry goes to his grave thinking, maybe this will be OK.

189
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,860
 But as soon as he dies, everyone's more thinking, well, you kind of a woman in charge.

190
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,760
 That's either because they themselves think a woman couldn't be in charge or because they think, well, I'm quite woke.

191
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,560
 I think it would be fine for a woman to be in charge, but other people won't accept it.

192
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,160
 But yes, so then please, can Matilda be the next queen?

193
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,360
 Yes, of course, Your Majesty. He dies. No, she can't.

194
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,960
 Stephen runs to London, gets himself crowned and he's King Stephen.

195
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,160
 Well, the other thing is that Henry, the first death was also due to food poisoning, we think, right?

196
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,960
 Oh, yeah.

197
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,260
 So it's like a double food poisoning thing because he famously died of a surfeit of lampreys, I think.

198
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,260
 That's what we're always taught in school.

199
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:08,560
 But there's been a few recent studies, one by Matthew D. Turner in 2023, who reckons that he died of listeria,

200
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,960
 possibly from the lampreys or possibly from something else yet with the lampreys.

201
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:19,060
 But also perhaps it would have made him confused just as he was about to die because that's what happens with this illness.

202
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,360
 And there is a story that on his deathbed, he actually told some of these lords,

203
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,960
 "Oh, no, Matilda, I've changed my mind. I don't think Matilda should be queen after all.

204
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,460
 I think Stephen should be king."

205
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,160
 My feeling is that that's not so much the effect of the listeria,

206
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,060
 the effect of those people who were in Stephen's camp lying about what the people said.

207
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
 So that's also a...

208
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,060
 Who can say?

209
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
 Yeah.

210
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,060
 But yeah, so I'd heard that it was, yes, it wasn't like surfeit of lampreys, rather unfair of him.

211
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,260
 Right, if you could have had too fewer lampreys, you'd have been fine with it.

212
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,860
 It's just that the lampreys he had, or as you say, something that went with them, the chips or something,

213
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,560
 that, yes, they'd been badly prepared.

214
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,160
 Apparently, it's quite difficult to prepare lampreys in a way that doesn't kill you.

215
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,960
 On this occasion, they hadn't bothered.

216
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,560
 They're kind of like the blowfish of the day.

217
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,460
 They can really do a number on you.

218
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,760
 You never see them on menus anymore.

219
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,460
 No, that's why it's so risky, yeah.

220
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,360
 I went to a restaurant once that only did blowfish.

221
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,460
 Oh, yeah? Only?

222
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:20,960
 Yeah.

223
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,060
 Oh, thank you. Look at the menu.

224
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,460
 It was in Osaka, I think, or somewhere like that.

225
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,560
 And my wife wanted to try blowfish, and I had a bit of food poisoning, didn't really want it.

226
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,260
 So we went to this place that sold blowfish, and the menu, it was like pictures on the menu.

227
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,860
 And so we looked at them all, and it was like, blowfish, blowfish, blowfish, blowfish.

228
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,660
 And then there was some chicken nuggets.

229
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,260
 And I was like, oh, thank God, I'll have the chicken nuggets, you can have the blowfish.

230
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,060
 And then we went in, they sat us down, we ordered our sake or whatever.

231
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,860
 And I said, in English, hoping that they'd speak it, I said, I'll have the chicken.

232
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,260
 And they said, oh, no, that's blowfish, no, that's...

233
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,060
 Oh, no, that's...

234
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,460
 And it was deep-fried blowfish, go-nuts.

235
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,460
 Wow.

236
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,460
 We left.

237
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,860
 I'm not sure if I was going to eat blowfish, which I'm not.

238
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,060
 I'm not sure I'd want to eat it in the sort of place where they show pictures of the food.

239
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,460
 The ones where they show a photo almost to prove that they can cook at all and not learn.

240
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,460
 A lot of the places, after they go for their Michelin star,

241
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,660
 they decide that the photos need to be excised.

242
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:34,060
 Henry, King Henry, he has, I think, the most baroque afterlife of any English king I've read about.

243
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,460
 I mean, so he dies in...

244
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,660
 He's in France, isn't he, at the Hunting Lodge, where he has the lampries and then dies.

245
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,660
 And he instructed he be taken to Redding just before he died, because he'd found a nabby there.

246
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,860
 He'd always wanted to go to Redding, haven't he?

247
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,060
 Loves the Spiscuits.

248
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,060
 So it was near-ish Legoland, or the site of the future Legoland.

249
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,060
 So he wanted to...

250
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,660
 He'd found it a big abbey in Redding, so he thought, "Right, I'll go there."

251
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,060
 But he was taken to Ruin, his body.

252
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,060
 So after he dies, he was taken to Ruin and embalmed there.

253
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:10,060
 But not all of him, because his heart, his bowels, his brains, his eyes, and his tongue were removed

254
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:15,060
 and buried in Normandy at a different monastery, or abbey, or whatever it was.

255
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,060
 And then he was embalmed and he was rubbed with salt,

256
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,060
 put in a bag made of ox hides for the journey.

257
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,060
 So he'll hopefully get to Redding in a decent state.

258
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,060
 I mean, he's removed his heart, his eyes, whatever.

259
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,060
 I mean, he's not going to look lovely.

260
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
 No, no. Well, he's in a bag, so that's fine.

261
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,060
 He's in a bag made of ox hides.

262
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,060
 Don't open the bag.

263
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,060
 They get to the coast.

264
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:43,060
 They get to the coast and the boat is then delayed by four weeks due to bad weather.

265
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,060
 And everyone's looking at the bag and thinking, "Oh, no."

266
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,060
 And the bag, I think, starts to leak and sort of very pungent.

267
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
 Body juice, I've heard about this.

268
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,060
 Very, very pungent stuff.

269
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,060
 There is, I think, a story.

270
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,060
 I think it says about him that the man who was ordered to remove his brain,

271
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,060
 there was such a bad aroma about the brain, because of how he died,

272
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,060
 that the man ordered to remove the brain also died.

273
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,060
 Of smell.

274
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,060
 Of smell.

275
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
 Of brain smell.

276
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,060
 Died of smell.

277
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,060
 I read that.

278
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,060
 That was forty years later.

279
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,060
 They associate it.

280
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,060
 Under the carrot jacks.

281
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,060
 Yeah, but it was definitely that smell.

282
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,060
 It was never the same again.

283
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,060
 Yeah.

284
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,060
 So, I mean, what an after life.

285
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,060
 What a shame that the Elizabeth line wasn't named after him,

286
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,060
 because that terminates in Reading.

287
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,060
 That would have been a beautiful tribute.

288
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,060
 And it's subterranean as well.

289
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,060
 So maybe it literally comes up against his skull.

290
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,060
 Yeah.

291
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,060
 And that's used to save money, keep it under 50 billion.

292
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:48,060
 And to use some of the heft of former King Henry to slow the trains down.

293
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,060
 Oxide buffers, yeah.

294
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,060
 Yeah.

295
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,060
 What I should say, though, the consequence of Stephen's food poisoning,

296
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,060
 and then him being declared king, and then him being not very good at being king,

297
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:04,060
 and Matilda, Henry's daughter, being extremely pissed off to have been passed over,

298
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
 is that she doesn't take it lying down.

299
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,060
 And she tries with all her might to rest the throne from Stephen.

300
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,060
 There is a huge civil war called the Anarchy,

301
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,060
 in a way that historians now say shouldn't be called the Anarchy,

302
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,060
 because that in some way reduces it.

303
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,060
 What you should just do is spend thousands and thousands of words describing it

304
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,060
 minutely rather than giving it a label.

305
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,060
 But these are obviously historians are not familiar with the concept of language.

306
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
 But anyway, I'm going to call it the Anarchy.

307
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,060
 It does sound quite an anarchic, like an 18-year civil war.

308
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,060
 It was quite anarchic.

309
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,060
 Yes, but also equally, you could take a little bit of it.

310
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,060
 It was quite calm, awful at night time, for example.

311
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,060
 So it's very, very reductive of you to use that word.

312
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,060
 So, you know, for example, I think it's very bad to call an apple an apple,

313
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,060
 but you want it to print out of every individual cell.

314
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,060
 And that's actually a better way of describing it.

315
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,060
 Anyway, this Anarchy happened and was awful.

316
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,060
 And Matilda nearly got to be the queen.

317
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,060
 At one point she was about to be crowned,

318
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,060
 but then the people in London got cross and she had to run away.

319
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,060
 And then at another point she was under siege in Oxford Castle

320
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,060
 and she ran away through the snow.

321
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,060
 It's quite exciting.

322
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,060
 But eventually she gave up and went back to Normandy,

323
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,060
 which by then her husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, had rested from Stephen.

324
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:27,060
 But then her son does inherit the throne because Stephen's regime essentially peters out.

325
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,060
 So they do a deal.

326
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,060
 Matilda's son, Henry, becomes Henry II.

327
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,060
 Plantagenet, named after his father, Geoffrey.

328
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,060
 And then you have quite an ordered succession for quite a long time.

329
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:42,060
 It's all in the first four, you know, the rhyme of all the kings and queens of England.

330
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,060
 It's Willy, Willy, Harry, Stee.

331
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,060
 This is all the Harry Stee bit.

332
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,060
 Just that bit, which is Harry Stee.

333
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,060
 I was just jumping a few Henrys ahead, Henry VIII.

334
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,060
 I was looking up food because I thought her royal meals sounded a bit odd.

335
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,060
 And I discovered that he used to serve this meal called cockentrice or cockentries.

336
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,060
 Have you heard of this?

337
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,060
 No.

338
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:09,060
 So it was a pig sewn to another animal and he pitched it as a mythical beast.

339
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,060
 And he would say this is a mythical beast ring.

340
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,060
 Most like the wings of a bird, is it?

341
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,060
 I think it became in a few different permutations.

342
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,060
 I think it always usually had a pig on the front.

343
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,060
 It's a chicken, but with the testicles of a blowfish.

344
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:27,060
 Yeah, so I just love that.

345
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,060
 Henry VIII would just present, you know, what was effectively the old version of a yeti.

346
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,060
 At the table.

347
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,060
 So he would say, not only have I discovered a mythical beast, I've killed it.

348
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,060
 And we know what it is.

349
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,060
 And it's the last one, sadly.

350
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060
 But there it is.

351
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,060
 You look at it now and then what do you fancy?

352
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,060
 A bit of wings.

353
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,060
 And they're like, oh, it tastes a bit like chicken.

354
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
 It's weird how everything tastes a bit like chicken.

355
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,060
 My bit tastes like pork.

356
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,060
 Well, that's the thing about the cockentrice.

357
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
 It's so full of flavours.

358
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,060
 The bottom's got chocolate in it.

359
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,060
 [LAUGHTER]

360
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:10,060
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

361
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:15,060
 My fact is that sea turtles have been going to the same restaurant for 3,000 years.

362
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,060
 Blowfish served?

363
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
 Yeah, it's only blowfish.

364
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,060
 Yeah, that's nice.

365
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,060
 You find a thing you like.

366
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,060
 Yeah, just eat that forever.

367
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
 Yeah, exactly.

368
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,060
 So this is about green sea turtles.

369
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,060
 A new study from the universities of Groningen, Exeter, York, Copenhagen,

370
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,060
 and the Society for the Protection of Turtles.

371
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,060
 They've all teamed up.

372
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
 So they're quite pro-turtles.

373
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,060
 Very pro-turtles.

374
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,060
 Society for the eradication of turtles.

375
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
 Didn't get a look at it.

376
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,060
 Absolutely not.

377
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
 That's quite-- I'm not sure if that's appropriate balance.

378
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,060
 If this was on the BBC, you'd have to have one person on the show going,

379
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,060
 "I fucking hate turtles."

380
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,060
 So they're a right paint, easy to flip.

381
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,060
 People, you know, Americans use the same words they do for tortoises.

382
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,060
 I mean, it's just confusing.

383
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,060
 Let's just have one.

384
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,060
 We don't need the aquatic version of those shell people.

385
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,060
 I've been trying to book a table at that restaurant for months now.

386
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,060
 Always by the window, party of eight turtles.

387
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,060
 Restaurant is such a way of putting it.

388
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,060
 But basically, it's a huge meadow of seagrass off North Africa.

389
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,060
 And sea turtles go there to eat.

390
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
 They spend the first few years of their life drifting around

391
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,060
 because they don't have the control to swim and live in these meadows.

392
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,060
 And then when they do get the control, they head to the meadows.

393
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
 They swim miles and miles and miles to get there.

394
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,060
 And they've used archaeology and ancient samples to work out

395
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:38,060
 these are the same habitats in use that sea turtles 3,000 years ago have been heading to.

396
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,060
 And it's just amazing.

397
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,060
 And the meadows all have their own chemical signatures,

398
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,060
 which end up in the bodies of the sea turtles.

399
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,060
 Because they're kind of made of these meadows.

400
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:51,060
 So yeah, sometimes turtles will visit the same 50 meters squared.

401
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,060
 Oh, wow.

402
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:57,060
 It's like having a table in a particular meadow that they return to.

403
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,060
 It's pretty amazing.

404
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,060
 Sea turtles, you know, conservationists have always been trying to monitor

405
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,060
 if they're declining, you know, what's going on.

406
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,060
 And 2023, there was an amazing count that happened.

407
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,060
 Volunteers went around.

408
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,060
 They found 74,000 nests bit over that.

409
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,060
 But there's a huge problem that's happening, which is that the sex, the gender,

410
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,060
 is determined by the climate.

411
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,060
 And as it's getting hotter, they tend to be born as female.

412
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,060
 And so we're slowly losing all male sea turtles.

413
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
 There's a genuine worry that we're going to just...

414
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,060
 We've got all these women now and no men to sort of...

415
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,060
 And you need enough diversity in the population to...

416
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,060
 Yeah.

417
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,060
 It is a big problem.

418
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,060
 It's to do with the temperature of the sand, I think.

419
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,060
 So if the eggs are laid in sand that's above 31, then they're all female.

420
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,060
 You know, 31 Celsius.

421
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
 And if it's below 27, they're all male.

422
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:49,060
 And the species relies on the sand being a range of temperatures in between the...

423
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,060
 Yeah.

424
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,060
 And historically it's been, well, it'll be colder years and hotter years,

425
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,060
 so it'll get a reasonable number of both.

426
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,060
 Yeah.

427
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
 That's the problem.

428
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
 Yeah.

429
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
 So no, it is a huge problem.

430
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,060
 So we're hoping for an hour, maybe if you get above like 32, it goes male again.

431
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,060
 So actually now we'd be rooting for further global warming

432
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,060
 in order to push through to the really...

433
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:17,060
 The hot guys, let's call them, that come to start coming through again.

434
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,060
 Well, the other problem is that the seagrass meadows are also hugely under threat.

435
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,060
 So just everyone in every...

436
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
 Like lots of sea turtles.

437
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,060
 Some sea turtles are doing all right.

438
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,060
 There is, I think, seven different species of sea turtle.

439
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,060
 And I think several are endangered.

440
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,060
 But a couple are doing okay, but several are endangered.

441
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,060
 And the meadows, lots of them are off North Africa,

442
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,060
 where there isn't much environmental protection.

443
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,060
 And lots of the countries nearest are undergoing quite chaotic times at the moment.

444
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,060
 And so, yeah, there is a risk that...

445
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,060
 Apparently we lose a football pitch's worth of seagrass every 30 minutes.

446
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
 Jesus.

447
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,060
 Every 30 minutes?

448
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,060
 Yeah.

449
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,060
 I have to say though, whatever's mowing that seagrass, we want to use that on land,

450
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,060
 because that's really quick.

451
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,060
 I think it takes more than half an hour to cut the grass on a football pitch.

452
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,060
 And this is just literally the use of...

453
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,060
 I mean, using global warming as a force for gardening.

454
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,060
 Yeah.

455
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,060
 Hot turtles, better gardening.

456
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,060
 Yeah.

457
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,060
 What is this?

458
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,060
 I kind of like climate change now.

459
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
 I am not.

460
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,060
 I'm in favor of climate change.

461
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,060
 Because the seagrass buries carbon 35 times faster than a tropical rainforest.

462
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,060
 Another fact that I read.

463
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,060
 It's amazing.

464
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,060
 Yeah, because they just...

465
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,060
 Seagrass, they take carbon from the water to build their leaves.

466
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,060
 The leaves eventually die.

467
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,060
 That sediment stays on the ocean floor for hundreds of years.

468
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
 And so that's how they sequester.

469
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,060
 So that's essentially carbon capture.

470
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,060
 It's captured in the silt at the bottom.

471
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
 Yeah, it's really functional carbon capture.

472
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:46,060
 And I think 10% of the carbon in the ocean is buried by seagrasses or sequestered by seagrasses,

473
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,060
 despite them being 0.1% of the ocean floor.

474
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,060
 So it's really impressive stuff.

475
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
 Yeah, we need loads more of it.

476
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
 Can we plant it?

477
00:26:54,060 --> 00:27:00,060
 There are a few plans to plant 18 hectares around the UK by 2026, which is not...

478
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,060
 It doesn't sound like that.

479
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,060
 I don't know how many hectares in a football pitch, but it sounds like a few hours.

480
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,060
 And that's done no good at all.

481
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,060
 It's not... Yes, I think there might be more like pilot schemes,

482
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,060
 but they are trying to get more going.

483
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,060
 And of course, if you protect bits of seafloor, then...

484
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
 Do the turtles, Andy?

485
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,060
 Did they eat seagrass?

486
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,060
 They eat the tips of it.

487
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,060
 I think that stimulates growth.

488
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,060
 Okay, so there's no cause to eradicate the turtles.

489
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,060
 Your anti-turtle society is just not going to be a thing.

490
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,060
 Let's just check.

491
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,060
 We've just got to be open-minded.

492
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,060
 Maybe the turtles are the villains of the piece.

493
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,060
 David, we're blaming ourselves for all our factories,

494
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:38,060
 but maybe those turtles are cleverer than they look.

495
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,060
 David's wearing a T-shirt, which is saying, "Stop sea turtles."

496
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,060
 It's really upsetting.

497
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,060
 Outside of seagrass, they're quite fussy eaters, sea turtles.

498
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,060
 They're given a bigger menu to play with.

499
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,060
 So one of the other problems of the climate at the moment

500
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,060
 is sometimes they're going off course, they're going into colder oceans,

501
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
 and they get hypothermia.

502
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,060
 So there's a lot of turtles that wash up onto shore,

503
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,060
 and either they're dead or they get rescued and taken to turtle hospital,

504
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,060
 where they then get this brilliant menu of different things.

505
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,060
 And so each individual turtle has just a different kind of taste.

506
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,060
 Like number seven doesn't like the squid, for example.

507
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,060
 A few of them don't like tails.

508
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,060
 Don't give them any fishy tails or anything like that.

509
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,060
 Yeah, and also it's creating chaos because turtles are very solitary,

510
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,060
 but they're in tanks together to be fed.

511
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,060
 And so there's turtle bullies that they have to sort of reprimand and tell off and so on,

512
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,060
 because they're eating the tails and so on.

513
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,060
 You can give turtles, if they're not very well, you can give them mayonnaise to eat.

514
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,060
 Did you see this?

515
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,060
 So this is if there's been an oil spill, and the turtles have eaten a lot of oil.

516
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,060
 If you give them mayonnaise, it helps them to shit it out.

517
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:54,060
 And the reason is because obviously mayonnaise, it's oil and whatever it is.

518
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,060
 Eggs?

519
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,060
 Yeah, it's an emulsion.

520
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,060
 We're revealing our ignorance here, aren't we?

521
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,060
 And it's a really base food stuff as well, it's not complicated.

522
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,060
 This is an off menu, we don't need to know anything about food.

523
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,060
 It comes out of a jar, let's be honest.

524
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:12,060
 Yeah, but it has an emulsifier in it, which mixes water and oil.

525
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,060
 So if you've got oil inside you, the emulsifier inside mayonnaise

526
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:21,060
 can help the oil to mix with the water already inside the stomach of the turtle

527
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,060
 and then just makes it easier to excrete.

528
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,060
 That is so interesting.

529
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,060
 That's amazing.

530
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:32,060
 Yeah, so all these oil slicks are basically, they're just a conspiracy by Big Mayo.

531
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:37,060
 That causes massive spikes in the helman's share price.

532
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:43,060
 Whenever BP has a little mistake, they're suddenly coaching.

533
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,060
 I've got a link to the previous fact weirdly.

534
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,060
 Oh yeah, to David's fact, his headline fact.

535
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:54,060
 So seagrasses stop people getting gastroenteritis.

536
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,060
 Oh.

537
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060
 Isn't that good?

538
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:00,060
 So if you have gastroenteritis because you've drunk some water normally,

539
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,060
 which has the pathogens in it, which cause it.

540
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:07,060
 Seagrass mayors have way, way, way fewer of those pathogens in and around and among them.

541
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,060
 So that water is just cleaner.

542
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,060
 You're less likely to get gastroenteritis from there.

543
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,060
 And they've tried to calculate it.

544
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:19,060
 Between 8 and 24 million cases of gastroenteritis prevented every year.

545
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,060
 Wow.

546
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:25,060
 And I think it's because the seagrass kind of uses it almost like a fertilizer and takes it into its body.

547
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,060
 Exactly.

548
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,060
 It takes the gastroenteritis pathogens out of water.

549
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,060
 Yeah.

550
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,060
 But can it grow in non-salty water?

551
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,060
 Almost none of it.

552
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,060
 No.

553
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,060
 No, I think there's a bit of it.

554
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,060
 There's only one fresh water.

555
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,060
 No, there's a problem there in terms of how useful it is.

556
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:47,060
 Well, if you only drink seawater like me, it's actually fine for you.

557
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,060
 It's still sparkling or salty, I think.

558
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,060
 I've just worked out a mnemonic.

559
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,060
 So how many cases did I say prevented every year?

560
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,060
 Little quiz, instant recall quiz.

561
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,060
 How many million cases?

562
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,060
 I think it was a football picture.

563
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,060
 It was between 8 and 24 million cases.

564
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,060
 Okay, all right.

565
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:13,060
 Now, if you need a mnemonic to remember that, those are the ages of Matilda and the Holy Roman Emperor when they were betrothed to each other.

566
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,060
 And if you need a mnemonic the other way around, you're like, how was Matilda?

567
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:21,060
 It was like, oh, what's the lower range of cases of gastroenteritis prevented each year by seagrasses?

568
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,060
 Beautiful.

569
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,060
 You're welcome, guys.

570
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:29,060
 So 8 and 24 when they were betrothed, but 12 and 28 when they were married, so not that.

571
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,060
 No, not that.

572
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:36,060
 That would be to massively overstate the beneficial effect of seagrass on gastroenteritis.

573
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,060
 I have a thing which I want to link back to the previous fact as well.

574
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,060
 So we have a mystery butcher of the previous fact.

575
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:47,060
 I found a mystery turtle that I don't know much more about, that I want to find out about.

576
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:52,060
 And it's the first turtle to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel and survive.

577
00:31:52,060 --> 00:32:01,060
 So I'm now plunging out an image of people glumly looking at a huge pile of dead turtles at the bottom of Niagara Falls.

578
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:06,060
 And go, I don't know, maybe try taping an X under the inside of the barrel.

579
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:13,060
 So this was 1930. There was a guy called George Stathakus, and he had this idea of going over Niagara in a barrel.

580
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,060
 And the barrel goes down.

581
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:20,060
 It doesn't break up, but it gets caught in a sort of a tide that's underneath.

582
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,060
 I don't know what you'd call it, but it's, he can't escape.

583
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,060
 And he's there for 18 hours in this barrel.

584
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,060
 So when they find him, he's suffocated.

585
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,060
 He's dead.

586
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,060
 And Sonny is, oh, sorry.

587
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,060
 Yeah, there's a dead man in the story.

588
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,060
 Do we suspect the turtle in this story?

589
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,060
 Oh, I haven't thought about it.

590
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,060
 Only one of us could survive this.

591
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:43,060
 Well, the turtle might have been feeling quite negatively towards him, to be honest.

592
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:48,060
 This guy, you know, I'm not, I wouldn't blame the turtle for not giving him a mouth to mouth.

593
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,060
 This is the guy that's, what are we doing now, sir?

594
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,060
 A hundred years old as well.

595
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
 Exactly.

596
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,060
 That's a very old turtle.

597
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,060
 It's a really old turtle.

598
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,060
 And the barrel is in a museum now.

599
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,060
 It's held as a kind of piece of Niagara Falls history.

600
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,060
 Right.

601
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,060
 But where did Sonny go?

602
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,060
 I don't know where he went.

603
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,060
 I don't know where he went.

604
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,060
 I don't know where he went.

605
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,060
 I don't know where he went.

606
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,060
 I don't know where he went.

607
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,060
 I don't know where he went.

608
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,060
 I don't know where he went.

609
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,060
 I don't know where he went.

610
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,060
 I don't know where he went.

 I don't know where he went.

00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,060
 I don't know where he went.

615
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
 I don't know where he went.

616
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,060
 I don't know where he went.

617
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
 I don't know where he went.

618
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,060
 I don't know where he went.

619
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,060
 I don't know where he went.

620
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,060
 I don't know where he went.

 I don't know where he went.

00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,060
 I don't know where he went.

 I don't know where he went.

646
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,060
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

647
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:58,060
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1861, there was one street musician for every ten streets in London.

648
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,060
 What a time to be alive.

649
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,060
 What a time.

650
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,060
 Noisy, noisy time.

651
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,060
 Sounds like it was a bit of a bad time for quite a lot of Londoners.

652
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:12,060
 Yeah, so this is according to journalist Henry Mayhew, whose article admittedly was relatively

653
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:16,060
 negative towards the street musicians, but he estimated there are approximately a thousand

654
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,060
 street musicians, 10,500 streets.

655
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,060
 Okay.

656
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,060
 And it was a real problem.

657
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,060
 We've said before, I think that Babbage really hated them.

658
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,060
 He really got frustrated with them, and he was actually him and the guy called Michael Bass,

659
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,060
 who ran the Bass Brewery.

660
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:38,060
 They managed to get it regulated in 1864, but for probably the decade up until 1864, London

661
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:42,060
 was just an unbelievably loud place to live, largely thanks to these.

662
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,060
 Yeah.

663
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,060
 What was their, what genre of music did they favour?

664
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,060
 Oh, it was all sorts.

665
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:53,060
 So Mayhew said there were English violinists, Scottish pipers, German brass bandsmen, Italian

666
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
 grinders.

667
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,060
 So that's be like a...

668
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,060
 Organs.

669
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,060
 All grinding, yeah.

670
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,060
 And one French hurdy-gurdy player.

671
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,060
 One out of all the thousand.

672
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,060
 Yeah.

673
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,060
 Here he comes.

674
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,060
 It was a she and the women.

675
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,060
 Oh, sorry.

676
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,060
 I'm sorry.

677
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
 That's my prejudice though.

678
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:18,060
 She had an instrument that, according to Mayhew, had a battered, heavy look about it and was

679
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,060
 grievously harsh and out of tune.

680
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,060
 And for 43 years, she had her regular rounds.

681
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
 43?

682
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:29,060
 Yeah, so she went to Marleybone on a Monday, Kentish Town on a Tuesday.

683
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
 So you knew how to avoid it.

684
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,060
 Yeah, exactly.

685
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,060
 I saw a hurdy-gurdy player recently.

686
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,060
 I was in Canterbury, and it was a very hurdy-gurdy, it was the very old, old, old bit of Canterbury.

687
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,060
 The cathedral.

688
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,060
 So you think he was a ghost?

689
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,060
 I don't think he was a ghost.

690
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:49,060
 No, he ran through a wall as soon as I started asking him questions, but he wasn't a ghost.

691
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,060
 Can you remind me what...

692
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,060
 There's a handle you wind, and he was doing something with his other hand as well.

693
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,060
 And it looks like a small violin with a handle.

694
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,060
 Oh, okay.

695
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,060
 How interesting.

696
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,060
 This is a really bad instrument.

697
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,060
 Is it a stringed instrument?

698
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,060
 It is stringed.

699
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,060
 Okay, so the fingers are kind of on the frets, like a guitar.

700
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,060
 This is sounding like the car that Homer Simpson designed.

701
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:16,060
 It has some strings, but also a handle, a little keyboard on the bottom, and then you blow in the end.

702
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,060
 I can't remember whether there were strings and frets or whether there were keys to play it.

703
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:24,060
 I think it might have been keys and a handle, but it was a very much a combo thing.

704
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,060
 Yeah, that's great.

705
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,060
 I only know it as like a comedy word, really.

706
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,060
 I know, I was staggered.

707
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,060
 That's why I said, "What's that?" to this guy, and he just went, "Woo-hoo!"

708
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,060
 That's weird.

709
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,060
 That was the hurdy-gurdy making the noise, isn't it?

710
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:42,060
 There was one other person, just while we're on it, described by Mayhew, who was an Italian fiddler

711
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:48,060
 who would go around imitating all the farmyard animals with his fiddle.

712
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:58,060
 He said he'd been doing it for 12 years, and he could imitate the bull, the calf, the dog, the cock, the peacock, the ass, and the hen when she's laid an egg.

713
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,060
 That's amazing.

714
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
 Do all that with his fiddle.

715
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,060
 But what he couldn't do is play a tune.

716
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:08,060
 What he found is that if you just bash at a fiddle, it makes this.

717
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:14,060
 That is exactly the noise a hen makes, and it's just later, you might not be familiar with that, you live in central London.

718
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,060
 But if you head out to the countryside and listen to it, it's exactly like that.

719
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,060
 So isn't that, that's worth a pop or two, isn't it?

720
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:27,060
 How come there was money to support the, why were, people must have been paying for it.

721
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,060
 Yeah, but it was like just pennies here and there, but they were doing it day in, day out.

722
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:40,060
 And these people, they had their regulars, so they would go to Miley Bono, to Kensington, because they knew there was someone there who would give them, you know, a few hapenies here and there.

723
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,060
 And that's all they needed to live, really.

724
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,060
 Nice.

725
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,060
 So these, like, grinders, as they were called.

726
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:54,060
 And the particular thing that people got annoyed by was people with barrel organs, because there was a bit of racism in it, because they were mostly from Italy and quite poor.

727
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,060
 And the other thing that annoyed people was, you just turn a handle.

728
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,060
 There's no skill involved here.

729
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
 There's no skill.

730
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
 You buy a...

731
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,060
 The skill of making a violin sound like a screech out.

732
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,060
 Like a goat.

733
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,060
 Yeah.

734
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,060
 That's been surprised, but not badly.

735
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,060
 Yeah, yeah.

736
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:12,060
 But, so, like, you just buy a barrel, slot it into the organ, turn the handle.

737
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,060
 The same tunes come out every time.

738
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,060
 So it's like, that was a frustrating thing for a lot of people.

739
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:23,060
 So Charles Dickens, his illustrator, called John Leitch, claimed that he died early, because he...

740
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,060
 He climbed.

741
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,060
 You saw him be cut to me, didn't you, Andy?

742
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,060
 Yeah.

743
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:31,060
 He said, "This is killing me," and then he died, and he said, "It's because of this."

744
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,060
 Yeah.

745
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:40,060
 His final words to fellow artist William Frith were, "Rather Frith to be tormented in this way, I would prefer to go to the grave where there is no noise."

746
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,060
 There we go.

747
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,060
 Where are we going?

748
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,060
 Oh, he really caught on his nerves.

749
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:48,060
 They buried him under the bandstand at Captain Commonside.

750
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:53,060
 I was looking into what was going on in 1861, London, at the time.

751
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,060
 Just curious.

752
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,060
 No, as in, I've got the answer, the invention of the toast sandwich.

753
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:04,060
 Because Mrs. Beaton's book of household management was first published in 1861, and one of the recipes in there was toast sandwich.

754
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,060
 Get two bits of bread, put your bit of toast inside.

755
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,060
 I've eaten that, actually.

756
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,060
 I tried it.

757
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
 Have you?

758
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,060
 Well, we did mention it on QI once, and I thought I'd see what it's like.

759
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,060
 Yeah.

760
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:19,060
 And it's not as bad as you might think, I would say, because it gives you a little bit of texture to what otherwise is quite a boring piece of bread.

761
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,060
 So, it's bread toast bread.

762
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,060
 Yeah.

763
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,060
 Well, people put crisps in sandwiches, don't they, for a bit of crunch.

764
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,060
 Yeah.

765
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,060
 But there's usually something else.

766
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
 Yeah.

767
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,060
 Although, I think, actually, a sandwich of just butter and crisps.

768
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,060
 I mean, flavor of choice.

769
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,060
 I mean, I'm ready-salted all the way.

770
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
 Oh, ready-salted.

771
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,060
 I think that's probably right with that combo, I think.

772
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
 Yeah, something vinegar wouldn't quite...

773
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,060
 It's a lot more about texture than taste.

774
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,060
 But you still think you might have a little bit of something else.

775
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,060
 Yeah.

776
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,060
 I think there was butter on it, in Mrs. Beaton's version, wasn't it?

777
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,060
 Yes, yeah, yeah.

778
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,060
 So, that was invented in...

779
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:54,060
 That was, well, the book was published, and that was a very notable, very odd bit of recipe.

780
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,060
 Yes, huge.

781
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,060
 Black velvet.

782
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,060
 You might have seen people walking around the streets, 1861, drinking black velvet.

783
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,060
 Oh.

784
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,060
 Now, this is a Guinness with a glass of champagne.

785
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,060
 That's right.

786
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
 And that's from then.

787
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,060
 Yes, to commemorate a very big death of 1861.

788
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,060
 Albert?

789
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
 That's right.

790
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,060
 Albert died December 1861.

791
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,060
 He invented a cocktail.

792
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,060
 Just before.

793
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,060
 No, no, no.

794
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,060
 He said, "This cocktail's going to kill me."

795
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,060
 And then he died.

796
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,060
 And then he said, "I told you."

797
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,060
 Can you think why they might have invented the cocktail?

798
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,060
 What?

799
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,060
 I mean, to try and monetise it, in general.

800
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,060
 You know, is it black for a morning?

801
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,060
 Yep.

802
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,060
 So, and then champagne for a royal celebration.

803
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:39,060
 So, the Guinness would sit like a black band, like mourners were hanging around their arms.

804
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,060
 The idea was, it was a, it's like getting a top on your beer.

805
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,060
 Is that a lager top?

806
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,060
 Is that what, which, what is a lager top?

807
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,060
 It's a normal pint of lager, but they pour out the tiniest bit of the top,

808
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,060
 and they give you a little dash of lemonade just to take the edge off.

809
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,060
 So, it's like a very, very strong chandelier.

810
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,060
 Yes, exactly.

811
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,060
 You know, when you're shandy, it's become a lager top.

812
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,060
 You know, you're just telling yourself, "That's just beer, mate."

813
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:07,060
 And particularly when you say, "Instead of the beer, use whiskey."

814
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,060
 Just two more things, because it's quite fun to know.

815
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:16,060
 It was the publication of Great Expectations, so Dickens obviously had been printing the stories in serials,

816
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,060
 but it was the first full book bringing the chapters together.

817
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:25,060
 And then the last one that I found was, it was the introduction of Widow Twenky into pantomime.

818
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,060
 Oh, wow.

819
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,060
 Yeah, 1861, the first ever pantomime.

820
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,060
 It sounds like a good time to be alive.

821
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,060
 Hello, that's great.

822
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,060
 It's great.

823
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,060
 Have you guys heard, just on people being loud and other people being annoyed about that,

824
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,060
 have you heard of the New York Society for the Suppression of Unnecessary Noise?

825
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,060
 No.

826
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,060
 This is my kind of organisation, basically.

827
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,060
 And yet you said David Mitchell is not very American.

828
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:50,060
 So this was a doctor called Julia Barnett Rice, okay.

829
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,060
 She was, she qualified in 1885, got a medical degree but didn't practice.

830
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,060
 I think, I don't know if women were allowed to practice in the 1880s, '90s, I'm not sure.

831
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,060
 But she really wanted that street vendors not be allowed to shout.

832
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,060
 And she, like, she made it her life's course.

833
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,060
 And she and her husband, he was called Isaac Rice.

834
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,060
 He was an interesting guy in various ways.

835
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:15,060
 He invented a chess opening that was called the Rice Gambit, just so you know.

836
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,060
 And then spent about, apparently, the next 20 years of his life,

837
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,060
 researching, analysing and testing the soundness of his gambit.

838
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,060
 So what a thing to spend your life doing.

839
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,060
 But the thing is that I've never heard of that and I followed chess a little bit.

840
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,060
 So presumably it wasn't very useful after all those 20 years.

841
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,060
 No, he got to the end of the 20 years, like, "Oh, it's not allowed to move that way."

842
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:40,060
 Oh, cancel that.

843
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:47,060
 I have never in my life met a bishop that could only move diagonally.

844
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:53,060
 It's just not realistic, whereas castles can't move at all without an earthquake.

845
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:58,060
 And they just, they had a house on Broadway, way too noisy.

846
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,060
 So they moved up to by the river, right, on Riverside Drive.

847
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,060
 They built their own house.

848
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,060
 They had a basement vault dug so that they could have somewhere quiet.

849
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,060
 Partly because they had six children, so the house was quite noisy.

850
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,060
 So he stayed in the basement a lot of the time, doing his gambit.

851
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:20,060
 That's actually what the Rice Gambit is.

852
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:25,060
 Because they were by the river, the riverboats made so much noise blowing their horns all day.

853
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:29,060
 So she, Julia, she hired students to count the number of toots per day.

854
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:33,060
 And it was about a thousand toots per day, but if it was foggy, it was 3,000.

855
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,060
 So she started a campaign saying, "Look, this is very bad for people's health."

856
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:40,060
 And it was mostly because she didn't like it, as far as I can tell.

857
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,060
 But the tugboat captains found out about this campaign of hers,

858
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,060
 and they found out where she lived, and they would gather outside on the river at night

859
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,060
 and all blast their horns.

860
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,060
 But she genuinely got the law changed, and she got Mark Twain involved.

861
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,060
 - Wow. - And she established quiet zones around hospitals.

862
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,060
 How many boats sank then?

863
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,060
 Like shipwrecks.

864
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,060
 Very quiet ones, that was the key.

865
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,060
 Yeah, that's amazing. Another person who hated it was Thomas Carlisle,

866
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:11,060
 just to go back to the 1850s in London, and the 1850s and 1860s in London.

867
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:16,060
 He once wrote that he was considering to assassinate a vile Italian organ grinder

868
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,060
 who worked near his house.

869
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,060
 But I think he might have built the first ever soundproof room

870
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,060
 in his house in London. This was in 1853.

871
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,060
 It had double walls, and it had a slated roof with a gap in between

872
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:33,060
 where he could get, like, muffling chambers full of air so that the sound couldn't get in.

873
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,060
 And it cost him £170, which, according to one online calculator,

874
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,060
 I found, said it was about £30,000 today. It cost him.

875
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,060
 For a house extension, that's, you know...

876
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,060
 Yeah, in those days, I think, yeah.

877
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:50,060
 Why didn't they pay the annoying organ grinder to go away?

878
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,060
 Oh, I think you could do that.

879
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,060
 But I think that is how they earned quite a bit of their money,

880
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,060
 just extorting it from people.

881
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,060
 That must be a glam profession, though.

882
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,060
 You know, ostensibly, you're there to, you know,

883
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:05,060
 they're here to entertain with our violin. It sounds like a cow.

884
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,060
 The real money is for people who desperately want you to go.

885
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,060
 It would be if we went doing live shows like we do,

886
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:16,060
 and we got on stage and everyone had done a whip round for us not to do the show.

887
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:20,060
 I'm going to give you one last set of buskers. This is in 2009 in Birmingham.

888
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,060
 Two buskers who only knew two songs and had been playing them

889
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:27,060
 in the same part of Birmingham for 18 months on end were given Aspose.

890
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,060
 And they were... They knew Wonderwall and...

891
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,060
 That's the worst review.

892
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,060
 Five-star, four-star, three-star, three-star, one-star,

893
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,060
 and then there is Aspose.

894
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,060
 It was Wonderwall and Faith.

895
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,060
 They had a guitar and they had a bin lid.

896
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:46,060
 And, yeah, but they would play it to, like, four or five or six in the morning sometimes.

897
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:50,060
 One person said, "To be fair, they didn't do a bad rendition of the songs."

898
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,060
 So that's...

899
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,060
 If you lived in the area, that would become the main version of the song to you.

900
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,060
 And then you'd listen to Oasis doing it and go,

901
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,060
 "No, they've got that bit wrong."

902
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,060
 There's a few classic London ones I think most tourists will probably remember

903
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,060
 if they've got the tube, like the Henry the Hoover.

904
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,060
 What is that person that Henry the Hoover calls people?

905
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,060
 I think next to it on a keyboard, but then he had accompanied by this Henry the Hoover

906
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,060
 that had the saxophone that would shoot bubbles outside it, yeah.

907
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,060
 So sorry, it's the... Where's the saxophone?

908
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,060
 In the nozzle, I guess?

909
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,060
 Of the Hoover?

910
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,060
 Yeah, it sucks.

911
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,060
 But wait, the far end of the nozzle, like the bit that does the hoovering,

912
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,060
 or is it right... Have you removed the Hoover's trunk?

913
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,060
 I can't believe how...

914
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,060
 And you've drowned the saxophone into that.

915
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,060
 Quickly, what I thought was a solid image in my head is collapsed.

916
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,060
 It sounds great.

917
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,060
 I just made that up there.

918
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,060
 I just want a bit of doctrinal reasoning.

919
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,060
 Does it suck saxophones?

920
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,060
 Does it make the same noise as if you blow a saxophone?

921
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,060
 Wow, great question.

922
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,060
 I don't know, I might do.

923
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,060
 I don't know, I might do.

924
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,060
 Stuming, no.

925
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,060
 You would think that, wouldn't you, mate?

926
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,060
 Yeah.

927
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,060
 Because you're sucking it into the...

928
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,060
 Is it the horn, the mouth of the saxophone?

929
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,060
 The bell end, actually.

930
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,060
 Is it called the bell end?

931
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,060
 Yeah, yeah.

932
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:59,060
 Okay, so it presumably will make the opposite noise.

933
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,060
 Does it always have an opposite?

934
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,060
 Well, we know it's quite theological.

935
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:07,060
 What's the opposite noise to February?

936
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,060
 Yeah, mate.

937
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,060
 I mean...

938
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,060
 No, I like this.

939
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,060
 Yeah.

940
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,060
 I like the big...

941
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,060
 We're finally getting to the big question.

942
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,060
 That's 500 eps in, finally.

943
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,060
 Does the noise have an opposite?

944
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,060
 It doesn't always have an opposite.

945
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,060
 You can have an opposite wave function.

946
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,060
 Well, they can do things, can't they?

947
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,060
 Sometimes when, if there's a noise of air conditioning when you're recording something,

948
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:31,060
 they can record that and in some way invert it and then...

949
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,060
 So it sucks that noise out.

950
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,060
 So if you're a hybun, you know what the opposite of the word February is.

951
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,060
 Yeah.

952
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,060
 Send it in.

953
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,060
 It's the noise that you would play over the word February in order to induce silence.

954
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:49,060
 And all these irritable Victorians needed was to have that on their own barrel.

955
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:52,060
 And turn the handle, and it would go quiet.

956
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,060
 That would be amazing.

957
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,060
 The opposite of Wonderwall.

958
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,060
 Yeah.

959
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:03,060
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

960
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,060
 And that is my fact.

961
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:09,060
 My fact is that in 1993, a man in Brazil who robbed a factory of its glue

962
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:13,060
 was arrested 36 hours later, still in the factory he was robbing,

963
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:16,060
 because he was stuck to the glue he was stealing.

964
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,060
 Didn't he think to steal the glue in its containers?

965
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,060
 I think what happened?

966
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,060
 So this is a guy called Edelberg.

967
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,060
 He was just putting it in his pockets.

968
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,060
 I'll just take the glue loose.

969
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:29,060
 It's so heavy, these cans.

970
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:32,060
 The police will be looking for tubes of glue.

971
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,060
 They won't be looking for raw glue.

972
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,060
 It was a 19-year-old.

973
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,060
 He was called Edelberg Guamárez.

974
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,060
 We don't have to name him.

975
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,060
 It's the opposite of that noise.

976
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:49,060
 I actually think he was probably called Edelberto, because I Googled it.

977
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,060
 I can't find anyone else called Edelberg, but there's a lot of people called Edelberto,

978
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,060
 where it runs over two lines and there's a hyphen.

979
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,060
 That's interesting.

980
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,060
 So I saw the story in the Washington Post.

981
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,060
 It was part of a yearly roundup, and it was a 19-year-old.

982
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:07,060
 He did take two large cans, and since something must have happened,

983
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,060
 they tipped over as he was trying to get out of the factory.

984
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,060
 Glue spilled everywhere.

985
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,060
 He obviously tried to pick up the glue and put it back in.

986
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,060
 I don't know.

987
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,060
 He then got stuck to where he was.

988
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,060
 It is very easy.

989
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,060
 I had to do a minor glue job the other day,

990
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,060
 and the amount of glue on my hands at the end of it was...

991
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,060
 When you say glue job, is that like a bank job?

992
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,060
 Were you also stealing glue?

993
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,060
 Yeah, it's very easy, even with a small...

994
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,060
 Does it dry that quickly?

995
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,060
 Oh, God, it dries so fast.

996
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,060
 Oh, really?

997
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,060
 Sorry, this is now my...

998
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,060
 Glue is very, very annoying, because it either doesn't work,

999
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,060
 like, you know, essentially, Pritz-stick.

1000
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,060
 There are other brands of glue that don't work.

1001
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,060
 They sort of go in that...

1002
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,060
 OK, it sort of sticks it a bit, but, you know, so does Snot.

1003
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:53,060
 Or it's just so incredibly effective, and you can't be angry with it, can you?

1004
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:58,060
 Because, you know, yes, it's doing exactly what Snot wanted it to stick together,

1005
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,060
 and, yeah, I didn't say my fingers.

1006
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,060
 But, yes, I did apply my two fingers to each other while there was glue on one,

1007
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,060
 and now, you know, but it's like the glue is being facetious.

1008
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:11,060
 You know I didn't want to stick my fingers whenever

1009
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,060
 as anyone wanted to stick their fingers together.

1010
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,060
 Yeah, I didn't...

1011
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,060
 It was through researching this fact that I didn't realise

1012
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:21,060
 how important super glue is to the world of live music.

1013
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,060
 Oh.

1014
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,060
 For live shows, so take a band like the Red Hot Chili Peppers,

1015
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,060
 flea on the bass, very aggressive with his playing,

1016
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:31,060
 slapping and popping and all sorts, and he'll get huge calluses during the gig.

1017
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,060
 And sometimes, with old wounds that he's got, they'll be ripped open.

1018
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,060
 So he's got missing bits of his hand.

1019
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,060
 So he'll run off stage, grab super glue, fill in the hole.

1020
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,060
 Oh, no.

1021
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,060
 Yeah, yeah, and come back on, John Froschanti does it,

1022
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,060
 the guitarist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stevie Ray Vaughan does it.

1023
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,060
 There's so many musicians that talk about...

1024
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,060
 They've got to give it a minute, or they're going to stick to their instruments.

1025
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,060
 (LAUGHTER)

1026
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:55,060
 I know how someone else would glue their fingers together, actually.

1027
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,060
 Oh, yeah.

1028
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,060
 For a specific use in film.

1029
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,060
 Is it something we can guess?

1030
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,060
 It's something you can guess.

1031
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,060
 Oh, okay.

1032
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,060
 Oh, yeah, I know it, so I won't say it.

1033
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,060
 Oh, great show.

1034
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,060
 Here's the only thing I'd say is, like, an additional clue.

1035
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,060
 I can't do this.

1036
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,060
 So if I was in the movie as this character, I would require the super glue as well.

1037
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,060
 Well, I'm thinking of one of two things.

1038
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,060
 Okay.

1039
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,060
 Is it E.T.?

1040
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,060
 Oh, weird fingers.

1041
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,060
 That's good.

1042
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,060
 Or...

1043
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,060
 Or Spock.

1044
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,060
 It's Spock.

1045
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,060
 It's Spock.

1046
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,060
 Well, you couldn't do it without glue.

1047
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,060
 Mr...

1048
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,060
 Spock.

1049
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,060
 It was Zachary Quinto in the new Star Trek film.

1050
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,060
 Couldn't do the Vulcan salute, so they glued it together.

1051
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,060
 It's a thing which I can't do, I can't.

1052
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,060
 I can do it with one hand, but not with the other.

1053
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,060
 Right.

1054
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:42,060
 Would you feel, if for that reason you weren't cast as Spock in Star Trek,

1055
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,060
 would you feel that that was okay?

1056
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,060
 I think so.

1057
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,060
 I think so.

1058
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:48,060
 Yeah, well, would you feel you were being discriminated against?

1059
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,060
 Well, he wasn't discriminated against.

1060
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,060
 No.

1061
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,060
 I don't know if he showed up to the audition pre-glued.

1062
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:56,060
 I would say, if I was auditioning for Spock, first thing, can you do that with your hand?

1063
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,060
 If so, okay, let's look at the script.

1064
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:05,060
 In fairness, they don't only cast people with pointy ears, so they do add some kind of...

1065
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,060
 Having said that, though, if some people had pointy ears, they would have a legitimate grievance.

1066
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,060
 I mean, talk about it.

1067
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:15,060
 If there were real Vulcans among us, and then suddenly we're getting people to Vulcan up,

1068
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,060
 then that's not appropriate, is it?

1069
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:23,060
 But because Vulcans don't happen to exist, it's okay to point a ear up non-Vulcans.

1070
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,060
 But similarly, the hand thing.

1071
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:29,060
 I do feel like Zachary Quinto is taking jobs away from people like me who can do it.

1072
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,060
 Yeah, you can do it.

1073
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:31,060
 I'm really duddy with both.

1074
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,060
 You two can.

1075
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:35,060
 I can do it with one and just about with the other, and you can't do it at all.

1076
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,060
 I can't do it at all.

1077
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,060
 No.

1078
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,060
 Well, you can play Kirk.

1079
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,060
 That's fine.

1080
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:45,060
 There's plenty of parts.

1081
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,060
 Was William Shatner Kirk?

1082
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,060
 Yeah.

1083
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,060
 So he couldn't do it either, and they tied his fingers...

1084
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,060
 No, no, but he apparently has to do it at one point.

1085
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:55,060
 They tied his fingers together with fishing line.

1086
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,060
 No.

1087
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,060
 Oh, my God.

1088
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,060
 That makes sense.

1089
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,060
 That's very gloomy.

1090
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,060
 Lovely.

1091
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:05,060
 You say I'm the least American person, but you ask, "Was William Shatner Kirk?"

1092
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:13,060
 I mean, I have to say, I really knew that as a piece of popular culture got through to me.

1093
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:18,060
 "Was Elvis Presley a singer?"

1094
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:23,060
 Speaking of body parts and glue, do you know what butt glue is?

1095
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,060
 Oh, butt glue.

1096
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,060
 Butt glue.

1097
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:31,060
 I have a product at home called Butt Clean, but I have a water butt.

1098
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:36,060
 You must have been disappointed when you bought that on the internet.

1099
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:43,060
 The amount of capsules I wasted for realising they had to be just dropped in the water butt.

1100
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,060
 So that cleans the water butt there.

1101
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,060
 Yeah, you just pop it in and it fizzes a bit.

1102
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:51,060
 All the turtles just float to the surface.

1103
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,060
 This is actually more to do with the Americans.

1104
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,060
 So what's it called?

1105
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,060
 Butt glue.

1106
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,060
 Butt glue.

1107
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,060
 That's a terrible bum remake.

1108
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,060
 Butt.

1109
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:04,060
 It's not for repairing water butts.

1110
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,060
 No, it's not.

1111
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:11,060
 It's for the bottoms and it's for people who compete in pageants.

1112
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:17,060
 If you're wearing a very tight bikini, you want it to be exactly straight on your cheeks.

1113
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:19,060
 You don't want it to ride up or anything like that.

1114
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,060
 You put it between the bikini and the bottom.

1115
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,060
 So it sort of goes on the bikini to get it positioned.

1116
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,060
 I was thinking it goes on the bum, but it sort of lifts the bum.

1117
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:35,060
 Well, Andrew, you would be good in the pageant world according to the Bravo show.

1118
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,060
 I think that too.

1119
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:39,060
 I'm amazed that is his line of work.

1120
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:46,060
 You would be an innovator because according to the Bravo show Game of Crowns, which is quite recent,

1121
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:54,060
 some people are using butt glue to actually hold the butt cheeks together to kind of make them seem very pert.

1122
00:54:54,060 --> 00:55:00,060
 Because it's not very strongly, but it's what's soluble so you can put some water down there and it'll open them up again.

1123
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,060
 You just need a thank goodness.

1124
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,060
 Do not use super glue instead of butt glue.

1125
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,060
 You're doing your airfix with butt glue.

1126
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,060
 It's not like, oh my god.

1127
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:18,060
 Is that a common complaint in beauty pageant terms that the buttocks are too far apart?

1128
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,060
 They're on the side of a criminal disposition.

1129
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:23,060
 I don't think they all do this just to say if you're a beauty pageant.

1130
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,060
 Of course not.

1131
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,060
 No, no, no.

1132
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,060
 I think but just some people do it too.

1133
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,060
 But I thought there was glue.

1134
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:32,060
 There's all sorts of bits of glue for sticking bits of makeup to people's faces.

1135
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,060
 Surely this is the same as butt glue.

1136
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,060
 There's no need to say that this glue, it's skin glue.

1137
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,060
 It doesn't need to be specifically for the butt.

1138
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,060
 I think there might be some marketing going on there.

1139
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:47,060
 Like I have something called Nerdwax which you use to keep your sunglasses on.

1140
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:54,060
 Because my nose is quite small so my sunglasses slip down my nose and you can kind of put it on your nose and it kind of keeps it there.

1141
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,060
 But really it's just wax.

1142
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,060
 But they've put it in a nice tube that says Nerdwax on and they maybe want to buy it.

1143
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,060
 So I think it's a bit of that.

1144
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,060
 Yeah, you could use it wherever you want.

1145
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,060
 Bugger glue.

1146
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,060
 Anyone heard of bugger glue?

1147
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,060
 Okay, bugger as in the Americans.

1148
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:10,060
 Yeah, so I should explain what bugger is to the non-American here.

1149
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:17,060
 I've heard the expression just by being so un-American as in for a unit of snot, isn't it?

1150
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,060
 A unit of dry snot.

1151
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,060
 Like a bogey.

1152
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,060
 Like a bogey.

1153
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:27,060
 Is it used in beauty pageants to hold the nostrils together because they are considered to be more beautiful?

1154
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,060
 Too far apart nostrils.

1155
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:36,060
 Remember when you used to get a bank card through the post and when you would take it off there would be a little bit of glue underneath.

1156
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,060
 That's clever.

1157
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,060
 The very snotty bugger glue.

1158
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,060
 That's bugger glue.

1159
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:46,060
 That's satisfying though because when that comes away it's gone completely, which is actually not the case for snot.

1160
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,060
 I'd say snot leaves more of a sort of residue.

1161
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,060
 Better than snot.

1162
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,060
 Better than snot.

1163
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:58,060
 We've invented a better snot but now all we need to do is get it to somehow come out of our noses.

1164
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:03,060
 Because at the moment it only manifests on credit cards rather than in packages when you've got a cold.

1165
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,060
 Come on AI.

1166
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,060
 I need to wrap us up in a sec.

1167
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,060
 Can we do some bungling criminals?

1168
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,060
 Yeah why not a couple of bungling criminals.

1169
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:16,060
 There was a man who stole a parcel from Reading.

1170
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:21,060
 Wasn't to contain Henry the first to remain.

1171
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,060
 This is in 1994.

1172
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,060
 It was in the early 90s.

1173
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,060
 It could still be the first year.

1174
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,060
 And it turned out to be a bomb.

1175
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:34,060
 It turned out to be an IRA bomb.

1176
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:40,060
 And he ran down the road pointing to the suitcase that he'd stolen shouting it's a bomb, it's a bomb.

1177
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:44,060
 And passersby thought that he was high on drugs but he dumped the suitcase outside a shop.

1178
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:49,060
 And 200 homes in Reading had to be evacuated while the bomb squad made it safe.

1179
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,060
 I thought you were going to say blew up.

1180
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:57,060
 I'll tell you how safely put it outside a shop.

1181
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,060
 I'll be honest I think he was panicking.

1182
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,060
 Because there must have been a moment of realisation of that story.

1183
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,060
 He's stolen the suitcase.

1184
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,060
 It's labels IRA bomb.

1185
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:10,060
 It's ticking or there's a fuse or something.

1186
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,060
 The truth is you would think it probably wasn't a bomb, right?

1187
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:16,060
 But they did make it safe.

1188
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,060
 So the newspaper report did say that it was a bomb.

1189
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,060
 A hero butcher.

1190
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,060
 You want to hear about a hero butcher?

1191
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,060
 Another one.

1192
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:29,060
 This was a man who stole £6 from a butcher.

1193
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:32,060
 But the butcher was also an amateur magician.

1194
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:36,060
 And rather than raising the alarm because he thought the guy would run away if he said stop thief.

1195
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:40,060
 He decided to do a trick where he pretended that 50p had gone missing.

1196
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:44,060
 And he said oh let me find it, it might be about your person.

1197
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:48,060
 And he searched the person and found the £6 that he'd stolen.

1198
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,060
 That's brilliant.

1199
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:54,060
 This is in 1976.

1200
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,060
 People were more willing to stand still then.

1201
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:03,060
 The butcher suddenly said I have just stolen £6 and now the butcher is coming round the counter

1202
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:06,060
 and doing a bit of a trick about coins.

1203
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:09,060
 This is an eerie coincidence.

1204
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:12,060
 How can the butcher prove unless the butcher has already written his initials on the £6

1205
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:15,060
 which he might have done as part of the magic trick.

1206
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:18,060
 Just saying that's my £6, what are you going to do?

1207
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:23,060
 Maybe it was a coincidence and the butcher always basically stole all the money of the people that came in.

1208
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:27,060
 But on this occasion it was just money that he was nicking back.

1209
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:34,060
 The reason we know about it is because actually the butcher let the guy go and even gave him some sausages for his tea

1210
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:37,060
 because he could see that he was in need of this stuff.

1211
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:43,060
 But when the guy was caught for a different robbery he was in court in Newcastle and he asked for this

1212
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:47,060
 and a few other crimes to be taken into account and then they brought the butcher in to corroborate it.

1213
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,060
 So that's how we know it happened.

1214
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:53,060
 Why did he mention that when he was being done for something else?

1215
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,060
 We know that.

1216
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:58,060
 He wasn't taking it any further and he said fine have some sausages.

1217
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,060
 Guess how I got these sausages.

1218
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,060
 It's a funny story actually.

1219
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:05,060
 I can't tell you what I should tell you.

1220
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,060
 You know what, I did think that.

1221
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:10,060
 But it is a thing that they asked for other things to be taken into account, don't they?

1222
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:14,060
 But that I think is what they're saying is it precludes future prosecution.

1223
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,060
 I think that might be it.

1224
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,060
 But I think on this, so I suppose maybe.

1225
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,060
 But on this case no way the butcher is going to go.

1226
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:22,060
 Actually I've thought about it.

1227
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,060
 That was out of order and I want this to be back.

1228
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:29,060
 Do you think it might make the judge look more kindly on you to say alright, I've turned over a new leaf by the way,

1229
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,060
 here are some other things.

1230
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,060
 Well it may be.

1231
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:36,060
 I think if you said to the judge I've never done anything wrong before, that's fine.

1232
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:42,060
 But the difference between saying, talking about five previous robberies rather than four,

1233
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:45,060
 I don't think that's going to meaningfully change the judge's view on you.

1234
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,060
 Because it's such a funny story.

1235
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,060
 The judge must get a lot of quite grim cases of theft and burglar and stuff.

1236
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:54,060
 And actually this funny thing that happened in a butcher shop would make me look more kindly on a grinder.

1237
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,060
 Now I know you're a bungling crook.

1238
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,060
 Bungling crook.

1239
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,060
 And then the butcher, anyway, the butcher saw the funny side.

1240
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,060
 David, it's awesome.

1241
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,060
 Yeah, and then I mugged an old lady.

1242
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:13,060
 Okay, that's it.

1243
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,060
 That is all of our facts.

1244
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,060
 Thank you so much for listening.

1245
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:19,060

 And David.

1253

 @RealDMitchell.

1254
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,060
 Nice.

1255
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,060
 I don't actually look at any of the replies because it's so poisonous on there.

1256
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,060
 Yes.

1257
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,060
 So, you know, you won't be hearing back from me.

1258
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,060
 Tweeting you abuse for years.

1259
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,060
 You mean you haven't written it?

1260
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,060
 I'm well aware.

1261
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:45,060
 Yeah, or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing, or go to our website,

1262
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,060
 NoSuchThingAsAfish.com.

1263

 All of our previous episodes are up there, so do check them out.

1264
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,060
 But most importantly of all, get David's new book.

1265
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,060
 It's called Unruly, A History of England's Kings and Queens.

1266
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,060
 It's out now in all shops and online.

1267
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,060
 That's it for us.

1268
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,060
 We'll be back again next week, and we'll see you then.

1269
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,060
 Goodbye.

1270
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,060
