00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.100
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show wanted to announce our special guest.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:13.160
 This one is really exciting guys. Our special guest this week is none other than David Mitchell.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.380
 That's right. If you haven't heard of David Mitchell, you haven't seen any British comedy recently because he's been in absolutely everything.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.020
 Of course, peep show, upstart crow, would I lie to you, the unbelievable truth,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.460
 every single panel show going and he's here. He's on fish this week. David is here partly because he has, as you are about to hear in the show, a new book out.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.380
 And it is a fantastic book. I genuinely finished it this morning and I loved it. It's called Unruly.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.260
 It's a history book. It's a history of England's kings and queens.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.540
 It goes all the way from King Arthur, fictional, to Queen Elizabeth I, not fictional.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.360
 And it is so funny and yet you also are being educated all the way along the way.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.060
 It's been described as horrible histories for grown-ups and that's exactly what it's like.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.560
 You'll laugh, you'll learn. It's got that classic Mitchell wit all the way through.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.660
 It's absolutely fantastic. There are lengthy digressions about things like where you can get a nice coffee in Oxford or the James Bond films, all of that.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.260
 It's so good. And it's not even just me saying this. It has already been a number one Sunday Times bestseller.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.060
 So if you have a history fan in your life who you think would like a laugh as well, this is a perfect present.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.660
 Also, if you'd like even more David Mitchell in your life after this episode, his new show Outsiders has just started its third series.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.760
 That's on Dave. It's a kind of outdoor challenge survival show hosted by David.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.260
 And the guests this series include Alan Davis of QI and of course, former fish guest.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.760
 So that's it from me. I'll stop wagging on now. Hope you enjoy this episode.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.360
 We really enjoyed recording it. On with the podcast.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:02:00.160
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.160
 My name is Dan Shriver. I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and David Mitchell.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.460
 And once again, we have David Mitchell here.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.360
 My name is Dan Shriver. I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and David Mitchell.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.260
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.360
 And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is David.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.560
 My fact is that King Stephen owed his throne to food poisoning or, you know, the shit.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.460
 Right. I haven't asked about swearing. How much so? You're allowed to go for it. Yeah, that's fucking great.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.060
 Yes, so to diarrhea, probably caused by food poisoning.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.460
 Okay. Previous King's Diarrhea, not his own.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.260
 His own? His own? Wait, not a previous King's Diarrhea.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.260
 What? And so people saw him shit himself and thought this man must be King? No, no, he didn't go like that.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.460
 I mean, obviously, there was a lot of diarrhea back then. It was, you know, there's a lot now.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.860
 It's one of the ways you can empathize for people in the past. They too had liquid shit, but more often died of them.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.260
 You know, King John, shot himself to death. Henry V shot himself to death.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.060
 So you've got a good King and a bad King there, both dying of dysentery.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.560
 But King Stephen didn't have dysentery. It was more of a short term thing.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.260
 I don't know if it was a bug or something yet. And he certainly didn't know.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.560
 But because he got diarrhea, he got off a ship.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.160
 And the ship he got off was the White Ship.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.360
 It was a state of the art, lovely craft in Barfleur Harbour.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.760
 And all of the most important young people of the reign, the in-crowd, were on this ship and they were about to sail to England.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.260
 But the not yet King Stephen, Stephen of Blois, was on it.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.360
 And he got diarrhea and he got off it to go into Barfleur and relax on a privy.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.960
 And the ship sailed without him and sank and everyone on board died apart from a butcher.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.260
 Oh, that's interesting.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.960
 Then he survived, but that's the last, then he's lost to, he went on, presumably being a butcher, and then died.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.060
 He had a good anecdote.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.160
 I was like, he absolutely had a good anecdote.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.960
 Did he survive because of the butchery? Was that, but as in, does history relate whether he clung to some, some of the meat?

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.060
 No, it wasn't the buoyancy of pork chops that saved him.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.360
 Was it him who provided the meal that provided the diarrhea for the future King?

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.360
 I don't think so.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.760
 I'm not clear as to why there was a butcher on board, but ships have, like, they have, you know, they must have livestock.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.560
 Well, you get on a cruise ship, they've got, you know, a swimming pool and a casino.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.360
 So, you know, I don't think this ship had that.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.860
 But, you know, they had some, they might not have had livestock because they're only going across the channel, but they would have had food.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.960
 Yeah, I don't think there's any connection.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.760
 There's no suggestion that it was his meat that he retailed that caused Stephen, King Stevens, not yet King Steve.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.360
 So I can't help calling him King Stephen.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.660
 He's not King Stephen yet.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.860
 It's like Prince Charles calling him King Charles.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.660
 It's impossible to get into your head or it is for me anyway.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.960
 I've managed, I'm, I'm now saying King Prince Charles, which is a way of easing myself into it.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.360
 And eventually I'd be able to drop the prince.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.960
 I was saying it two years previous, just to make sure I was running with it.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:27.160
 This ship though, it does sound, it sounds amazing as in it was obviously stated with the art, but I mean everyone who was anyone was on one ship at one time,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.060
 which I presume wasn't thought of as being fine.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.060
 I mean, clearly wasn't fine.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.860
 Yeah, because like, is it like the Royal Family aren't really supposed to be on the same airplane or something?

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.260
 I heard that.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.860
 Is that right?

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.060
 Yeah.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.760
 Oh, wow.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.060
 Yeah.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.460
 But the air, the real air to the throne was on that ship, right?

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.760
 That's the key thing.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.560
 Yes, the real air to the throne, doesn't it?

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.460
 The King at the time, King Henry I, he wasn't on it.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:57.960
 He was on a less snazzy ship with older, important people, but the younger, cool, important people, including William Atherling, the air to the throne.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.760
 They were all on the white ship and they all died because obviously the butcher wasn't part of that team.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.260
 He was staff.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.360
 And so the only survivor was one of the staff, which I'm sure at the time they thought was absolutely the wrong way round.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:27.660
 Well, one of the other staff, I've read that one of the other staff, the ship's captain, also survived the initial shipwreck, came to the surface, heard that the air to the throne, William Atherling had drowned and then just decided to drown himself.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.160
 The only person who could possibly have told us that story is the butcher.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.360
 Yeah, you're right.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.160
 It feels like as the anecdote has gone on, he's kind of added little bits to it.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.460
 Obviously, if you were the captain's fact, that's a very positive anecdote for the butcher to say.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.760
 And the thing is, obviously, the butcher, we don't know what happened to him other than he didn't die in that shipwreck.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.560
 He probably murdered the captain is what I would think of, possibly, and maybe he made a hole in the ship.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:01.660
 But the thing is, he didn't even get a book deal out of it, which just shows you what primitive times these were, because nowadays that would have been on the gravy train for life.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.560
 Yeah, what a ship show, something like that.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.360
 Yes, it's unbelievable.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.560
 So what year are we talking here?

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.660
 1120.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.660
 1120, OK.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.060
 So that's ages ago, didn't even know we had proper ships crossing the channel at that point.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.660
 1120, you must have guessed, because 1066, quite famously.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.960
 How do you think they got here to get across the total?

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.360
 Not a swimming operation.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.760
 I'm sorry, I had the whole lifeguard swimming pool, because you know, think of my head.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.660
 Oh, I see, no.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.460
 I don't think they hadn't bought tickets.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.460
 It wasn't a scheduled cross.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.060
 I think it was absolutely just, it was commissioned for the...

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.060
 Right, specifically.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.460
 ...just for the posh people to go across, because they were having a very nice time at the point.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.260
 Henry I had just won a small war against the King of France.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.360
 William Athling had been confirmed as the heir to the Dukedom of Normandy.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.060
 At that point, the King of England was also Duke of Normandy, and he was running this cross channel regime.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:03.260
 And so they've shored up their position on the continent in this sort of weird situation where the King of France is King in Normandy, but not in control of it.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:10.660
 And the Duke of Normandy runs Normandy, but has to sort of pay lip service to the feudal seniority of the King of France.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.860
 But that's all been lined up for William Athling, the King of France is back in his box.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.160
 He didn't live in a box.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.260
 There will have been French kings who lived in boxes.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:24.660
 There was a French king who thought he was made out of glass, but this one I think was sort of comparatively normal.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.360
 So, Henry I is very happy.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:32.060
 Let's all go back to England, this other country we own, and hang out there for a bit.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.560
 So it was a happy day, very successful period of Henry I's reign.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:44.460
 And then it was a bit like a sort of mega-som in the heirs to the whole ruling class just died in one go.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.560
 Is it true that they were all drunk as well?

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.460
 I read that.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.260
 Yes, basically they decided to get the boat across at night time.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:51.660
 Yeah.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.160
 We're not sure why, but it might have been just so they could get pissed in the meantime.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.560
 Right.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.860
 Apparently everyone on board was absolutely shit-faced, and that could have been one of the reasons that they crashed.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.760
 That's interesting.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.560
 It seems quite likely to be one of the reasons, doesn't it?

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.060
 Because they were obviously quite, I mean, those days there were more shipwrecks than there are now.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.060
 You know, it wasn't a dumb deal crossing the channel, but I don't think the weather was bad.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.060
 People were nipping back and forth all the time.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.060
 But yeah, William Atherling essentially declared it a party boat and said we're all going to have a drink.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:30.160
 And you know, not to be a snob, he very much included the staff, the crew, the butcher and crucially the people driving the ship,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.460
 as they didn't call it then.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.260
 So one set of people they didn't include was the priests.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.760
 So usually the priests would bless the ship before it set off.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.960
 And because it was a party boat, they decided to dismiss the priests, and so they didn't get blessed.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.460
 Right.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.660
 And so later on some people said that may have been the reason that they crashed.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.260
 Yeah.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.760
 That's, do you think that's the reason they crashed?

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.260
 I'm only reporting what some people said.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.260
 I mean, that sounds tremendously convenient, the prevailing religious ethos of the time.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:58.760
 Oh yeah.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:05.960
 Because they blamed everything on religion, because obviously they lived in baffling times where they didn't understand much of what was happening to them.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:14.260
 So they were very keen in the Middle Ages to say it's not that we're, you know, tiny little creatures in a universe of which we have no comprehension.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
 It's that we didn't pray enough.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.360
 So there was something we could have done.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:18.960
 Yes.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:25.260
 And I think it probably made living in the Middle Ages a little bit more relaxing than it otherwise would have been.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.860
 Anyway, the white ship, yeah, thanks.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:35.660
 And the future king, Stephen, is probably equally uncomfortable, but in a way with fewer long term consequences to his survival.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.660
 Was he seen as someone who is, you know, useful?

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.560
 Did they look at him and go, OK, at least we've got someone who might be a good king?

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.960
 Or was he a sort of, well, dear with Stephen, just Stephen?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.660
 No, no, because Henry I, who they say after the white ship disaster, he never smiled again.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.860
 And I don't know how they know, but I'm not going to call them liars.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.660
 But he was very, very upset and he was upset in two ways.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.360
 His, obviously his beloved son was dead.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.060
 Lots of other people's beloved sons were dead.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:10.960
 But crucially, his plan for the succession of the English crown is in absolute ruins.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.260
 Because he's had lots of children, Henry I, but only two of them with his wife.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.960
 And the two with his wife are William Atherling, who drowns, and Matilda, who goes...

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.260
 Told dreadful lies, no.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:33.860
 She is the former wife of the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, as it wasn't then called.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.860
 But the Emperor would be the expression.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.960
 So she went around calling herself Empress Matilda with some justification.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.960
 And he quickly married someone else to try and get a new son going.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.360
 Because they didn't like the idea of women ruling then.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:55.760
 Totally fails to beget any children with his new wife, even though he's begat children all over the place.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.560
 And she begets a load after he's dead.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.560
 So I don't know, whatever.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.860
 His sperm and her eggs, they don't make a good team.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.260
 Probably because he's so desperately trying to beget an heir.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.660
 And it's just the whole begetting vibe is so unromantic, isn't it?

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.360
 So anyway, so he doesn't get any more legitimate children before he dies.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.060
 So he's stuck with only Matilda.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:25.560
 And he says, OK, well, the only way my bloodline can continue, which is the main thing.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:32.960
 So he makes everyone say, look, I know I've only got a daughter and everyone thinks women shouldn't be in charge of things,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.260
 because this is the past and it's sexist.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.660
 I'm quoting him directly.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.060
 But please come on so that my DNA can carry on.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:47.660
 Please say that she can be the next king, effectively ruler, queen, and everyone goes.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:55.960
 Your Majesty, of course, for you, anything and twice all of the big shots of the rain, all of the men.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.660
 They didn't ask the women, which perhaps a sign that this is a problematic strategy for the age.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.360
 But nevertheless, all of the men go, we absolutely as soon as you're dead, your Majesty,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.160
 she's in charge and will absolutely do everything she says like we did to you.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:16.860
 And they all swear, including Stephen of Blois and Henry goes to his grave thinking, maybe this will be OK.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.860
 But as soon as he dies, everyone's more thinking, well, you kind of a woman in charge.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:28.760
 That's either because they themselves think a woman couldn't be in charge or because they think, well, I'm quite woke.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.560
 I think it would be fine for a woman to be in charge, but other people won't accept it.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.160
 But yes, so then please, can Matilda be the next queen?

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.360
 Yes, of course, Your Majesty. He dies. No, she can't.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.960
 Stephen runs to London, gets himself crowned and he's King Stephen.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:52.160
 Well, the other thing is that Henry, the first death was also due to food poisoning, we think, right?

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:52.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:59.260
 So it's like a double food poisoning thing because he famously died of a surfeit of lampreys, I think.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
 That's what we're always taught in school.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:08.560
 But there's been a few recent studies, one by Matthew D. Turner in 2023, who reckons that he died of listeria,

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.960
 possibly from the lampreys or possibly from something else yet with the lampreys.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:19.060
 But also perhaps it would have made him confused just as he was about to die because that's what happens with this illness.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:24.360
 And there is a story that on his deathbed, he actually told some of these lords,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.960
 "Oh, no, Matilda, I've changed my mind. I don't think Matilda should be queen after all.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.460
 I think Stephen should be king."

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:36.160
 My feeling is that that's not so much the effect of the listeria,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:42.060
 the effect of those people who were in Stephen's camp lying about what the people said.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.060
 So that's also a...

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.060
 Who can say?

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.060
 Yeah.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.060
 But yeah, so I'd heard that it was, yes, it wasn't like surfeit of lampreys, rather unfair of him.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.260
 Right, if you could have had too fewer lampreys, you'd have been fine with it.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.860
 It's just that the lampreys he had, or as you say, something that went with them, the chips or something,

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.560
 that, yes, they'd been badly prepared.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.160
 Apparently, it's quite difficult to prepare lampreys in a way that doesn't kill you.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.960
 On this occasion, they hadn't bothered.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.560
 They're kind of like the blowfish of the day.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.460
 They can really do a number on you.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.760
 You never see them on menus anymore.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.460
 No, that's why it's so risky, yeah.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.360
 I went to a restaurant once that only did blowfish.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.460
 Oh, yeah? Only?

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:20.960
 Yeah.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.060
 Oh, thank you. Look at the menu.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.460
 It was in Osaka, I think, or somewhere like that.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.560
 And my wife wanted to try blowfish, and I had a bit of food poisoning, didn't really want it.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.260
 So we went to this place that sold blowfish, and the menu, it was like pictures on the menu.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.860
 And so we looked at them all, and it was like, blowfish, blowfish, blowfish, blowfish.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.660
 And then there was some chicken nuggets.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.260
 And I was like, oh, thank God, I'll have the chicken nuggets, you can have the blowfish.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.060
 And then we went in, they sat us down, we ordered our sake or whatever.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.860
 And I said, in English, hoping that they'd speak it, I said, I'll have the chicken.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.260
 And they said, oh, no, that's blowfish, no, that's...

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.060
 Oh, no, that's...

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.460
 And it was deep-fried blowfish, go-nuts.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.460
 Wow.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.460
 We left.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.860
 I'm not sure if I was going to eat blowfish, which I'm not.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.060
 I'm not sure I'd want to eat it in the sort of place where they show pictures of the food.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:18.460
 The ones where they show a photo almost to prove that they can cook at all and not learn.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.460
 A lot of the places, after they go for their Michelin star,

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.660
 they decide that the photos need to be excised.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:34.060
 Henry, King Henry, he has, I think, the most baroque afterlife of any English king I've read about.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.460
 I mean, so he dies in...

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.660
 He's in France, isn't he, at the Hunting Lodge, where he has the lampries and then dies.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:45.660
 And he instructed he be taken to Redding just before he died, because he'd found a nabby there.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.860
 He'd always wanted to go to Redding, haven't he?

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.060
 Loves the Spiscuits.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.060
 So it was near-ish Legoland, or the site of the future Legoland.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.060
 So he wanted to...

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.660
 He'd found it a big abbey in Redding, so he thought, "Right, I'll go there."

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.060
 But he was taken to Ruin, his body.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.060
 So after he dies, he was taken to Ruin and embalmed there.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:10.060
 But not all of him, because his heart, his bowels, his brains, his eyes, and his tongue were removed

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:15.060
 and buried in Normandy at a different monastery, or abbey, or whatever it was.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.060
 And then he was embalmed and he was rubbed with salt,

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.060
 put in a bag made of ox hides for the journey.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.060
 So he'll hopefully get to Redding in a decent state.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.060
 I mean, he's removed his heart, his eyes, whatever.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.060
 I mean, he's not going to look lovely.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.060
 No, no. Well, he's in a bag, so that's fine.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.060
 He's in a bag made of ox hides.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.060
 Don't open the bag.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.060
 They get to the coast.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:43.060
 They get to the coast and the boat is then delayed by four weeks due to bad weather.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.060
 And everyone's looking at the bag and thinking, "Oh, no."

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:49.060
 And the bag, I think, starts to leak and sort of very pungent.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.060
 Body juice, I've heard about this.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.060
 Very, very pungent stuff.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.060
 There is, I think, a story.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:59.060
 I think it says about him that the man who was ordered to remove his brain,

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:03.060
 there was such a bad aroma about the brain, because of how he died,

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.060
 that the man ordered to remove the brain also died.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.060
 Of smell.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.060
 Of smell.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.060
 Of brain smell.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.060
 Died of smell.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.060
 I read that.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.060
 That was forty years later.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.060
 They associate it.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.060
 Under the carrot jacks.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.060
 Yeah, but it was definitely that smell.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.060
 It was never the same again.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.060
 Yeah.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.060
 So, I mean, what an after life.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.060
 What a shame that the Elizabeth line wasn't named after him,

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.060
 because that terminates in Reading.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.060
 That would have been a beautiful tribute.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.060
 And it's subterranean as well.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.060
 So maybe it literally comes up against his skull.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.060
 Yeah.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.060
 And that's used to save money, keep it under 50 billion.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:48.060
 And to use some of the heft of former King Henry to slow the trains down.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.060
 Oxide buffers, yeah.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.060
 Yeah.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:54.060
 What I should say, though, the consequence of Stephen's food poisoning,

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.060
 and then him being declared king, and then him being not very good at being king,

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:04.060
 and Matilda, Henry's daughter, being extremely pissed off to have been passed over,

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.060
 is that she doesn't take it lying down.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:11.060
 And she tries with all her might to rest the throne from Stephen.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.060
 There is a huge civil war called the Anarchy,

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.060
 in a way that historians now say shouldn't be called the Anarchy,

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.060
 because that in some way reduces it.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:25.060
 What you should just do is spend thousands and thousands of words describing it

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.060
 minutely rather than giving it a label.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.060
 But these are obviously historians are not familiar with the concept of language.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.060
 But anyway, I'm going to call it the Anarchy.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.060
 It does sound quite an anarchic, like an 18-year civil war.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.060
 It was quite anarchic.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.060
 Yes, but also equally, you could take a little bit of it.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.060
 It was quite calm, awful at night time, for example.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.060
 So it's very, very reductive of you to use that word.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:50.060
 So, you know, for example, I think it's very bad to call an apple an apple,

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.060
 but you want it to print out of every individual cell.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.060
 And that's actually a better way of describing it.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.060
 Anyway, this Anarchy happened and was awful.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.060
 And Matilda nearly got to be the queen.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.060
 At one point she was about to be crowned,

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.060
 but then the people in London got cross and she had to run away.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.060
 And then at another point she was under siege in Oxford Castle

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.060
 and she ran away through the snow.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.060
 It's quite exciting.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.060
 But eventually she gave up and went back to Normandy,

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.060
 which by then her husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, had rested from Stephen.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:27.060
 But then her son does inherit the throne because Stephen's regime essentially peters out.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.060
 So they do a deal.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.060
 Matilda's son, Henry, becomes Henry II.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.060
 Plantagenet, named after his father, Geoffrey.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:38.060
 And then you have quite an ordered succession for quite a long time.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.060
 It's all in the first four, you know, the rhyme of all the kings and queens of England.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.060
 It's Willy, Willy, Harry, Stee.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.060
 This is all the Harry Stee bit.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.060
 Just that bit, which is Harry Stee.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.060
 I was just jumping a few Henrys ahead, Henry VIII.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:57.060
 I was looking up food because I thought her royal meals sounded a bit odd.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:02.060
 And I discovered that he used to serve this meal called cockentrice or cockentries.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.060
 Have you heard of this?

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.060
 No.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:09.060
 So it was a pig sewn to another animal and he pitched it as a mythical beast.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.060
 And he would say this is a mythical beast ring.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.060
 Most like the wings of a bird, is it?

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.060
 I think it became in a few different permutations.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.060
 I think it always usually had a pig on the front.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.060
 It's a chicken, but with the testicles of a blowfish.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:27.060
 Yeah, so I just love that.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.060
 Henry VIII would just present, you know, what was effectively the old version of a yeti.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.060
 At the table.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.060
 So he would say, not only have I discovered a mythical beast, I've killed it.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.060
 And we know what it is.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.060
 And it's the last one, sadly.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.060
 But there it is.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.060
 You look at it now and then what do you fancy?

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.060
 A bit of wings.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.060
 And they're like, oh, it tastes a bit like chicken.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.060
 It's weird how everything tastes a bit like chicken.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.060
 My bit tastes like pork.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:54.060
 Well, that's the thing about the cockentrice.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.060
 It's so full of flavours.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.060
 The bottom's got chocolate in it.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:10.060
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:15.060
 My fact is that sea turtles have been going to the same restaurant for 3,000 years.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.060
 Blowfish served?

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.060
 Yeah, it's only blowfish.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.060
 Yeah, that's nice.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.060
 You find a thing you like.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.060
 Yeah, just eat that forever.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.060
 Yeah, exactly.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.060
 So this is about green sea turtles.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.060
 A new study from the universities of Groningen, Exeter, York, Copenhagen,

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.060
 and the Society for the Protection of Turtles.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.060
 They've all teamed up.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.060
 So they're quite pro-turtles.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.060
 Very pro-turtles.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.060
 Society for the eradication of turtles.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.060
 Didn't get a look at it.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.060
 Absolutely not.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.060
 That's quite-- I'm not sure if that's appropriate balance.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:45.060
 If this was on the BBC, you'd have to have one person on the show going,

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.060
 "I fucking hate turtles."

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.060
 So they're a right paint, easy to flip.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:54.060
 People, you know, Americans use the same words they do for tortoises.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.060
 I mean, it's just confusing.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.060
 Let's just have one.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.060
 We don't need the aquatic version of those shell people.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.060
 I've been trying to book a table at that restaurant for months now.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:08.060
 Always by the window, party of eight turtles.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.060
 Restaurant is such a way of putting it.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.060
 But basically, it's a huge meadow of seagrass off North Africa.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.060
 And sea turtles go there to eat.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.060
 They spend the first few years of their life drifting around

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:24.060
 because they don't have the control to swim and live in these meadows.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.060
 And then when they do get the control, they head to the meadows.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.060
 They swim miles and miles and miles to get there.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.060
 And they've used archaeology and ancient samples to work out

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:38.060
 these are the same habitats in use that sea turtles 3,000 years ago have been heading to.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.060
 And it's just amazing.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.060
 And the meadows all have their own chemical signatures,

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.060
 which end up in the bodies of the sea turtles.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.060
 Because they're kind of made of these meadows.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:51.060
 So yeah, sometimes turtles will visit the same 50 meters squared.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.060
 Oh, wow.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:57.060
 It's like having a table in a particular meadow that they return to.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.060
 It's pretty amazing.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.060
 Sea turtles, you know, conservationists have always been trying to monitor

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.060
 if they're declining, you know, what's going on.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.060
 And 2023, there was an amazing count that happened.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.060
 Volunteers went around.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.060
 They found 74,000 nests bit over that.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.060
 But there's a huge problem that's happening, which is that the sex, the gender,

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.060
 is determined by the climate.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.060
 And as it's getting hotter, they tend to be born as female.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.060
 And so we're slowly losing all male sea turtles.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.060
 There's a genuine worry that we're going to just...

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.060
 We've got all these women now and no men to sort of...

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.060
 And you need enough diversity in the population to...

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.060
 Yeah.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.060
 It is a big problem.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.060
 It's to do with the temperature of the sand, I think.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.060
 So if the eggs are laid in sand that's above 31, then they're all female.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.060
 You know, 31 Celsius.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.060
 And if it's below 27, they're all male.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:49.060
 And the species relies on the sand being a range of temperatures in between the...

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.060
 Yeah.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.060
 And historically it's been, well, it'll be colder years and hotter years,

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.060
 so it'll get a reasonable number of both.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.060
 Yeah.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.060
 That's the problem.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.060
 Yeah.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.060
 So no, it is a huge problem.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:04.060
 So we're hoping for an hour, maybe if you get above like 32, it goes male again.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.060
 So actually now we'd be rooting for further global warming

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.060
 in order to push through to the really...

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:17.060
 The hot guys, let's call them, that come to start coming through again.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.060
 Well, the other problem is that the seagrass meadows are also hugely under threat.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.060
 So just everyone in every...

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.060
 Like lots of sea turtles.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.060
 Some sea turtles are doing all right.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.060
 There is, I think, seven different species of sea turtle.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.060
 And I think several are endangered.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.060
 But a couple are doing okay, but several are endangered.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.060
 And the meadows, lots of them are off North Africa,

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.060
 where there isn't much environmental protection.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:40.060
 And lots of the countries nearest are undergoing quite chaotic times at the moment.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.060
 And so, yeah, there is a risk that...

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.060
 Apparently we lose a football pitch's worth of seagrass every 30 minutes.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.060
 Jesus.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.060
 Every 30 minutes?

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.060
 Yeah.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.060
 I have to say though, whatever's mowing that seagrass, we want to use that on land,

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.060
 because that's really quick.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.060
 I think it takes more than half an hour to cut the grass on a football pitch.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.060
 And this is just literally the use of...

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.060
 I mean, using global warming as a force for gardening.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.060
 Yeah.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.060
 Hot turtles, better gardening.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.060
 Yeah.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.060
 What is this?

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.060
 I kind of like climate change now.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.060
 I am not.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.060
 I'm in favor of climate change.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:21.060
 Because the seagrass buries carbon 35 times faster than a tropical rainforest.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.060
 Another fact that I read.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.060
 It's amazing.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.060
 Yeah, because they just...

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.060
 Seagrass, they take carbon from the water to build their leaves.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.060
 The leaves eventually die.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.060
 That sediment stays on the ocean floor for hundreds of years.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.060
 And so that's how they sequester.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.060
 So that's essentially carbon capture.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.060
 It's captured in the silt at the bottom.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.060
 Yeah, it's really functional carbon capture.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:46.060
 And I think 10% of the carbon in the ocean is buried by seagrasses or sequestered by seagrasses,

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:49.060
 despite them being 0.1% of the ocean floor.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.060
 So it's really impressive stuff.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.060
 Yeah, we need loads more of it.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.060
 Can we plant it?

00:26:54.060 --> 00:27:00.060
 There are a few plans to plant 18 hectares around the UK by 2026, which is not...

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.060
 It doesn't sound like that.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:05.060
 I don't know how many hectares in a football pitch, but it sounds like a few hours.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.060
 And that's done no good at all.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.060
 It's not... Yes, I think there might be more like pilot schemes,

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.060
 but they are trying to get more going.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.060
 And of course, if you protect bits of seafloor, then...

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.060
 Do the turtles, Andy?

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.060
 Did they eat seagrass?

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.060
 They eat the tips of it.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.060
 I think that stimulates growth.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.060
 Okay, so there's no cause to eradicate the turtles.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.060
 Your anti-turtle society is just not going to be a thing.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.060
 Let's just check.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.060
 We've just got to be open-minded.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.060
 Maybe the turtles are the villains of the piece.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.060
 David, we're blaming ourselves for all our factories,

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:38.060
 but maybe those turtles are cleverer than they look.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.060
 David's wearing a T-shirt, which is saying, "Stop sea turtles."

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.060
 It's really upsetting.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.060
 Outside of seagrass, they're quite fussy eaters, sea turtles.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.060
 They're given a bigger menu to play with.

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.060
 So one of the other problems of the climate at the moment

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.060
 is sometimes they're going off course, they're going into colder oceans,

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.060
 and they get hypothermia.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.060
 So there's a lot of turtles that wash up onto shore,

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:06.060
 and either they're dead or they get rescued and taken to turtle hospital,

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.060
 where they then get this brilliant menu of different things.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.060
 And so each individual turtle has just a different kind of taste.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.060
 Like number seven doesn't like the squid, for example.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.060
 A few of them don't like tails.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:21.060
 Don't give them any fishy tails or anything like that.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.060
 Yeah, and also it's creating chaos because turtles are very solitary,

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.060
 but they're in tanks together to be fed.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.060
 And so there's turtle bullies that they have to sort of reprimand and tell off and so on,

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.060
 because they're eating the tails and so on.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:39.060
 You can give turtles, if they're not very well, you can give them mayonnaise to eat.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.060
 Did you see this?

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:45.060
 So this is if there's been an oil spill, and the turtles have eaten a lot of oil.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.060
 If you give them mayonnaise, it helps them to shit it out.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:54.060
 And the reason is because obviously mayonnaise, it's oil and whatever it is.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.060
 Eggs?

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.060
 Yeah, it's an emulsion.

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.060
 We're revealing our ignorance here, aren't we?

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.060
 And it's a really base food stuff as well, it's not complicated.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.060
 This is an off menu, we don't need to know anything about food.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.060
 It comes out of a jar, let's be honest.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.060
 Yeah, but it has an emulsifier in it, which mixes water and oil.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:16.060
 So if you've got oil inside you, the emulsifier inside mayonnaise

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:21.060
 can help the oil to mix with the water already inside the stomach of the turtle

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.060
 and then just makes it easier to excrete.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.060
 That is so interesting.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.060
 That's amazing.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:32.060
 Yeah, so all these oil slicks are basically, they're just a conspiracy by Big Mayo.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:37.060
 That causes massive spikes in the helman's share price.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:43.060
 Whenever BP has a little mistake, they're suddenly coaching.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.060
 I've got a link to the previous fact weirdly.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.060
 Oh yeah, to David's fact, his headline fact.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:54.060
 So seagrasses stop people getting gastroenteritis.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.060
 Oh.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.060
 Isn't that good?

00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:00.060
 So if you have gastroenteritis because you've drunk some water normally,

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.060
 which has the pathogens in it, which cause it.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:07.060
 Seagrass mayors have way, way, way fewer of those pathogens in and around and among them.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:09.060
 So that water is just cleaner.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.060
 You're less likely to get gastroenteritis from there.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.060
 And they've tried to calculate it.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:19.060
 Between 8 and 24 million cases of gastroenteritis prevented every year.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.060
 Wow.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:25.060
 And I think it's because the seagrass kind of uses it almost like a fertilizer and takes it into its body.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.060
 Exactly.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.060
 It takes the gastroenteritis pathogens out of water.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.060
 Yeah.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.060
 But can it grow in non-salty water?

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.060
 Almost none of it.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.060
 No.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.060
 No, I think there's a bit of it.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.060
 There's only one fresh water.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:42.060
 No, there's a problem there in terms of how useful it is.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:47.060
 Well, if you only drink seawater like me, it's actually fine for you.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.060
 It's still sparkling or salty, I think.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.060
 I've just worked out a mnemonic.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.060
 So how many cases did I say prevented every year?

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.060
 Little quiz, instant recall quiz.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.060
 How many million cases?

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.060
 I think it was a football picture.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.060
 It was between 8 and 24 million cases.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.060
 Okay, all right.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:13.060
 Now, if you need a mnemonic to remember that, those are the ages of Matilda and the Holy Roman Emperor when they were betrothed to each other.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.060
 And if you need a mnemonic the other way around, you're like, how was Matilda?

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:21.060
 It was like, oh, what's the lower range of cases of gastroenteritis prevented each year by seagrasses?

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.060
 Beautiful.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.060
 You're welcome, guys.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:29.060
 So 8 and 24 when they were betrothed, but 12 and 28 when they were married, so not that.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.060
 No, not that.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:36.060
 That would be to massively overstate the beneficial effect of seagrass on gastroenteritis.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.060
 I have a thing which I want to link back to the previous fact as well.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.060
 So we have a mystery butcher of the previous fact.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:47.060
 I found a mystery turtle that I don't know much more about, that I want to find out about.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:52.060
 And it's the first turtle to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel and survive.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:32:01.060
 So I'm now plunging out an image of people glumly looking at a huge pile of dead turtles at the bottom of Niagara Falls.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:06.060
 And go, I don't know, maybe try taping an X under the inside of the barrel.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:13.060
 So this was 1930. There was a guy called George Stathakus, and he had this idea of going over Niagara in a barrel.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.060
 And the barrel goes down.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:20.060
 It doesn't break up, but it gets caught in a sort of a tide that's underneath.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.060
 I don't know what you'd call it, but it's, he can't escape.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.060
 And he's there for 18 hours in this barrel.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.060
 So when they find him, he's suffocated.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.060
 He's dead.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.060
 And Sonny is, oh, sorry.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.060
 Yeah, there's a dead man in the story.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.060
 Do we suspect the turtle in this story?

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.060
 Oh, I haven't thought about it.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:38.060
 Only one of us could survive this.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:43.060
 Well, the turtle might have been feeling quite negatively towards him, to be honest.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:48.060
 This guy, you know, I'm not, I wouldn't blame the turtle for not giving him a mouth to mouth.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:52.060
 This is the guy that's, what are we doing now, sir?

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.060
 A hundred years old as well.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.060
 Exactly.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.060
 That's a very old turtle.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.060
 It's a really old turtle.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.060
 And the barrel is in a museum now.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.060
 It's held as a kind of piece of Niagara Falls history.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.060
 Right.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.060
 But where did Sonny go?

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.060
 I don't know where he went.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.060
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:58.060
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1861, there was one street musician for every ten streets in London.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.060
 What a time to be alive.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.060
 What a time.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.060
 Noisy, noisy time.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.060
 Sounds like it was a bit of a bad time for quite a lot of Londoners.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:12.060
 Yeah, so this is according to journalist Henry Mayhew, whose article admittedly was relatively

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:16.060
 negative towards the street musicians, but he estimated there are approximately a thousand

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.060
 street musicians, 10,500 streets.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.060
 Okay.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.060
 And it was a real problem.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:24.060
 We've said before, I think that Babbage really hated them.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:29.060
 He really got frustrated with them, and he was actually him and the guy called Michael Bass,

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.060
 who ran the Bass Brewery.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:38.060
 They managed to get it regulated in 1864, but for probably the decade up until 1864, London

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.060
 was just an unbelievably loud place to live, largely thanks to these.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.060
 Yeah.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:46.060
 What was their, what genre of music did they favour?

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:47.060
 Oh, it was all sorts.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:53.060
 So Mayhew said there were English violinists, Scottish pipers, German brass bandsmen, Italian

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.060
 grinders.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.060
 So that's be like a...

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.060
 Organs.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.060
 All grinding, yeah.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.060
 And one French hurdy-gurdy player.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.060
 One out of all the thousand.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.060
 Yeah.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.060
 Here he comes.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.060
 It was a she and the women.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.060
 Oh, sorry.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.060
 I'm sorry.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.060
 That's my prejudice though.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:18.060
 She had an instrument that, according to Mayhew, had a battered, heavy look about it and was

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.060
 grievously harsh and out of tune.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.060
 And for 43 years, she had her regular rounds.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.060
 43?

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:29.060
 Yeah, so she went to Marleybone on a Monday, Kentish Town on a Tuesday.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.060
 So you knew how to avoid it.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.060
 Yeah, exactly.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.060
 I saw a hurdy-gurdy player recently.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:41.060
 I was in Canterbury, and it was a very hurdy-gurdy, it was the very old, old, old bit of Canterbury.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.060
 The cathedral.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.060
 So you think he was a ghost?

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.060
 I don't think he was a ghost.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.060
 No, he ran through a wall as soon as I started asking him questions, but he wasn't a ghost.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.060
 Can you remind me what...

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:55.060
 There's a handle you wind, and he was doing something with his other hand as well.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.060
 And it looks like a small violin with a handle.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.060
 Oh, okay.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.060
 How interesting.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.060
 This is a really bad instrument.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.060
 Is it a stringed instrument?

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.060
 It is stringed.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.060
 Okay, so the fingers are kind of on the frets, like a guitar.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.060
 This is sounding like the car that Homer Simpson designed.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:16.060
 It has some strings, but also a handle, a little keyboard on the bottom, and then you blow in the end.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:20.060
 I can't remember whether there were strings and frets or whether there were keys to play it.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:24.060
 I think it might have been keys and a handle, but it was a very much a combo thing.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.060
 Yeah, that's great.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.060
 I only know it as like a comedy word, really.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.060
 I know, I was staggered.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.060
 That's why I said, "What's that?" to this guy, and he just went, "Woo-hoo!"

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.060
 That's weird.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.060
 That was the hurdy-gurdy making the noise, isn't it?

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:42.060
 There was one other person, just while we're on it, described by Mayhew, who was an Italian fiddler

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:48.060
 who would go around imitating all the farmyard animals with his fiddle.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:58.060
 He said he'd been doing it for 12 years, and he could imitate the bull, the calf, the dog, the cock, the peacock, the ass, and the hen when she's laid an egg.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.060
 That's amazing.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.060
 Do all that with his fiddle.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.060
 But what he couldn't do is play a tune.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:08.060
 What he found is that if you just bash at a fiddle, it makes this.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:14.060
 That is exactly the noise a hen makes, and it's just later, you might not be familiar with that, you live in central London.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:18.060
 But if you head out to the countryside and listen to it, it's exactly like that.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.060
 So isn't that, that's worth a pop or two, isn't it?

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:27.060
 How come there was money to support the, why were, people must have been paying for it.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:32.060
 Yeah, but it was like just pennies here and there, but they were doing it day in, day out.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:40.060
 And these people, they had their regulars, so they would go to Miley Bono, to Kensington, because they knew there was someone there who would give them, you know, a few hapenies here and there.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.060
 And that's all they needed to live, really.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.060
 Nice.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.060
 So these, like, grinders, as they were called.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:54.060
 And the particular thing that people got annoyed by was people with barrel organs, because there was a bit of racism in it, because they were mostly from Italy and quite poor.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:58.060
 And the other thing that annoyed people was, you just turn a handle.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.060
 There's no skill involved here.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.060
 There's no skill.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.060
 You buy a...

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.060
 The skill of making a violin sound like a screech out.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.060
 Like a goat.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.060
 Yeah.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.060
 That's been surprised, but not badly.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.060
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:12.060
 But, so, like, you just buy a barrel, slot it into the organ, turn the handle.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.060
 The same tunes come out every time.

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.060
 So it's like, that was a frustrating thing for a lot of people.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:23.060
 So Charles Dickens, his illustrator, called John Leitch, claimed that he died early, because he...

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.060
 He climbed.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.060
 You saw him be cut to me, didn't you, Andy?

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.060
 Yeah.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:31.060
 He said, "This is killing me," and then he died, and he said, "It's because of this."

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.060
 Yeah.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:40.060
 His final words to fellow artist William Frith were, "Rather Frith to be tormented in this way, I would prefer to go to the grave where there is no noise."

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.060
 There we go.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.060
 Where are we going?

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.060
 Oh, he really caught on his nerves.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:48.060
 They buried him under the bandstand at Captain Commonside.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:53.060
 I was looking into what was going on in 1861, London, at the time.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.060
 Just curious.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:58.060
 No, as in, I've got the answer, the invention of the toast sandwich.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:04.060
 Because Mrs. Beaton's book of household management was first published in 1861, and one of the recipes in there was toast sandwich.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.060
 Get two bits of bread, put your bit of toast inside.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.060
 I've eaten that, actually.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.060
 I tried it.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.060
 Have you?

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.060
 Well, we did mention it on QI once, and I thought I'd see what it's like.

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.060
 Yeah.

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:19.060
 And it's not as bad as you might think, I would say, because it gives you a little bit of texture to what otherwise is quite a boring piece of bread.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.060
 So, it's bread toast bread.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.060
 Yeah.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.060
 Well, people put crisps in sandwiches, don't they, for a bit of crunch.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.060
 Yeah.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.060
 But there's usually something else.

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.060
 Yeah.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.060
 Although, I think, actually, a sandwich of just butter and crisps.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.060
 I mean, flavor of choice.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.060
 I mean, I'm ready-salted all the way.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.060
 Oh, ready-salted.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.060
 I think that's probably right with that combo, I think.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.060
 Yeah, something vinegar wouldn't quite...

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.060
 It's a lot more about texture than taste.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.060
 But you still think you might have a little bit of something else.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.060
 Yeah.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.060
 I think there was butter on it, in Mrs. Beaton's version, wasn't it?

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.060
 Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.060
 So, that was invented in...

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:54.060
 That was, well, the book was published, and that was a very notable, very odd bit of recipe.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.060
 Yes, huge.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.060
 Black velvet.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:01.060
 You might have seen people walking around the streets, 1861, drinking black velvet.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.060
 Oh.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.060
 Now, this is a Guinness with a glass of champagne.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.060
 That's right.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.060
 And that's from then.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.060
 Yes, to commemorate a very big death of 1861.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.060
 Albert?

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.060
 That's right.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.060
 Albert died December 1861.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.060
 He invented a cocktail.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.060
 Just before.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.060
 No, no, no.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.060
 He said, "This cocktail's going to kill me."

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.060
 And then he died.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.060
 And then he said, "I told you."

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.060
 Can you think why they might have invented the cocktail?

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:27.060
 What?

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:30.060
 I mean, to try and monetise it, in general.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.060
 You know, is it black for a morning?

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.060
 Yep.

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.060
 So, and then champagne for a royal celebration.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:39.060
 So, the Guinness would sit like a black band, like mourners were hanging around their arms.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.060
 The idea was, it was a, it's like getting a top on your beer.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.060
 Is that a lager top?

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.060
 Is that what, which, what is a lager top?

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.060
 It's a normal pint of lager, but they pour out the tiniest bit of the top,

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.060
 and they give you a little dash of lemonade just to take the edge off.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.060
 So, it's like a very, very strong chandelier.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.060
 Yes, exactly.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:58.060
 You know, when you're shandy, it's become a lager top.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:02.060
 You know, you're just telling yourself, "That's just beer, mate."

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:07.060
 And particularly when you say, "Instead of the beer, use whiskey."

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.060
 Just two more things, because it's quite fun to know.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:16.060
 It was the publication of Great Expectations, so Dickens obviously had been printing the stories in serials,

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.060
 but it was the first full book bringing the chapters together.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:25.060
 And then the last one that I found was, it was the introduction of Widow Twenky into pantomime.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.060
 Oh, wow.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.060
 Yeah, 1861, the first ever pantomime.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.060
 It sounds like a good time to be alive.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.060
 Hello, that's great.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.060
 It's great.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:35.060
 Have you guys heard, just on people being loud and other people being annoyed about that,

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:39.060
 have you heard of the New York Society for the Suppression of Unnecessary Noise?

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.060
 No.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.060
 This is my kind of organisation, basically.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.060
 And yet you said David Mitchell is not very American.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:50.060
 So this was a doctor called Julia Barnett Rice, okay.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:54.060
 She was, she qualified in 1885, got a medical degree but didn't practice.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:59.060
 I think, I don't know if women were allowed to practice in the 1880s, '90s, I'm not sure.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:04.060
 But she really wanted that street vendors not be allowed to shout.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:07.060
 And she, like, she made it her life's course.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.060
 And she and her husband, he was called Isaac Rice.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.060
 He was an interesting guy in various ways.

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:15.060
 He invented a chess opening that was called the Rice Gambit, just so you know.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:19.060
 And then spent about, apparently, the next 20 years of his life,

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:22.060
 researching, analysing and testing the soundness of his gambit.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:25.060
 So what a thing to spend your life doing.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.060
 But the thing is that I've never heard of that and I followed chess a little bit.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.060
 So presumably it wasn't very useful after all those 20 years.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.060
 No, he got to the end of the 20 years, like, "Oh, it's not allowed to move that way."

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:40.060
 Oh, cancel that.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:47.060
 I have never in my life met a bishop that could only move diagonally.

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:53.060
 It's just not realistic, whereas castles can't move at all without an earthquake.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:58.060
 And they just, they had a house on Broadway, way too noisy.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:02.060
 So they moved up to by the river, right, on Riverside Drive.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.060
 They built their own house.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:06.060
 They had a basement vault dug so that they could have somewhere quiet.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:09.060
 Partly because they had six children, so the house was quite noisy.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.060
 So he stayed in the basement a lot of the time, doing his gambit.

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:20.060
 That's actually what the Rice Gambit is.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:25.060
 Because they were by the river, the riverboats made so much noise blowing their horns all day.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:29.060
 So she, Julia, she hired students to count the number of toots per day.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.060
 And it was about a thousand toots per day, but if it was foggy, it was 3,000.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:36.060
 So she started a campaign saying, "Look, this is very bad for people's health."

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:40.060
 And it was mostly because she didn't like it, as far as I can tell.

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.060
 But the tugboat captains found out about this campaign of hers,

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:47.060
 and they found out where she lived, and they would gather outside on the river at night

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.060
 and all blast their horns.

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:52.060
 But she genuinely got the law changed, and she got Mark Twain involved.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.060
 - Wow. - And she established quiet zones around hospitals.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.060
 How many boats sank then?

00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:00.060
 Like shipwrecks.

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.060
 Very quiet ones, that was the key.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.060
 Yeah, that's amazing. Another person who hated it was Thomas Carlisle,

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:11.060
 just to go back to the 1850s in London, and the 1850s and 1860s in London.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:16.060
 He once wrote that he was considering to assassinate a vile Italian organ grinder

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.060
 who worked near his house.

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.060
 But I think he might have built the first ever soundproof room

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.060
 in his house in London. This was in 1853.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:28.060
 It had double walls, and it had a slated roof with a gap in between

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:33.060
 where he could get, like, muffling chambers full of air so that the sound couldn't get in.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:37.060
 And it cost him £170, which, according to one online calculator,

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.060
 I found, said it was about £30,000 today. It cost him.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.060
 For a house extension, that's, you know...

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.060
 Yeah, in those days, I think, yeah.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:50.060
 Why didn't they pay the annoying organ grinder to go away?

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.060
 Oh, I think you could do that.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:54.060
 But I think that is how they earned quite a bit of their money,

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.060
 just extorting it from people.

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.060
 That must be a glam profession, though.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.060
 You know, ostensibly, you're there to, you know,

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:05.060
 they're here to entertain with our violin. It sounds like a cow.

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:09.060
 The real money is for people who desperately want you to go.

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.060
 It would be if we went doing live shows like we do,

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:16.060
 and we got on stage and everyone had done a whip round for us not to do the show.

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.060
 I'm going to give you one last set of buskers. This is in 2009 in Birmingham.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.060
 Two buskers who only knew two songs and had been playing them

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:27.060
 in the same part of Birmingham for 18 months on end were given Aspose.

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.060
 And they were... They knew Wonderwall and...

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.060
 That's the worst review.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:35.060
 Five-star, four-star, three-star, three-star, one-star,

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:38.060
 and then there is Aspose.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.060
 It was Wonderwall and Faith.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.060
 They had a guitar and they had a bin lid.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.060
 And, yeah, but they would play it to, like, four or five or six in the morning sometimes.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:50.060
 One person said, "To be fair, they didn't do a bad rendition of the songs."

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.060
 So that's...

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:56.060
 If you lived in the area, that would become the main version of the song to you.

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.060
 And then you'd listen to Oasis doing it and go,

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.060
 "No, they've got that bit wrong."

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.060
 There's a few classic London ones I think most tourists will probably remember

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.060
 if they've got the tube, like the Henry the Hoover.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.060
 What is that person that Henry the Hoover calls people?

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:13.060
 I think next to it on a keyboard, but then he had accompanied by this Henry the Hoover

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:17.060
 that had the saxophone that would shoot bubbles outside it, yeah.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:19.060
 So sorry, it's the... Where's the saxophone?

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.060
 In the nozzle, I guess?

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.060
 Of the Hoover?

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.060
 Yeah, it sucks.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.060
 But wait, the far end of the nozzle, like the bit that does the hoovering,

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.060
 or is it right... Have you removed the Hoover's trunk?

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.060
 I can't believe how...

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.060
 And you've drowned the saxophone into that.

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:34.060
 Quickly, what I thought was a solid image in my head is collapsed.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:35.060
 It sounds great.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.060
 I just made that up there.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.060
 I just want a bit of doctrinal reasoning.

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.060
 Does it suck saxophones?

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:42.060
 Does it make the same noise as if you blow a saxophone?

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.060
 Wow, great question.

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.060
 I don't know, I might do.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.060
 I don't know, I might do.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.060
 Stuming, no.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.060
 You would think that, wouldn't you, mate?

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.060
 Yeah.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.060
 Because you're sucking it into the...

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.060
 Is it the horn, the mouth of the saxophone?

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.060
 The bell end, actually.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.060
 Is it called the bell end?

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.060
 Yeah, yeah.

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:59.060
 Okay, so it presumably will make the opposite noise.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.060
 Does it always have an opposite?

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:04.060
 Well, we know it's quite theological.

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:07.060
 What's the opposite noise to February?

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:08.060
 Yeah, mate.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.060
 I mean...

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.060
 No, I like this.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.060
 Yeah.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.060
 I like the big...

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.060
 We're finally getting to the big question.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.060
 That's 500 eps in, finally.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.060
 Does the noise have an opposite?

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.060
 It doesn't always have an opposite.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.060
 You can have an opposite wave function.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.060
 Well, they can do things, can't they?

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.060
 Sometimes when, if there's a noise of air conditioning when you're recording something,

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:31.060
 they can record that and in some way invert it and then...

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.060
 So it sucks that noise out.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.060
 So if you're a hybun, you know what the opposite of the word February is.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.060
 Yeah.

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.060
 Send it in.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.060
 It's the noise that you would play over the word February in order to induce silence.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:49.060
 And all these irritable Victorians needed was to have that on their own barrel.

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:52.060
 And turn the handle, and it would go quiet.

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.060
 That would be amazing.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:54.060
 The opposite of Wonderwall.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.060
 Yeah.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:48:03.060
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:04.060
 And that is my fact.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:09.060
 My fact is that in 1993, a man in Brazil who robbed a factory of its glue

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.060
 was arrested 36 hours later, still in the factory he was robbing,

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:16.060
 because he was stuck to the glue he was stealing.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:19.060
 Didn't he think to steal the glue in its containers?

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.060
 I think what happened?

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:22.060
 So this is a guy called Edelberg.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.060
 He was just putting it in his pockets.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.060
 I'll just take the glue loose.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:29.060
 It's so heavy, these cans.

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.060
 The police will be looking for tubes of glue.

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.060
 They won't be looking for raw glue.

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.060
 It was a 19-year-old.

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:39.060
 He was called Edelberg Guamárez.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.060
 We don't have to name him.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:45.060
 It's the opposite of that noise.

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:49.060
 I actually think he was probably called Edelberto, because I Googled it.

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.060
 I can't find anyone else called Edelberg, but there's a lot of people called Edelberto,

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.060
 where it runs over two lines and there's a hyphen.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.060
 That's interesting.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.060
 So I saw the story in the Washington Post.

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:03.060
 It was part of a yearly roundup, and it was a 19-year-old.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:07.060
 He did take two large cans, and since something must have happened,

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.060
 they tipped over as he was trying to get out of the factory.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:11.060
 Glue spilled everywhere.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.060
 He obviously tried to pick up the glue and put it back in.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:15.060
 I don't know.

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.060
 He then got stuck to where he was.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.060
 It is very easy.

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.060
 I had to do a minor glue job the other day,

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:23.060
 and the amount of glue on my hands at the end of it was...

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.060
 When you say glue job, is that like a bank job?

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.060
 Were you also stealing glue?

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.060
 Yeah, it's very easy, even with a small...

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.060
 Does it dry that quickly?

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.060
 Oh, God, it dries so fast.

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.060
 Oh, really?

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.060
 Sorry, this is now my...

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:39.060
 Glue is very, very annoying, because it either doesn't work,

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.060
 like, you know, essentially, Pritz-stick.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.060
 There are other brands of glue that don't work.

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.060
 They sort of go in that...

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:49.060
 OK, it sort of sticks it a bit, but, you know, so does Snot.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:53.060
 Or it's just so incredibly effective, and you can't be angry with it, can you?

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:58.060
 Because, you know, yes, it's doing exactly what Snot wanted it to stick together,

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.060
 and, yeah, I didn't say my fingers.

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:04.060
 But, yes, I did apply my two fingers to each other while there was glue on one,

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:08.060
 and now, you know, but it's like the glue is being facetious.

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:11.060
 You know I didn't want to stick my fingers whenever

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.060
 as anyone wanted to stick their fingers together.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.060
 Yeah, I didn't...

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.060
 It was through researching this fact that I didn't realise

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:21.060
 how important super glue is to the world of live music.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:22.060
 Oh.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:25.060
 For live shows, so take a band like the Red Hot Chili Peppers,

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.060
 flea on the bass, very aggressive with his playing,

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:31.060
 slapping and popping and all sorts, and he'll get huge calluses during the gig.

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:34.060
 And sometimes, with old wounds that he's got, they'll be ripped open.

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.060
 So he's got missing bits of his hand.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.060
 So he'll run off stage, grab super glue, fill in the hole.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.060
 Oh, no.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:41.060
 Yeah, yeah, and come back on, John Froschanti does it,

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.060
 the guitarist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stevie Ray Vaughan does it.

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.060
 There's so many musicians that talk about...

00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:49.060
 They've got to give it a minute, or they're going to stick to their instruments.

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.060
 (LAUGHTER)

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:55.060
 I know how someone else would glue their fingers together, actually.

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.060
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.060
 For a specific use in film.

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.060
 Is it something we can guess?

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.060
 It's something you can guess.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:02.060
 Oh, okay.

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:04.060
 Oh, yeah, I know it, so I won't say it.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.060
 Oh, great show.

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.060
 Here's the only thing I'd say is, like, an additional clue.

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.060
 I can't do this.

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:13.060
 So if I was in the movie as this character, I would require the super glue as well.

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:15.060
 Well, I'm thinking of one of two things.

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:16.060
 Okay.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:18.060
 Is it E.T.?

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.060
 Oh, weird fingers.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.060
 That's good.

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.060
 Or...

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.060
 Or Spock.

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.060
 It's Spock.

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.060
 It's Spock.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:25.060
 Well, you couldn't do it without glue.

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.060
 Mr...

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.060
 Spock.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.060
 It was Zachary Quinto in the new Star Trek film.

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:33.060
 Couldn't do the Vulcan salute, so they glued it together.

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:35.060
 It's a thing which I can't do, I can't.

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.060
 I can do it with one hand, but not with the other.

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.060
 Right.

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:42.060
 Would you feel, if for that reason you weren't cast as Spock in Star Trek,

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:44.060
 would you feel that that was okay?

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.060
 I think so.

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.060
 I think so.

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:48.060
 Yeah, well, would you feel you were being discriminated against?

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:49.060
 Well, he wasn't discriminated against.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.060
 No.

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.060
 I don't know if he showed up to the audition pre-glued.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:56.060
 I would say, if I was auditioning for Spock, first thing, can you do that with your hand?

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:59.060
 If so, okay, let's look at the script.

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:05.060
 In fairness, they don't only cast people with pointy ears, so they do add some kind of...

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:09.060
 Having said that, though, if some people had pointy ears, they would have a legitimate grievance.

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.060
 I mean, talk about it.

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:15.060
 If there were real Vulcans among us, and then suddenly we're getting people to Vulcan up,

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:18.060
 then that's not appropriate, is it?

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:23.060
 But because Vulcans don't happen to exist, it's okay to point a ear up non-Vulcans.

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:25.060
 But similarly, the hand thing.

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:29.060
 I do feel like Zachary Quinto is taking jobs away from people like me who can do it.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.060
 Yeah, you can do it.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.060
 I'm really duddy with both.

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.060
 You two can.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:35.060
 I can do it with one and just about with the other, and you can't do it at all.

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.060
 I can't do it at all.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.060
 No.

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.060
 Well, you can play Kirk.

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.060
 That's fine.

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:45.060
 There's plenty of parts.

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.060
 Was William Shatner Kirk?

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:48.060
 Yeah.

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.060
 So he couldn't do it either, and they tied his fingers...

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:53.060
 No, no, but he apparently has to do it at one point.

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.060
 They tied his fingers together with fishing line.

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.060
 No.

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:57.060
 Oh, my God.

00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:58.060
 That makes sense.

00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:59.060
 That's very gloomy.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.060
 Lovely.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:05.060
 You say I'm the least American person, but you ask, "Was William Shatner Kirk?"

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:13.060
 I mean, I have to say, I really knew that as a piece of popular culture got through to me.

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:18.060
 "Was Elvis Presley a singer?"

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:23.060
 Speaking of body parts and glue, do you know what butt glue is?

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:24.060
 Oh, butt glue.

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:25.060
 Butt glue.

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:31.060
 I have a product at home called Butt Clean, but I have a water butt.

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:36.060
 You must have been disappointed when you bought that on the internet.

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:43.060
 The amount of capsules I wasted for realising they had to be just dropped in the water butt.

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.060
 So that cleans the water butt there.

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.060
 Yeah, you just pop it in and it fizzes a bit.

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:51.060
 All the turtles just float to the surface.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.060
 This is actually more to do with the Americans.

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.060
 So what's it called?

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:55.060
 Butt glue.

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:56.060
 Butt glue.

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:59.060
 That's a terrible bum remake.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.060
 Butt.

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:04.060
 It's not for repairing water butts.

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.060
 No, it's not.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:11.060
 It's for the bottoms and it's for people who compete in pageants.

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:17.060
 If you're wearing a very tight bikini, you want it to be exactly straight on your cheeks.

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:19.060
 You don't want it to ride up or anything like that.

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:22.060
 You put it between the bikini and the bottom.

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:25.060
 So it sort of goes on the bikini to get it positioned.

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.060
 I was thinking it goes on the bum, but it sort of lifts the bum.

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:35.060
 Well, Andrew, you would be good in the pageant world according to the Bravo show.

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.060
 I think that too.

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:39.060
 I'm amazed that is his line of work.

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:46.060
 You would be an innovator because according to the Bravo show Game of Crowns, which is quite recent,

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:54.060
 some people are using butt glue to actually hold the butt cheeks together to kind of make them seem very pert.

00:54:54.060 --> 00:55:00.060
 Because it's not very strongly, but it's what's soluble so you can put some water down there and it'll open them up again.

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:03.060
 You just need a thank goodness.

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:07.060
 Do not use super glue instead of butt glue.

00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.060
 You're doing your airfix with butt glue.

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:12.060
 It's not like, oh my god.

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:18.060
 Is that a common complaint in beauty pageant terms that the buttocks are too far apart?

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:20.060
 They're on the side of a criminal disposition.

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.060
 I don't think they all do this just to say if you're a beauty pageant.

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.060
 Of course not.

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.060
 No, no, no.

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.060
 I think but just some people do it too.

00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:28.060
 But I thought there was glue.

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:32.060
 There's all sorts of bits of glue for sticking bits of makeup to people's faces.

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.060
 Surely this is the same as butt glue.

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.060
 There's no need to say that this glue, it's skin glue.

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:40.060
 It doesn't need to be specifically for the butt.

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:42.060
 I think there might be some marketing going on there.

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:47.060
 Like I have something called Nerdwax which you use to keep your sunglasses on.

00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:54.060
 Because my nose is quite small so my sunglasses slip down my nose and you can kind of put it on your nose and it kind of keeps it there.

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.060
 But really it's just wax.

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.060
 But they've put it in a nice tube that says Nerdwax on and they maybe want to buy it.

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.060
 So I think it's a bit of that.

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.060
 Yeah, you could use it wherever you want.

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:04.060
 Bugger glue.

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.060
 Anyone heard of bugger glue?

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:07.060
 Okay, bugger as in the Americans.

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:10.060
 Yeah, so I should explain what bugger is to the non-American here.

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:17.060
 I've heard the expression just by being so un-American as in for a unit of snot, isn't it?

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.060
 A unit of dry snot.

00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.060
 Like a bogey.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.060
 Like a bogey.

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:27.060
 Is it used in beauty pageants to hold the nostrils together because they are considered to be more beautiful?

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:29.060
 Too far apart nostrils.

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:36.060
 Remember when you used to get a bank card through the post and when you would take it off there would be a little bit of glue underneath.

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:37.060
 That's clever.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.060
 The very snotty bugger glue.

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.060
 That's bugger glue.

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:46.060
 That's satisfying though because when that comes away it's gone completely, which is actually not the case for snot.

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:50.060
 I'd say snot leaves more of a sort of residue.

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:51.060
 Better than snot.

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.060
 Better than snot.

00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:58.060
 We've invented a better snot but now all we need to do is get it to somehow come out of our noses.

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:03.060
 Because at the moment it only manifests on credit cards rather than in packages when you've got a cold.

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:06.060
 Come on AI.

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:08.060
 I need to wrap us up in a sec.

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:09.060
 Can we do some bungling criminals?

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.060
 Yeah why not a couple of bungling criminals.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:16.060
 There was a man who stole a parcel from Reading.

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:21.060
 Wasn't to contain Henry the first to remain.

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:24.060
 This is in 1994.

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.060
 It was in the early 90s.

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:28.060
 It could still be the first year.

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.060
 And it turned out to be a bomb.

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:34.060
 It turned out to be an IRA bomb.

00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:40.060
 And he ran down the road pointing to the suitcase that he'd stolen shouting it's a bomb, it's a bomb.

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:44.060
 And passersby thought that he was high on drugs but he dumped the suitcase outside a shop.

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:49.060
 And 200 homes in Reading had to be evacuated while the bomb squad made it safe.

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.060
 I thought you were going to say blew up.

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:57.060
 I'll tell you how safely put it outside a shop.

00:57:57.060 --> 00:58:00.060
 I'll be honest I think he was panicking.

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:03.060
 Because there must have been a moment of realisation of that story.

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:05.060
 He's stolen the suitcase.

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:07.060
 It's labels IRA bomb.

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:10.060
 It's ticking or there's a fuse or something.

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:13.060
 The truth is you would think it probably wasn't a bomb, right?

00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:16.060
 But they did make it safe.

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:18.060
 So the newspaper report did say that it was a bomb.

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:21.060
 A hero butcher.

00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:23.060
 You want to hear about a hero butcher?

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.060
 Another one.

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:29.060
 This was a man who stole £6 from a butcher.

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.060
 But the butcher was also an amateur magician.

00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:36.060
 And rather than raising the alarm because he thought the guy would run away if he said stop thief.

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:40.060
 He decided to do a trick where he pretended that 50p had gone missing.

00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:44.060
 And he said oh let me find it, it might be about your person.

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:48.060
 And he searched the person and found the £6 that he'd stolen.

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:51.060
 That's brilliant.

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:54.060
 This is in 1976.

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:57.060
 People were more willing to stand still then.

00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:03.060
 The butcher suddenly said I have just stolen £6 and now the butcher is coming round the counter

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:06.060
 and doing a bit of a trick about coins.

00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:09.060
 This is an eerie coincidence.

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:12.060
 How can the butcher prove unless the butcher has already written his initials on the £6

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:15.060
 which he might have done as part of the magic trick.

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:18.060
 Just saying that's my £6, what are you going to do?

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:23.060
 Maybe it was a coincidence and the butcher always basically stole all the money of the people that came in.

00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:27.060
 But on this occasion it was just money that he was nicking back.

00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:34.060
 The reason we know about it is because actually the butcher let the guy go and even gave him some sausages for his tea

00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:37.060
 because he could see that he was in need of this stuff.

00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:43.060
 But when the guy was caught for a different robbery he was in court in Newcastle and he asked for this

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:47.060
 and a few other crimes to be taken into account and then they brought the butcher in to corroborate it.

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:49.060
 So that's how we know it happened.

00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:53.060
 Why did he mention that when he was being done for something else?

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:55.060
 We know that.

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:58.060
 He wasn't taking it any further and he said fine have some sausages.

00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:00.060
 Guess how I got these sausages.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.060
 It's a funny story actually.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:05.060
 I can't tell you what I should tell you.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.060
 You know what, I did think that.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:10.060
 But it is a thing that they asked for other things to be taken into account, don't they?

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:14.060
 But that I think is what they're saying is it precludes future prosecution.

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:16.060
 I think that might be it.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.060
 But I think on this, so I suppose maybe.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.060
 But on this case no way the butcher is going to go.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.060
 Actually I've thought about it.

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.060
 That was out of order and I want this to be back.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:29.060
 Do you think it might make the judge look more kindly on you to say alright, I've turned over a new leaf by the way,

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.060
 here are some other things.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.060
 Well it may be.

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:36.060
 I think if you said to the judge I've never done anything wrong before, that's fine.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:42.060
 But the difference between saying, talking about five previous robberies rather than four,

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:45.060
 I don't think that's going to meaningfully change the judge's view on you.

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.060
 Because it's such a funny story.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.060
 The judge must get a lot of quite grim cases of theft and burglar and stuff.

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:54.060
 And actually this funny thing that happened in a butcher shop would make me look more kindly on a grinder.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.060
 Now I know you're a bungling crook.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.060
 Bungling crook.

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.060
 And then the butcher, anyway, the butcher saw the funny side.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.060
 David, it's awesome.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.060
 Yeah, and then I mugged an old lady.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:13.060
 Okay, that's it.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.060
 That is all of our facts.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.060
 Thank you so much for listening.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:19.060

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.060
 Nice.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:32.060
 I don't actually look at any of the replies because it's so poisonous on there.

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.060
 Yes.

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.060
 So, you know, you won't be hearing back from me.

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:37.060
 Tweeting you abuse for years.

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.060
 You mean you haven't written it?

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.060
 I'm well aware.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.060
 Yeah, or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing, or go to our website,

 All of our previous episodes are up there, so do check them out.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.060
 But most importantly of all, get David's new book.

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.060
 It's called Unruly, A History of England's Kings and Queens.

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.060
 It's out now in all shops and online.

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.060
 That's it for us.

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.060
 We'll be back again next week, and we'll see you then.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.060
