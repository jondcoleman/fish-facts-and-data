WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
 Hi everybody, Alex here. Yes, Alex. I am alive and well and I'm here in the QI

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.120
 office on Christmas Eve Eve. Dan, James and Andy and Anna have all gone home

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.620
 again. Let me here to sort out this year's Christmas episode. In a second

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.520
 you're gonna get Dan and Anna asking you to subscribe to things and buy all

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.960
 their merch, but they couldn't even take the time to wish their loyal listeners

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 a merry Christmas because they're all complete f***ing freeloading, self-centered f***ing whole f***ing bastards.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.920
 So yeah, f*** them. It falls to me to gladly wish all of you out there a very

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.600
 merry Christmas from everyone here at No Such Thing as a Fish. And this means

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.240
 that I finally get to say, on with the podcast after these messages.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.280
 Hi everybody, just before we start this show we have a couple of small

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.480
 favours to ask you. It's that begging time of year when people put their tins

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.640
 out and shake them around asking for you to do things like, for instance, voting

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.160
 for their favourite podcast in the National Comedy Awards. That's why we

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.040
 have been longlisted as one of the best comedy podcasts. We're very excited about

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.920
 that and we would love it if you could get us to the short list. To do that you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.840
 can go to qi.com/vote. You'll see all the options there. You can also vote for

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.040
 your favourite comedians, your favourite comedy shows. You'll see Sandy Toxfig up

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.600
 there, host of QI. You'll see QI itself. Why not register a vote for them? And

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.800
 you'll see No Such Thing as a Fish. We would massively appreciate a vote. Do it

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.160
 now, qi.com/vote. That's right and there's stiff competition on there so we

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.960
 really need the Fish Army to come together and give us these votes because

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.200
 it would mean so much to the podcast to make it to the live National Comedy

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.600
 Awards. Outside of that what we would absolutely love is if you could just

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.000
 very quickly just go to the follow button on wherever you're listening to

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.240
 this podcast, be it Spotify or Apple iTunes, wherever it is and just press

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.640
 follow. We've discovered that so many people are listening to this show without

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.800
 having pressed that button and it's extraordinary what a difference it makes

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.080
 in helping us to be higher in the charts to get more exposure, to get more

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.240
 attention, to allow for the podcast to keep going. So simple button press is

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.880
 genuinely going to be a huge deal for us if enough of you do it. So please do.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.320
 That's our two big bits of begging. Please vote for us in the National

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.560
 Comedy Awards. Please press follow and that will allow us to keep going as a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.080
 podcast in 2023. Otherwise we just have to shut shop. That's it. If we don't get

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.640
 shortlisted and you don't press follow, we're out of here. Okay, come on down.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.160
 Enough begging. This is time to get desperate and sad. Look, do it if you

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.960
 want to. Don't do it if you don't. Okay, on with the show. On with the show after

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.280
 you press follow and voted for us. Okay.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:03:08.120
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.200
 podcast this week coming to you live from the Bloomsbury Theatre in London.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:21.880
 My name is Dan Shriver. I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.600
 Murray and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.400
 microphones, but not with our four favorite facts this time because this

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.200
 is our Christmas special episode and we have decided to instead use 500

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.840
 favorite facts from the audience members who are here tonight who have

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.600
 submitted them to us. And at the end of the show, after reading out some of our

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.480
 favorites, we're going to pick two of the best. We're going to bring the two

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.480
 people who said those facts onto stage and we're going to have them battle in

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.560
 a quiz to the death. So it's a very exciting episode, a special treat.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.280
 What have we got from our audience here tonight, guys? I just want to say the

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.360
 facts are on my phone. I'm not checking the football scars all the way through.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.120
 I just want to make that clear really early. So shall I do a fact? This is one

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.600
 just that I just picked up now. Some people can grow hair on their tongues.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.320
 Oh, wow. Like a will? Yeah, that's what it sounds like. Yeah, well, I mean, would

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.200
 that be a useful superpower to have, do you think? Or a tongue, tongue hair.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.960
 Yeah. Warmth. Sometimes it gets very cold in the mouth. Yeah. When you eat ice

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.760
 cream too fast. Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ice cream headaches.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.240
 I only say it is because the person who wrote it is a surgeon. Oh, I wonder if

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.480
 you're in. Are you in the person who? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Who's that? What's your name?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.240
 Malcolm. Malcolm. You're a surgeon. Do you operate on hairy tongues? Are you a

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.200
 glorified hairdresser? Here's a weird thing that would possibly happen, right?

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.040
 If you had a very hairy tongue and you were, say, making out with someone and

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.160
 you did some French kissing, would it ever be the case that their hairy tongue

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.480
 would wrap around your tongue and then you would get stuck? Does it ever happen

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.720
 that you walk next to someone and your hair wraps around them and you get stuck

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.360
 together? No, but you know when you, like, put Christmas lights back in the box and

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.240
 then they come out next year and they're all tangled up? Oh, yeah. And you know,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.240
 sometimes, remember, I had a friend at school who had braces and he kissed

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.680
 someone who had braces. No. And they got stuck in their braces. They're still stuck,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.360
 aren't they? No, it's not a myth. It sounds like an urban myth. It does sound

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.480
 like an urban myth. Well, I saw it. Maybe you're the source of it. I shouldn't have

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.600
 been watching, but I saw it. I popped out from the cupboard and went, "Guys, I can

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.040
 help. I can help." Shall we just quickly go back to Malcolm to check whether it's

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.640
 part of your surgery, you actually grow people hairy tongues. Yeah, and you said

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.040
 in your message, so you can reconstruct people's tongues, but you said in your

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.720
 message that it might be come from your forearm or your thigh and so when it

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.640
 comes in, that's where the hair comes from. I see. Isn't that something like your

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.800
 hair, even if you take it away, I suppose this is, and this will explain why

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.640
 people have hairy tongues, even if you take it away from a certain bit of your

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.400
 body, it always remembers it was there and grows in accordance with that. So I

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.520
 think there are things where like if you get some hair planted onto your head, if

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.800
 you want to sort out your baldness, for instance, then I believe if like the

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.480
 hairs, let's say you get it taken from your pubic region or something. I think

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.600
 that's the most common that people get. If the hairs that were around it start to

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.080
 fall out, then that one will also fall out. So your hair has a thing in it that

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.560
 tells you how long it needs to grow, right, because your eyebrows are not the

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.960
 same length as your head hair and your pubic hair is not the same. What you

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.040
 can't see at home for the podcast is that it has enormous hairs on her

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.040
 eyebrows. And so yeah, it has those and then when you transplant, say you put

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.400
 eyebrow hair on your head, they would all grow for that amount of time and then

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.920
 stop. Could you transplant all hair as in could you transplant eyelash hair onto

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.920
 your head, should you want it? Well, we have a surgeon in the audience. Don't ask

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.920
 us. Shall we do some more facts? Yeah, let's do another fact. Maybe the fact that

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.040
 only I and presumably the person who sent this in, who's called Jamie Drummond,

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:25.360
 will enjoy and it's that. Why are you reading it? Stop with the hard sell, Anna, please.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.040
 I think sometimes it's good to have a private bonding moment in these mass

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.720
 experiences. Cool. In Gladiator, released in 2000, Russell Crowe had a dog, quite

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.760
 ferocious dog, played by a dog called Kite, who was a Belgian shepherd,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:46.000
 apparently a terveur in Belgian shepherd. Anyway, she went on to be well-arred in

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.080
 EastEnders. Of course, so that's the name of the dog, well-arred. Yeah, well-arred in EastEnders,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.880
 yeah, named by Gus, I think, who was a funny guy, which is why he named him

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.080
 well-arred. Great fact. That is a really good fact. Any more? Any more? This is a

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.720
 cool one. This is from Polly, or at saying nice stuff. My husband, Frank, says the

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.280
 electrical cable in this theatre would stretch from here to Grimsby if placed

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.760
 end-to-end. Yeah. Why haven't we done that? Yeah. Do you mean all the different cables,

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.320
 because presumably if it's a cable it is end-to-end already, it's just a cable,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.240
 right? It's not a cable, is it all the cables? It says the electrical cable. There's

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:33.640
 one cable in this place, wow. But I think I feel like cable can be a plural

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.920
 kind of collective noun, right? All the cable in a place. You could say that, right?

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:44.840
 Yeah, I see that. We said that all the time. Another one on places. I've got one

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.240
 which someone sent in saying, "In Switzerland it's illegal to flush the

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.920
 toilet after 10 p.m." What? Illegal? Illegal, according to this person who

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.720
 apparently lives in Switzerland, as so they claim. I remember there was a woman

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.960
 who wanted to get a passport in Switzerland, didn't she? Do you remember? And in

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.880
 order to get a passport, she needed to get the permission of all the other

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.160
 people in her village. That's right. And they all hated her. Yeah. And they all

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.080
 wrote to the government saying, "No, we don't want her in our country." And she

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.120
 didn't. I think eventually she got it. Did she? I think so, yeah. Yeah, they were

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.400
 like, "She's so annoying. We just don't want her." Yeah. That's bad. Thank God we

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.800
 didn't have that system here. I'd be homeless. This is quite a cool fact. I

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.720
 think Danny might like this one. It's kind of spooky coincidence. Oh, cool, nice. So

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.720
 this was sent in by email from Nick Speechley and it's that in one of his

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.680
 recent rants, Kanye West, I know not a promising opening. We don't love a lot

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.920
 of his work. Claimed that Hitler, I also not promising. I'll give you that. There

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.800
 better be a huge U-turn coming on this fact. Claimed that Hitler invented the

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.720
 microphone, weird. In actual fact, the technology that 90% of microphones used

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:08.120
 today was invented by an African-American man who was called West. That's good.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:14.960
 Spooky. Is Kanye trying to plant that in our heads somehow? What is he trying to

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.840
 do? Well, you think he's gonna then say, "Well, it's my relative, so I'm gonna

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.600
 take all the money." Oh, maybe, yeah. Yeah. Are you saying he's a gold digger is

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:30.600
 what I'm asking? Oh, that's one of his songs. Is that a reference to him? Yeah.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.040
 Is it true? We're sorry to move into Hitler, but I read years ago, years and

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.480
 years ago, that there was a story that whenever Hitler was gonna do a speech,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.960
 the sound system, so this has to do with the microphones as well, the sound

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.760
 system would play a sort of note, a slightly annoying note, while everyone

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.680
 was waiting. So it was just one of those notes that, you know... Not the one that

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.960
 makes everyone poo. No, not the poo note, but like a certain age as you can

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.400
 hear certain ones, and it's just a little... Like a mosquito tone. Yeah, a mosquito tone.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.360
 And the idea, again, don't know if this is true, the idea was that when he came on

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.680
 stage, they would turn it off, and the sense of relief that you would get when

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.120
 he came on stage played into the sense of, "Ah, someone who's gonna help us is here."

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.480
 It was just a little psychological thing. Has anyone heard that? I have heard that,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:23.920
 yeah, from you. I bring it up every episode. Why is it not made it in? But that's

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.920
 actually what we were doing at the start of this show when, and for listeners at

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.160
 home, there were a series of maybe two or three dozen technical glitches, but it

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.880
 was just to create that sense of relief when we come on. Yeah, I've got a fact for

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:42.160
 you. Yeah, this is from Steve Early and it's this. I'm just gonna read it verbatim.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.440
 "It is possible to make a tuba out of material other than brass, and somebody

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:58.640
 once made one from cheese. And it sounded okay." That's pretty good.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.920
 I remember reading once that, I think this is tubas, I might be going completely

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.000
 wrong, but I think it's tubas. Basically, in America this is, all the high schools

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.920
 have all got bands, and they all have tuba players. But then, when you go to,

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.760
 like, top level bands, you only need one tuba player in a band, right? And so

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.200
 there's a massive, massive competition for tuba players in America, because

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.800
 there's loads of really good ones. Like, there might be loads of really good

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.880
 violinists, but you can have ten different violinists in an orchestra, right?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.200
 Yeah. But there's not much use for a tuba. I would have thought it was always

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.560
 proportional, you know, in the schools. You've got, let's say, you've got lots of

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.200
 violinists in every school, so only a certain percentage of them are gonna

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.000
 get through to the... Well, they can also play in, you know, string quartets.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.360
 I see. You don't get very many tuba quartets.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.960
 Steve, can I just ask what kind of cheese it was?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.440
 I'm guessing it was a fairly hard one. Oh, gotta be a hard one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:06.360
 I've got a fact about cheese, actually. This is Swedish cheese called "vastabottensåst".

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.640
 And apparently, when you make it, you require a bit of, you need to stir it

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.160
 and then leave it and then stir it and then leave it. And apparently, it was

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.680
 invented in 1872 by a dairy maid called Ulrika Lindström, and she kept being

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:25.040
 distracted by her work to go and have sex with a local boy. And she would go away,

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.920
 have sex, then come back and stir it, and then go away, have sex, come back and

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.960
 then stir it, and then when the cheese was made, she was like, "This is delicious."

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:40.680
 Yeah, but she must have been starving after that. Anything would taste good.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.560
 Just quickly, I'm just thinking, if it was Edam, you could presumably get one of the

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.560
 holes to go all the way through, and then you'd have like a cheese tuba.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.480
 You think of Leodamma? I don't think of Edam. And a tuba.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.760
 It definitely has the holes, right?

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.560
 Edam's got holes in it, right? Oh, dear. No. Doesn't. Oh, wow.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.480
 Ementol, I'm getting. Ementol. Yeah. Leodamma does as well, for sure.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.760
 And Leodamma, yeah. That's probably why no one liked that joke.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.000
 That would be the reason. Yeah, yeah. Make a good drum, and Edam, wouldn't it?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.160
 I don't know what Edam is, as we now well know.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.080
 I'm slightly struggling to remember what a tuba looks like.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.840
 What does it look like? Well, imagine a big tube. Yeah.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.320
 Surround it with brass. Yeah. There you go.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.800
 In fact, do you know what you should imagine?

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.600
 Because I've always really loved this. You know, the fallopian tubes,

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.480
 if you can picture fallopian tubes. Of course.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.680
 A common, everyday household item for Dan.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.600
 From diagrams. You can see the shape of them, and they get wider at the bottom.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.200
 Yes. So they were named after the tuba.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.440
 Oh, really? Not tubes. Yeah.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.520
 I would say more like a paperclip, but it's a big musical instrument, right?

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.240
 It's got those bending bits, and it's got... Yeah.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.520
 I'm just trying to think of something that Dan might have seen more from the fallopian tubes.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.720
 I've seen a lot of fallopian tubes, James.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.520
 It is a fun Christmas fact that I got sent.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.720
 I got sent this this morning. Nothing to do with the show.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.560
 So @SteveDownUnder is not going to realise that he's made it onto our show,

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.400
 but he's written in from New Zealand.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.560
 He DM'd me on Twitter, and he said, "Kia ora, Dan.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.840
 "Quick fact for you. You might like to use for fish."

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.600
 Jesus had a disciple named Thomas the Testicle.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.320
 No. No, no, no, no, no.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.520
 Happy to elaborate if you're interested.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.120
 Now, I don't want to be a doubting Thomas, but I don't think that's true.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.440
 Why would he say that? What's he saying there?

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.000
 Thomas the Testicle.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.400
 I don't know what he's saying.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.280
 Does anyone in the audience have any idea

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.480
 if he might be making some kind of weird reference to an actual fact?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.480
 Oh, is he hitting on me?

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.720
 We'll let you believe that's what it is, I suppose.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:00.800
 We did actually put a call-out for some Christmas facts on Twitter,

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.200
 and we got some great ones in.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.880
 So this is not from people in the audience here, but I did particularly like that.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.480
 So I like this because I have friends who live in the Netherlands,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.120
 and I refuse to believe they're this deranged.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:18.560
 But in 2006, people in the Netherlands were banned from adopting rabbits over Christmas,

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.240
 because there's a popular festive song about a family cooking their pet,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.600
 and it was believed that all Dutch people who adopted rabbits

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.560
 would just be trying to replicate that song.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.880
 It's terrible, isn't it?

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.680
 And I think around the same time, the Dutch version of the RSPCA said

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.240
 that everyone who had a rabbit should keep it indoors

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.240
 so that no one would kind of pick it up and try and copy the song.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.000
 How often do you sing a song and then sort of enact the lyrics as you do it?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.080
 Yeah, I'm always going around bullying reindeer's.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.200
 Yeah, apparently this is a thing, and it's really, really popular,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.720
 and if you go to the Netherlands and they play the top 20 Christmas songs of the year,

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.000
 they always play this one.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.080
 Oh, we've got to send another Christmas animal slaughter-related fact.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.160
 I've got it here. It's from Holly T. I think you're in.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.480
 Hi. This is great. I really like this.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.560
 This is a historical fact. It's that in 1797,

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.920
 Tom the Goose was brought with thousands of other geese to the Leidenhol market

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.720
 in London to be slaughtered.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:24.840
 But Tom escaped perusing the market and evading capture for days on end.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.000
 His life was eventually spared, and he was adopted as the market's mascot,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.040
 and he had a bar named after him, which is called Old Tom's Bar.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.040
 The Goose.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.840
 The Goose. Yeah, yeah.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.600
 Do we buy that? I buy it.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.000
 Yeah, I think so. And definitely we know that the geese were taken to town

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.840
 and they were walked all the way to town and stuff like that.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.040
 They put little boots on them, wouldn't they?

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.760
 Well, that's what they say. They always say, "Oh, they put little boots on the geese."

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.480
 But actually, I think what they happened was they would dip the feet in, like, tars.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.080
 I think they'd walk them through a big tars.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not quite as nice.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.520
 But that definitely did happen. That did happen.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:03.000
 And they did used to always go rampaging the animals around Smithfield and stuff.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 So, yeah.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.800
 I would say more plausible than Tom as a testicle, if that's the...

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.920
 Yeah, that's true, yeah.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.720
 ...high rocky. Of the Tom's, yes.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.800
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.520
 This is a cool one. We got sent by @flamies, who I think is in here tonight.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.440
 Diego, are you in here tonight? Diego's here.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.520
 Google engineers in California had no clue about the Football World Cup,

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.520
 and were alerted to it when traffic dropped suddenly for more than half an hour,

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.440
 then suddenly spiked and went back down again.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.480
 Nowadays, most tech companies have a dedicated sports event calendar as a result.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.800
 It's just pretty cool how much it sort of influences the world.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.720
 Yeah, except no one in this room who have continued with your ordinary lives

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.880
 despite the football match being on, and we respect you for it.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.480
 Yeah. Here's one.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.960
 In 1834, we also had three prime ministers in a year.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.320
 So, we did this year.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.160
 Lord Melbourne was the prime minister.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.840
 He was sacked by the king, and Sir Robert Peel was chosen,

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.600
 but Sir Robert Peel was on holiday in Italy at the time.

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.760
 So, they sent someone out to find him,

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.560
 and while they were trying to find him, the Duke of Wellington was an interim PM.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.080
 - That's good fact, isn't it? - Right.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.560
 I love the idea of trying to just find the PM.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.200
 Well, they just struggled with Boris, OK?

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.120
 Check the fridge.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.800
 There was another fact about, oh, I think it was Lord Liverpool,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.960
 who was the fifth Tory prime minister in a row,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.200
 and was at the kind of late end of, you know, an administration,

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.840
 and wasn't seen as being very good at the job,

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.640
 was really young as well, was in his early 40s when he got the job,

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.000
 and he was in charge of 25 years.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.840
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.880
 Are we sure there wasn't a Thomas the Testicle?

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.160
 Because I feel like that would be, of all the disciples,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.120
 the one you'd want at the last supper, right?

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.560
 - Like, he's... - Why?

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.160
 - He's the party disciple! - I thought you...

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.040
 Bring the party disciple, Thomas the Testicle!

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.440
 I thought you meant as a kind of dim sum option.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.600
 - Who am I? - I've got another fact on bowls.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.400
 - Oh, yeah? - Someone sent this in.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.000
 My interesting fact is that frozen meatballs that go in pasta,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.920
 ready meals, set off metal detectors.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.320
 Now, can you guess? Let's see if you can guess why that might happen.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.920
 - Frozen meatballs set off metal detectors. - Frozen meatballs.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.960
 - Yeah. - They've got metal in them.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.160
 LAUGHTER

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.000
 - Oh, it's a reasonable thought! - Yeah.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.360
 - Because you wrap them in aluminium. - No, no, no.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.640
 - That's good. - More surprising than that.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.480
 - More surprising. - Is it to do with them being frozen?

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.160
 - The freezing process. - Why? Close.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.240
 - Whose fact is it? - Jack.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.320
 - Jack, can you explain why? - Because that's...

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.720
 When they're frozen, they're so dense.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.600
 The metal detector isn't actually looking for metal.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.960
 - They're supposed to be really dense on there. - Oh, I didn't know that.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.200
 So metal detectors don't detect metal specifically.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.840
 They detect the density of the object.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.400
 - Yeah, and the meatballs are really dense. - Frozen meatballs are really dense.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.800
 - The idea is... - That's why Dan sets it off whenever he goes through.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.520
 LAUGHTER

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:55.840
 When I go home and my wife says, "How's the gig?"

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.120
 It's great. The room clapped for me at one point.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.680
 - It felt great. - Here's one.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.280
 This is from... I think you're in the room.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.880
 Samuel Wilkinson, hello. So, Sam Wilkinson says,

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:12.160
 "Only five people on the planet know the formula for angostura bitters,

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.800
 "and they have made a pact to never fly on a plane together,

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.080
 "or even to eat in the same restaurant."

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.960
 That's a really good excuse if you've got people who you don't like, isn't it?

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.480
 Just give them something and you're like,

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.480
 "Oh, we can't go for dinner together. I'm sorry."

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.880
 - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.720
 I was always told when I was a barman,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.720
 "I don't know if this is true because I never looked it up,

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.360
 "that angostura bitters is technically poisonous. It's a poison."

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.200
 And that's why they always said, "You're only allowed to use a tiny little bit."

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.400
 - I don't know if that's true. - Maybe.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.960
 I mean, everything's poisonous in large enough quantities, isn't it?

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.960
 - Yeah. - It's such a clever dick thing to say.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.080
 Well, I got really worried recently because my husband made a meal for me,

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.080
 and it tasted quite strongly of a specific spice.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.960
 I was like, "God, why is that? You put lots of it in."

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.120
 He said, "Oh, I just put loads of nutmeg in it."

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.360
 And I know, and I got suddenly quite nervous

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.760
 because you know, nutmeg is actually banned in a couple of countries

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.160
 because it is in certain quantities poisonous.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.520
 And surprisingly, small quantities.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.880
 Like, if you had two tablespoons of nutmeg, I think you'd be in trouble.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.560
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.840
 And then I actually...

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.400
 I don't think I've admitted this to him, so maybe you don't tell him.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.600
 But I wanted him to feel okay, so I said, "No, I'm sure it's fine.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.400
 "How much did you put in?" And he showed me.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.760
 And then I actually threw up

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.480
 because I thought, "I'm not fucking dying.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.720
 "If this guy wants to die, if not my poisoning, he's good.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.760
 "He can go, but I've got a long life to live."

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.280
 - Oh, my God, so... - But you thought it was worth saving yourself.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.120
 Well, I didn't want him to think I was paranoid.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.760
 Yeah, you certainly haven't come across as paranoid in this story.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.480
 And then did you just watch him and see if he died?

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.960
 I watched him like an absolute hawk, yeah.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.280
 - And he passed on that name. - Yeah.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:03.760
 Is it legal these days to have a massive company

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.840
 and have all the ingredients on the back,

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.320
 but then go, "But there's a secret something we're not telling you?"

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.800
 - I don't know. - Can you legally do that these days?

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.480
 But they all do, don't they, like KFC and Coca-Cola and stuff?

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.760
 We've got allergies. We have, like, people have things.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.880
 I think if you had peanuts in there, they'd make you put that on.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.080
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.480
 Well, I don't get why they're not allowed to go to the same restaurant

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.760
 because, in case it's poisoned.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.560
 - Well, if all five of them die in the restaurant... - Yeah.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.320
 I see, yeah. But in case there's a poisoned chef in the restaurant...

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.480
 - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, okay.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.040
 Hannah's husband working...

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.040
 Welcome to Nutmeg, Nick.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.600
 There's a few things at the O's, right,

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.040
 where people aren't allowed to travel in the same plane or whatever.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.200
 I can only think of the Wright brothers,

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.760
 - because they weren't allowed to fly in the same plane for years and years. - Yeah, me too.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.920
 The Royal Family as well, there were certain things about that

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.760
 that's been said. I read, and again, don't know,

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.320
 - because we're just flying off with... - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.400
 We were telling the facts. It's possible this is true,

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.560
 that people who made the parachutes for NASA

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.760
 for the rockets that come back in, so Apollo 13, when the parachutes came out,

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.040
 the people who know how to make the parachutes,

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.280
 there's only, like, three people who know how to make their parachutes.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.840
 - Can't be right. - It doesn't say that.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.640
 Three people who know how to make their parachutes.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.240
 Yeah, there's a secret ingredient to that.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.800
 It's the ropes.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.680
 Just on the Royal Family, by the way, because we just quickly mentioned them,

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:29.280
 when he was child, and the nanny told him to do something that he didn't want to do,

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.200
 apparently Prince William used to say,

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.880
 "When I'm king, I will have you punished."

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.320
 Oh!

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.600
 This is a cool one from Charlie Brook.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.800
 In the 1960s, a British scientist began an investigation

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.160
 into whether there were people who could see the future.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:51.880
 The project ended in 1968, when two of his subjects accurately predicted his death.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:58.960
 - And this really happened, and this is, as Charlie Brook says,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.880
 this is from a book called The Premonitions Bureau,

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.520
 which is a new book that came out this year by Sam Knight,

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:08.600
 and it was about a guy in London who, following a very tragic accident

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.160
 where a school was taken out by a landslide and there was a lot of deaths,

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.160
 a few people said that they had accurately predicted that this would happen.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.320
 There was even a few school children from the school

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.040
 that had drawn these quite ominous drawings ahead of it,

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.680
 and so he thought, what if this is the case, a premonition was a real thing?

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.400
 What if we had a bureau in London that was able to accurately gather together

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.800
 all these predictions so that we could see if there was going to be a big train crash

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.480
 in the future, or a fire somewhere, we would be able to stop it before it happened.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.560
 - And they predicted his death. - They both independently said...

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.640
 - Did they kill him?

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.200
 - Yeah.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.240
 - I haven't got to the end of the book. - I went to Nostradamus's house this year.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.520
 - I knew you were going to do that. - That was great.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.040
 - What was your favourite thing? - Oh, it was a plaque. That's it.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.560
 - That's it? - Yeah, yeah.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.880
 - What was the plaque? Is the plaque said that he'd lived there, or was it like in Kodor?

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.440
 - It said he'd lived there, and it talked a bit about the stuff he predicted,

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.200
 which I don't think it's going to be true.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.120
 - They hired you to work for their tourism outreach programme, didn't they?

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.840
 - Can I quickly say my favourite Nostradamus fact? - Oh, gosh.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:20.040
 - And it's not a fact, obviously, but when he died, he was buried,

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.640
 and there was all these rumours swirling around that if you wanted to inherit

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:28.040
 the powers of Nostradamus, you had to get his skull, and you had to drink through his skull.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:35.120
 And so he died, and then in 1791, which is, I think, maybe even 100 years after he died,

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:41.120
 in May of 1791, these grave diggers locate his grave, and they dig him up,

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.360
 and they open it, and there, laying in the grave, is Nostradamus.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.160
 But around his neck, and on his chest, is a little board on which it's written,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.400
 "May 1791," as if he went, "I knew you'd be here!"

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.960
 - Oh, my God. - That's good pranking.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.360
 - Yeah, yeah. And is that true? Oh, it's not true.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.560
 - I think this is really interesting. I can't believe I didn't know it, if it's true.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.840
 This was sent in by Willoway Culpepper.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.840
 So in Pennsylvania, you've got the Amish community, you know, they're called Pennsylvania Dutch.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.040
 Do you guys know why they're called Pennsylvania Dutch?

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.880
 - I thought they originated in the Netherlands.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.680
 - Apparently, they were German settlers, but they introduced themselves to the English,

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.320
 and what do they introduce themselves as? - Deutsch.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.800
 - Deutsch. And the English one. - I know.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.160
 - Yeah, sounds like you're probably Dutch.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.600
 - And that's stuck ever since. - That's great.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:43.880
 - OK, well, look, I think we've got a good pool of facts to pick from here

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.560
 for going into our fact-off for the nerdiest person in the room.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.960
 So James and I are going to be deciding who are the two finalists,

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.400
 and whoever we pick is going to be on our team, so we're going to ask you to come up on stage

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.800
 and sit next to each of us, and we'll do this quiz along next to you.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.360
 And so, James, do you want to pick first who...?

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:10.600
 - Yeah, I'm thinking that maybe to psych you out, we should go for the meatballs guy.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.480
 Because it felt like you really lost it around that time.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.760
 And I think by bringing him up on this side of the stage, that's going to really...

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.080
 - OK, all right, meatballs guy.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.160
 And I will go for the lady who hasn't flushed her toilets since 10pm to 6am

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.600
 in the mornings every single night.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.760
 - So, while you're making your way down and making your way to the front of the stage,

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.000
 we are going to find out the rules of the quiz, how it's going to be played,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.680
 how we're going to determine the winner.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.640
 So here to introduce it all is our quiz master herself, Anna Tyshinski, everybody.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.560
 - Yes. Yes, so the way this is going to work, as we alluded to earlier,

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.280
 is we will be quizzing our two contenders, Jack and Gaia,

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:57.200
 and we're going to be quizzing them on how well they know the no such thing as a fish crew.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.640
 So come on to stage, Jack, you're on James' team, I'm sorry about that.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.640
 But if you take a seat there... - Ah, it's the winning team, Jack, don't worry.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:08.720
 - And I just want to introduce you also to my little scoring boy over here on the left,

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.680
 Andrew the red-nosed reindeer.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.920
 Hi, Gaia, you're on Dan's team.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.480
 So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to read out some questions,

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.040
 and you're going to have to tell me which member of no such thing as a fish

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.720
 is the answer to those questions.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.880
 Can you stop distracting your contestant, please?

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:30.960
 Um... OK, without further ado, let's start the quiz.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.640
 So, question number one.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:41.320
 Who once lost a quiz by saying one of the seven dwarves was called Bernard?

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.200
 Please choose quite speedily.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.840
 Gaia, you've gone for Andy, Jack, you've gone for Dan.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.160
 The correct answer is Dan Triber.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.680
 Get in there. Come on.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.560
 Cross it with me. What the fuck are you doing?

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.600
 I'm an idiot. She thinks too much of you.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.200
 Oh, actually, that's very kind of you. Oh, thank you. Oh, OK.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.080
 OK, question number two. So, sorry, scoring boy, what is the score?

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.240
 1-0.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.680
 Thank you for your invaluable contribution to the game.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.760
 Question number two.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:15.200
 Who was given birth to in front of live observing students?

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.920
 And you guys have gone for James, you, Jack, have gone for me.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.720
 Anna, the correct answer is me.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.120
 Brilliant, Jack. Amazing.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.760
 You knew it. You just knew it.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.280
 Scoring boy, what have we got?

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.600
 2-0.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.120
 Wait, sorry, why were people watching you when you were born?

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.120
 They asked my mum halfway through labour if she minded if...

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.560
 Excuse me, is that Anna Tyshensky?

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.840
 It's about to be.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.720
 No, they said, "Do you mind as an educational process

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.680
 "if people can watch your child being born?"

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.360
 And she said, "Go for your life."

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.200
 And so, they asked about 20 people into the room.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.640
 Oh, my gosh. Wow.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.400
 Are they still in contact with the others?

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, she has them round every time, every Saturday.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.680
 Every time you come back home.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.600
 I squeeze myself through a very small window.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.600
 The cat flap.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.360
 OK, so question number three, and Jack, if you get this right

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.000
 and you get this wrong, then Jack's taken it.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.360
 Who owns a light-up ear spoon?

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.760
 Who owns a light-up ear spoon?

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.000
 You've both gone for James Harkin,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.400
 and the answer is James Harkin.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.400
 Yes! Yes!

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.120
 Yes, Gaya!

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.920
 What's our score, then?

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.680
 3-1.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.200
 3-1. Well done. You could call it back now.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.400
 Yeah.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.880
 But not if Jack gets this one right.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.600
 So, who played Joseph in the nativity play

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.960
 alongside their brother, who played a blade of grass?

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:56.120
 You've both gone with Andy, and I'm afraid that's not right.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.680
 No, I'm afraid it was me. It's not me, this guy, James.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.920
 And he will be absolutely delighted

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.680
 we're bringing it up for this podcast.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.520
 OK, so... No change.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.560
 No change. There we go.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.440
 Still on 3-1.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.360
 And so, final... Oh, hang on.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.720
 Let's do the final question anyway.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.400
 I'm sorry, that was an underwhelming announcement

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.520
 to say that Jack's won this, but...

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.240
 Very, very hard to come back from at this point.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.560
 But it's possible. It's possible. We can do this.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.920
 We can do this.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:31.160
 Gaya, according to Dan's brain, you can do this, and I believe in you.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.600
 So... Double points.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.760
 Who once had a brilliant, self-described,

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.320
 idea for a cheese chessboard?

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.280
 You've gone for Dan. You've gone for James.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.800
 So, just to say, this is double points, right?

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.640
 Oh, we're actually giving Gaya a chance.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.080
 I think we should, yeah. Double points.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.920
 Well, you're both wrong. Just because I know the answer, yeah?

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.240
 I'm afraid it was Andrew Hunter Murray...

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.000
 Guys, it's obviously my idea. Come on.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.520
 The cheeseboard.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.240
 But cheeseboard is already a thing.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.080
 But every piece is a different cheese.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.600
 As we've learned, you know so much about cheese.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.440
 Well...

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.680
 I had an idea for a T-shirt

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.840
 where you have a chessboard on the front, right?

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.080
 And it's called "chest", right?

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.920
 So you have little velcro bits, right?

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.520
 And then, check this out. Check this out.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.840
 On the back... What have you got?

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.680
 Backgammon. Backgammon. Oh, backgammon.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.680
 Way better.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.920
 Way better. That's why that didn't work.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.440
 Monopoly's too complicated.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.480
 So, Gaya, I'm so sorry.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.240
 You're the second nerdiest person in the room,

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.040
 but I'm going to have to ush you offstage now.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.080
 But, Jack, if you want to take center stage here,

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.840
 and I'm going to hand you over to Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.240
 Jack, well, you have done it.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.040
 You did it with your facts.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.360
 Get ready to take your prize, Jack.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.040
 Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Jack,

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.920
 the nerdiest person in the room.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.920
 CHEERING

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:04.040
 OK, that's it. That is all of our facts.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.360

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.960
 Jack?

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.400

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.800
 Are you a bot, Jack?

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:31.640
 You're the nicest bot I've ever met.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.880
 Andy?

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.760
