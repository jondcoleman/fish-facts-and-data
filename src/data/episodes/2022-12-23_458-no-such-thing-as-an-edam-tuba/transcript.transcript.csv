00:00:00,00:00:07,"Hi everybody, Alex here. Yes, Alex. I am alive and well and I'm here in the QI"
00:00:07,00:00:12,"office on Christmas Eve Eve. Dan, James and Andy and Anna have all gone home"
00:00:12,00:00:16,again. Let me here to sort out this year's Christmas episode. In a second
00:00:16,00:00:20,you're gonna get Dan and Anna asking you to subscribe to things and buy all
00:00:20,00:00:24,"their merch, but they couldn't even take the time to wish their loyal listeners"
00:00:24,00:00:32,"a merry Christmas because they're all complete f***ing freeloading, self-centered f***ing whole f***ing bastards."
00:00:32,00:00:38,"So yeah, f*** them. It falls to me to gladly wish all of you out there a very"
00:00:38,00:00:42,merry Christmas from everyone here at No Such Thing as a Fish. And this means
00:00:42,00:00:49,"that I finally get to say, on with the podcast after these messages."
00:00:49,00:00:54,"Hi everybody, just before we start this show we have a couple of small"
00:00:54,00:00:58,favours to ask you. It's that begging time of year when people put their tins
00:00:58,00:01:03,"out and shake them around asking for you to do things like, for instance, voting"
00:01:03,00:01:08,for their favourite podcast in the National Comedy Awards. That's why we
00:01:08,00:01:12,have been longlisted as one of the best comedy podcasts. We're very excited about
00:01:12,00:01:15,that and we would love it if you could get us to the short list. To do that you
00:01:15,00:01:20,can go to qi.com/vote. You'll see all the options there. You can also vote for
00:01:20,00:01:25,"your favourite comedians, your favourite comedy shows. You'll see Sandy Toxfig up"
00:01:25,00:01:30,"there, host of QI. You'll see QI itself. Why not register a vote for them? And"
00:01:30,00:01:34,you'll see No Such Thing as a Fish. We would massively appreciate a vote. Do it
00:01:34,00:01:39,"now, qi.com/vote. That's right and there's stiff competition on there so we"
00:01:39,00:01:42,really need the Fish Army to come together and give us these votes because
00:01:42,00:01:47,it would mean so much to the podcast to make it to the live National Comedy
00:01:47,00:01:51,Awards. Outside of that what we would absolutely love is if you could just
00:01:51,00:01:55,very quickly just go to the follow button on wherever you're listening to
00:01:55,00:01:59,"this podcast, be it Spotify or Apple iTunes, wherever it is and just press"
00:01:59,00:02:02,follow. We've discovered that so many people are listening to this show without
00:02:02,00:02:05,having pressed that button and it's extraordinary what a difference it makes
00:02:05,00:02:09,"in helping us to be higher in the charts to get more exposure, to get more"
00:02:09,00:02:13,"attention, to allow for the podcast to keep going. So simple button press is"
00:02:13,00:02:17,genuinely going to be a huge deal for us if enough of you do it. So please do.
00:02:17,00:02:22,That's our two big bits of begging. Please vote for us in the National
00:02:22,00:02:26,Comedy Awards. Please press follow and that will allow us to keep going as a
00:02:26,00:02:32,podcast in 2023. Otherwise we just have to shut shop. That's it. If we don't get
00:02:32,00:02:35,"shortlisted and you don't press follow, we're out of here. Okay, come on down."
00:02:35,00:02:39,"Enough begging. This is time to get desperate and sad. Look, do it if you"
00:02:39,00:02:43,"want to. Don't do it if you don't. Okay, on with the show. On with the show after"
00:02:43,00:02:46,you press follow and voted for us. Okay.
00:02:46,00:03:08,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly"
00:03:08,00:03:13,podcast this week coming to you live from the Bloomsbury Theatre in London.
00:03:13,00:03:21,"My name is Dan Shriver. I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter"
00:03:21,00:03:24,"Murray and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the"
00:03:24,00:03:28,"microphones, but not with our four favorite facts this time because this"
00:03:28,00:03:34,is our Christmas special episode and we have decided to instead use 500
00:03:34,00:03:37,favorite facts from the audience members who are here tonight who have
00:03:37,00:03:41,"submitted them to us. And at the end of the show, after reading out some of our"
00:03:41,00:03:44,"favorites, we're going to pick two of the best. We're going to bring the two"
00:03:44,00:03:48,people who said those facts onto stage and we're going to have them battle in
00:03:48,00:03:53,"a quiz to the death. So it's a very exciting episode, a special treat."
00:03:53,00:03:57,"What have we got from our audience here tonight, guys? I just want to say the"
00:03:57,00:04:00,facts are on my phone. I'm not checking the football scars all the way through.
00:04:00,00:04:07,I just want to make that clear really early. So shall I do a fact? This is one
00:04:07,00:04:11,just that I just picked up now. Some people can grow hair on their tongues.
00:04:11,00:04:18,"Oh, wow. Like a will? Yeah, that's what it sounds like. Yeah, well, I mean, would"
00:04:18,00:04:22,"that be a useful superpower to have, do you think? Or a tongue, tongue hair."
00:04:22,00:04:28,Yeah. Warmth. Sometimes it gets very cold in the mouth. Yeah. When you eat ice
00:04:28,00:04:32,"cream too fast. Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ice cream headaches."
00:04:32,00:04:38,"I only say it is because the person who wrote it is a surgeon. Oh, I wonder if"
00:04:38,00:04:43,you're in. Are you in the person who? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Who's that? What's your name?
00:04:43,00:04:49,Malcolm. Malcolm. You're a surgeon. Do you operate on hairy tongues? Are you a
00:04:49,00:04:54,"glorified hairdresser? Here's a weird thing that would possibly happen, right?"
00:04:54,00:04:58,"If you had a very hairy tongue and you were, say, making out with someone and"
00:04:58,00:05:01,"you did some French kissing, would it ever be the case that their hairy tongue"
00:05:01,00:05:04,would wrap around your tongue and then you would get stuck? Does it ever happen
00:05:04,00:05:07,that you walk next to someone and your hair wraps around them and you get stuck
00:05:07,00:05:11,"together? No, but you know when you, like, put Christmas lights back in the box and"
00:05:11,00:05:14,"then they come out next year and they're all tangled up? Oh, yeah. And you know,"
00:05:14,00:05:17,"sometimes, remember, I had a friend at school who had braces and he kissed"
00:05:17,00:05:20,"someone who had braces. No. And they got stuck in their braces. They're still stuck,"
00:05:20,00:05:25,"aren't they? No, it's not a myth. It sounds like an urban myth. It does sound"
00:05:25,00:05:28,"like an urban myth. Well, I saw it. Maybe you're the source of it. I shouldn't have"
00:05:28,00:05:33,"been watching, but I saw it. I popped out from the cupboard and went, ""Guys, I can"
00:05:33,00:05:39,"help. I can help."" Shall we just quickly go back to Malcolm to check whether it's"
00:05:39,00:05:46,"part of your surgery, you actually grow people hairy tongues. Yeah, and you said"
00:05:46,00:05:50,"in your message, so you can reconstruct people's tongues, but you said in your"
00:05:50,00:05:54,message that it might be come from your forearm or your thigh and so when it
00:05:54,00:05:59,"comes in, that's where the hair comes from. I see. Isn't that something like your"
00:05:59,00:06:03,"hair, even if you take it away, I suppose this is, and this will explain why"
00:06:03,00:06:06,"people have hairy tongues, even if you take it away from a certain bit of your"
00:06:06,00:06:11,"body, it always remembers it was there and grows in accordance with that. So I"
00:06:11,00:06:17,"think there are things where like if you get some hair planted onto your head, if"
00:06:17,00:06:23,"you want to sort out your baldness, for instance, then I believe if like the"
00:06:23,00:06:29,"hairs, let's say you get it taken from your pubic region or something. I think"
00:06:29,00:06:34,that's the most common that people get. If the hairs that were around it start to
00:06:34,00:06:39,"fall out, then that one will also fall out. So your hair has a thing in it that"
00:06:39,00:06:42,"tells you how long it needs to grow, right, because your eyebrows are not the"
00:06:42,00:06:47,same length as your head hair and your pubic hair is not the same. What you
00:06:47,00:06:52,can't see at home for the podcast is that it has enormous hairs on her
00:06:52,00:06:56,"eyebrows. And so yeah, it has those and then when you transplant, say you put"
00:06:56,00:06:59,"eyebrow hair on your head, they would all grow for that amount of time and then"
00:06:59,00:07:03,stop. Could you transplant all hair as in could you transplant eyelash hair onto
00:07:03,00:07:08,"your head, should you want it? Well, we have a surgeon in the audience. Don't ask"
00:07:08,00:07:13,"us. Shall we do some more facts? Yeah, let's do another fact. Maybe the fact that"
00:07:13,00:07:18,"only I and presumably the person who sent this in, who's called Jamie Drummond,"
00:07:18,00:07:25,"will enjoy and it's that. Why are you reading it? Stop with the hard sell, Anna, please."
00:07:25,00:07:29,I think sometimes it's good to have a private bonding moment in these mass
00:07:29,00:07:34,"experiences. Cool. In Gladiator, released in 2000, Russell Crowe had a dog, quite"
00:07:34,00:07:39,"ferocious dog, played by a dog called Kite, who was a Belgian shepherd,"
00:07:39,00:07:46,"apparently a terveur in Belgian shepherd. Anyway, she went on to be well-arred in"
00:07:46,00:07:52,"EastEnders. Of course, so that's the name of the dog, well-arred. Yeah, well-arred in EastEnders,"
00:07:52,00:07:56,"yeah, named by Gus, I think, who was a funny guy, which is why he named him"
00:07:56,00:08:03,well-arred. Great fact. That is a really good fact. Any more? Any more? This is a
00:08:03,00:08:07,"cool one. This is from Polly, or at saying nice stuff. My husband, Frank, says the"
00:08:07,00:08:12,electrical cable in this theatre would stretch from here to Grimsby if placed
00:08:12,00:08:17,"end-to-end. Yeah. Why haven't we done that? Yeah. Do you mean all the different cables,"
00:08:17,00:08:21,"because presumably if it's a cable it is end-to-end already, it's just a cable,"
00:08:21,00:08:27,"right? It's not a cable, is it all the cables? It says the electrical cable. There's"
00:08:27,00:08:33,"one cable in this place, wow. But I think I feel like cable can be a plural"
00:08:33,00:08:38,"kind of collective noun, right? All the cable in a place. You could say that, right?"
00:08:38,00:08:44,"Yeah, I see that. We said that all the time. Another one on places. I've got one"
00:08:44,00:08:48,"which someone sent in saying, ""In Switzerland it's illegal to flush the"
00:08:48,00:08:53,"toilet after 10 p.m."" What? Illegal? Illegal, according to this person who"
00:08:53,00:08:58,"apparently lives in Switzerland, as so they claim. I remember there was a woman"
00:08:58,00:09:03,"who wanted to get a passport in Switzerland, didn't she? Do you remember? And in"
00:09:03,00:09:06,"order to get a passport, she needed to get the permission of all the other"
00:09:06,00:09:11,people in her village. That's right. And they all hated her. Yeah. And they all
00:09:11,00:09:14,"wrote to the government saying, ""No, we don't want her in our country."" And she"
00:09:14,00:09:17,"didn't. I think eventually she got it. Did she? I think so, yeah. Yeah, they were"
00:09:17,00:09:21,"like, ""She's so annoying. We just don't want her."" Yeah. That's bad. Thank God we"
00:09:21,00:09:26,didn't have that system here. I'd be homeless. This is quite a cool fact. I
00:09:26,00:09:30,"think Danny might like this one. It's kind of spooky coincidence. Oh, cool, nice. So"
00:09:30,00:09:35,this was sent in by email from Nick Speechley and it's that in one of his
00:09:35,00:09:41,"recent rants, Kanye West, I know not a promising opening. We don't love a lot"
00:09:41,00:09:47,"of his work. Claimed that Hitler, I also not promising. I'll give you that. There"
00:09:47,00:09:53,better be a huge U-turn coming on this fact. Claimed that Hitler invented the
00:09:53,00:09:59,"microphone, weird. In actual fact, the technology that 90% of microphones used"
00:09:59,00:10:08,today was invented by an African-American man who was called West. That's good.
00:10:08,00:10:14,Spooky. Is Kanye trying to plant that in our heads somehow? What is he trying to
00:10:14,00:10:18,"do? Well, you think he's gonna then say, ""Well, it's my relative, so I'm gonna"
00:10:18,00:10:23,"take all the money."" Oh, maybe, yeah. Yeah. Are you saying he's a gold digger is"
00:10:23,00:10:30,"what I'm asking? Oh, that's one of his songs. Is that a reference to him? Yeah."
00:10:30,00:10:37,"Is it true? We're sorry to move into Hitler, but I read years ago, years and"
00:10:37,00:10:41,"years ago, that there was a story that whenever Hitler was gonna do a speech,"
00:10:41,00:10:44,"the sound system, so this has to do with the microphones as well, the sound"
00:10:44,00:10:48,"system would play a sort of note, a slightly annoying note, while everyone"
00:10:48,00:10:52,"was waiting. So it was just one of those notes that, you know... Not the one that"
00:10:52,00:10:57,"makes everyone poo. No, not the poo note, but like a certain age as you can"
00:10:57,00:11:01,"hear certain ones, and it's just a little... Like a mosquito tone. Yeah, a mosquito tone."
00:11:01,00:11:04,"And the idea, again, don't know if this is true, the idea was that when he came on"
00:11:04,00:11:07,"stage, they would turn it off, and the sense of relief that you would get when"
00:11:07,00:11:12,"he came on stage played into the sense of, ""Ah, someone who's gonna help us is here."""
00:11:12,00:11:16,"It was just a little psychological thing. Has anyone heard that? I have heard that,"
00:11:16,00:11:23,"yeah, from you. I bring it up every episode. Why is it not made it in? But that's"
00:11:23,00:11:26,"actually what we were doing at the start of this show when, and for listeners at"
00:11:26,00:11:31,"home, there were a series of maybe two or three dozen technical glitches, but it"
00:11:31,00:11:35,"was just to create that sense of relief when we come on. Yeah, I've got a fact for"
00:11:35,00:11:42,"you. Yeah, this is from Steve Early and it's this. I'm just gonna read it verbatim."
00:11:42,00:11:47,"""It is possible to make a tuba out of material other than brass, and somebody"
00:11:47,00:11:58,"once made one from cheese. And it sounded okay."" That's pretty good."
00:11:58,00:12:02,"I remember reading once that, I think this is tubas, I might be going completely"
00:12:02,00:12:07,"wrong, but I think it's tubas. Basically, in America this is, all the high schools"
00:12:07,00:12:11,"have all got bands, and they all have tuba players. But then, when you go to,"
00:12:11,00:12:16,"like, top level bands, you only need one tuba player in a band, right? And so"
00:12:16,00:12:21,"there's a massive, massive competition for tuba players in America, because"
00:12:21,00:12:23,"there's loads of really good ones. Like, there might be loads of really good"
00:12:23,00:12:27,"violinists, but you can have ten different violinists in an orchestra, right?"
00:12:27,00:12:32,Yeah. But there's not much use for a tuba. I would have thought it was always
00:12:32,00:12:37,"proportional, you know, in the schools. You've got, let's say, you've got lots of"
00:12:37,00:12:41,"violinists in every school, so only a certain percentage of them are gonna"
00:12:41,00:12:46,"get through to the... Well, they can also play in, you know, string quartets."
00:12:46,00:12:50,I see. You don't get very many tuba quartets.
00:12:50,00:12:54,"Steve, can I just ask what kind of cheese it was?"
00:12:54,00:12:59,"I'm guessing it was a fairly hard one. Oh, gotta be a hard one. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:59,00:13:06,"I've got a fact about cheese, actually. This is Swedish cheese called ""vastabottensåst""."
00:13:06,00:13:10,"And apparently, when you make it, you require a bit of, you need to stir it"
00:13:10,00:13:14,"and then leave it and then stir it and then leave it. And apparently, it was"
00:13:14,00:13:19,"invented in 1872 by a dairy maid called Ulrika Lindström, and she kept being"
00:13:19,00:13:25,"distracted by her work to go and have sex with a local boy. And she would go away,"
00:13:25,00:13:28,"have sex, then come back and stir it, and then go away, have sex, come back and"
00:13:28,00:13:33,"then stir it, and then when the cheese was made, she was like, ""This is delicious."""
00:13:33,00:13:40,"Yeah, but she must have been starving after that. Anything would taste good."
00:13:40,00:13:43,"Just quickly, I'm just thinking, if it was Edam, you could presumably get one of the"
00:13:43,00:13:48,"holes to go all the way through, and then you'd have like a cheese tuba."
00:13:48,00:13:51,You think of Leodamma? I don't think of Edam. And a tuba.
00:13:51,00:13:52,"It definitely has the holes, right?"
00:13:52,00:13:58,"Edam's got holes in it, right? Oh, dear. No. Doesn't. Oh, wow."
00:13:58,00:14:02,"Ementol, I'm getting. Ementol. Yeah. Leodamma does as well, for sure."
00:14:02,00:14:07,"And Leodamma, yeah. That's probably why no one liked that joke."
00:14:07,00:14:12,"That would be the reason. Yeah, yeah. Make a good drum, and Edam, wouldn't it?"
00:14:12,00:14:16,"I don't know what Edam is, as we now well know."
00:14:16,00:14:20,I'm slightly struggling to remember what a tuba looks like.
00:14:20,00:14:23,"What does it look like? Well, imagine a big tube. Yeah."
00:14:23,00:14:27,Surround it with brass. Yeah. There you go.
00:14:27,00:14:28,"In fact, do you know what you should imagine?"
00:14:28,00:14:32,"Because I've always really loved this. You know, the fallopian tubes,"
00:14:32,00:14:35,if you can picture fallopian tubes. Of course.
00:14:35,00:14:38,"A common, everyday household item for Dan."
00:14:38,00:14:42,"From diagrams. You can see the shape of them, and they get wider at the bottom."
00:14:42,00:14:46,Yes. So they were named after the tuba.
00:14:46,00:14:48,"Oh, really? Not tubes. Yeah."
00:14:48,00:14:52,"I would say more like a paperclip, but it's a big musical instrument, right?"
00:14:52,00:14:55,"It's got those bending bits, and it's got... Yeah."
00:14:55,00:14:59,I'm just trying to think of something that Dan might have seen more from the fallopian tubes.
00:14:59,00:15:02,"I've seen a lot of fallopian tubes, James."
00:15:02,00:15:05,It is a fun Christmas fact that I got sent.
00:15:05,00:15:07,I got sent this this morning. Nothing to do with the show.
00:15:07,00:15:11,"So @SteveDownUnder is not going to realise that he's made it onto our show,"
00:15:11,00:15:14,but he's written in from New Zealand.
00:15:14,00:15:17,"He DM'd me on Twitter, and he said, ""Kia ora, Dan."
00:15:17,00:15:20,"""Quick fact for you. You might like to use for fish."""
00:15:20,00:15:24,Jesus had a disciple named Thomas the Testicle.
00:15:25,00:15:27,"No. No, no, no, no, no."
00:15:27,00:15:31,Happy to elaborate if you're interested.
00:15:31,00:15:36,"Now, I don't want to be a doubting Thomas, but I don't think that's true."
00:15:36,00:15:38,Why would he say that? What's he saying there?
00:15:38,00:15:40,Thomas the Testicle.
00:15:40,00:15:42,I don't know what he's saying.
00:15:42,00:15:44,Does anyone in the audience have any idea
00:15:44,00:15:48,if he might be making some kind of weird reference to an actual fact?
00:15:48,00:15:50,"Oh, is he hitting on me?"
00:15:52,00:15:55,"We'll let you believe that's what it is, I suppose."
00:15:55,00:16:00,"We did actually put a call-out for some Christmas facts on Twitter,"
00:16:00,00:16:03,and we got some great ones in.
00:16:03,00:16:07,"So this is not from people in the audience here, but I did particularly like that."
00:16:07,00:16:10,"So I like this because I have friends who live in the Netherlands,"
00:16:10,00:16:13,and I refuse to believe they're this deranged.
00:16:13,00:16:18,"But in 2006, people in the Netherlands were banned from adopting rabbits over Christmas,"
00:16:18,00:16:22,"because there's a popular festive song about a family cooking their pet,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,and it was believed that all Dutch people who adopted rabbits
00:16:24,00:16:27,would just be trying to replicate that song.
00:16:27,00:16:28,"It's terrible, isn't it?"
00:16:28,00:16:33,"And I think around the same time, the Dutch version of the RSPCA said"
00:16:33,00:16:36,that everyone who had a rabbit should keep it indoors
00:16:36,00:16:39,so that no one would kind of pick it up and try and copy the song.
00:16:39,00:16:44,How often do you sing a song and then sort of enact the lyrics as you do it?
00:16:44,00:16:48,"Yeah, I'm always going around bullying reindeer's."
00:16:48,00:16:51,"Yeah, apparently this is a thing, and it's really, really popular,"
00:16:51,00:16:55,"and if you go to the Netherlands and they play the top 20 Christmas songs of the year,"
00:16:55,00:16:58,they always play this one.
00:16:58,00:17:04,"Oh, we've got to send another Christmas animal slaughter-related fact."
00:17:04,00:17:07,I've got it here. It's from Holly T. I think you're in.
00:17:07,00:17:09,Hi. This is great. I really like this.
00:17:09,00:17:12,"This is a historical fact. It's that in 1797,"
00:17:12,00:17:16,Tom the Goose was brought with thousands of other geese to the Leidenhol market
00:17:16,00:17:18,in London to be slaughtered.
00:17:18,00:17:24,But Tom escaped perusing the market and evading capture for days on end.
00:17:24,00:17:28,"His life was eventually spared, and he was adopted as the market's mascot,"
00:17:28,00:17:31,"and he had a bar named after him, which is called Old Tom's Bar."
00:17:31,00:17:33,The Goose.
00:17:33,00:17:34,"The Goose. Yeah, yeah."
00:17:34,00:17:36,Do we buy that? I buy it.
00:17:36,00:17:40,"Yeah, I think so. And definitely we know that the geese were taken to town"
00:17:40,00:17:43,and they were walked all the way to town and stuff like that.
00:17:43,00:17:46,"They put little boots on them, wouldn't they?"
00:17:46,00:17:48,"Well, that's what they say. They always say, ""Oh, they put little boots on the geese."""
00:17:48,00:17:53,"But actually, I think what they happened was they would dip the feet in, like, tars."
00:17:53,00:17:55,I think they'd walk them through a big tars.
00:17:55,00:17:56,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not quite as nice."
00:17:56,00:17:58,But that definitely did happen. That did happen.
00:17:58,00:18:03,And they did used to always go rampaging the animals around Smithfield and stuff.
00:18:03,00:18:04,"So, yeah."
00:18:04,00:18:07,"I would say more plausible than Tom as a testicle, if that's the..."
00:18:07,00:18:08,"Yeah, that's true, yeah."
00:18:08,00:18:11,"...high rocky. Of the Tom's, yes."
00:18:11,00:18:12,Yeah. Yeah.
00:18:12,00:18:17,"This is a cool one. We got sent by @flamies, who I think is in here tonight."
00:18:17,00:18:20,"Diego, are you in here tonight? Diego's here."
00:18:20,00:18:24,"Google engineers in California had no clue about the Football World Cup,"
00:18:24,00:18:28,"and were alerted to it when traffic dropped suddenly for more than half an hour,"
00:18:28,00:18:31,then suddenly spiked and went back down again.
00:18:31,00:18:36,"Nowadays, most tech companies have a dedicated sports event calendar as a result."
00:18:36,00:18:39,It's just pretty cool how much it sort of influences the world.
00:18:39,00:18:43,"Yeah, except no one in this room who have continued with your ordinary lives"
00:18:43,00:18:46,"despite the football match being on, and we respect you for it."
00:18:46,00:18:48,Yeah. Here's one.
00:18:48,00:18:52,"In 1834, we also had three prime ministers in a year."
00:18:52,00:18:54,"So, we did this year."
00:18:54,00:18:56,Lord Melbourne was the prime minister.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"He was sacked by the king, and Sir Robert Peel was chosen,"
00:18:59,00:19:02,but Sir Robert Peel was on holiday in Italy at the time.
00:19:02,00:19:04,"So, they sent someone out to find him,"
00:19:04,00:19:08,"and while they were trying to find him, the Duke of Wellington was an interim PM."
00:19:08,00:19:10,"- That's good fact, isn't it? - Right."
00:19:10,00:19:12,I love the idea of trying to just find the PM.
00:19:12,00:19:15,"Well, they just struggled with Boris, OK?"
00:19:15,00:19:17,Check the fridge.
00:19:17,00:19:19,"There was another fact about, oh, I think it was Lord Liverpool,"
00:19:19,00:19:22,"who was the fifth Tory prime minister in a row,"
00:19:22,00:19:26,"and was at the kind of late end of, you know, an administration,"
00:19:26,00:19:28,"and wasn't seen as being very good at the job,"
00:19:28,00:19:31,"was really young as well, was in his early 40s when he got the job,"
00:19:31,00:19:34,and he was in charge of 25 years.
00:19:34,00:19:35,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:19:35,00:19:37,Are we sure there wasn't a Thomas the Testicle?
00:19:37,00:19:42,"Because I feel like that would be, of all the disciples,"
00:19:42,00:19:44,"the one you'd want at the last supper, right?"
00:19:44,00:19:45,"- Like, he's... - Why?"
00:19:45,00:19:47,- He's the party disciple! - I thought you...
00:19:47,00:19:49,"Bring the party disciple, Thomas the Testicle!"
00:19:49,00:19:51,I thought you meant as a kind of dim sum option.
00:19:51,00:19:55,- Who am I? - I've got another fact on bowls.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"- Oh, yeah? - Someone sent this in."
00:19:57,00:20:01,"My interesting fact is that frozen meatballs that go in pasta,"
00:20:01,00:20:03,"ready meals, set off metal detectors."
00:20:03,00:20:07,"Now, can you guess? Let's see if you can guess why that might happen."
00:20:07,00:20:09,- Frozen meatballs set off metal detectors. - Frozen meatballs.
00:20:09,00:20:11,- Yeah. - They've got metal in them.
00:20:11,00:20:14,LAUGHTER
00:20:14,00:20:16,"- Oh, it's a reasonable thought! - Yeah."
00:20:16,00:20:19,"- Because you wrap them in aluminium. - No, no, no."
00:20:19,00:20:20,- That's good. - More surprising than that.
00:20:20,00:20:23,- More surprising. - Is it to do with them being frozen?
00:20:23,00:20:25,- The freezing process. - Why? Close.
00:20:25,00:20:27,- Whose fact is it? - Jack.
00:20:27,00:20:30,"- Jack, can you explain why? - Because that's..."
00:20:30,00:20:33,"When they're frozen, they're so dense."
00:20:33,00:20:36,The metal detector isn't actually looking for metal.
00:20:36,00:20:38,"- They're supposed to be really dense on there. - Oh, I didn't know that."
00:20:38,00:20:41,So metal detectors don't detect metal specifically.
00:20:41,00:20:42,They detect the density of the object.
00:20:42,00:20:44,"- Yeah, and the meatballs are really dense. - Frozen meatballs are really dense."
00:20:44,00:20:46,- The idea is... - That's why Dan sets it off whenever he goes through.
00:20:46,00:20:48,LAUGHTER
00:20:48,00:20:55,"When I go home and my wife says, ""How's the gig?"""
00:20:55,00:20:59,It's great. The room clapped for me at one point.
00:20:59,00:21:00,- It felt great. - Here's one.
00:21:00,00:21:02,This is from... I think you're in the room.
00:21:02,00:21:06,"Samuel Wilkinson, hello. So, Sam Wilkinson says,"
00:21:06,00:21:12,"""Only five people on the planet know the formula for angostura bitters,"
00:21:12,00:21:16,"""and they have made a pact to never fly on a plane together,"
00:21:16,00:21:21,"""or even to eat in the same restaurant."""
00:21:21,00:21:24,"That's a really good excuse if you've got people who you don't like, isn't it?"
00:21:24,00:21:26,"Just give them something and you're like,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,"""Oh, we can't go for dinner together. I'm sorry."""
00:21:28,00:21:29,"- Yeah, yeah. - Yeah."
00:21:29,00:21:31,"I was always told when I was a barman,"
00:21:31,00:21:33,"""I don't know if this is true because I never looked it up,"
00:21:33,00:21:37,"""that angostura bitters is technically poisonous. It's a poison."""
00:21:37,00:21:41,"And that's why they always said, ""You're only allowed to use a tiny little bit."""
00:21:41,00:21:42,- I don't know if that's true. - Maybe.
00:21:42,00:21:44,"I mean, everything's poisonous in large enough quantities, isn't it?"
00:21:44,00:21:47,- Yeah. - It's such a clever dick thing to say.
00:21:47,00:21:52,"Well, I got really worried recently because my husband made a meal for me,"
00:21:52,00:21:55,and it tasted quite strongly of a specific spice.
00:21:55,00:21:56,"I was like, ""God, why is that? You put lots of it in."""
00:21:56,00:21:59,"He said, ""Oh, I just put loads of nutmeg in it."""
00:21:59,00:22:03,"And I know, and I got suddenly quite nervous"
00:22:03,00:22:06,"because you know, nutmeg is actually banned in a couple of countries"
00:22:06,00:22:09,because it is in certain quantities poisonous.
00:22:09,00:22:10,"And surprisingly, small quantities."
00:22:10,00:22:13,"Like, if you had two tablespoons of nutmeg, I think you'd be in trouble."
00:22:13,00:22:15,- Really? - Yeah.
00:22:15,00:22:17,And then I actually...
00:22:17,00:22:20,"I don't think I've admitted this to him, so maybe you don't tell him."
00:22:20,00:22:22,"But I wanted him to feel okay, so I said, ""No, I'm sure it's fine."
00:22:22,00:22:24,"""How much did you put in?"" And he showed me."
00:22:24,00:22:27,And then I actually threw up
00:22:27,00:22:29,"because I thought, ""I'm not fucking dying."
00:22:29,00:22:32,"""If this guy wants to die, if not my poisoning, he's good."
00:22:32,00:22:36,"""He can go, but I've got a long life to live."""
00:22:36,00:22:40,"- Oh, my God, so... - But you thought it was worth saving yourself."
00:22:40,00:22:44,"Well, I didn't want him to think I was paranoid."
00:22:44,00:22:47,"Yeah, you certainly haven't come across as paranoid in this story."
00:22:47,00:22:52,And then did you just watch him and see if he died?
00:22:52,00:22:54,"I watched him like an absolute hawk, yeah."
00:22:56,00:22:58,- And he passed on that name. - Yeah.
00:22:58,00:23:03,Is it legal these days to have a massive company
00:23:03,00:23:05,"and have all the ingredients on the back,"
00:23:05,00:23:09,"but then go, ""But there's a secret something we're not telling you?"""
00:23:09,00:23:11,- I don't know. - Can you legally do that these days?
00:23:11,00:23:15,"But they all do, don't they, like KFC and Coca-Cola and stuff?"
00:23:15,00:23:17,"We've got allergies. We have, like, people have things."
00:23:17,00:23:20,"I think if you had peanuts in there, they'd make you put that on."
00:23:20,00:23:22,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:23:22,00:23:24,"Well, I don't get why they're not allowed to go to the same restaurant"
00:23:24,00:23:26,"because, in case it's poisoned."
00:23:26,00:23:29,"- Well, if all five of them die in the restaurant... - Yeah."
00:23:29,00:23:32,"I see, yeah. But in case there's a poisoned chef in the restaurant..."
00:23:32,00:23:33,"- Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, okay."
00:23:33,00:23:35,Hannah's husband working...
00:23:35,00:23:38,"Welcome to Nutmeg, Nick."
00:23:38,00:23:40,"There's a few things at the O's, right,"
00:23:40,00:23:45,where people aren't allowed to travel in the same plane or whatever.
00:23:45,00:23:46,"I can only think of the Wright brothers,"
00:23:46,00:23:49,"- because they weren't allowed to fly in the same plane for years and years. - Yeah, me too."
00:23:49,00:23:51,"The Royal Family as well, there were certain things about that"
00:23:51,00:23:54,"that's been said. I read, and again, don't know,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,"- because we're just flying off with... - Yeah, yeah."
00:23:56,00:23:58,"We were telling the facts. It's possible this is true,"
00:23:58,00:24:01,that people who made the parachutes for NASA
00:24:01,00:24:05,"for the rockets that come back in, so Apollo 13, when the parachutes came out,"
00:24:05,00:24:08,"the people who know how to make the parachutes,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,"there's only, like, three people who know how to make their parachutes."
00:24:10,00:24:11,- Can't be right. - It doesn't say that.
00:24:11,00:24:14,Three people who know how to make their parachutes.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"Yeah, there's a secret ingredient to that."
00:24:17,00:24:18,It's the ropes.
00:24:20,00:24:23,"Just on the Royal Family, by the way, because we just quickly mentioned them,"
00:24:23,00:24:29,"when he was child, and the nanny told him to do something that he didn't want to do,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,"apparently Prince William used to say,"
00:24:31,00:24:33,"""When I'm king, I will have you punished."""
00:24:33,00:24:36,Oh!
00:24:36,00:24:38,This is a cool one from Charlie Brook.
00:24:38,00:24:42,"In the 1960s, a British scientist began an investigation"
00:24:42,00:24:46,into whether there were people who could see the future.
00:24:46,00:24:51,"The project ended in 1968, when two of his subjects accurately predicted his death."
00:24:51,00:24:58,"- And this really happened, and this is, as Charlie Brook says,"
00:24:58,00:25:00,"this is from a book called The Premonitions Bureau,"
00:25:00,00:25:03,"which is a new book that came out this year by Sam Knight,"
00:25:03,00:25:08,"and it was about a guy in London who, following a very tragic accident"
00:25:08,00:25:12,"where a school was taken out by a landslide and there was a lot of deaths,"
00:25:12,00:25:15,a few people said that they had accurately predicted that this would happen.
00:25:15,00:25:17,There was even a few school children from the school
00:25:17,00:25:20,"that had drawn these quite ominous drawings ahead of it,"
00:25:20,00:25:23,"and so he thought, what if this is the case, a premonition was a real thing?"
00:25:23,00:25:27,What if we had a bureau in London that was able to accurately gather together
00:25:27,00:25:30,all these predictions so that we could see if there was going to be a big train crash
00:25:30,00:25:35,"in the future, or a fire somewhere, we would be able to stop it before it happened."
00:25:35,00:25:38,- And they predicted his death. - They both independently said...
00:25:38,00:25:40,- Did they kill him?
00:25:40,00:25:43,- Yeah.
00:25:43,00:25:48,- I haven't got to the end of the book. - I went to Nostradamus's house this year.
00:25:48,00:25:52,- I knew you were going to do that. - That was great.
00:25:52,00:25:57,"- What was your favourite thing? - Oh, it was a plaque. That's it."
00:25:57,00:25:58,"- That's it? - Yeah, yeah."
00:25:58,00:26:01,"- What was the plaque? Is the plaque said that he'd lived there, or was it like in Kodor?"
00:26:01,00:26:05,"- It said he'd lived there, and it talked a bit about the stuff he predicted,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,which I don't think it's going to be true.
00:26:07,00:26:11,"- They hired you to work for their tourism outreach programme, didn't they?"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"- Can I quickly say my favourite Nostradamus fact? - Oh, gosh."
00:26:13,00:26:20,"- And it's not a fact, obviously, but when he died, he was buried,"
00:26:20,00:26:23,and there was all these rumours swirling around that if you wanted to inherit
00:26:23,00:26:28,"the powers of Nostradamus, you had to get his skull, and you had to drink through his skull."
00:26:28,00:26:35,"And so he died, and then in 1791, which is, I think, maybe even 100 years after he died,"
00:26:35,00:26:41,"in May of 1791, these grave diggers locate his grave, and they dig him up,"
00:26:41,00:26:45,"and they open it, and there, laying in the grave, is Nostradamus."
00:26:45,00:26:50,"But around his neck, and on his chest, is a little board on which it's written,"
00:26:50,00:26:55,"""May 1791,"" as if he went, ""I knew you'd be here!"""
00:26:55,00:26:57,"- Oh, my God. - That's good pranking."
00:26:57,00:27:01,"- Yeah, yeah. And is that true? Oh, it's not true."
00:27:01,00:27:04,"- I think this is really interesting. I can't believe I didn't know it, if it's true."
00:27:04,00:27:07,This was sent in by Willoway Culpepper.
00:27:07,00:27:12,"So in Pennsylvania, you've got the Amish community, you know, they're called Pennsylvania Dutch."
00:27:12,00:27:15,Do you guys know why they're called Pennsylvania Dutch?
00:27:15,00:27:17,- I thought they originated in the Netherlands.
00:27:17,00:27:22,"- Apparently, they were German settlers, but they introduced themselves to the English,"
00:27:22,00:27:25,and what do they introduce themselves as? - Deutsch.
00:27:25,00:27:27,- Deutsch. And the English one. - I know.
00:27:27,00:27:32,"- Yeah, sounds like you're probably Dutch."
00:27:32,00:27:34,- And that's stuck ever since. - That's great.
00:27:34,00:27:43,"- OK, well, look, I think we've got a good pool of facts to pick from here"
00:27:43,00:27:48,for going into our fact-off for the nerdiest person in the room.
00:27:48,00:27:53,"So James and I are going to be deciding who are the two finalists,"
00:27:53,00:27:57,"and whoever we pick is going to be on our team, so we're going to ask you to come up on stage"
00:27:57,00:28:01,"and sit next to each of us, and we'll do this quiz along next to you."
00:28:01,00:28:04,"And so, James, do you want to pick first who...?"
00:28:04,00:28:10,"- Yeah, I'm thinking that maybe to psych you out, we should go for the meatballs guy."
00:28:10,00:28:13,Because it felt like you really lost it around that time.
00:28:13,00:28:17,"And I think by bringing him up on this side of the stage, that's going to really..."
00:28:17,00:28:20,"- OK, all right, meatballs guy."
00:28:20,00:28:25,And I will go for the lady who hasn't flushed her toilets since 10pm to 6am
00:28:25,00:28:27,in the mornings every single night.
00:28:27,00:28:32,"- So, while you're making your way down and making your way to the front of the stage,"
00:28:32,00:28:36,"we are going to find out the rules of the quiz, how it's going to be played,"
00:28:36,00:28:37,how we're going to determine the winner.
00:28:37,00:28:42,"So here to introduce it all is our quiz master herself, Anna Tyshinski, everybody."
00:28:42,00:28:48,"- Yes. Yes, so the way this is going to work, as we alluded to earlier,"
00:28:48,00:28:52,"is we will be quizzing our two contenders, Jack and Gaia,"
00:28:52,00:28:57,and we're going to be quizzing them on how well they know the no such thing as a fish crew.
00:28:57,00:29:00,"So come on to stage, Jack, you're on James' team, I'm sorry about that."
00:29:00,00:29:03,"But if you take a seat there... - Ah, it's the winning team, Jack, don't worry."
00:29:03,00:29:08,"- And I just want to introduce you also to my little scoring boy over here on the left,"
00:29:08,00:29:11,Andrew the red-nosed reindeer.
00:29:11,00:29:13,"Hi, Gaia, you're on Dan's team."
00:29:13,00:29:17,"So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to read out some questions,"
00:29:17,00:29:21,and you're going to have to tell me which member of no such thing as a fish
00:29:21,00:29:22,is the answer to those questions.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"Can you stop distracting your contestant, please?"
00:29:24,00:29:30,"Um... OK, without further ado, let's start the quiz."
00:29:30,00:29:34,"So, question number one."
00:29:34,00:29:41,Who once lost a quiz by saying one of the seven dwarves was called Bernard?
00:29:41,00:29:43,Please choose quite speedily.
00:29:43,00:29:45,"Gaia, you've gone for Andy, Jack, you've gone for Dan."
00:29:45,00:29:48,The correct answer is Dan Triber.
00:29:48,00:29:49,Get in there. Come on.
00:29:49,00:29:53,Cross it with me. What the fuck are you doing?
00:29:53,00:29:55,I'm an idiot. She thinks too much of you.
00:29:55,00:29:59,"Oh, actually, that's very kind of you. Oh, thank you. Oh, OK."
00:29:59,00:30:03,"OK, question number two. So, sorry, scoring boy, what is the score?"
00:30:03,00:30:06,1-0.
00:30:06,00:30:09,Thank you for your invaluable contribution to the game.
00:30:09,00:30:10,Question number two.
00:30:10,00:30:15,Who was given birth to in front of live observing students?
00:30:15,00:30:18,"And you guys have gone for James, you, Jack, have gone for me."
00:30:18,00:30:20,"Anna, the correct answer is me."
00:30:20,00:30:23,"Brilliant, Jack. Amazing."
00:30:23,00:30:26,You knew it. You just knew it.
00:30:26,00:30:28,"Scoring boy, what have we got?"
00:30:28,00:30:30,2-0.
00:30:30,00:30:33,"Wait, sorry, why were people watching you when you were born?"
00:30:33,00:30:36,They asked my mum halfway through labour if she minded if...
00:30:36,00:30:39,"Excuse me, is that Anna Tyshensky?"
00:30:39,00:30:42,It's about to be.
00:30:42,00:30:45,"No, they said, ""Do you mind as an educational process"
00:30:45,00:30:47,"""if people can watch your child being born?"""
00:30:47,00:30:49,"And she said, ""Go for your life."""
00:30:49,00:30:51,"And so, they asked about 20 people into the room."
00:30:51,00:30:53,"Oh, my gosh. Wow."
00:30:53,00:30:57,Are they still in contact with the others?
00:30:57,00:31:01,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, she has them round every time, every Saturday."
00:31:01,00:31:03,Every time you come back home.
00:31:03,00:31:06,I squeeze myself through a very small window.
00:31:06,00:31:08,The cat flap.
00:31:08,00:31:13,"OK, so question number three, and Jack, if you get this right"
00:31:13,00:31:16,"and you get this wrong, then Jack's taken it."
00:31:16,00:31:19,Who owns a light-up ear spoon?
00:31:19,00:31:21,Who owns a light-up ear spoon?
00:31:21,00:31:25,"You've both gone for James Harkin,"
00:31:25,00:31:27,and the answer is James Harkin.
00:31:27,00:31:29,Yes! Yes!
00:31:29,00:31:32,"Yes, Gaya!"
00:31:32,00:31:33,"What's our score, then?"
00:31:33,00:31:35,3-1.
00:31:35,00:31:38,3-1. Well done. You could call it back now.
00:31:38,00:31:39,Yeah.
00:31:39,00:31:41,But not if Jack gets this one right.
00:31:41,00:31:46,"So, who played Joseph in the nativity play"
00:31:46,00:31:49,"alongside their brother, who played a blade of grass?"
00:31:49,00:31:56,"You've both gone with Andy, and I'm afraid that's not right."
00:31:56,00:32:00,"No, I'm afraid it was me. It's not me, this guy, James."
00:32:00,00:32:02,And he will be absolutely delighted
00:32:02,00:32:05,we're bringing it up for this podcast.
00:32:05,00:32:07,"OK, so... No change."
00:32:07,00:32:09,No change. There we go.
00:32:09,00:32:11,Still on 3-1.
00:32:11,00:32:14,"And so, final... Oh, hang on."
00:32:14,00:32:15,Let's do the final question anyway.
00:32:15,00:32:18,"I'm sorry, that was an underwhelming announcement"
00:32:18,00:32:21,"to say that Jack's won this, but..."
00:32:21,00:32:24,"Very, very hard to come back from at this point."
00:32:24,00:32:26,But it's possible. It's possible. We can do this.
00:32:26,00:32:27,We can do this.
00:32:27,00:32:31,"Gaya, according to Dan's brain, you can do this, and I believe in you."
00:32:31,00:32:32,So... Double points.
00:32:32,00:32:36,"Who once had a brilliant, self-described,"
00:32:36,00:32:40,idea for a cheese chessboard?
00:32:40,00:32:42,You've gone for Dan. You've gone for James.
00:32:42,00:32:44,"So, just to say, this is double points, right?"
00:32:44,00:32:46,"Oh, we're actually giving Gaya a chance."
00:32:46,00:32:48,"I think we should, yeah. Double points."
00:32:48,00:32:50,"Well, you're both wrong. Just because I know the answer, yeah?"
00:32:50,00:32:52,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:52,00:32:56,I'm afraid it was Andrew Hunter Murray...
00:32:56,00:32:59,"Guys, it's obviously my idea. Come on."
00:32:59,00:33:01,The cheeseboard.
00:33:01,00:33:04,But cheeseboard is already a thing.
00:33:04,00:33:06,But every piece is a different cheese.
00:33:06,00:33:08,"As we've learned, you know so much about cheese."
00:33:08,00:33:12,Well...
00:33:12,00:33:15,I had an idea for a T-shirt
00:33:15,00:33:17,"where you have a chessboard on the front, right?"
00:33:17,00:33:20,"And it's called ""chest"", right?"
00:33:20,00:33:21,"So you have little velcro bits, right?"
00:33:21,00:33:23,"And then, check this out. Check this out."
00:33:23,00:33:25,On the back... What have you got?
00:33:25,00:33:27,"Backgammon. Backgammon. Oh, backgammon."
00:33:27,00:33:29,Way better.
00:33:29,00:33:31,Way better. That's why that didn't work.
00:33:31,00:33:33,Monopoly's too complicated.
00:33:33,00:33:37,"So, Gaya, I'm so sorry."
00:33:37,00:33:39,"You're the second nerdiest person in the room,"
00:33:39,00:33:42,but I'm going to have to ush you offstage now.
00:33:42,00:33:45,"But, Jack, if you want to take center stage here,"
00:33:45,00:33:47,and I'm going to hand you over to Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:33:47,00:33:50,"Jack, well, you have done it."
00:33:50,00:33:52,You did it with your facts.
00:33:52,00:33:53,"Get ready to take your prize, Jack."
00:33:53,00:33:55,"Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Jack,"
00:33:55,00:33:56,the nerdiest person in the room.
00:33:56,00:33:58,CHEERING
