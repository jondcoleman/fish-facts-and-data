1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
 Hi everybody, Alex here. Yes, Alex. I am alive and well and I'm here in the QI

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,120
 office on Christmas Eve Eve. Dan, James and Andy and Anna have all gone home

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,620
 again. Let me here to sort out this year's Christmas episode. In a second

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,520
 you're gonna get Dan and Anna asking you to subscribe to things and buy all

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,960
 their merch, but they couldn't even take the time to wish their loyal listeners

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,520
 a merry Christmas because they're all complete f***ing freeloading, self-centered f***ing whole f***ing bastards.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,920
 So yeah, f*** them. It falls to me to gladly wish all of you out there a very

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,600
 merry Christmas from everyone here at No Such Thing as a Fish. And this means

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,240
 that I finally get to say, on with the podcast after these messages.

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,280
 Hi everybody, just before we start this show we have a couple of small

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,480
 favours to ask you. It's that begging time of year when people put their tins

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,640
 out and shake them around asking for you to do things like, for instance, voting

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,160
 for their favourite podcast in the National Comedy Awards. That's why we

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,040
 have been longlisted as one of the best comedy podcasts. We're very excited about

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,920
 that and we would love it if you could get us to the short list. To do that you

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,840
 can go to qi.com/vote. You'll see all the options there. You can also vote for

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,040
 your favourite comedians, your favourite comedy shows. You'll see Sandy Toxfig up

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,600
 there, host of QI. You'll see QI itself. Why not register a vote for them? And

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,800
 you'll see No Such Thing as a Fish. We would massively appreciate a vote. Do it

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,160
 now, qi.com/vote. That's right and there's stiff competition on there so we

21
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,960
 really need the Fish Army to come together and give us these votes because

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,200
 it would mean so much to the podcast to make it to the live National Comedy

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,600
 Awards. Outside of that what we would absolutely love is if you could just

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,000
 very quickly just go to the follow button on wherever you're listening to

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,240
 this podcast, be it Spotify or Apple iTunes, wherever it is and just press

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,640
 follow. We've discovered that so many people are listening to this show without

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,800
 having pressed that button and it's extraordinary what a difference it makes

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,080
 in helping us to be higher in the charts to get more exposure, to get more

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,240
 attention, to allow for the podcast to keep going. So simple button press is

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,880
 genuinely going to be a huge deal for us if enough of you do it. So please do.

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,320
 That's our two big bits of begging. Please vote for us in the National

32
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,560
 Comedy Awards. Please press follow and that will allow us to keep going as a

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,080
 podcast in 2023. Otherwise we just have to shut shop. That's it. If we don't get

34
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,640
 shortlisted and you don't press follow, we're out of here. Okay, come on down.

35
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,160
 Enough begging. This is time to get desperate and sad. Look, do it if you

36
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,960
 want to. Don't do it if you don't. Okay, on with the show. On with the show after

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,280
 you press follow and voted for us. Okay.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:03:08,120
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly

39
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,200
 podcast this week coming to you live from the Bloomsbury Theatre in London.

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:21,880
 My name is Dan Shriver. I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter

41
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,600
 Murray and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the

42
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,400
 microphones, but not with our four favorite facts this time because this

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,200
 is our Christmas special episode and we have decided to instead use 500

44
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,840
 favorite facts from the audience members who are here tonight who have

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,600
 submitted them to us. And at the end of the show, after reading out some of our

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,480
 favorites, we're going to pick two of the best. We're going to bring the two

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,480
 people who said those facts onto stage and we're going to have them battle in

48
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,560
 a quiz to the death. So it's a very exciting episode, a special treat.

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,280
 What have we got from our audience here tonight, guys? I just want to say the

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,360
 facts are on my phone. I'm not checking the football scars all the way through.

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,120
 I just want to make that clear really early. So shall I do a fact? This is one

52
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,600
 just that I just picked up now. Some people can grow hair on their tongues.

53
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:18,320
 Oh, wow. Like a will? Yeah, that's what it sounds like. Yeah, well, I mean, would

54
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,200
 that be a useful superpower to have, do you think? Or a tongue, tongue hair.

55
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,960
 Yeah. Warmth. Sometimes it gets very cold in the mouth. Yeah. When you eat ice

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,760
 cream too fast. Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ice cream headaches.

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,240
 I only say it is because the person who wrote it is a surgeon. Oh, I wonder if

58
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,480
 you're in. Are you in the person who? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Who's that? What's your name?

59
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,240
 Malcolm. Malcolm. You're a surgeon. Do you operate on hairy tongues? Are you a

60
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,200
 glorified hairdresser? Here's a weird thing that would possibly happen, right?

61
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,040
 If you had a very hairy tongue and you were, say, making out with someone and

62
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,160
 you did some French kissing, would it ever be the case that their hairy tongue

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,480
 would wrap around your tongue and then you would get stuck? Does it ever happen

64
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,720
 that you walk next to someone and your hair wraps around them and you get stuck

65
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,360
 together? No, but you know when you, like, put Christmas lights back in the box and

66
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,240
 then they come out next year and they're all tangled up? Oh, yeah. And you know,

67
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,240
 sometimes, remember, I had a friend at school who had braces and he kissed

68
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,680
 someone who had braces. No. And they got stuck in their braces. They're still stuck,

69
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,360
 aren't they? No, it's not a myth. It sounds like an urban myth. It does sound

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,480
 like an urban myth. Well, I saw it. Maybe you're the source of it. I shouldn't have

71
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,600
 been watching, but I saw it. I popped out from the cupboard and went, "Guys, I can

72
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,040
 help. I can help." Shall we just quickly go back to Malcolm to check whether it's

73
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:46,640
 part of your surgery, you actually grow people hairy tongues. Yeah, and you said

74
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,040
 in your message, so you can reconstruct people's tongues, but you said in your

75
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,720
 message that it might be come from your forearm or your thigh and so when it

76
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,640
 comes in, that's where the hair comes from. I see. Isn't that something like your

77
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,800
 hair, even if you take it away, I suppose this is, and this will explain why

78
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,640
 people have hairy tongues, even if you take it away from a certain bit of your

79
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,400
 body, it always remembers it was there and grows in accordance with that. So I

80
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,520
 think there are things where like if you get some hair planted onto your head, if

81
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,800
 you want to sort out your baldness, for instance, then I believe if like the

82
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,480
 hairs, let's say you get it taken from your pubic region or something. I think

83
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,600
 that's the most common that people get. If the hairs that were around it start to

84
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,080
 fall out, then that one will also fall out. So your hair has a thing in it that

85
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,560
 tells you how long it needs to grow, right, because your eyebrows are not the

86
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,960
 same length as your head hair and your pubic hair is not the same. What you

87
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,040
 can't see at home for the podcast is that it has enormous hairs on her

88
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,040
 eyebrows. And so yeah, it has those and then when you transplant, say you put

89
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,400
 eyebrow hair on your head, they would all grow for that amount of time and then

90
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,920
 stop. Could you transplant all hair as in could you transplant eyelash hair onto

91
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,920
 your head, should you want it? Well, we have a surgeon in the audience. Don't ask

92
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,920
 us. Shall we do some more facts? Yeah, let's do another fact. Maybe the fact that

93
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,040
 only I and presumably the person who sent this in, who's called Jamie Drummond,

94
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:25,360
 will enjoy and it's that. Why are you reading it? Stop with the hard sell, Anna, please.

95
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,040
 I think sometimes it's good to have a private bonding moment in these mass

96
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,720
 experiences. Cool. In Gladiator, released in 2000, Russell Crowe had a dog, quite

97
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,760
 ferocious dog, played by a dog called Kite, who was a Belgian shepherd,

98
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,000
 apparently a terveur in Belgian shepherd. Anyway, she went on to be well-arred in

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,080
 EastEnders. Of course, so that's the name of the dog, well-arred. Yeah, well-arred in EastEnders,

100
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,880
 yeah, named by Gus, I think, who was a funny guy, which is why he named him

101
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,080
 well-arred. Great fact. That is a really good fact. Any more? Any more? This is a

102
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,720
 cool one. This is from Polly, or at saying nice stuff. My husband, Frank, says the

103
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,280
 electrical cable in this theatre would stretch from here to Grimsby if placed

104
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,760
 end-to-end. Yeah. Why haven't we done that? Yeah. Do you mean all the different cables,

105
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,320
 because presumably if it's a cable it is end-to-end already, it's just a cable,

106
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,240
 right? It's not a cable, is it all the cables? It says the electrical cable. There's

107
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,640
 one cable in this place, wow. But I think I feel like cable can be a plural

108
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,920
 kind of collective noun, right? All the cable in a place. You could say that, right?

109
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,840
 Yeah, I see that. We said that all the time. Another one on places. I've got one

110
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,240
 which someone sent in saying, "In Switzerland it's illegal to flush the

111
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,920
 toilet after 10 p.m." What? Illegal? Illegal, according to this person who

112
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,720
 apparently lives in Switzerland, as so they claim. I remember there was a woman

113
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,960
 who wanted to get a passport in Switzerland, didn't she? Do you remember? And in

114
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,880
 order to get a passport, she needed to get the permission of all the other

115
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,160
 people in her village. That's right. And they all hated her. Yeah. And they all

116
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,080
 wrote to the government saying, "No, we don't want her in our country." And she

117
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,120
 didn't. I think eventually she got it. Did she? I think so, yeah. Yeah, they were

118
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,400
 like, "She's so annoying. We just don't want her." Yeah. That's bad. Thank God we

119
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,800
 didn't have that system here. I'd be homeless. This is quite a cool fact. I

120
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,720
 think Danny might like this one. It's kind of spooky coincidence. Oh, cool, nice. So

121
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,720
 this was sent in by email from Nick Speechley and it's that in one of his

122
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,680
 recent rants, Kanye West, I know not a promising opening. We don't love a lot

123
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,920
 of his work. Claimed that Hitler, I also not promising. I'll give you that. There

124
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,800
 better be a huge U-turn coming on this fact. Claimed that Hitler invented the

125
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,720
 microphone, weird. In actual fact, the technology that 90% of microphones used

126
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:08,120
 today was invented by an African-American man who was called West. That's good.

127
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,960
 Spooky. Is Kanye trying to plant that in our heads somehow? What is he trying to

128
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,840
 do? Well, you think he's gonna then say, "Well, it's my relative, so I'm gonna

129
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,600
 take all the money." Oh, maybe, yeah. Yeah. Are you saying he's a gold digger is

130
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 what I'm asking? Oh, that's one of his songs. Is that a reference to him? Yeah.

131
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,040
 Is it true? We're sorry to move into Hitler, but I read years ago, years and

132
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,480
 years ago, that there was a story that whenever Hitler was gonna do a speech,

133
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,960
 the sound system, so this has to do with the microphones as well, the sound

134
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,760
 system would play a sort of note, a slightly annoying note, while everyone

135
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,680
 was waiting. So it was just one of those notes that, you know... Not the one that

136
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,960
 makes everyone poo. No, not the poo note, but like a certain age as you can

137
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,400
 hear certain ones, and it's just a little... Like a mosquito tone. Yeah, a mosquito tone.

138
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,360
 And the idea, again, don't know if this is true, the idea was that when he came on

139
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,680
 stage, they would turn it off, and the sense of relief that you would get when

140
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,120
 he came on stage played into the sense of, "Ah, someone who's gonna help us is here."

141
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,480
 It was just a little psychological thing. Has anyone heard that? I have heard that,

142
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,920
 yeah, from you. I bring it up every episode. Why is it not made it in? But that's

143
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,920
 actually what we were doing at the start of this show when, and for listeners at

144
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,160
 home, there were a series of maybe two or three dozen technical glitches, but it

145
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,880
 was just to create that sense of relief when we come on. Yeah, I've got a fact for

146
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:42,160
 you. Yeah, this is from Steve Early and it's this. I'm just gonna read it verbatim.

147
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,440
 "It is possible to make a tuba out of material other than brass, and somebody

148
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:58,640
 once made one from cheese. And it sounded okay." That's pretty good.

149
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,920
 I remember reading once that, I think this is tubas, I might be going completely

150
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,000
 wrong, but I think it's tubas. Basically, in America this is, all the high schools

151
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,920
 have all got bands, and they all have tuba players. But then, when you go to,

152
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,760
 like, top level bands, you only need one tuba player in a band, right? And so

153
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,200
 there's a massive, massive competition for tuba players in America, because

154
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,800
 there's loads of really good ones. Like, there might be loads of really good

155
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,880
 violinists, but you can have ten different violinists in an orchestra, right?

156
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,200
 Yeah. But there's not much use for a tuba. I would have thought it was always

157
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,560
 proportional, you know, in the schools. You've got, let's say, you've got lots of

158
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,200
 violinists in every school, so only a certain percentage of them are gonna

159
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,000
 get through to the... Well, they can also play in, you know, string quartets.

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,360
 I see. You don't get very many tuba quartets.

161
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,960
 Steve, can I just ask what kind of cheese it was?

162
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,440
 I'm guessing it was a fairly hard one. Oh, gotta be a hard one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,360
 I've got a fact about cheese, actually. This is Swedish cheese called "vastabottensåst".

164
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,640
 And apparently, when you make it, you require a bit of, you need to stir it

165
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,160
 and then leave it and then stir it and then leave it. And apparently, it was

166
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,680
 invented in 1872 by a dairy maid called Ulrika Lindström, and she kept being

167
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,040
 distracted by her work to go and have sex with a local boy. And she would go away,

168
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,920
 have sex, then come back and stir it, and then go away, have sex, come back and

169
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,960
 then stir it, and then when the cheese was made, she was like, "This is delicious."

170
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:40,680
 Yeah, but she must have been starving after that. Anything would taste good.

171
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,560
 Just quickly, I'm just thinking, if it was Edam, you could presumably get one of the

172
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,560
 holes to go all the way through, and then you'd have like a cheese tuba.

173
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,480
 You think of Leodamma? I don't think of Edam. And a tuba.

174
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,760
 It definitely has the holes, right?

175
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,560
 Edam's got holes in it, right? Oh, dear. No. Doesn't. Oh, wow.

176
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,480
 Ementol, I'm getting. Ementol. Yeah. Leodamma does as well, for sure.

177
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,760
 And Leodamma, yeah. That's probably why no one liked that joke.

178
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,000
 That would be the reason. Yeah, yeah. Make a good drum, and Edam, wouldn't it?

179
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,160
 I don't know what Edam is, as we now well know.

180
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,080
 I'm slightly struggling to remember what a tuba looks like.

181
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,840
 What does it look like? Well, imagine a big tube. Yeah.

182
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,320
 Surround it with brass. Yeah. There you go.

183
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,800
 In fact, do you know what you should imagine?

184
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,600
 Because I've always really loved this. You know, the fallopian tubes,

185
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,480
 if you can picture fallopian tubes. Of course.

186
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,680
 A common, everyday household item for Dan.

187
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,600
 From diagrams. You can see the shape of them, and they get wider at the bottom.

188
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,200
 Yes. So they were named after the tuba.

189
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,440
 Oh, really? Not tubes. Yeah.

190
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,520
 I would say more like a paperclip, but it's a big musical instrument, right?

191
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,240
 It's got those bending bits, and it's got... Yeah.

192
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,520
 I'm just trying to think of something that Dan might have seen more from the fallopian tubes.

193
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,720
 I've seen a lot of fallopian tubes, James.

194
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,520
 It is a fun Christmas fact that I got sent.

195
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,720
 I got sent this this morning. Nothing to do with the show.

196
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,560
 So @SteveDownUnder is not going to realise that he's made it onto our show,

197
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,400
 but he's written in from New Zealand.

198
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,560
 He DM'd me on Twitter, and he said, "Kia ora, Dan.

199
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,840
 "Quick fact for you. You might like to use for fish."

200
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,600
 Jesus had a disciple named Thomas the Testicle.

201
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
 No. No, no, no, no, no.

202
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,520
 Happy to elaborate if you're interested.

203
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,120
 Now, I don't want to be a doubting Thomas, but I don't think that's true.

204
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,440
 Why would he say that? What's he saying there?

205
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,000
 Thomas the Testicle.

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,400
 I don't know what he's saying.

207
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,280
 Does anyone in the audience have any idea

208
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,480
 if he might be making some kind of weird reference to an actual fact?

209
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
 Oh, is he hitting on me?

210
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,720
 We'll let you believe that's what it is, I suppose.

211
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,800
 We did actually put a call-out for some Christmas facts on Twitter,

212
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,200
 and we got some great ones in.

213
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,880
 So this is not from people in the audience here, but I did particularly like that.

214
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,480
 So I like this because I have friends who live in the Netherlands,

215
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,120
 and I refuse to believe they're this deranged.

216
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,560
 But in 2006, people in the Netherlands were banned from adopting rabbits over Christmas,

217
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,240
 because there's a popular festive song about a family cooking their pet,

218
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,600
 and it was believed that all Dutch people who adopted rabbits

219
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,560
 would just be trying to replicate that song.

220
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,880
 It's terrible, isn't it?

221
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,680
 And I think around the same time, the Dutch version of the RSPCA said

222
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,240
 that everyone who had a rabbit should keep it indoors

223
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,240
 so that no one would kind of pick it up and try and copy the song.

224
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,000
 How often do you sing a song and then sort of enact the lyrics as you do it?

225
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,080
 Yeah, I'm always going around bullying reindeer's.

226
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,200
 Yeah, apparently this is a thing, and it's really, really popular,

227
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,720
 and if you go to the Netherlands and they play the top 20 Christmas songs of the year,

228
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,000
 they always play this one.

229
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,080
 Oh, we've got to send another Christmas animal slaughter-related fact.

230
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,160
 I've got it here. It's from Holly T. I think you're in.

231
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,480
 Hi. This is great. I really like this.

232
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,560
 This is a historical fact. It's that in 1797,

233
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,920
 Tom the Goose was brought with thousands of other geese to the Leidenhol market

234
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,720
 in London to be slaughtered.

235
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,840
 But Tom escaped perusing the market and evading capture for days on end.

236
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,000
 His life was eventually spared, and he was adopted as the market's mascot,

237
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,040
 and he had a bar named after him, which is called Old Tom's Bar.

238
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
 The Goose.

239
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,840
 The Goose. Yeah, yeah.

240
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,600
 Do we buy that? I buy it.

241
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,000
 Yeah, I think so. And definitely we know that the geese were taken to town

242
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,840
 and they were walked all the way to town and stuff like that.

243
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,040
 They put little boots on them, wouldn't they?

244
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,760
 Well, that's what they say. They always say, "Oh, they put little boots on the geese."

245
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,480
 But actually, I think what they happened was they would dip the feet in, like, tars.

246
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,080
 I think they'd walk them through a big tars.

247
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not quite as nice.

248
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,520
 But that definitely did happen. That did happen.

249
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,000
 And they did used to always go rampaging the animals around Smithfield and stuff.

250
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 So, yeah.

251
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,800
 I would say more plausible than Tom as a testicle, if that's the...

252
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,920
 Yeah, that's true, yeah.

253
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,720
 ...high rocky. Of the Tom's, yes.

254
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,800
 Yeah. Yeah.

255
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,520
 This is a cool one. We got sent by @flamies, who I think is in here tonight.

256
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,440
 Diego, are you in here tonight? Diego's here.

257
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,520
 Google engineers in California had no clue about the Football World Cup,

258
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,520
 and were alerted to it when traffic dropped suddenly for more than half an hour,

259
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,440
 then suddenly spiked and went back down again.

260
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,480
 Nowadays, most tech companies have a dedicated sports event calendar as a result.

261
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,800
 It's just pretty cool how much it sort of influences the world.

262
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,720
 Yeah, except no one in this room who have continued with your ordinary lives

263
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,880
 despite the football match being on, and we respect you for it.

264
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,480
 Yeah. Here's one.

265
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,960
 In 1834, we also had three prime ministers in a year.

266
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,320
 So, we did this year.

267
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,160
 Lord Melbourne was the prime minister.

268
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,840
 He was sacked by the king, and Sir Robert Peel was chosen,

269
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,600
 but Sir Robert Peel was on holiday in Italy at the time.

270
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,760
 So, they sent someone out to find him,

271
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,560
 and while they were trying to find him, the Duke of Wellington was an interim PM.

272
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,080
 - That's good fact, isn't it? - Right.

273
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,560
 I love the idea of trying to just find the PM.

274
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,200
 Well, they just struggled with Boris, OK?

275
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,120
 Check the fridge.

276
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,800
 There was another fact about, oh, I think it was Lord Liverpool,

277
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,960
 who was the fifth Tory prime minister in a row,

278
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,200
 and was at the kind of late end of, you know, an administration,

279
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,840
 and wasn't seen as being very good at the job,

280
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,640
 was really young as well, was in his early 40s when he got the job,

281
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,000
 and he was in charge of 25 years.

282
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,840
 - Wow. - Yeah.

283
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,880
 Are we sure there wasn't a Thomas the Testicle?

284
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,160
 Because I feel like that would be, of all the disciples,

285
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,120
 the one you'd want at the last supper, right?

286
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,560
 - Like, he's... - Why?

287
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,160
 - He's the party disciple! - I thought you...

288
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,040
 Bring the party disciple, Thomas the Testicle!

289
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,440
 I thought you meant as a kind of dim sum option.

290
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,600
 - Who am I? - I've got another fact on bowls.

291
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,400
 - Oh, yeah? - Someone sent this in.

292
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,000
 My interesting fact is that frozen meatballs that go in pasta,

293
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,920
 ready meals, set off metal detectors.

294
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,320
 Now, can you guess? Let's see if you can guess why that might happen.

295
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,920
 - Frozen meatballs set off metal detectors. - Frozen meatballs.

296
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,960
 - Yeah. - They've got metal in them.

297
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,160
 LAUGHTER

298
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,000
 - Oh, it's a reasonable thought! - Yeah.

299
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,360
 - Because you wrap them in aluminium. - No, no, no.

300
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,640
 - That's good. - More surprising than that.

301
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,480
 - More surprising. - Is it to do with them being frozen?

302
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,160
 - The freezing process. - Why? Close.

303
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,240
 - Whose fact is it? - Jack.

304
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,320
 - Jack, can you explain why? - Because that's...

305
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,720
 When they're frozen, they're so dense.

306
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,600
 The metal detector isn't actually looking for metal.

307
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,960
 - They're supposed to be really dense on there. - Oh, I didn't know that.

308
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,200
 So metal detectors don't detect metal specifically.

309
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,840
 They detect the density of the object.

310
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,400
 - Yeah, and the meatballs are really dense. - Frozen meatballs are really dense.

311
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,800
 - The idea is... - That's why Dan sets it off whenever he goes through.

312
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,520
 LAUGHTER

313
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:55,840
 When I go home and my wife says, "How's the gig?"

314
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,120
 It's great. The room clapped for me at one point.

315
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,680
 - It felt great. - Here's one.

316
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,280
 This is from... I think you're in the room.

317
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,880
 Samuel Wilkinson, hello. So, Sam Wilkinson says,

318
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,160
 "Only five people on the planet know the formula for angostura bitters,

319
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,800
 "and they have made a pact to never fly on a plane together,

320
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,080
 "or even to eat in the same restaurant."

321
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,960
 That's a really good excuse if you've got people who you don't like, isn't it?

322
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,480
 Just give them something and you're like,

323
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
 "Oh, we can't go for dinner together. I'm sorry."

324
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,880
 - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.

325
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,720
 I was always told when I was a barman,

326
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
 "I don't know if this is true because I never looked it up,

327
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,360
 "that angostura bitters is technically poisonous. It's a poison."

328
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,200
 And that's why they always said, "You're only allowed to use a tiny little bit."

329
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
 - I don't know if that's true. - Maybe.

330
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,960
 I mean, everything's poisonous in large enough quantities, isn't it?

331
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,960
 - Yeah. - It's such a clever dick thing to say.

332
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,080
 Well, I got really worried recently because my husband made a meal for me,

333
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,080
 and it tasted quite strongly of a specific spice.

334
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,960
 I was like, "God, why is that? You put lots of it in."

335
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,120
 He said, "Oh, I just put loads of nutmeg in it."

336
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,360
 And I know, and I got suddenly quite nervous

337
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,760
 because you know, nutmeg is actually banned in a couple of countries

338
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,160
 because it is in certain quantities poisonous.

339
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,520
 And surprisingly, small quantities.

340
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,880
 Like, if you had two tablespoons of nutmeg, I think you'd be in trouble.

341
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,560
 - Really? - Yeah.

342
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,840
 And then I actually...

343
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,400
 I don't think I've admitted this to him, so maybe you don't tell him.

344
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,600
 But I wanted him to feel okay, so I said, "No, I'm sure it's fine.

345
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,400
 "How much did you put in?" And he showed me.

346
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,760
 And then I actually threw up

347
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,480
 because I thought, "I'm not fucking dying.

348
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,720
 "If this guy wants to die, if not my poisoning, he's good.

349
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,760
 "He can go, but I've got a long life to live."

350
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,280
 - Oh, my God, so... - But you thought it was worth saving yourself.

351
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,120
 Well, I didn't want him to think I was paranoid.

352
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,760
 Yeah, you certainly haven't come across as paranoid in this story.

353
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,480
 And then did you just watch him and see if he died?

354
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,960
 I watched him like an absolute hawk, yeah.

355
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,280
 - And he passed on that name. - Yeah.

356
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,760
 Is it legal these days to have a massive company

357
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
 and have all the ingredients on the back,

358
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,320
 but then go, "But there's a secret something we're not telling you?"

359
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,800
 - I don't know. - Can you legally do that these days?

360
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,480
 But they all do, don't they, like KFC and Coca-Cola and stuff?

361
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,760
 We've got allergies. We have, like, people have things.

362
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,880
 I think if you had peanuts in there, they'd make you put that on.

363
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,080
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

364
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,480
 Well, I don't get why they're not allowed to go to the same restaurant

365
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,760
 because, in case it's poisoned.

366
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,560
 - Well, if all five of them die in the restaurant... - Yeah.

367
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,320
 I see, yeah. But in case there's a poisoned chef in the restaurant...

368
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,480
 - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, okay.

369
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,040
 Hannah's husband working...

370
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,040
 Welcome to Nutmeg, Nick.

371
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,600
 There's a few things at the O's, right,

372
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,040
 where people aren't allowed to travel in the same plane or whatever.

373
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,200
 I can only think of the Wright brothers,

374
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,760
 - because they weren't allowed to fly in the same plane for years and years. - Yeah, me too.

375
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,920
 The Royal Family as well, there were certain things about that

376
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,760
 that's been said. I read, and again, don't know,

377
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,320
 - because we're just flying off with... - Yeah, yeah.

378
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,400
 We were telling the facts. It's possible this is true,

379
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,560
 that people who made the parachutes for NASA

380
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,760
 for the rockets that come back in, so Apollo 13, when the parachutes came out,

381
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,040
 the people who know how to make the parachutes,

382
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,280
 there's only, like, three people who know how to make their parachutes.

383
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,840
 - Can't be right. - It doesn't say that.

384
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,640
 Three people who know how to make their parachutes.

385
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,240
 Yeah, there's a secret ingredient to that.

386
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,800
 It's the ropes.

387
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,680
 Just on the Royal Family, by the way, because we just quickly mentioned them,

388
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:29,280
 when he was child, and the nanny told him to do something that he didn't want to do,

389
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,200
 apparently Prince William used to say,

390
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,880
 "When I'm king, I will have you punished."

391
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,320
 Oh!

392
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,600
 This is a cool one from Charlie Brook.

393
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,800
 In the 1960s, a British scientist began an investigation

394
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,160
 into whether there were people who could see the future.

395
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,880
 The project ended in 1968, when two of his subjects accurately predicted his death.

396
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:58,960
 - And this really happened, and this is, as Charlie Brook says,

397
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,880
 this is from a book called The Premonitions Bureau,

398
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,520
 which is a new book that came out this year by Sam Knight,

399
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,600
 and it was about a guy in London who, following a very tragic accident

400
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,160
 where a school was taken out by a landslide and there was a lot of deaths,

401
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,160
 a few people said that they had accurately predicted that this would happen.

402
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,320
 There was even a few school children from the school

403
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,040
 that had drawn these quite ominous drawings ahead of it,

404
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,680
 and so he thought, what if this is the case, a premonition was a real thing?

405
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,400
 What if we had a bureau in London that was able to accurately gather together

406
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,800
 all these predictions so that we could see if there was going to be a big train crash

407
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,480
 in the future, or a fire somewhere, we would be able to stop it before it happened.

408
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,560
 - And they predicted his death. - They both independently said...

409
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,640
 - Did they kill him?

410
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,200
 - Yeah.

411
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,240
 - I haven't got to the end of the book. - I went to Nostradamus's house this year.

412
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,520
 - I knew you were going to do that. - That was great.

413
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,040
 - What was your favourite thing? - Oh, it was a plaque. That's it.

414
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,560
 - That's it? - Yeah, yeah.

415
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,880
 - What was the plaque? Is the plaque said that he'd lived there, or was it like in Kodor?

416
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,440
 - It said he'd lived there, and it talked a bit about the stuff he predicted,

417
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,200
 which I don't think it's going to be true.

418
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,120
 - They hired you to work for their tourism outreach programme, didn't they?

419
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,840
 - Can I quickly say my favourite Nostradamus fact? - Oh, gosh.

420
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,040
 - And it's not a fact, obviously, but when he died, he was buried,

421
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,640
 and there was all these rumours swirling around that if you wanted to inherit

422
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,040
 the powers of Nostradamus, you had to get his skull, and you had to drink through his skull.

423
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:35,120
 And so he died, and then in 1791, which is, I think, maybe even 100 years after he died,

424
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,120
 in May of 1791, these grave diggers locate his grave, and they dig him up,

425
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,360
 and they open it, and there, laying in the grave, is Nostradamus.

426
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,160
 But around his neck, and on his chest, is a little board on which it's written,

427
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,400
 "May 1791," as if he went, "I knew you'd be here!"

428
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,960
 - Oh, my God. - That's good pranking.

429
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,360
 - Yeah, yeah. And is that true? Oh, it's not true.

430
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,560
 - I think this is really interesting. I can't believe I didn't know it, if it's true.

431
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,840
 This was sent in by Willoway Culpepper.

432
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,840
 So in Pennsylvania, you've got the Amish community, you know, they're called Pennsylvania Dutch.

433
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,040
 Do you guys know why they're called Pennsylvania Dutch?

434
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,880
 - I thought they originated in the Netherlands.

435
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,680
 - Apparently, they were German settlers, but they introduced themselves to the English,

436
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,320
 and what do they introduce themselves as? - Deutsch.

437
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,800
 - Deutsch. And the English one. - I know.

438
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,160
 - Yeah, sounds like you're probably Dutch.

439
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,600
 - And that's stuck ever since. - That's great.

440
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:43,880
 - OK, well, look, I think we've got a good pool of facts to pick from here

441
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,560
 for going into our fact-off for the nerdiest person in the room.

442
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,960
 So James and I are going to be deciding who are the two finalists,

443
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,400
 and whoever we pick is going to be on our team, so we're going to ask you to come up on stage

444
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,800
 and sit next to each of us, and we'll do this quiz along next to you.

445
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,360
 And so, James, do you want to pick first who...?

446
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:10,600
 - Yeah, I'm thinking that maybe to psych you out, we should go for the meatballs guy.

447
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,480
 Because it felt like you really lost it around that time.

448
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,760
 And I think by bringing him up on this side of the stage, that's going to really...

449
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,080
 - OK, all right, meatballs guy.

450
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,160
 And I will go for the lady who hasn't flushed her toilets since 10pm to 6am

451
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,600
 in the mornings every single night.

452
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,760
 - So, while you're making your way down and making your way to the front of the stage,

453
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,000
 we are going to find out the rules of the quiz, how it's going to be played,

454
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,680
 how we're going to determine the winner.

455
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,640
 So here to introduce it all is our quiz master herself, Anna Tyshinski, everybody.

456
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,560
 - Yes. Yes, so the way this is going to work, as we alluded to earlier,

457
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,280
 is we will be quizzing our two contenders, Jack and Gaia,

458
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,200
 and we're going to be quizzing them on how well they know the no such thing as a fish crew.

459
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,640
 So come on to stage, Jack, you're on James' team, I'm sorry about that.

460
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,640
 But if you take a seat there... - Ah, it's the winning team, Jack, don't worry.

461
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,720
 - And I just want to introduce you also to my little scoring boy over here on the left,

462
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,680
 Andrew the red-nosed reindeer.

463
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,920
 Hi, Gaia, you're on Dan's team.

464
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,480
 So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to read out some questions,

465
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,040
 and you're going to have to tell me which member of no such thing as a fish

466
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,720
 is the answer to those questions.

467
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,880
 Can you stop distracting your contestant, please?

468
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,960
 Um... OK, without further ado, let's start the quiz.

469
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,640
 So, question number one.

470
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,320
 Who once lost a quiz by saying one of the seven dwarves was called Bernard?

471
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,200
 Please choose quite speedily.

472
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,840
 Gaia, you've gone for Andy, Jack, you've gone for Dan.

473
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,160
 The correct answer is Dan Triber.

474
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,680
 Get in there. Come on.

475
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,560
 Cross it with me. What the fuck are you doing?

476
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,600
 I'm an idiot. She thinks too much of you.

477
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,200
 Oh, actually, that's very kind of you. Oh, thank you. Oh, OK.

478
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,080
 OK, question number two. So, sorry, scoring boy, what is the score?

479
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,240
 1-0.

480
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,680
 Thank you for your invaluable contribution to the game.

481
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,760
 Question number two.

482
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,200
 Who was given birth to in front of live observing students?

483
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,920
 And you guys have gone for James, you, Jack, have gone for me.

484
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,720
 Anna, the correct answer is me.

485
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,120
 Brilliant, Jack. Amazing.

486
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,760
 You knew it. You just knew it.

487
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,280
 Scoring boy, what have we got?

488
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,600
 2-0.

489
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,120
 Wait, sorry, why were people watching you when you were born?

490
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,120
 They asked my mum halfway through labour if she minded if...

491
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,560
 Excuse me, is that Anna Tyshensky?

492
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,840
 It's about to be.

493
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,720
 No, they said, "Do you mind as an educational process

494
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,680
 "if people can watch your child being born?"

495
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,360
 And she said, "Go for your life."

496
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,200
 And so, they asked about 20 people into the room.

497
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,640
 Oh, my gosh. Wow.

498
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,400
 Are they still in contact with the others?

499
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, she has them round every time, every Saturday.

500
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,680
 Every time you come back home.

501
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,600
 I squeeze myself through a very small window.

502
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
 The cat flap.

503
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,360
 OK, so question number three, and Jack, if you get this right

504
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,000
 and you get this wrong, then Jack's taken it.

505
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,360
 Who owns a light-up ear spoon?

506
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,760
 Who owns a light-up ear spoon?

507
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,000
 You've both gone for James Harkin,

508
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,400
 and the answer is James Harkin.

509
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
 Yes! Yes!

510
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,120
 Yes, Gaya!

511
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,920
 What's our score, then?

512
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,680
 3-1.

513
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,200
 3-1. Well done. You could call it back now.

514
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,400
 Yeah.

515
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,880
 But not if Jack gets this one right.

516
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,600
 So, who played Joseph in the nativity play

517
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,960
 alongside their brother, who played a blade of grass?

518
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:56,120
 You've both gone with Andy, and I'm afraid that's not right.

519
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,680
 No, I'm afraid it was me. It's not me, this guy, James.

520
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,920
 And he will be absolutely delighted

521
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,680
 we're bringing it up for this podcast.

522
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,520
 OK, so... No change.

523
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,560
 No change. There we go.

524
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,440
 Still on 3-1.

525
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,360
 And so, final... Oh, hang on.

526
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,720
 Let's do the final question anyway.

527
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,400
 I'm sorry, that was an underwhelming announcement

528
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,520
 to say that Jack's won this, but...

529
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,240
 Very, very hard to come back from at this point.

530
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,560
 But it's possible. It's possible. We can do this.

531
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,920
 We can do this.

532
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,160
 Gaya, according to Dan's brain, you can do this, and I believe in you.

533
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,600
 So... Double points.

534
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,760
 Who once had a brilliant, self-described,

535
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,320
 idea for a cheese chessboard?

536
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,280
 You've gone for Dan. You've gone for James.

537
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,800
 So, just to say, this is double points, right?

538
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,640
 Oh, we're actually giving Gaya a chance.

539
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,080
 I think we should, yeah. Double points.

540
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,920
 Well, you're both wrong. Just because I know the answer, yeah?

541
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,880
 Yeah, yeah.

542
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,240
 I'm afraid it was Andrew Hunter Murray...

543
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,000
 Guys, it's obviously my idea. Come on.

544
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,520
 The cheeseboard.

545
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,240
 But cheeseboard is already a thing.

546
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,080
 But every piece is a different cheese.

547
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,600
 As we've learned, you know so much about cheese.

548
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,440
 Well...

549
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,680
 I had an idea for a T-shirt

550
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,840
 where you have a chessboard on the front, right?

551
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,080
 And it's called "chest", right?

552
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,920
 So you have little velcro bits, right?

553
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,520
 And then, check this out. Check this out.

554
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,840
 On the back... What have you got?

555
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,680
 Backgammon. Backgammon. Oh, backgammon.

556
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
 Way better.

557
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,920
 Way better. That's why that didn't work.

558
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,440
 Monopoly's too complicated.

559
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,480
 So, Gaya, I'm so sorry.

560
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,240
 You're the second nerdiest person in the room,

561
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,040
 but I'm going to have to ush you offstage now.

562
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,080
 But, Jack, if you want to take center stage here,

563
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,840
 and I'm going to hand you over to Andrew Hunter Murray.

564
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,240
 Jack, well, you have done it.

565
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,040
 You did it with your facts.

566
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,360
 Get ready to take your prize, Jack.

567
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,040
 Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Jack,

568
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,920
 the nerdiest person in the room.

569
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
 CHEERING

570
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,040
 OK, that's it. That is all of our facts.

 Are you a bot, Jack?

581

 You're the nicest bot I've ever met.

582

 Andy?

583
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,760
 Andrew Hunter M.

584
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,400
 And James.

585
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,480
