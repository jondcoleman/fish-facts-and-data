00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 Hi everyone, welcome to the bit in between Christmas and New Year, where you're not really

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.880
 sure what day it is and you've eaten way too much turkey. It's Friday, so that means it's

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.560
 a no-six thing. There's a fish day, and what do we have for you today? We have the 2018 clip show,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.600
 all the best bits from this year that didn't quite fit into the actual episode, so it's all new,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.040
 you've never heard it. They're all times when we were just too silly, too stupid, people were making

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:32.080
 mistakes, there's loads of outtakes, and we'll see you with a brand new episode in 2019. So please

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:51.840
 enjoy it on with the show. Oh, no. Okay, my fat this week is that it might look like Anna is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:01.040
 drinking a pint of lime and soda, but that is a pint of wine. It's not. And this is not a podcast,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:10.480
 this is an intervention. We love you, we're worried about you. It's not a pint of wine, it was a pint

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:20.640
 of wine. There was only one wine glass in the green room genuinely, and Andy hogged it, so I had no

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.040
 choice. Practically threw it at me, saying no, no, no, it's fine, I'll use this. Okay, none of this could

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.680
 go into the podcast, so. So according to Old English folklore, if you dream of gathering nuts,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.480
 then that's a bad old man. There's an Old English proverb, which is a good year for nuts,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.160
 is a good year for babies. Very true. Very true. Can you guess why that is?

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.960
 There's lots of nuts. Nope. Do people use to think that I want to not fell from a tree, it cracked

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.200
 open and a baby came out. No, they weren't idiots. No, it's because gathering nuts was like you do it

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.600
 undercover as like a way of meeting people at the office in sex. Oh, I see. So you're like, oh,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 we're just going gathering nuts. And then you plant your seeds. And there's a thing here we go

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.560
 gathering nuts in May. Yes. And May is springtime. So do you think that could be a sexy? Well, weirdly,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.080
 that doesn't make any sense, because no, not your, I'm not rubbish in your theory. It's a really good

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.400
 theory. Thank you. The rhyme itself. Obviously, if you think about it, nuts aren't falling in May,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.200
 are they? I don't know. Well, you know, it's awesome. They followed the art. Yeah. Yeah. Right,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.520
 okay. Well, cool. That's all shaped, you know, suburbs, Murray. You do know what happens in

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.200
 Arton? Yes, Charlie. Conkins actually, yeah. Yep. Yep. There you go. With half a second's thought,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.040
 we could have avoided it. I didn't. So here we are. I think we're all pleased we had to go through it,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.840
 though. So what's gathering nuts in May? So actually, it's thought that it's the knots of May,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.920
 which is something that they used to refer to Hawthorne. So they're just gathering Hawthorne,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.320
 but that could have been a sexy thing to do as well, I think. Did you know that the first ever

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.320
 aircraft carrier was for hot air balloons? No. It was in the US Civil War, and they were used for

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.800
 reconnaissance, and it was called the General Washington Park Custis. It was a converted coal budge,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.200
 and it had its deck cleared, and it was used specifically to store lots of the Union hot air balloons.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.280
 That was the first ever aircraft carrier. That's very cool. That's very cool. But it didn't fly itself.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.600
 No, much like a normal aircraft carrier today. They just bob around on the ocean.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.400
 Excuse me. This aircraft carrier is not flying at all. I'm like a refund of my $50 billion.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.640
 I'm only ever listened to far as the word aircraft.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.480
 The story of the first nativity, I found quite sweet. So it was created by Francis of a CC. It was in

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.720
 1223. That was the first ever nativity scene, and it was because, you know, he was the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.040
 patron saint of animals, wasn't he? He was always shown with loads of rabbits crawling all over him and stuff,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:16.000
 in a nice way. It wasn't constantly tell you just with rabbits, fighting them off and having to kill

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.520
 them to get a bit of sleep at night. Why would these rabbits leave me alone? Trowning in rabbits.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:29.040
 Yeah. When he got up for air to gasp for air, he said let's make an activity scene, because at that

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.120
 time the Bible was read out in Latin in church at Christmas, and no one knew what anyone was saying,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.280
 and he really wanted it to become a bit more relatable for people and for them to actually understand

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.120
 what was going on. And so it was done with real actors, or well, probably not professional actors,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.280
 real people. It was done in a village in Italy, and it involved a manger and a real ox and a real

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:57.840
 donkey. And he quite sweetly had a wax model as the baby Jesus, and he tried to explain, as he

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.280
 was giving the sum, and that this was the baby Jesus, but he was so overwhelmed with the motion that

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.680
 he couldn't say the word Jesus. So in the first episode of the scene, the word Jesus wasn't said,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.000
 he just kept on saying the baby perfectly him, and he couldn't get it out. But then it really took

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.280
 off from there, and the hay from that very first nativity scene was then taken away by all the onnuckers

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.160
 and fed to their farm animals, and apparently, it cured them of all their malaria and other diseases.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.080
 That's how you cure it. Magic K. Horses can only breathe through their noses. I didn't realise as

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.680
 opposed to their mouths. Sorry, yeah, of course. As opposed to their anuses. I don't know where

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.960
 I was going with that. I saw you realising halfway through that question what the alternative was.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.760
 How's when you see one horse in the cold, and it's breathing? It comes out of the nose, doesn't it?

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.040
 So is the nostrils, isn't it? Yeah, so don't tape up a horse. Is nostrils or anything?

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.720
 No, okay. Press you are going to. I have to leave.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.240
 Churchill used to listen to translations of Hitler's speeches on a gramophone, and he would

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.040
 play back the bits where Hitler mentioned in my name. Did he? Yeah, that's very Trump-y, isn't it?

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:14.640
 Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is a bit. Oh. Why did he do it? Why? Yeah, it's just an ego trip.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.680
 I don't know. I don't know. I'll regret mentioning it.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:26.080
 I was looking at some strange driving rules that you can infringe abroad in this country,

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.840
 but I didn't realise this thing about parking rules in various countries can get so complicated.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.000
 So in various countries, but particularly in Sweden, you have this system that they call

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.200
 datum parkering, which is about parking on alternate sides of the street, depending on the date.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.160
 So if there's a certain sign on lots of streets, and what it means is if you see this sign,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.680
 then on the morning of odd dates, then you're not allowed to park on the side of the street

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.040
 where the houses have odd numbers. Oh my goodness. And on the morning of even dates,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.920
 you're not allowed to park on the side of the street where the houses have even numbers.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.480
 And so if you park in the evening, and it's going to be the next morning,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.600
 you have to plan for the next morning that it will be on the right side.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.400
 I mean, it just sounds like a way to get money off foreigners, doesn't it?

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.440
 That sounds a bit like that. The system in Paris that they have where only on Wednesdays,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.560
 like Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, odd numbers, nice and polite to relax. Yeah, yeah.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.480
 They did that in central South America. It might be in Mexico City, and what happened was

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.960
 just people bought two cars, and they were always old cars, because they had to buy two, so they had

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:33.280
 to be cheaper, so the pollution went way up. But it is this odd numbers houses thing seems to dictate

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.720
 as well in other countries. In Belgium, for the first half of the month, you can park on the side

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.840
 of the road with odd house numbers, and the second half of the month with even.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.280
 Just kind of a hassle if you have to jump out of your car and run up to a front door and check

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.560
 the house number. It's amazing. I'm 100% certain. In fact, I know I've parked in Belgium.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.960
 Yeah, it's not every road. There'll be a sign, and it's a special sign that they all recognize.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.200
 There's not even any word on it. It's just a random image.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:01.040
 That you definitely put forward a scratch at his head, giving away money.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.360
 That's when I went to New York, someone was telling me that the parking is actually

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.960
 surprisingly, if you're a resident in Manhattan, it's surprisingly easy and cheap to park outside

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.560
 your house and cost fairly nothing. And the only rule is that you have to want a week, you have to

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.080
 your car has to be out of the space for two hours while they clean the street.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.360
 It must be the same two hours for everyone, right? Otherwise, it's a poor street cleaner.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.080
 Every time he sees a car leave, he has to jump in there.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:32.080
 Just a clean of it. That can't be true, right? There's no way for two hours every week.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.720
 Every single car in town starts driving. It's not the same two hours. I'm sure there's a rotor

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.240
 of street, right? You know, there's like one, two hours. It's just all your neighbours turn up.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.960
 Hey, man, parking thing again. Yeah, that's all good, shall we?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.840
 We've taken a assumption that Manhattan has won street clean. He's got two hours.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.880
 Like a cleaning Santa to cover all of Manhattan.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.360
 Can't be done. I'd like to see that sitcom about that guy.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.080
 No, I think a Christmas festive film where he has to do it in one night.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.080
 Picture a few type on a keyboard and you're typing something and you don't look down.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.880
 You're one of those people who's got amazing words per minute.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.520
 So they did a study in a university where they got people to type 70 words per minute.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.760
 That was the goal. Can you get that fast?

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.360
 And everyone, 94% of the time, managed to do that.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.520
 They then did a second test on them, which was,

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.320
 can you now write out where everything on the keyboard is?

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.320
 Quarity. Can you write out the placings?

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.840
 And all they could manage was at top 15 of the letters of the alphabet they had known.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.440
 They had no idea where the rest were and it's all because it's all automatic memory.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.480
 Some things going on. The fingers are doing the dancing at that point.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.320
 That's really interesting. That's like, you know when someone says what's your pin number?

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.600
 If someone's, you know, paying with your card and often you have to go up and say,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.920
 "I need to type it in." You have that, right? Yeah.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.560
 It's like that. It's exactly like that. It's in your fingers.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.920
 The magic is here. That is the thing that brings.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.320
 This isn't a fact, but that's the worst feeling, isn't it, where your fingers stop remembering.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.600
 And then you just, you've lost it. There's no way to get your number back there.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.480
 It's just, it's all over. Is that just me? That's not just me, right?

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.520
 No, no, that's me, too.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.320
 Because I look away as well. I'm like, "Oh, come on."

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.640
 And then when it's wrong, you're like, "Oh, you were my last."

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.480
 Like, this isn't even my last, this asshole.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.800
 And then they say, "Sara, step away from the ATM machine."

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.840
 Maybe it falls out when you cut your nails.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.200
 It's just a theory.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.200
 It's just a theory.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.840
 Something else that rained down to earth was the earth's core.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.840
 What?

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.240
 So the earth's core is made of iron.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.960
 And the way that it got there, we think, is a massive meteor comes in,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.080
 hits the earth, vaporizes, goes into the sky,

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.680
 and then rains down and eventually seeps into the center of the planet.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.840
 So it's, it tunneled its way in.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.840
 Kind of. Well, it's dead, so isn't it?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.840
 Then anything else around it, and that's what it does.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.280
 It's that one that would have been iron rain, molten iron rain.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.040
 Yep. Wow.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.240
 He's a strong umbrella.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.240
 Yeah.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.480
 There was another dog called Rolf. It was a terrier.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.440
 And he spoke through tapping his paw against boards,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.960
 each letter of the alphabet, represented by different taps.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.280
 So if you ask them, all dogs are called Rolf.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.280
 Yeah.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.240
 It's a real dad joke, that one.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:32.240
 I read about a Bible-themed amusement park,

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.040
 which is in Bonacera's Tierra Santa.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.960
 And it is, it was meant to have like roller coasters and stuff like that.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.240
 They didn't end up doing that.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.680
 So it's a lot of sort of plastic Bible scenes that they've made.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.920
 So the scale down has gone quite a bit,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.200
 except for their one centerpiece for the whole thing,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.800
 which is that they have in the distance with a hill,

00:11:52.800 --> 00:12:00.000
 a 40-foot tall animatronic Jesus that comes out from the side of the mountain,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.320
 every hour as part of the resurrection.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:09.200
 He resurrects every hour of 40-foot Jesus out the side of the vaulted.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.080
 Well, it wasn't resurrected as a giant.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.480
 No, but he's really far away.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.120
 So maybe he looks really cloister when he, when you see it.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.080
 Wow, that sounds absolutely terrifying.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.800
 Yeah.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.720
 So nowhere the largest Jesus statue in the world is, just as a petrivia?

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.200
 I would have said in Rio de Janeiro.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.880
 No, there's a taller one in Sphibod's in Poland.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.480
 It's called Christ the King.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.920
 It's 108 feet tall.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.520
 And it has Wi-Fi transmitter in its crown.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.640
 Wow.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.520
 Just like the real Jesus.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.280
 Yes.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.000
 Any stuff on King Louis the 13th of France?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.360
 Got some stuff, yeah.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.320
 Because he did not calm his hair until he was nine months old.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.160
 Well, he probably didn't do it at that age.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.400
 But no one calmed his hair until he was nine months old.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.200
 How come?

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.200
 And no one washed his legs until he was five.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.800
 And he had his first bath at the age of seven.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.320
 Why did he start somewhere?

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.040
 So sorry, did they start with his legs?

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.360
 So they washed the rest of his body and then they didn't get to his legs until he was five.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.240
 They washed his legs first when he was five and tepid water.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.960
 And then when he was seven, he had his first bath at that stage.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.920
 Everything was clean.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.400
 Yeah, it's not like until he was five.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.440
 They only just quickly dumped him in the bath, but they were holding his legs.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.880
 So obviously he couldn't wash the legs.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.000
 No, he just didn't wash anything.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.040
 So they didn't wash anything.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.120
 So it was in the time when washing was seen to be perhaps not great for you.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.600
 Yeah.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.920
 His hair's combed what more do you want?

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.080
 At one stage, he boasted that he takes after his father and he smells of armpits.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:42.800
 Yeah.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.160
 He was a smelly man.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.960
 He was.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.800
 But he had a horrible upbringing.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.920
 I think his parents might have just not washed him out of spite.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.680
 He was a very, very sad man.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.280
 I grew to really like him.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.640
 And so his mother tried to keep the throne for as long as possible.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.360
 So he was made king officially, I think, about age nine.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.560
 But his mother was desperate to stay region and hated her son.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.840
 And so she would humiliate him or keep him out of power.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.880
 So once when he was 15 and he's king, he's in front of his court,

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.560
 she'd just still up and slapped him in the face just to tell him off.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.640
 Another time he tried to attend a meeting of the Royal Council that he was supposed to be holding.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.440
 And whereupon the source I was reading said,

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.480
 "Whereupon she took him by the shoulders and threw him out of it."

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.120
 So she was real harsh.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.080
 That was harsh.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.600
 And she also forced him to sleep with his wife.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.000
 So we really know almost every historian can curse that he was gay.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.480
 And he never had any mistress.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.760
 He never showed any interest in women, showed a lot of interest in men.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.080
 And he was married off to Anavostria,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.840
 who was confusingly a Spanish queen when they were both gay.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.520
 And shut that must have been so annoying for her,

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.920
 always being asked, "So what's it like in Austria?"

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.840
 My parents just had a silly sense of humour.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.320
 She, Anavostria of Spain, came over.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.600
 Her brother Dave of Denmark.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.840
 Yes, she came over to marry him and he had to be physically carried into the wedding bed

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.880
 because he was desperate not to sleep with her and he was really freaked out.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.000
 And two nurses were there to monitor the act to make sure it happened,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.240
 because otherwise you could sort of get an annulment,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.960
 and that would ruin the alliance between Spain and France.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.120
 And then he ran out of the bedroom as soon as he'd done it and refused to even enter it,

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.000
 or eat with his wife or speak to her for about six months.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.960
 Wow.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.320
 He had a regimental Croatian mercenaries that he liked.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.640
 We were actually from Portugal.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.120
 And they are famous for what reason?

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.000
 Because they uniform.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.200
 Ooh.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.920
 The crevettes.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.200
 Because they wore crevettes.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.160
 They wore neckties.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.320
 And because crevazka is Croatian for Croatia,

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.640
 they became known as crevettes,

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.000
 and that's where we get the word from.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.080
 Ooh, that's so cool.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.440
 And he was also big on wigs.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.960
 He was sort of the original--

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.840
 Yeah, he was a big wig.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.200
 He was the original wig wearer.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.320
 Let's see.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.040
 In the way that crevettes sort of became fashionable,

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.560
 he brought them back into wigs back into fashion as well.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.840
 So he was thinning in his hair, and he wanted to disguise that.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.560
 And the surrounding friends all thought,

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.320
 "We want to help you out and not make you look like the only person wearing a wig."

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.160
 So they wore wigs as well, and that spread,

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.840
 and everyone was wig wearing again.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.440
 Anavastria popularized hot chocolate.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.640
 Did she?

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.720
 Yeah, she brought it over from Spain.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.560
 And it became an instance data symbol,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.600
 and they said that only the aristocracy were allowed to drink it.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.200
 And that was true for a while, and then after a while,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.280
 everyone was allowed to drink it in front.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.960
 I know I've said this before.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.960
 It is easy to see why they had a revolution

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.120
 if they're saying only we can drink hot chocolate.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.640
 Yeah.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.400
 I'm amazed it took a hundred years after this.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.160
 There is a theory that there is a bonus track hidden in the last supper.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.840
 What do you mean?

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.680
 Is that the bread rolls on the table are a musical arrangement?

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.240
 Come on.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:06.960
 And if you play the bread rolls from left to right along the last supper, it plays a tune.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.320
 So presumably people have done this.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.480
 Yes, I clicked on it earlier today, and it said video unavailable.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.400
 We just, so we don't know what the tune is now.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.880
 No, I've actually heard it.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.560
 Yeah, and it's a tune that does work.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.360
 So it's--

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.480
 So I'm not making this up.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.360
 No, you're not making this up.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:27.760
 Thank you.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.240
 Yeah.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:28.960
 I've never seen this before.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.320
 I've never seen it like I've been making it up.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.400
 I mean, the guy who discovered it is insane,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.840
 but it's not real.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.880
 It's not a real thing.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.080
 He's looked at bread rolls and thought that looks like a quaver.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.200
 Like that's not a thing.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.800
 Did you guys hear about the countdown thieves in 2009?

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.600
 No.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.960
 So these were some, I think I might have read this in the Daily Mail,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.920
 but these were thieves that the police were hunting for who were stealing

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.400
 some bit letters from shop signs.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.280
 In Norwich, they did it to seven stores over three nights,

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.360
 and they were seeing specific letters,

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.800
 and then one of them was caught on camera and was overheard saying,

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.640
 "I'm just trying to spell my own name."

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.160
 And so then the police released the fact that they were looking for people

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.960
 who might be called one of these names.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.240
 Sam, Danny, Alan, Lloyd, Glyn, or Manning.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.000
 Can they realize that Manning did turn Manning?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.360
 He pulled on hard times.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:29.920
 I once tried to convince Dan Schreiber that one of the lines

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.920
 in the English national anthem was,

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.800
 "Oscopistoria."

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.400
 Has it?

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.800
 Everything else seems to rhyme with that.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.160
 And he was like, "That's not true.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.280
 Surely, surely, isn't that."

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.840
 And I was like, "When are they going to pull out his phone and Google it?"

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.880
 And he pulled out his phone.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.920
 He was like, "It's not true, right?"

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.280
 And I was like, "No, of course it's not true."

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.000
 "You're not going to do anything."

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.880
 He sounds like an idiot.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.920
 Yeah, but I'm on.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.000
 I discovered a few things that genuinely surprised me about both ears

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.440
 and what we can hear and what we can't hear.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.560
 So first thing that shocked me is that when we're asleep,

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.240
 our ears are still listening.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.840
 Isn't that weird?

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.760
 Well, how do you think loud noise is where you are?

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.480
 I pull out.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:13.840
 Just so you went deaf, deaf and blind.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.440
 Oh, she's got her there, pal.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.720
 I assumed that that was some sort of like secret knock to let.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.240
 Like it's just, if it's at a certain loudness and maybe,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.440
 then you get woken up.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.400
 But I did genuinely think that when you went to sleep,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.400
 you sort of just, "Boo, shut down."

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.000
 And your ears kind of just went, "Okay, I'm taking the night off as well."

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.040
 And you are alone in thinking that, I think, "Yeah."

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.880
 Really?

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.800
 So let's move on to my next amazing thing.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:47.520
 Apparently, when this is a noise that we can't hear that we make on our own,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.000
 when you rub your forefinger and your thumb together,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.920
 you make an ultrasonic signal.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:58.640
 It works so clearly that people often use it to detect

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.040
 whether a bat detector is working.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.560
 So you rub it against a back detector, and that will give you a signal.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.400
 So anyone listening, I'm doing it now.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.680
 If you just go to your bat detector, and I wonder if over a podcast, I can set it off.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.400
 Well, do you know that?

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.200
 Anna.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:13.760
 I'm so sorry.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.240
 I mean, change.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.920
 Sorry, what is a bat detector?

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.480
 Who has bat detectors?

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.280
 People with bats.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.320
 What do you mean a bat detector?

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.320
 Something that's detecting the ultrasonic sounds of bats,

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.360
 like a scientific instrument.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.320
 Right, yeah.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.120
 Must be.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.160
 But yeah, that's...

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.720
 Dan, for the listener at home,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.080
 Dan has been rubbing his finger and thumb by the mic for about 30 seconds now.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.400
 And if I could get, and your home will be full of bats.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.120
 Did you know that laughing cow is Comte?

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:43.920
 Cheese.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.720
 What do you mean?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.360
 I love...

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.320
 Sorry, I don't know Comte.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.320
 Oh, maybe...

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.840
 No, maybe this is just a thing that we have in my family because I love it.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.480
 It's like really creamy, nice European cheese.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.120
 I don't think you're family the only people here.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.440
 I don't think there's a special Tujensky family cheese.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.640
 Tujensky's?

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.120
 I...

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.920
 Wow.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.920
 I mean, it was a hard one,

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.920
 and I tried it, and it didn't work out.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.960
 It used in ski.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.960
 Yeah, it does the obvious shit.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.480
 The great Pitch and Race disaster

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.600
 was something that Anna posted about on the QI Bards a few years ago,

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.560
 and that I read about.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.360
 Do you remember that?

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.480
 I love it.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.000
 I couldn't believe I've never mentioned it before,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.680
 when all the pigeons disappeared.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.000
 Because there's an extremely famous Pitch and Race.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.160
 Sorry, extremely famous among Pitch and Fancy's.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.560
 And it's between Paris and London.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.000
 It's between France and the UK.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.560
 And it was in the 80s or 90s.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.320
 It was from Nantes to the UK to the people's homes in the UK.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.080
 And yeah, there were 60,000 pigeons taking part

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.840
 and 90% of them disappeared.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.160
 And no, it never happened, like every year before that, they'd all arrive back.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.960
 No, a new way.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.360
 There's a theory that there was a Concorde flight

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.120
 that was going over the channel at the time,

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.760
 and that disrupted their magnetic impulses and cookies.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.200
 Sorry, were we in?

00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.920
 '97.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.280
 Oh, okay.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.160
 So quite recently.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:02.960
 Yeah.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.680
 And there was one guy called Tom Rodin

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.320
 who lost his winning champion Pitch and White Tail.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.960
 And five years later, the Pitch and was on his doorstep.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.440
 Yeah.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.240
 Oh, no way.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.440
 Five years.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.640
 I want to see the movie about one hundred and five years.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.280
 I'm guessing that was awesome.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.560
 Do you think he over the dawn?

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.840
 Where the hell have you been?

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.040
 Have you heard of Bristol's punctuation Banksy?

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.200
 This is an amazing guy.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.600
 He was active at least until last year.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.640
 So he goes around just correcting poor punctuation.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.120
 And there was an interview with him recently.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.160
 He has built himself a device he calls an apostrophyser,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.840
 which is a very long-handled bit of kit,

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.840
 which allows him to either cover over an apostrophe

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.440
 or shouldn't be there in a sign,

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.480
 or add one in if he needs an extra one.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.080
 And someone said to him what he was doing was probably illegal,

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.760
 going around, knocking around with businesses sign,

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.520
 just for having an apostrophe in the wrong place.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.480
 And he said,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.560
 "I'm sticking on a bit of sticky-back plastic.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.800
 It's more of a crime to have the apostrophys wrong."

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.680
 He's wrong about that.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.640
 I think he's wrong.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.400
 But he's been going since 2003.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.120
 Wow.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:09.840
 So, yeah.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.440
 So he's been getting away with it that long?

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.320
 Yeah, and also...

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.120
 How has he not been apprehended?

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.600
 How misspelled is Bristol that he's still in operation?

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.320
 Is he only correcting the word Bristol?

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.560
 Yeah, imagine if he thought that Bristol had two S's.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.440
 He's like, "They've got it run again."

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.320
 I think it's not a full-time job.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.200
 It's also not a job.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.000
 But he is cool, as you say,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.640
 the Banksy of Punctuation or Apostrophe Avenger.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.080
 So he's got, you know, cool names.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.920
 They feel ironic to me, those names.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.120
 They feel self-given.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.000
 Yeah.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.520
 There is a National Punctuation Day in America.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:43.760
 So...

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.840
 And CNN interviewed the guy, he's called Jeff Rubin, who set it up.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.200
 He used to be a reporter.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.440
 And CNN wrote that he grew increasingly frustrated

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.440
 as he spotted errors in the newspaper.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.480
 I quoted him,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.880
 "I would sit at the kitchen table with my red Sharpie,

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.280
 screaming obscenities, which were upset my wife."

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.680
 She encouraged me to find another outlet for my aggravation.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.880
 So he set up National Punctuation Day.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.400
 Oh, good on him.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.600
 I mean, good on...

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.120
 Yeah, it's better for his wife.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.320
 Sort of. I wonder if that has solved his quite deep-seater character flaws

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.240
 that I'm interpreting from that story.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:16.480
 But...

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.440
 Whatever he had to do.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.280
 They had things called dog dramas in the 19th century,

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.320
 early 19th century,

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.880
 where the dog was like the hero of the play.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.120
 So they would usually have other human actors,

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.440
 but the dog would do the really heroic things.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.120
 There was one where the show ended with a dog jumping in the pool of water

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.240
 and saving a child.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.400
 But what would often happen is

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.480
 mischievous theater goers would throw meat onto the stage to describe the dogs.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.920
 That's so funny.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.680
 Thus drowning a child, but...

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.120
 It's all good fun for the audience, isn't it?

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.680
 So you know the idea of just going back to the fire of London.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.400
 Did you guys know that the sort of, there's a worshipful company of bakers,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.760
 it's sort of the union of the bakers.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.240
 They apologized officially for it.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.800
 Yeah, 320 years later.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.440
 So after the legal threat, it's diminished.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.600
 Well, it's never too late to apologize.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.320
 Said the then Lord Mayor of London, who's called Alan Davis.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.120
 Do you guys remember Alan Davis?

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.080
 That must have been only an excuse.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.840
 I remember the guy who was in QI.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.520
 Yeah, it's still in QI, by the way.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.480
 He used people here in this.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.920
 Yeah, he used to be the Mayor of London.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.720
 No, no, Alan Davis.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.120
 I think around 1986, this would have happened if it's 320 years after 1666.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.680
 And I did work that out.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.840
 And it did take ages.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.120
 This is closest as I come to sounding intelligent.

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.400
 Yeah, they they apologize to officially for it.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.520
 That's good that they admitted to it finally, because at the time,

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.080
 the French and the Dutch were blamed all across town.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.160
 And loads of French and Dutch were arrested.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.480
 And I think that was beaten up.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.080
 And yeah, beaten constantly.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.520
 So we were at war or Britain was at war with France and in Netherlands,

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.280
 there was probably Protestant plots everywhere.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.240
 And so I think there was a French woman who had a breast cut off

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.760
 because people thought what she was carrying was explosive devices.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.560
 And it was just...

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.520
 It was chickens.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.480
 Oh, right.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.280
 She was carrying some chickens and people thought they were fireballs.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:16.240
 You would have thought in the process of chopping off someone's boobies.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.720
 You would find out that they weren't fireballs.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.400
 They were chicks, wouldn't you?

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.200
 Yeah.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.160
 You've gone too far, then.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.760
 You've got to go through with it.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.800
 You're right.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.080
 There are parallels with our current political climate.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.960
 Unfortunately, have we progressed?

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.800
 Yes.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.240
 This is the big breast cutting off of the 21st century.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.080
 Yeah, it's the horrific metaphor that we find ourselves in.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.880
 Wow.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.120
 In 2010, in Belgium, there was a guy who was experimenting with the idea

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.920
 of solving the problem of pigeons pooing all over cities.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.120
 So massive problem, poo on your head, poo on car windows.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:51.920
 Yeah.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.600
 It's on your head.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.640
 And so what he's attempted to do,

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.080
 and I don't know if this has actually worked,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.120
 but he's tempted to create a special bacteria

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.760
 that when it's fed to the pigeons, it metabolises,

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.160
 and when they defecate what comes out is not poo,

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.000
 but a soapy-like substance.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.760
 So they end up cleaning your head, shampooing your head,

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.800
 and cleaning the streets.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.240
 I'd say we've had a few shelters, I think.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.040
 You don't want to squeeze a pigeon over your head in the shower.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.600
 Yeah, so the idea is that-

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.200
 It's not make them poo soap.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.160
 It's not fair.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.080
 It's not fair, but it's probably possible.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.680
 But I just couldn't-

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.600
 Where's the waste product going?

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.440
 I mean, there's poo in that soap.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.400
 Yeah, there is poo in there.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.360
 It's pooey soap.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.640
 It's pooey soap in there.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.040
 Yeah.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.520
 I suppose what they're saying is, okay,

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.920
 so there are soapy molecules in there.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.720
 Yep.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.960
 Which will attach to the pooey substances,

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.120
 and when it rains, it will be easier to flush away.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.480
 Does that make sense?

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.280
 It feels like-

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.600
 I forgot that poo has to come out at some point.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.320
 So yeah, that must be the logic.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.560
 Unless these pigeons are just growing bigger and bigger and bigger,

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.880
 and eventually they're just explode with their own feces.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.840
 But I don't think-

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.000
 It's more problems to completing a facility.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.800
 It certainly does.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.280
 But they were-

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.400
 It's a very short-term solution.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.760
 This wasn't just a mad guy.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.280
 They were given a grant by the Flemish Architecture and Design Committee

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.320
 and Ministry of Culture.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.560
 Like it was a funded proper science-

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.320
 So we're going to the Ministry of Culture, though, wouldn't you?

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.120
 If you had this-

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.560
 Not slightly strange idea.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:14.960
 That's true.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.160
 There's no other science people.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:20.000
 There is a thing, there's a-

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.040
 This is another amphipod, which this is originally about,

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.000
 and it's called-

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.600
 And I'm going to take a run up at this-

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.640
 Sudamphithoidis Incavaria.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.880
 It lives in the Caribbean and it eats seaweed.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.960
 And this is another really sort of just a weird defense mechanism in nature.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.160
 So the seaweed that it eats has chemicals which deter fish.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.240
 Same deal, it gives off toxic chemicals.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.360
 But the amphipod, it doesn't just eat it.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:48.080
 It also makes a little house for itself out of this algae.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.600
 And it has-

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.200
 Have it some food, I guess, right?

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.600
 Yeah.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.120
 Like a gingerbread house kind of thing.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.200
 Yeah, exactly like that.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.800
 And so, exactly like that.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.280
 And it swims around with its head and front legs sticking out of this-

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.960
 It's more like a sleeping bag, I guess.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.480
 It's more like a more sleeping bag than a house.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.600
 A gingerbread sleeping bag.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.440
 Yeah.

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:10.000
 Or like a ham sleeping bag.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.080
 Like a hamock.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.520
 Like a hamock.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.120
 Wow.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.880
 You guys are going to be so surprised by the laugh that comes after that when the podcast comes out.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.040
 I don't remember that being nearly as funny on the night.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:30.800
 A lot of pigeons are being smuggled out of Syria at the moment.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:37.840
 So because Syria was the world-leading pigeon breeding place.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.120
 So in the Middle East they say, you know, all the best pigeon breeders are Syrians.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.800
 And now they're getting sent over the board because obviously it's not safe for them to be there

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.080
 anymore and pigeon fanciers in Syria can't keep them anymore.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.600
 And so there are lots of collectors who are going on these kind of death-defying missions

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.440
 to get them. There's a guy who's spent five million dollars on Syrian pigeons.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.240
 This is a guy called NASA who's a Jordanese, Jordanian, who's Jordanian.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.160
 And there was one instance where 70 pigeons were killed when they were being smuggled across

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.960
 the border and they got caught in a fight.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.320
 So yeah, it's taken its toll on the poor pigeons.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.440
 But yeah, they are- they are really valuable there.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.680
 That's amazing. Act by the Great, who was a Mughal Emperor around there.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:23.600
 In the 16th century, he always travelled wherever he went with his personal colony of 10,000 pigeons.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.560
 10,000?

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.600
 What? They're only small.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.520
 I can have 10,000 of one rooms, please.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.200
 I don't think they all got their own room.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.720
 No, maybe not.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.960
 But they could like- some of them were really beautiful.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.000
 Some of them could do tricks and tumble through the air and, you know.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.040
 Some of the poods so well.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.560
 There's a whole whole thing.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.400
 Did he name them all?

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.400
 I don't know. I doubt it.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.240
 No, he probably named his favourite ones.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.120
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.040
 That is impressive.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.200
 I'm taking a register every day for that.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:01.520
 Do you guys know what's happened to actually the original manuscript of the origin of species?

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.560
 On the origin of species?

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:02.720
 Nope.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.480
 So it has various drawings on it.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.840
 So for instance, it has a drawing of a green fish with pink legs and fins and a bright blue umbrella.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.960
 And this is covered in these doodles.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.440
 And this is because Charles Darwin was a really fun dad.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.880
 So we wrote the origin of species.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.800
 And then he gave it to his kid.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.240
 So I was like, "Well, I'm done with this now.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.200
 I've had this idea.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:23.680
 Have that."

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.440
 And it's covered in his kid's doodles.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:25.920
 Cool.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.880
 And so,

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:31.440
 I read the book and thought maybe one day animals will evolve to have an umbrella.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.800
 Yes.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.920
 Yeah, maybe actually Darwin discovered a lot more than he led on.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.320
 Yeah.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.200
 You know, he did, we wanted to keep it secret.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:39.680
 Yeah.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.480
 So he put around the story,

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.920
 "Oh yeah, my kids just drew that weird creature with 15 legs and...

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.880
 ...an umbrella growing out of its fin."

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.360
 Yeah.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:47.680
 Yeah.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.800
 So it was actually him who drew it and he was backtracking on his own illustrations.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:51.600
 That's what I'm saying, right?

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.320
 Darwin drew these secret animals that didn't exist.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.520
 Because he thought if they don't believe that,

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.600
 relatively plausible evolution and stuff,

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.600
 they're never going to believe in the umbrella fish.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.080
 Another Canadian thing.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.840
 Well, do you know what the national animal of Canada is?

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.640
 Which I think is a bit right.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.440
 It's not a user?

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.240
 Yeah, it's a beaver.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.040
 It's a beaver, yeah.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.960
 It's what I just always think it's such a great thing to have bears.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.400
 I would have picked that.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.040
 But it's really controversial, they're not really into having the beaver.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.040
 It's been debated whether they should ditch it since the mid-19th century.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.880
 And in 1964, I was reading a lecture that a Canadian historian gave

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.680
 that complained that the beaver is representative of English Canada rather than French.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:32.000
 And that means that it represents a pretty intelligent animal on a rather low level

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.120
 who is very fond of work and has not much idea beyond that.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.920
 So that was his impression of what the English element of Canada

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.320
 had given to the country that the beaver represented.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.560
 And what did the French area want in?

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.680
 I'm not sure actually, what would the French animal be?

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.840
 Not a beaver or something with fur that was cute that we would kill.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.120
 Yes, a bear.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.000
 Yes, a bear, or a seal butt.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.440
 Lovely.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.280
 But we're introducing beavers to Scotland at the moment, isn't that?

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.080
 Yeah.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:02.800
 The new thing.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:03.360
 Yeah.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.160
 And very interestingly, when they were introduced wolves in the various parks in North America,

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:14.320
 particularly in Yellowstone, it had this extraordinary effect of increasingly beaver population,

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.560
 which no one had considered, but it just a sort of another example of how into

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.840
 related everything uses, that the wolves slightly kept down the elk's stroke moose.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.480
 And they didn't go as far south and they didn't eat the young vegetation

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:34.880
 on which the beavers relied to make that sort of fluff up their dams.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:41.200
 But they thrived because of the, but miles, you know, a thousand miles north

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.400
 where the wolves were was affecting the beavers in the south.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.600
 Wow, you couldn't have predicted that, really, could you?

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.680
 No, it's marvellous, it's like a butterfly effect in a way.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.680
 It is, so I wish a mess with it.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:59.840
 Another Canadian thing, one more thing, Poutine, so this...

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.040
 Yes, nice delicious food.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.280
 Yeah, gravy, sort of gravy on...

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.040
 Gravy on chips with curd.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.840
 That's it.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.240
 ...on it.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.480
 Right, and they give it a post-sounding name to convince us.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.400
 It doesn't sound like Ellie D's name for a lady part.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:17.680
 Well, the thing is, in French parting speaking Canada, it's kind of unusual sounding to them,

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.680
 because in France, you don't call Vladimir Putin, Poutine.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.000
 Because in France, Putin means prostitute.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.040
 Of course, Putin, yes.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:25.680
 Putin, yes.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.720
 So in France, they all call him Vladimir Poutine.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.720
 And so in Canada, they have like a Vladimir's Poutine

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.520
 and restaurants.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.720
 Ah!

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.160
 Very cool.

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.440
 Do you know when the queen takes her Christmas decorations down?

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.840
 Never. Never.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.360
 She's one of those weirdos who has them all here.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.840
 Yeah, she waits till February, February the 6th, and it's actually quite sweet.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.800
 It's an honor of her father who died on that day.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.200
 And then they do these weird things when they have their Christmas dinners.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.320
 So this year, Meghan Markle will be weighed before she has her Christmas turkey,

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.720
 as will all of the royal members.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.320
 They do this thing where they weigh them.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.520
 They all stand on a weighing scale.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.080
 Just the numbers, though, the people as well, right?

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.320
 Sorry, I'm ashamed.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.200
 Yes, they will be weighed.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.280
 The royal Christmas toddler weigh it.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:26.560
 So they weigh the full of humans, and they then have the meal,

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.680
 and then they weigh them afterwards again to see whether or not they've been

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.480
 well fed enough.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.480
 That's the symbolic idea of that.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.240
 So you have to eat the most.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.040
 Do you have to gain the most?

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.840
 I don't think it's a game.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.320
 I think it's just a tradition.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.760
 And also, the queen likes to wear it.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.320
 Again, this is, like you say, a lot of this stuff is put out there,

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.960
 who knows if it's true, from their official sources.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.160
 She likes to wear the paper crown from a cracker.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:50.800
 That's her thing.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.160
 Is she?

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.360
 Quite nice image, isn't it?

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:59.280
 Wouldn't it be great to rig up Prince Charles's cracker?

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.960
 So there's never a crown inside?

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.960
