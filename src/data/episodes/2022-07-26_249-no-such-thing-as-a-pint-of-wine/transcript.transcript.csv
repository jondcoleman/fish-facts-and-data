00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, welcome to the bit in between Christmas and New Year, where you're not really"
00:00:04,00:00:08,"sure what day it is and you've eaten way too much turkey. It's Friday, so that means it's"
00:00:08,00:00:14,"a no-six thing. There's a fish day, and what do we have for you today? We have the 2018 clip show,"
00:00:14,00:00:19,"all the best bits from this year that didn't quite fit into the actual episode, so it's all new,"
00:00:19,00:00:25,"you've never heard it. They're all times when we were just too silly, too stupid, people were making"
00:00:25,00:00:32,"mistakes, there's loads of outtakes, and we'll see you with a brand new episode in 2019. So please"
00:00:32,00:00:51,"enjoy it on with the show. Oh, no. Okay, my fat this week is that it might look like Anna is"
00:00:51,00:01:01,"drinking a pint of lime and soda, but that is a pint of wine. It's not. And this is not a podcast,"
00:01:01,00:01:10,"this is an intervention. We love you, we're worried about you. It's not a pint of wine, it was a pint"
00:01:10,00:01:20,"of wine. There was only one wine glass in the green room genuinely, and Andy hogged it, so I had no"
00:01:20,00:01:27,"choice. Practically threw it at me, saying no, no, no, it's fine, I'll use this. Okay, none of this could"
00:01:27,00:01:33,"go into the podcast, so. So according to Old English folklore, if you dream of gathering nuts,"
00:01:33,00:01:40,"then that's a bad old man. There's an Old English proverb, which is a good year for nuts,"
00:01:40,00:01:46,is a good year for babies. Very true. Very true. Can you guess why that is?
00:01:47,00:01:54,"There's lots of nuts. Nope. Do people use to think that I want to not fell from a tree, it cracked"
00:01:54,00:02:03,"open and a baby came out. No, they weren't idiots. No, it's because gathering nuts was like you do it"
00:02:03,00:02:09,"undercover as like a way of meeting people at the office in sex. Oh, I see. So you're like, oh,"
00:02:09,00:02:15,we're just going gathering nuts. And then you plant your seeds. And there's a thing here we go
00:02:15,00:02:22,"gathering nuts in May. Yes. And May is springtime. So do you think that could be a sexy? Well, weirdly,"
00:02:22,00:02:28,"that doesn't make any sense, because no, not your, I'm not rubbish in your theory. It's a really good"
00:02:28,00:02:32,"theory. Thank you. The rhyme itself. Obviously, if you think about it, nuts aren't falling in May,"
00:02:32,00:02:37,"are they? I don't know. Well, you know, it's awesome. They followed the art. Yeah. Yeah. Right,"
00:02:37,00:02:43,"okay. Well, cool. That's all shaped, you know, suburbs, Murray. You do know what happens in"
00:02:43,00:02:49,"Arton? Yes, Charlie. Conkins actually, yeah. Yep. Yep. There you go. With half a second's thought,"
00:02:49,00:02:55,"we could have avoided it. I didn't. So here we are. I think we're all pleased we had to go through it,"
00:02:55,00:02:59,"though. So what's gathering nuts in May? So actually, it's thought that it's the knots of May,"
00:02:59,00:03:03,"which is something that they used to refer to Hawthorne. So they're just gathering Hawthorne,"
00:03:03,00:03:08,"but that could have been a sexy thing to do as well, I think. Did you know that the first ever"
00:03:08,00:03:14,"aircraft carrier was for hot air balloons? No. It was in the US Civil War, and they were used for"
00:03:14,00:03:18,"reconnaissance, and it was called the General Washington Park Custis. It was a converted coal budge,"
00:03:18,00:03:25,"and it had its deck cleared, and it was used specifically to store lots of the Union hot air balloons."
00:03:25,00:03:31,That was the first ever aircraft carrier. That's very cool. That's very cool. But it didn't fly itself.
00:03:31,00:03:37,"No, much like a normal aircraft carrier today. They just bob around on the ocean."
00:03:38,00:03:44,Excuse me. This aircraft carrier is not flying at all. I'm like a refund of my $50 billion.
00:03:44,00:03:50,I'm only ever listened to far as the word aircraft.
00:03:50,00:03:58,"The story of the first nativity, I found quite sweet. So it was created by Francis of a CC. It was in"
00:03:58,00:04:02,"1223. That was the first ever nativity scene, and it was because, you know, he was the"
00:04:02,00:04:07,"patron saint of animals, wasn't he? He was always shown with loads of rabbits crawling all over him and stuff,"
00:04:07,00:04:16,"in a nice way. It wasn't constantly tell you just with rabbits, fighting them off and having to kill"
00:04:16,00:04:21,them to get a bit of sleep at night. Why would these rabbits leave me alone? Trowning in rabbits.
00:04:21,00:04:29,"Yeah. When he got up for air to gasp for air, he said let's make an activity scene, because at that"
00:04:29,00:04:33,"time the Bible was read out in Latin in church at Christmas, and no one knew what anyone was saying,"
00:04:33,00:04:37,and he really wanted it to become a bit more relatable for people and for them to actually understand
00:04:37,00:04:43,"what was going on. And so it was done with real actors, or well, probably not professional actors,"
00:04:43,00:04:49,"real people. It was done in a village in Italy, and it involved a manger and a real ox and a real"
00:04:49,00:04:57,"donkey. And he quite sweetly had a wax model as the baby Jesus, and he tried to explain, as he"
00:04:57,00:05:01,"was giving the sum, and that this was the baby Jesus, but he was so overwhelmed with the motion that"
00:05:01,00:05:05,"he couldn't say the word Jesus. So in the first episode of the scene, the word Jesus wasn't said,"
00:05:05,00:05:12,"he just kept on saying the baby perfectly him, and he couldn't get it out. But then it really took"
00:05:12,00:05:17,"off from there, and the hay from that very first nativity scene was then taken away by all the onnuckers"
00:05:17,00:05:22,"and fed to their farm animals, and apparently, it cured them of all their malaria and other diseases."
00:05:23,00:05:30,That's how you cure it. Magic K. Horses can only breathe through their noses. I didn't realise as
00:05:30,00:05:35,"opposed to their mouths. Sorry, yeah, of course. As opposed to their anuses. I don't know where"
00:05:35,00:05:40,I was going with that. I saw you realising halfway through that question what the alternative was.
00:05:40,00:05:47,"How's when you see one horse in the cold, and it's breathing? It comes out of the nose, doesn't it?"
00:05:47,00:05:51,"So is the nostrils, isn't it? Yeah, so don't tape up a horse. Is nostrils or anything?"
00:05:51,00:05:54,"No, okay. Press you are going to. I have to leave."
00:05:54,00:06:02,"Churchill used to listen to translations of Hitler's speeches on a gramophone, and he would"
00:06:02,00:06:07,"play back the bits where Hitler mentioned in my name. Did he? Yeah, that's very Trump-y, isn't it?"
00:06:07,00:06:14,"Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is a bit. Oh. Why did he do it? Why? Yeah, it's just an ego trip."
00:06:14,00:06:17,I don't know. I don't know. I'll regret mentioning it.
00:06:17,00:06:26,"I was looking at some strange driving rules that you can infringe abroad in this country,"
00:06:26,00:06:31,but I didn't realise this thing about parking rules in various countries can get so complicated.
00:06:31,00:06:36,"So in various countries, but particularly in Sweden, you have this system that they call"
00:06:36,00:06:41,"datum parkering, which is about parking on alternate sides of the street, depending on the date."
00:06:41,00:06:46,"So if there's a certain sign on lots of streets, and what it means is if you see this sign,"
00:06:46,00:06:49,"then on the morning of odd dates, then you're not allowed to park on the side of the street"
00:06:49,00:06:53,"where the houses have odd numbers. Oh my goodness. And on the morning of even dates,"
00:06:53,00:06:55,you're not allowed to park on the side of the street where the houses have even numbers.
00:06:55,00:06:58,"And so if you park in the evening, and it's going to be the next morning,"
00:06:58,00:07:01,you have to plan for the next morning that it will be on the right side.
00:07:01,00:07:04,"I mean, it just sounds like a way to get money off foreigners, doesn't it?"
00:07:04,00:07:11,"That sounds a bit like that. The system in Paris that they have where only on Wednesdays,"
00:07:11,00:07:16,"like Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, odd numbers, nice and polite to relax. Yeah, yeah."
00:07:16,00:07:20,"They did that in central South America. It might be in Mexico City, and what happened was"
00:07:20,00:07:26,"just people bought two cars, and they were always old cars, because they had to buy two, so they had"
00:07:26,00:07:33,"to be cheaper, so the pollution went way up. But it is this odd numbers houses thing seems to dictate"
00:07:33,00:07:36,"as well in other countries. In Belgium, for the first half of the month, you can park on the side"
00:07:36,00:07:39,"of the road with odd house numbers, and the second half of the month with even."
00:07:39,00:07:43,Just kind of a hassle if you have to jump out of your car and run up to a front door and check
00:07:43,00:07:48,"the house number. It's amazing. I'm 100% certain. In fact, I know I've parked in Belgium."
00:07:48,00:07:52,"Yeah, it's not every road. There'll be a sign, and it's a special sign that they all recognize."
00:07:52,00:07:55,There's not even any word on it. It's just a random image.
00:07:55,00:08:01,"That you definitely put forward a scratch at his head, giving away money."
00:08:01,00:08:05,"That's when I went to New York, someone was telling me that the parking is actually"
00:08:05,00:08:10,"surprisingly, if you're a resident in Manhattan, it's surprisingly easy and cheap to park outside"
00:08:10,00:08:14,"your house and cost fairly nothing. And the only rule is that you have to want a week, you have to"
00:08:14,00:08:18,your car has to be out of the space for two hours while they clean the street.
00:08:18,00:08:21,"It must be the same two hours for everyone, right? Otherwise, it's a poor street cleaner."
00:08:21,00:08:24,"Every time he sees a car leave, he has to jump in there."
00:08:24,00:08:32,"Just a clean of it. That can't be true, right? There's no way for two hours every week."
00:08:32,00:08:36,Every single car in town starts driving. It's not the same two hours. I'm sure there's a rotor
00:08:36,00:08:40,"of street, right? You know, there's like one, two hours. It's just all your neighbours turn up."
00:08:40,00:08:42,"Hey, man, parking thing again. Yeah, that's all good, shall we?"
00:08:42,00:08:45,We've taken a assumption that Manhattan has won street clean. He's got two hours.
00:08:45,00:08:48,Like a cleaning Santa to cover all of Manhattan.
00:08:48,00:08:53,Can't be done. I'd like to see that sitcom about that guy.
00:08:53,00:08:58,"No, I think a Christmas festive film where he has to do it in one night."
00:08:59,00:09:04,Picture a few type on a keyboard and you're typing something and you don't look down.
00:09:04,00:09:06,You're one of those people who's got amazing words per minute.
00:09:06,00:09:11,So they did a study in a university where they got people to type 70 words per minute.
00:09:11,00:09:13,That was the goal. Can you get that fast?
00:09:13,00:09:17,"And everyone, 94% of the time, managed to do that."
00:09:17,00:09:19,"They then did a second test on them, which was,"
00:09:19,00:09:24,can you now write out where everything on the keyboard is?
00:09:24,00:09:26,Quarity. Can you write out the placings?
00:09:26,00:09:31,And all they could manage was at top 15 of the letters of the alphabet they had known.
00:09:31,00:09:35,They had no idea where the rest were and it's all because it's all automatic memory.
00:09:35,00:09:38,Some things going on. The fingers are doing the dancing at that point.
00:09:38,00:09:42,"That's really interesting. That's like, you know when someone says what's your pin number?"
00:09:42,00:09:45,"If someone's, you know, paying with your card and often you have to go up and say,"
00:09:45,00:09:47,"""I need to type it in."" You have that, right? Yeah."
00:09:47,00:09:50,It's like that. It's exactly like that. It's in your fingers.
00:09:50,00:09:53,The magic is here. That is the thing that brings.
00:09:53,00:09:58,"This isn't a fact, but that's the worst feeling, isn't it, where your fingers stop remembering."
00:09:58,00:10:01,"And then you just, you've lost it. There's no way to get your number back there."
00:10:01,00:10:04,"It's just, it's all over. Is that just me? That's not just me, right?"
00:10:04,00:10:05,"No, no, that's me, too."
00:10:05,00:10:08,"Because I look away as well. I'm like, ""Oh, come on."""
00:10:08,00:10:10,"And then when it's wrong, you're like, ""Oh, you were my last."""
00:10:10,00:10:14,"Like, this isn't even my last, this asshole."
00:10:14,00:10:18,"And then they say, ""Sara, step away from the ATM machine."""
00:10:18,00:10:21,Maybe it falls out when you cut your nails.
00:10:21,00:10:25,It's just a theory.
00:10:25,00:10:27,It's just a theory.
00:10:27,00:10:31,Something else that rained down to earth was the earth's core.
00:10:31,00:10:33,What?
00:10:33,00:10:36,So the earth's core is made of iron.
00:10:36,00:10:40,"And the way that it got there, we think, is a massive meteor comes in,"
00:10:40,00:10:44,"hits the earth, vaporizes, goes into the sky,"
00:10:44,00:10:47,and then rains down and eventually seeps into the center of the planet.
00:10:47,00:10:49,"So it's, it tunneled its way in."
00:10:49,00:10:51,"Kind of. Well, it's dead, so isn't it?"
00:10:51,00:10:53,"Then anything else around it, and that's what it does."
00:10:53,00:10:57,"It's that one that would have been iron rain, molten iron rain."
00:10:57,00:10:59,Yep. Wow.
00:10:59,00:11:00,He's a strong umbrella.
00:11:00,00:11:02,Yeah.
00:11:02,00:11:06,There was another dog called Rolf. It was a terrier.
00:11:06,00:11:09,"And he spoke through tapping his paw against boards,"
00:11:09,00:11:12,"each letter of the alphabet, represented by different taps."
00:11:12,00:11:15,"So if you ask them, all dogs are called Rolf."
00:11:15,00:11:17,Yeah.
00:11:17,00:11:22,"It's a real dad joke, that one."
00:11:22,00:11:32,"I read about a Bible-themed amusement park,"
00:11:32,00:11:35,which is in Bonacera's Tierra Santa.
00:11:35,00:11:38,"And it is, it was meant to have like roller coasters and stuff like that."
00:11:38,00:11:40,They didn't end up doing that.
00:11:40,00:11:43,So it's a lot of sort of plastic Bible scenes that they've made.
00:11:43,00:11:45,"So the scale down has gone quite a bit,"
00:11:45,00:11:49,"except for their one centerpiece for the whole thing,"
00:11:49,00:11:52,"which is that they have in the distance with a hill,"
00:11:52,00:12:00,"a 40-foot tall animatronic Jesus that comes out from the side of the mountain,"
00:12:00,00:12:02,every hour as part of the resurrection.
00:12:02,00:12:09,He resurrects every hour of 40-foot Jesus out the side of the vaulted.
00:12:09,00:12:12,"Well, it wasn't resurrected as a giant."
00:12:13,00:12:14,"No, but he's really far away."
00:12:14,00:12:17,"So maybe he looks really cloister when he, when you see it."
00:12:17,00:12:20,"Wow, that sounds absolutely terrifying."
00:12:20,00:12:20,Yeah.
00:12:20,00:12:24,"So nowhere the largest Jesus statue in the world is, just as a petrivia?"
00:12:24,00:12:27,I would have said in Rio de Janeiro.
00:12:27,00:12:30,"No, there's a taller one in Sphibod's in Poland."
00:12:30,00:12:32,It's called Christ the King.
00:12:32,00:12:33,It's 108 feet tall.
00:12:33,00:12:37,And it has Wi-Fi transmitter in its crown.
00:12:37,00:12:38,Wow.
00:12:38,00:12:41,Just like the real Jesus.
00:12:42,00:12:43,Yes.
00:12:43,00:12:46,Any stuff on King Louis the 13th of France?
00:12:46,00:12:47,"Got some stuff, yeah."
00:12:47,00:12:50,Because he did not calm his hair until he was nine months old.
00:12:50,00:12:52,"Well, he probably didn't do it at that age."
00:12:52,00:12:54,But no one calmed his hair until he was nine months old.
00:12:54,00:12:55,How come?
00:12:55,00:12:57,And no one washed his legs until he was five.
00:12:57,00:13:00,And he had his first bath at the age of seven.
00:13:00,00:13:04,Why did he start somewhere?
00:13:04,00:13:09,"So sorry, did they start with his legs?"
00:13:09,00:13:13,So they washed the rest of his body and then they didn't get to his legs until he was five.
00:13:13,00:13:16,They washed his legs first when he was five and tepid water.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"And then when he was seven, he had his first bath at that stage."
00:13:18,00:13:19,Everything was clean.
00:13:19,00:13:22,"Yeah, it's not like until he was five."
00:13:22,00:13:25,"They only just quickly dumped him in the bath, but they were holding his legs."
00:13:25,00:13:26,So obviously he couldn't wash the legs.
00:13:26,00:13:28,"No, he just didn't wash anything."
00:13:28,00:13:29,So they didn't wash anything.
00:13:29,00:13:33,So it was in the time when washing was seen to be perhaps not great for you.
00:13:33,00:13:33,Yeah.
00:13:33,00:13:35,His hair's combed what more do you want?
00:13:37,00:13:42,"At one stage, he boasted that he takes after his father and he smells of armpits."
00:13:42,00:13:42,Yeah.
00:13:42,00:13:44,He was a smelly man.
00:13:44,00:13:44,He was.
00:13:44,00:13:46,But he had a horrible upbringing.
00:13:46,00:13:49,I think his parents might have just not washed him out of spite.
00:13:49,00:13:51,"He was a very, very sad man."
00:13:51,00:13:53,I grew to really like him.
00:13:53,00:13:56,And so his mother tried to keep the throne for as long as possible.
00:13:56,00:13:59,"So he was made king officially, I think, about age nine."
00:13:59,00:14:02,But his mother was desperate to stay region and hated her son.
00:14:02,00:14:05,And so she would humiliate him or keep him out of power.
00:14:05,00:14:08,"So once when he was 15 and he's king, he's in front of his court,"
00:14:08,00:14:12,she'd just still up and slapped him in the face just to tell him off.
00:14:12,00:14:16,Another time he tried to attend a meeting of the Royal Council that he was supposed to be holding.
00:14:16,00:14:19,"And whereupon the source I was reading said,"
00:14:19,00:14:22,"""Whereupon she took him by the shoulders and threw him out of it."""
00:14:22,00:14:25,So she was real harsh.
00:14:25,00:14:26,That was harsh.
00:14:26,00:14:29,And she also forced him to sleep with his wife.
00:14:29,00:14:34,So we really know almost every historian can curse that he was gay.
00:14:35,00:14:36,And he never had any mistress.
00:14:36,00:14:39,"He never showed any interest in women, showed a lot of interest in men."
00:14:39,00:14:42,"And he was married off to Anavostria,"
00:14:42,00:14:45,who was confusingly a Spanish queen when they were both gay.
00:14:45,00:14:49,"And shut that must have been so annoying for her,"
00:14:49,00:14:51,"always being asked, ""So what's it like in Austria?"""
00:14:51,00:14:55,My parents just had a silly sense of humour.
00:14:55,00:15:00,"She, Anavostria of Spain, came over."
00:15:00,00:15:01,Her brother Dave of Denmark.
00:15:01,00:15:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:03,00:15:09,"Yes, she came over to marry him and he had to be physically carried into the wedding bed"
00:15:09,00:15:12,because he was desperate not to sleep with her and he was really freaked out.
00:15:12,00:15:16,"And two nurses were there to monitor the act to make sure it happened,"
00:15:16,00:15:18,"because otherwise you could sort of get an annulment,"
00:15:18,00:15:20,and that would ruin the alliance between Spain and France.
00:15:20,00:15:25,"And then he ran out of the bedroom as soon as he'd done it and refused to even enter it,"
00:15:25,00:15:28,or eat with his wife or speak to her for about six months.
00:15:28,00:15:28,Wow.
00:15:28,00:15:32,He had a regimental Croatian mercenaries that he liked.
00:15:32,00:15:34,We were actually from Portugal.
00:15:34,00:15:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:35,00:15:41,And they are famous for what reason?
00:15:41,00:15:42,Because they uniform.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Ooh.
00:15:43,00:15:43,The crevettes.
00:15:43,00:15:45,Because they wore crevettes.
00:15:45,00:15:46,They wore neckties.
00:15:46,00:15:50,"And because crevazka is Croatian for Croatia,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"they became known as crevettes,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,and that's where we get the word from.
00:15:54,00:15:56,"Ooh, that's so cool."
00:15:56,00:15:57,And he was also big on wigs.
00:15:57,00:15:58,He was sort of the original--
00:15:58,00:15:59,"Yeah, he was a big wig."
00:15:59,00:16:01,He was the original wig wearer.
00:16:01,00:16:02,Let's see.
00:16:02,00:16:05,"In the way that crevettes sort of became fashionable,"
00:16:05,00:16:08,he brought them back into wigs back into fashion as well.
00:16:08,00:16:11,"So he was thinning in his hair, and he wanted to disguise that."
00:16:11,00:16:14,"And the surrounding friends all thought,"
00:16:14,00:16:18,"""We want to help you out and not make you look like the only person wearing a wig."""
00:16:18,00:16:20,"So they wore wigs as well, and that spread,"
00:16:20,00:16:21,and everyone was wig wearing again.
00:16:21,00:16:25,Anavastria popularized hot chocolate.
00:16:25,00:16:26,Did she?
00:16:26,00:16:28,"Yeah, she brought it over from Spain."
00:16:28,00:16:32,"And it became an instance data symbol,"
00:16:32,00:16:35,and they said that only the aristocracy were allowed to drink it.
00:16:35,00:16:37,"And that was true for a while, and then after a while,"
00:16:37,00:16:39,everyone was allowed to drink it in front.
00:16:39,00:16:40,I know I've said this before.
00:16:40,00:16:42,It is easy to see why they had a revolution
00:16:42,00:16:45,if they're saying only we can drink hot chocolate.
00:16:45,00:16:46,Yeah.
00:16:46,00:16:48,I'm amazed it took a hundred years after this.
00:16:48,00:16:54,There is a theory that there is a bonus track hidden in the last supper.
00:16:54,00:16:55,What do you mean?
00:16:55,00:16:59,Is that the bread rolls on the table are a musical arrangement?
00:16:59,00:17:00,Come on.
00:17:00,00:17:06,"And if you play the bread rolls from left to right along the last supper, it plays a tune."
00:17:06,00:17:10,So presumably people have done this.
00:17:10,00:17:14,"Yes, I clicked on it earlier today, and it said video unavailable."
00:17:14,00:17:18,"We just, so we don't know what the tune is now."
00:17:18,00:17:20,"No, I've actually heard it."
00:17:20,00:17:24,"Yeah, and it's a tune that does work."
00:17:24,00:17:25,So it's--
00:17:25,00:17:26,So I'm not making this up.
00:17:26,00:17:27,"No, you're not making this up."
00:17:27,00:17:27,Thank you.
00:17:27,00:17:28,Yeah.
00:17:28,00:17:28,I've never seen this before.
00:17:28,00:17:30,I've never seen it like I've been making it up.
00:17:30,00:17:32,"I mean, the guy who discovered it is insane,"
00:17:32,00:17:33,but it's not real.
00:17:33,00:17:34,It's not a real thing.
00:17:34,00:17:38,He's looked at bread rolls and thought that looks like a quaver.
00:17:38,00:17:41,Like that's not a thing.
00:17:41,00:17:44,Did you guys hear about the countdown thieves in 2009?
00:17:44,00:17:45,No.
00:17:45,00:17:48,"So these were some, I think I might have read this in the Daily Mail,"
00:17:48,00:17:53,but these were thieves that the police were hunting for who were stealing
00:17:53,00:17:56,some bit letters from shop signs.
00:17:56,00:18:01,"In Norwich, they did it to seven stores over three nights,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,"and they were seeing specific letters,"
00:18:03,00:18:06,"and then one of them was caught on camera and was overheard saying,"
00:18:06,00:18:08,"""I'm just trying to spell my own name."""
00:18:08,00:18:12,And so then the police released the fact that they were looking for people
00:18:12,00:18:14,who might be called one of these names.
00:18:14,00:18:18,"Sam, Danny, Alan, Lloyd, Glyn, or Manning."
00:18:18,00:18:22,Can they realize that Manning did turn Manning?
00:18:22,00:18:23,He pulled on hard times.
00:18:23,00:18:29,I once tried to convince Dan Schreiber that one of the lines
00:18:29,00:18:31,"in the English national anthem was,"
00:18:31,00:18:34,"""Oscopistoria."""
00:18:34,00:18:36,Has it?
00:18:36,00:18:38,Everything else seems to rhyme with that.
00:18:38,00:18:40,"And he was like, ""That's not true."
00:18:40,00:18:41,"Surely, surely, isn't that."""
00:18:41,00:18:43,"And I was like, ""When are they going to pull out his phone and Google it?"""
00:18:43,00:18:44,And he pulled out his phone.
00:18:44,00:18:45,"He was like, ""It's not true, right?"""
00:18:45,00:18:47,"And I was like, ""No, of course it's not true."""
00:18:47,00:18:50,"""You're not going to do anything."""
00:18:50,00:18:50,He sounds like an idiot.
00:18:50,00:18:51,"Yeah, but I'm on."
00:18:51,00:18:56,I discovered a few things that genuinely surprised me about both ears
00:18:56,00:18:57,and what we can hear and what we can't hear.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"So first thing that shocked me is that when we're asleep,"
00:19:00,00:19:02,our ears are still listening.
00:19:02,00:19:03,Isn't that weird?
00:19:03,00:19:05,"Well, how do you think loud noise is where you are?"
00:19:05,00:19:06,I pull out.
00:19:06,00:19:13,"Just so you went deaf, deaf and blind."
00:19:13,00:19:15,"Oh, she's got her there, pal."
00:19:15,00:19:20,I assumed that that was some sort of like secret knock to let.
00:19:20,00:19:24,"Like it's just, if it's at a certain loudness and maybe,"
00:19:24,00:19:25,then you get woken up.
00:19:25,00:19:28,"But I did genuinely think that when you went to sleep,"
00:19:28,00:19:30,"you sort of just, ""Boo, shut down."""
00:19:30,00:19:34,"And your ears kind of just went, ""Okay, I'm taking the night off as well."""
00:19:34,00:19:37,"And you are alone in thinking that, I think, ""Yeah."""
00:19:37,00:19:38,Really?
00:19:38,00:19:40,So let's move on to my next amazing thing.
00:19:40,00:19:47,"Apparently, when this is a noise that we can't hear that we make on our own,"
00:19:47,00:19:50,"when you rub your forefinger and your thumb together,"
00:19:50,00:19:51,you make an ultrasonic signal.
00:19:51,00:19:58,It works so clearly that people often use it to detect
00:19:58,00:20:01,whether a bat detector is working.
00:20:01,00:20:04,"So you rub it against a back detector, and that will give you a signal."
00:20:04,00:20:06,"So anyone listening, I'm doing it now."
00:20:06,00:20:11,"If you just go to your bat detector, and I wonder if over a podcast, I can set it off."
00:20:11,00:20:12,"Well, do you know that?"
00:20:12,00:20:13,Anna.
00:20:13,00:20:13,I'm so sorry.
00:20:13,00:20:16,"I mean, change."
00:20:16,00:20:17,"Sorry, what is a bat detector?"
00:20:18,00:20:20,Who has bat detectors?
00:20:20,00:20:21,People with bats.
00:20:21,00:20:24,What do you mean a bat detector?
00:20:24,00:20:26,"Something that's detecting the ultrasonic sounds of bats,"
00:20:26,00:20:27,like a scientific instrument.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"Right, yeah."
00:20:28,00:20:29,Must be.
00:20:29,00:20:30,"But yeah, that's..."
00:20:30,00:20:32,"Dan, for the listener at home,"
00:20:32,00:20:36,Dan has been rubbing his finger and thumb by the mic for about 30 seconds now.
00:20:36,00:20:38,"And if I could get, and your home will be full of bats."
00:20:38,00:20:43,Did you know that laughing cow is Comte?
00:20:43,00:20:43,Cheese.
00:20:43,00:20:44,What do you mean?
00:20:44,00:20:45,I love...
00:20:45,00:20:46,"Sorry, I don't know Comte."
00:20:46,00:20:48,"Oh, maybe..."
00:20:48,00:20:51,"No, maybe this is just a thing that we have in my family because I love it."
00:20:51,00:20:54,"It's like really creamy, nice European cheese."
00:20:54,00:20:57,I don't think you're family the only people here.
00:20:57,00:20:59,I don't think there's a special Tujensky family cheese.
00:20:59,00:21:00,Tujensky's?
00:21:00,00:21:01,I...
00:21:01,00:21:01,Wow.
00:21:01,00:21:03,"I mean, it was a hard one,"
00:21:03,00:21:05,"and I tried it, and it didn't work out."
00:21:05,00:21:06,It used in ski.
00:21:06,00:21:08,"Yeah, it does the obvious shit."
00:21:08,00:21:14,The great Pitch and Race disaster
00:21:14,00:21:17,"was something that Anna posted about on the QI Bards a few years ago,"
00:21:17,00:21:18,and that I read about.
00:21:18,00:21:19,Do you remember that?
00:21:19,00:21:20,I love it.
00:21:20,00:21:22,"I couldn't believe I've never mentioned it before,"
00:21:22,00:21:23,when all the pigeons disappeared.
00:21:23,00:21:26,Because there's an extremely famous Pitch and Race.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"Sorry, extremely famous among Pitch and Fancy's."
00:21:28,00:21:30,And it's between Paris and London.
00:21:30,00:21:32,It's between France and the UK.
00:21:32,00:21:34,And it was in the 80s or 90s.
00:21:34,00:21:38,It was from Nantes to the UK to the people's homes in the UK.
00:21:38,00:21:42,"And yeah, there were 60,000 pigeons taking part"
00:21:42,00:21:43,and 90% of them disappeared.
00:21:44,00:21:48,"And no, it never happened, like every year before that, they'd all arrive back."
00:21:48,00:21:48,"No, a new way."
00:21:48,00:21:53,There's a theory that there was a Concorde flight
00:21:53,00:21:55,"that was going over the channel at the time,"
00:21:55,00:21:57,and that disrupted their magnetic impulses and cookies.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"Sorry, were we in?"
00:21:59,00:21:59,'97.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"Oh, okay."
00:22:01,00:22:02,So quite recently.
00:22:02,00:22:02,Yeah.
00:22:02,00:22:05,And there was one guy called Tom Rodin
00:22:05,00:22:08,who lost his winning champion Pitch and White Tail.
00:22:08,00:22:12,"And five years later, the Pitch and was on his doorstep."
00:22:12,00:22:13,Yeah.
00:22:13,00:22:14,"Oh, no way."
00:22:14,00:22:15,Five years.
00:22:15,00:22:18,I want to see the movie about one hundred and five years.
00:22:18,00:22:21,I'm guessing that was awesome.
00:22:21,00:22:22,Do you think he over the dawn?
00:22:22,00:22:23,Where the hell have you been?
00:22:23,00:22:29,Have you heard of Bristol's punctuation Banksy?
00:22:29,00:22:31,This is an amazing guy.
00:22:31,00:22:33,He was active at least until last year.
00:22:33,00:22:36,So he goes around just correcting poor punctuation.
00:22:36,00:22:39,And there was an interview with him recently.
00:22:39,00:22:42,"He has built himself a device he calls an apostrophyser,"
00:22:42,00:22:43,"which is a very long-handled bit of kit,"
00:22:43,00:22:45,which allows him to either cover over an apostrophe
00:22:45,00:22:47,"or shouldn't be there in a sign,"
00:22:47,00:22:50,or add one in if he needs an extra one.
00:22:50,00:22:54,"And someone said to him what he was doing was probably illegal,"
00:22:54,00:22:55,"going around, knocking around with businesses sign,"
00:22:55,00:22:57,just for having an apostrophe in the wrong place.
00:22:57,00:22:58,"And he said,"
00:22:58,00:23:00,"""I'm sticking on a bit of sticky-back plastic."
00:23:00,00:23:02,"It's more of a crime to have the apostrophys wrong."""
00:23:02,00:23:03,He's wrong about that.
00:23:03,00:23:04,I think he's wrong.
00:23:04,00:23:08,But he's been going since 2003.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Wow.
00:23:09,00:23:09,"So, yeah."
00:23:09,00:23:11,So he's been getting away with it that long?
00:23:11,00:23:12,"Yeah, and also..."
00:23:12,00:23:13,How has he not been apprehended?
00:23:13,00:23:15,How misspelled is Bristol that he's still in operation?
00:23:15,00:23:18,Is he only correcting the word Bristol?
00:23:18,00:23:20,"Yeah, imagine if he thought that Bristol had two S's."
00:23:20,00:23:23,"He's like, ""They've got it run again."""
00:23:23,00:23:26,I think it's not a full-time job.
00:23:26,00:23:27,It's also not a job.
00:23:27,00:23:30,"But he is cool, as you say,"
00:23:30,00:23:32,the Banksy of Punctuation or Apostrophe Avenger.
00:23:32,00:23:34,"So he's got, you know, cool names."
00:23:34,00:23:37,"They feel ironic to me, those names."
00:23:37,00:23:39,They feel self-given.
00:23:39,00:23:40,Yeah.
00:23:40,00:23:43,There is a National Punctuation Day in America.
00:23:43,00:23:43,So...
00:23:43,00:23:47,"And CNN interviewed the guy, he's called Jeff Rubin, who set it up."
00:23:47,00:23:49,He used to be a reporter.
00:23:49,00:23:51,And CNN wrote that he grew increasingly frustrated
00:23:51,00:23:53,as he spotted errors in the newspaper.
00:23:53,00:23:54,"I quoted him,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,"""I would sit at the kitchen table with my red Sharpie,"
00:23:56,00:23:59,"screaming obscenities, which were upset my wife."""
00:23:59,00:24:03,She encouraged me to find another outlet for my aggravation.
00:24:03,00:24:06,So he set up National Punctuation Day.
00:24:06,00:24:08,"Oh, good on him."
00:24:08,00:24:09,"I mean, good on..."
00:24:09,00:24:11,"Yeah, it's better for his wife."
00:24:11,00:24:14,Sort of. I wonder if that has solved his quite deep-seater character flaws
00:24:14,00:24:16,that I'm interpreting from that story.
00:24:16,00:24:16,But...
00:24:16,00:24:19,Whatever he had to do.
00:24:19,00:24:23,"They had things called dog dramas in the 19th century,"
00:24:23,00:24:24,"early 19th century,"
00:24:24,00:24:26,where the dog was like the hero of the play.
00:24:26,00:24:29,"So they would usually have other human actors,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,but the dog would do the really heroic things.
00:24:31,00:24:35,There was one where the show ended with a dog jumping in the pool of water
00:24:35,00:24:36,and saving a child.
00:24:36,00:24:38,But what would often happen is
00:24:38,00:24:42,mischievous theater goers would throw meat onto the stage to describe the dogs.
00:24:42,00:24:45,That's so funny.
00:24:45,00:24:47,"Thus drowning a child, but..."
00:24:47,00:24:51,"It's all good fun for the audience, isn't it?"
00:24:51,00:24:53,So you know the idea of just going back to the fire of London.
00:24:53,00:24:58,"Did you guys know that the sort of, there's a worshipful company of bakers,"
00:24:58,00:24:59,it's sort of the union of the bakers.
00:24:59,00:25:02,They apologized officially for it.
00:25:02,00:25:04,"Yeah, 320 years later."
00:25:05,00:25:09,"So after the legal threat, it's diminished."
00:25:09,00:25:11,"Well, it's never too late to apologize."
00:25:11,00:25:14,"Said the then Lord Mayor of London, who's called Alan Davis."
00:25:14,00:25:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:16,00:25:17,Do you guys remember Alan Davis?
00:25:17,00:25:18,That must have been only an excuse.
00:25:18,00:25:19,I remember the guy who was in QI.
00:25:19,00:25:21,"Yeah, it's still in QI, by the way."
00:25:21,00:25:22,He used people here in this.
00:25:22,00:25:23,"Yeah, he used to be the Mayor of London."
00:25:23,00:25:26,"No, no, Alan Davis."
00:25:26,00:25:31,"I think around 1986, this would have happened if it's 320 years after 1666."
00:25:31,00:25:33,And I did work that out.
00:25:34,00:25:35,And it did take ages.
00:25:35,00:25:39,This is closest as I come to sounding intelligent.
00:25:39,00:25:42,"Yeah, they they apologize to officially for it."
00:25:42,00:25:45,"That's good that they admitted to it finally, because at the time,"
00:25:45,00:25:48,the French and the Dutch were blamed all across town.
00:25:48,00:25:50,And loads of French and Dutch were arrested.
00:25:50,00:25:52,And I think that was beaten up.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"And yeah, beaten constantly."
00:25:54,00:25:57,"So we were at war or Britain was at war with France and in Netherlands,"
00:25:57,00:25:59,there was probably Protestant plots everywhere.
00:25:59,00:26:02,And so I think there was a French woman who had a breast cut off
00:26:02,00:26:05,because people thought what she was carrying was explosive devices.
00:26:05,00:26:06,And it was just...
00:26:06,00:26:07,It was chickens.
00:26:07,00:26:08,"Oh, right."
00:26:08,00:26:11,She was carrying some chickens and people thought they were fireballs.
00:26:11,00:26:16,You would have thought in the process of chopping off someone's boobies.
00:26:16,00:26:18,You would find out that they weren't fireballs.
00:26:18,00:26:20,"They were chicks, wouldn't you?"
00:26:20,00:26:21,Yeah.
00:26:21,00:26:22,"You've gone too far, then."
00:26:22,00:26:23,You've got to go through with it.
00:26:23,00:26:24,You're right.
00:26:24,00:26:28,There are parallels with our current political climate.
00:26:28,00:26:30,"Unfortunately, have we progressed?"
00:26:31,00:26:32,Yes.
00:26:32,00:26:36,This is the big breast cutting off of the 21st century.
00:26:36,00:26:40,"Yeah, it's the horrific metaphor that we find ourselves in."
00:26:40,00:26:40,Wow.
00:26:40,00:26:45,"In 2010, in Belgium, there was a guy who was experimenting with the idea"
00:26:45,00:26:47,of solving the problem of pigeons pooing all over cities.
00:26:47,00:26:51,"So massive problem, poo on your head, poo on car windows."
00:26:51,00:26:51,Yeah.
00:26:51,00:26:53,It's on your head.
00:26:53,00:26:56,"And so what he's attempted to do,"
00:26:56,00:26:58,"and I don't know if this has actually worked,"
00:26:58,00:27:01,but he's tempted to create a special bacteria
00:27:01,00:27:03,"that when it's fed to the pigeons, it metabolises,"
00:27:03,00:27:06,"and when they defecate what comes out is not poo,"
00:27:06,00:27:08,but a soapy-like substance.
00:27:08,00:27:11,"So they end up cleaning your head, shampooing your head,"
00:27:11,00:27:12,and cleaning the streets.
00:27:12,00:27:14,"I'd say we've had a few shelters, I think."
00:27:14,00:27:17,You don't want to squeeze a pigeon over your head in the shower.
00:27:17,00:27:19,"Yeah, so the idea is that-"
00:27:19,00:27:21,It's not make them poo soap.
00:27:21,00:27:22,It's not fair.
00:27:22,00:27:24,"It's not fair, but it's probably possible."
00:27:24,00:27:25,But I just couldn't-
00:27:25,00:27:27,Where's the waste product going?
00:27:27,00:27:29,"I mean, there's poo in that soap."
00:27:29,00:27:30,"Yeah, there is poo in there."
00:27:30,00:27:31,It's pooey soap.
00:27:31,00:27:32,It's pooey soap in there.
00:27:32,00:27:35,Yeah.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"I suppose what they're saying is, okay,"
00:27:37,00:27:39,so there are soapy molecules in there.
00:27:39,00:27:40,Yep.
00:27:40,00:27:42,"Which will attach to the pooey substances,"
00:27:42,00:27:45,"and when it rains, it will be easier to flush away."
00:27:45,00:27:46,Does that make sense?
00:27:46,00:27:47,It feels like-
00:27:47,00:27:49,I forgot that poo has to come out at some point.
00:27:49,00:27:52,"So yeah, that must be the logic."
00:27:52,00:27:54,"Unless these pigeons are just growing bigger and bigger and bigger,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,and eventually they're just explode with their own feces.
00:27:56,00:27:57,But I don't think-
00:27:57,00:28:00,It's more problems to completing a facility.
00:28:00,00:28:00,It certainly does.
00:28:00,00:28:01,But they were-
00:28:01,00:28:02,It's a very short-term solution.
00:28:02,00:28:03,This wasn't just a mad guy.
00:28:03,00:28:07,They were given a grant by the Flemish Architecture and Design Committee
00:28:07,00:28:08,and Ministry of Culture.
00:28:08,00:28:10,Like it was a funded proper science-
00:28:10,00:28:12,"So we're going to the Ministry of Culture, though, wouldn't you?"
00:28:12,00:28:13,If you had this-
00:28:13,00:28:14,Not slightly strange idea.
00:28:14,00:28:14,That's true.
00:28:14,00:28:16,There's no other science people.
00:28:16,00:28:20,"There is a thing, there's a-"
00:28:20,00:28:23,"This is another amphipod, which this is originally about,"
00:28:23,00:28:24,and it's called-
00:28:24,00:28:25,And I'm going to take a run up at this-
00:28:25,00:28:28,Sudamphithoidis Incavaria.
00:28:28,00:28:30,It lives in the Caribbean and it eats seaweed.
00:28:30,00:28:34,And this is another really sort of just a weird defense mechanism in nature.
00:28:34,00:28:38,So the seaweed that it eats has chemicals which deter fish.
00:28:38,00:28:40,"Same deal, it gives off toxic chemicals."
00:28:40,00:28:43,"But the amphipod, it doesn't just eat it."
00:28:43,00:28:48,It also makes a little house for itself out of this algae.
00:28:48,00:28:49,And it has-
00:28:49,00:28:51,"Have it some food, I guess, right?"
00:28:51,00:28:51,Yeah.
00:28:51,00:28:53,Like a gingerbread house kind of thing.
00:28:53,00:28:55,"Yeah, exactly like that."
00:28:55,00:28:56,"And so, exactly like that."
00:28:56,00:29:01,And it swims around with its head and front legs sticking out of this-
00:29:01,00:29:02,"It's more like a sleeping bag, I guess."
00:29:02,00:29:04,It's more like a more sleeping bag than a house.
00:29:04,00:29:05,A gingerbread sleeping bag.
00:29:05,00:29:07,Yeah.
00:29:07,00:29:10,Or like a ham sleeping bag.
00:29:10,00:29:14,Like a hamock.
00:29:14,00:29:15,Like a hamock.
00:29:15,00:29:17,Wow.
00:29:17,00:29:20,You guys are going to be so surprised by the laugh that comes after that when the podcast comes out.
00:29:22,00:29:25,I don't remember that being nearly as funny on the night.
00:29:25,00:29:30,A lot of pigeons are being smuggled out of Syria at the moment.
00:29:30,00:29:37,So because Syria was the world-leading pigeon breeding place.
00:29:37,00:29:41,"So in the Middle East they say, you know, all the best pigeon breeders are Syrians."
00:29:41,00:29:44,And now they're getting sent over the board because obviously it's not safe for them to be there
00:29:44,00:29:48,anymore and pigeon fanciers in Syria can't keep them anymore.
00:29:48,00:29:51,And so there are lots of collectors who are going on these kind of death-defying missions
00:29:51,00:29:55,to get them. There's a guy who's spent five million dollars on Syrian pigeons.
00:29:55,00:30:00,"This is a guy called NASA who's a Jordanese, Jordanian, who's Jordanian."
00:30:00,00:30:04,And there was one instance where 70 pigeons were killed when they were being smuggled across
00:30:04,00:30:06,the border and they got caught in a fight.
00:30:06,00:30:10,"So yeah, it's taken its toll on the poor pigeons."
00:30:10,00:30:13,"But yeah, they are- they are really valuable there."
00:30:13,00:30:17,"That's amazing. Act by the Great, who was a Mughal Emperor around there."
00:30:18,00:30:23,"In the 16th century, he always travelled wherever he went with his personal colony of 10,000 pigeons."
00:30:23,00:30:24,"10,000?"
00:30:24,00:30:27,What? They're only small.
00:30:27,00:30:29,"I can have 10,000 of one rooms, please."
00:30:29,00:30:33,I don't think they all got their own room.
00:30:33,00:30:34,"No, maybe not."
00:30:34,00:30:36,But they could like- some of them were really beautiful.
00:30:36,00:30:40,"Some of them could do tricks and tumble through the air and, you know."
00:30:40,00:30:41,Some of the poods so well.
00:30:41,00:30:42,There's a whole whole thing.
00:30:42,00:30:44,Did he name them all?
00:30:45,00:30:48,I don't know. I doubt it.
00:30:48,00:30:50,"No, he probably named his favourite ones."
00:30:50,00:30:51,"Yeah, yeah."
00:30:51,00:30:53,That is impressive.
00:30:53,00:30:55,I'm taking a register every day for that.
00:30:55,00:31:01,Do you guys know what's happened to actually the original manuscript of the origin of species?
00:31:01,00:31:02,On the origin of species?
00:31:02,00:31:02,Nope.
00:31:02,00:31:06,So it has various drawings on it.
00:31:06,00:31:11,"So for instance, it has a drawing of a green fish with pink legs and fins and a bright blue umbrella."
00:31:11,00:31:14,And this is covered in these doodles.
00:31:14,00:31:17,And this is because Charles Darwin was a really fun dad.
00:31:17,00:31:18,So we wrote the origin of species.
00:31:18,00:31:20,And then he gave it to his kid.
00:31:20,00:31:22,"So I was like, ""Well, I'm done with this now."
00:31:22,00:31:23,I've had this idea.
00:31:23,00:31:23,"Have that."""
00:31:23,00:31:25,And it's covered in his kid's doodles.
00:31:25,00:31:25,Cool.
00:31:25,00:31:26,"And so,"
00:31:26,00:31:31,I read the book and thought maybe one day animals will evolve to have an umbrella.
00:31:31,00:31:32,Yes.
00:31:32,00:31:35,"Yeah, maybe actually Darwin discovered a lot more than he led on."
00:31:35,00:31:36,Yeah.
00:31:36,00:31:39,"You know, he did, we wanted to keep it secret."
00:31:39,00:31:39,Yeah.
00:31:39,00:31:40,"So he put around the story,"
00:31:40,00:31:43,"""Oh yeah, my kids just drew that weird creature with 15 legs and..."
00:31:44,00:31:46,"...an umbrella growing out of its fin."""
00:31:46,00:31:47,Yeah.
00:31:47,00:31:47,Yeah.
00:31:47,00:31:50,So it was actually him who drew it and he was backtracking on his own illustrations.
00:31:50,00:31:51,"That's what I'm saying, right?"
00:31:51,00:31:54,Darwin drew these secret animals that didn't exist.
00:31:54,00:31:55,"Because he thought if they don't believe that,"
00:31:55,00:31:57,"relatively plausible evolution and stuff,"
00:31:57,00:31:59,they're never going to believe in the umbrella fish.
00:31:59,00:32:04,Another Canadian thing.
00:32:04,00:32:05,"Well, do you know what the national animal of Canada is?"
00:32:05,00:32:06,Which I think is a bit right.
00:32:06,00:32:07,It's not a user?
00:32:07,00:32:08,"Yeah, it's a beaver."
00:32:08,00:32:09,"It's a beaver, yeah."
00:32:09,00:32:10,It's what I just always think it's such a great thing to have bears.
00:32:10,00:32:12,I would have picked that.
00:32:12,00:32:15,"But it's really controversial, they're not really into having the beaver."
00:32:15,00:32:19,It's been debated whether they should ditch it since the mid-19th century.
00:32:19,00:32:22,"And in 1964, I was reading a lecture that a Canadian historian gave"
00:32:22,00:32:27,that complained that the beaver is representative of English Canada rather than French.
00:32:27,00:32:32,And that means that it represents a pretty intelligent animal on a rather low level
00:32:32,00:32:35,who is very fond of work and has not much idea beyond that.
00:32:35,00:32:37,So that was his impression of what the English element of Canada
00:32:37,00:32:40,had given to the country that the beaver represented.
00:32:40,00:32:42,And what did the French area want in?
00:32:42,00:32:45,"I'm not sure actually, what would the French animal be?"
00:32:45,00:32:51,Not a beaver or something with fur that was cute that we would kill.
00:32:51,00:32:53,"Yes, a bear."
00:32:53,00:32:56,"Yes, a bear, or a seal butt."
00:32:56,00:32:57,Lovely.
00:32:57,00:33:01,"But we're introducing beavers to Scotland at the moment, isn't that?"
00:33:01,00:33:02,Yeah.
00:33:02,00:33:02,The new thing.
00:33:02,00:33:03,Yeah.
00:33:03,00:33:08,"And very interestingly, when they were introduced wolves in the various parks in North America,"
00:33:08,00:33:14,"particularly in Yellowstone, it had this extraordinary effect of increasingly beaver population,"
00:33:14,00:33:18,"which no one had considered, but it just a sort of another example of how into"
00:33:18,00:33:23,"related everything uses, that the wolves slightly kept down the elk's stroke moose."
00:33:23,00:33:28,And they didn't go as far south and they didn't eat the young vegetation
00:33:28,00:33:34,on which the beavers relied to make that sort of fluff up their dams.
00:33:34,00:33:41,"But they thrived because of the, but miles, you know, a thousand miles north"
00:33:41,00:33:44,where the wolves were was affecting the beavers in the south.
00:33:44,00:33:47,"Wow, you couldn't have predicted that, really, could you?"
00:33:47,00:33:51,"No, it's marvellous, it's like a butterfly effect in a way."
00:33:51,00:33:53,"It is, so I wish a mess with it."
00:33:53,00:33:59,"Another Canadian thing, one more thing, Poutine, so this..."
00:33:59,00:34:01,"Yes, nice delicious food."
00:34:01,00:34:03,"Yeah, gravy, sort of gravy on..."
00:34:03,00:34:05,Gravy on chips with curd.
00:34:05,00:34:05,That's it.
00:34:05,00:34:06,...on it.
00:34:06,00:34:08,"Right, and they give it a post-sounding name to convince us."
00:34:08,00:34:10,It doesn't sound like Ellie D's name for a lady part.
00:34:10,00:34:17,"Well, the thing is, in French parting speaking Canada, it's kind of unusual sounding to them,"
00:34:17,00:34:21,"because in France, you don't call Vladimir Putin, Poutine."
00:34:21,00:34:24,"Because in France, Putin means prostitute."
00:34:24,00:34:25,"Of course, Putin, yes."
00:34:25,00:34:25,"Putin, yes."
00:34:25,00:34:28,"So in France, they all call him Vladimir Poutine."
00:34:28,00:34:32,"And so in Canada, they have like a Vladimir's Poutine"
00:34:32,00:34:33,and restaurants.
00:34:33,00:34:34,Ah!
00:34:34,00:34:36,Very cool.
00:34:36,00:34:39,Do you know when the queen takes her Christmas decorations down?
00:34:39,00:34:41,Never. Never.
00:34:41,00:34:45,She's one of those weirdos who has them all here.
00:34:45,00:34:49,"Yeah, she waits till February, February the 6th, and it's actually quite sweet."
00:34:49,00:34:52,It's an honor of her father who died on that day.
00:34:52,00:34:55,And then they do these weird things when they have their Christmas dinners.
00:34:55,00:35:00,"So this year, Meghan Markle will be weighed before she has her Christmas turkey,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,as will all of the royal members.
00:35:02,00:35:04,They do this thing where they weigh them.
00:35:04,00:35:05,They all stand on a weighing scale.
00:35:05,00:35:08,"Just the numbers, though, the people as well, right?"
00:35:08,00:35:12,"Sorry, I'm ashamed."
00:35:12,00:35:15,"Yes, they will be weighed."
00:35:15,00:35:17,The royal Christmas toddler weigh it.
00:35:17,00:35:26,"So they weigh the full of humans, and they then have the meal,"
00:35:26,00:35:29,and then they weigh them afterwards again to see whether or not they've been
00:35:29,00:35:30,well fed enough.
00:35:30,00:35:32,That's the symbolic idea of that.
00:35:32,00:35:34,So you have to eat the most.
00:35:34,00:35:35,Do you have to gain the most?
00:35:35,00:35:37,I don't think it's a game.
00:35:37,00:35:40,I think it's just a tradition.

00:35:52,00:35:53,"Quite nice image, isn't it?"
00:35:53,00:35:59,Wouldn't it be great to rig up Prince Charles's cracker?
00:35:59,00:36:00,So there's never a crown inside?
