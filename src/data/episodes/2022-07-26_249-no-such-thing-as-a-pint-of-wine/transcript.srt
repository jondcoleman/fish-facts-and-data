00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 Hi everyone, welcome to the bit in between Christmas and New Year, where you're not really

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,880
 sure what day it is and you've eaten way too much turkey. It's Friday, so that means it's

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,560
 a no-six thing. There's a fish day, and what do we have for you today? We have the 2018 clip show,

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,600
 all the best bits from this year that didn't quite fit into the actual episode, so it's all new,

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,040
 you've never heard it. They're all times when we were just too silly, too stupid, people were making

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:32,080
 mistakes, there's loads of outtakes, and we'll see you with a brand new episode in 2019. So please

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:51,840
 enjoy it on with the show. Oh, no. Okay, my fat this week is that it might look like Anna is

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:01,040
 drinking a pint of lime and soda, but that is a pint of wine. It's not. And this is not a podcast,

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:10,480
 this is an intervention. We love you, we're worried about you. It's not a pint of wine, it was a pint

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:20,640
 of wine. There was only one wine glass in the green room genuinely, and Andy hogged it, so I had no

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,040
 choice. Practically threw it at me, saying no, no, no, it's fine, I'll use this. Okay, none of this could

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,680
 go into the podcast, so. So according to Old English folklore, if you dream of gathering nuts,

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,480
 then that's a bad old man. There's an Old English proverb, which is a good year for nuts,

14
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,160
 is a good year for babies. Very true. Very true. Can you guess why that is?

15
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,960
 There's lots of nuts. Nope. Do people use to think that I want to not fell from a tree, it cracked

16
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:03,200
 open and a baby came out. No, they weren't idiots. No, it's because gathering nuts was like you do it

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,600
 undercover as like a way of meeting people at the office in sex. Oh, I see. So you're like, oh,

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 we're just going gathering nuts. And then you plant your seeds. And there's a thing here we go

19
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,560
 gathering nuts in May. Yes. And May is springtime. So do you think that could be a sexy? Well, weirdly,

20
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,080
 that doesn't make any sense, because no, not your, I'm not rubbish in your theory. It's a really good

21
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,400
 theory. Thank you. The rhyme itself. Obviously, if you think about it, nuts aren't falling in May,

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,200
 are they? I don't know. Well, you know, it's awesome. They followed the art. Yeah. Yeah. Right,

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,520
 okay. Well, cool. That's all shaped, you know, suburbs, Murray. You do know what happens in

24
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,200
 Arton? Yes, Charlie. Conkins actually, yeah. Yep. Yep. There you go. With half a second's thought,

25
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,040
 we could have avoided it. I didn't. So here we are. I think we're all pleased we had to go through it,

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,840
 though. So what's gathering nuts in May? So actually, it's thought that it's the knots of May,

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,920
 which is something that they used to refer to Hawthorne. So they're just gathering Hawthorne,

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,320
 but that could have been a sexy thing to do as well, I think. Did you know that the first ever

29
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,320
 aircraft carrier was for hot air balloons? No. It was in the US Civil War, and they were used for

30
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,800
 reconnaissance, and it was called the General Washington Park Custis. It was a converted coal budge,

31
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,200
 and it had its deck cleared, and it was used specifically to store lots of the Union hot air balloons.

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,280
 That was the first ever aircraft carrier. That's very cool. That's very cool. But it didn't fly itself.

33
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,600
 No, much like a normal aircraft carrier today. They just bob around on the ocean.

34
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,400
 Excuse me. This aircraft carrier is not flying at all. I'm like a refund of my $50 billion.

35
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,640
 I'm only ever listened to far as the word aircraft.

36
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,480
 The story of the first nativity, I found quite sweet. So it was created by Francis of a CC. It was in

37
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,720
 1223. That was the first ever nativity scene, and it was because, you know, he was the

38
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,040
 patron saint of animals, wasn't he? He was always shown with loads of rabbits crawling all over him and stuff,

39
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:16,000
 in a nice way. It wasn't constantly tell you just with rabbits, fighting them off and having to kill

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,520
 them to get a bit of sleep at night. Why would these rabbits leave me alone? Trowning in rabbits.

41
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:29,040
 Yeah. When he got up for air to gasp for air, he said let's make an activity scene, because at that

42
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
 time the Bible was read out in Latin in church at Christmas, and no one knew what anyone was saying,

43
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,280
 and he really wanted it to become a bit more relatable for people and for them to actually understand

44
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,120
 what was going on. And so it was done with real actors, or well, probably not professional actors,

45
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,280
 real people. It was done in a village in Italy, and it involved a manger and a real ox and a real

46
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:57,840
 donkey. And he quite sweetly had a wax model as the baby Jesus, and he tried to explain, as he

47
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,280
 was giving the sum, and that this was the baby Jesus, but he was so overwhelmed with the motion that

48
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,680
 he couldn't say the word Jesus. So in the first episode of the scene, the word Jesus wasn't said,

49
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,000
 he just kept on saying the baby perfectly him, and he couldn't get it out. But then it really took

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,280
 off from there, and the hay from that very first nativity scene was then taken away by all the onnuckers

51
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,160
 and fed to their farm animals, and apparently, it cured them of all their malaria and other diseases.

52
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:30,080
 That's how you cure it. Magic K. Horses can only breathe through their noses. I didn't realise as

53
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,680
 opposed to their mouths. Sorry, yeah, of course. As opposed to their anuses. I don't know where

54
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,960
 I was going with that. I saw you realising halfway through that question what the alternative was.

55
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,760
 How's when you see one horse in the cold, and it's breathing? It comes out of the nose, doesn't it?

56
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,040
 So is the nostrils, isn't it? Yeah, so don't tape up a horse. Is nostrils or anything?

57
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,720
 No, okay. Press you are going to. I have to leave.

58
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,240
 Churchill used to listen to translations of Hitler's speeches on a gramophone, and he would

59
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,040
 play back the bits where Hitler mentioned in my name. Did he? Yeah, that's very Trump-y, isn't it?

60
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:14,640
 Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is a bit. Oh. Why did he do it? Why? Yeah, it's just an ego trip.

61
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,680
 I don't know. I don't know. I'll regret mentioning it.

62
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:26,080
 I was looking at some strange driving rules that you can infringe abroad in this country,

63
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,840
 but I didn't realise this thing about parking rules in various countries can get so complicated.

64
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,000
 So in various countries, but particularly in Sweden, you have this system that they call

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,200
 datum parkering, which is about parking on alternate sides of the street, depending on the date.

66
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,160
 So if there's a certain sign on lots of streets, and what it means is if you see this sign,

67
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,680
 then on the morning of odd dates, then you're not allowed to park on the side of the street

68
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,040
 where the houses have odd numbers. Oh my goodness. And on the morning of even dates,

69
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,920
 you're not allowed to park on the side of the street where the houses have even numbers.

70
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,480
 And so if you park in the evening, and it's going to be the next morning,

71
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,600
 you have to plan for the next morning that it will be on the right side.

72
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,400
 I mean, it just sounds like a way to get money off foreigners, doesn't it?

73
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,440
 That sounds a bit like that. The system in Paris that they have where only on Wednesdays,

74
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,560
 like Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, odd numbers, nice and polite to relax. Yeah, yeah.

75
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,480
 They did that in central South America. It might be in Mexico City, and what happened was

76
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,960
 just people bought two cars, and they were always old cars, because they had to buy two, so they had

77
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,280
 to be cheaper, so the pollution went way up. But it is this odd numbers houses thing seems to dictate

78
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,720
 as well in other countries. In Belgium, for the first half of the month, you can park on the side

79
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,840
 of the road with odd house numbers, and the second half of the month with even.

80
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,280
 Just kind of a hassle if you have to jump out of your car and run up to a front door and check

81
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,560
 the house number. It's amazing. I'm 100% certain. In fact, I know I've parked in Belgium.

82
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,960
 Yeah, it's not every road. There'll be a sign, and it's a special sign that they all recognize.

83
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,200
 There's not even any word on it. It's just a random image.

84
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,040
 That you definitely put forward a scratch at his head, giving away money.

85
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,360
 That's when I went to New York, someone was telling me that the parking is actually

86
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,960
 surprisingly, if you're a resident in Manhattan, it's surprisingly easy and cheap to park outside

87
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,560
 your house and cost fairly nothing. And the only rule is that you have to want a week, you have to

88
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,080
 your car has to be out of the space for two hours while they clean the street.

89
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,360
 It must be the same two hours for everyone, right? Otherwise, it's a poor street cleaner.

90
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
 Every time he sees a car leave, he has to jump in there.

91
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:32,080
 Just a clean of it. That can't be true, right? There's no way for two hours every week.

92
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,720
 Every single car in town starts driving. It's not the same two hours. I'm sure there's a rotor

93
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,240
 of street, right? You know, there's like one, two hours. It's just all your neighbours turn up.

94
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,960
 Hey, man, parking thing again. Yeah, that's all good, shall we?

95
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,840
 We've taken a assumption that Manhattan has won street clean. He's got two hours.

96
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,880
 Like a cleaning Santa to cover all of Manhattan.

97
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,360
 Can't be done. I'd like to see that sitcom about that guy.

98
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,080
 No, I think a Christmas festive film where he has to do it in one night.

99
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,080
 Picture a few type on a keyboard and you're typing something and you don't look down.

100
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,880
 You're one of those people who's got amazing words per minute.

101
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,520
 So they did a study in a university where they got people to type 70 words per minute.

102
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,760
 That was the goal. Can you get that fast?

103
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,360
 And everyone, 94% of the time, managed to do that.

104
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,520
 They then did a second test on them, which was,

105
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,320
 can you now write out where everything on the keyboard is?

106
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
 Quarity. Can you write out the placings?

107
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,840
 And all they could manage was at top 15 of the letters of the alphabet they had known.

108
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,440
 They had no idea where the rest were and it's all because it's all automatic memory.

109
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,480
 Some things going on. The fingers are doing the dancing at that point.

110
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,320
 That's really interesting. That's like, you know when someone says what's your pin number?

111
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
 If someone's, you know, paying with your card and often you have to go up and say,

112
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,920
 "I need to type it in." You have that, right? Yeah.

113
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,560
 It's like that. It's exactly like that. It's in your fingers.

114
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,920
 The magic is here. That is the thing that brings.

115
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,320
 This isn't a fact, but that's the worst feeling, isn't it, where your fingers stop remembering.

116
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
 And then you just, you've lost it. There's no way to get your number back there.

117
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,480
 It's just, it's all over. Is that just me? That's not just me, right?

118
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,520
 No, no, that's me, too.

119
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,320
 Because I look away as well. I'm like, "Oh, come on."

120
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,640
 And then when it's wrong, you're like, "Oh, you were my last."

121
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,480
 Like, this isn't even my last, this asshole.

122
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,800
 And then they say, "Sara, step away from the ATM machine."

123
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,840
 Maybe it falls out when you cut your nails.

124
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,200
 It's just a theory.

125
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
 It's just a theory.

126
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,840
 Something else that rained down to earth was the earth's core.

127
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
 What?

128
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,240
 So the earth's core is made of iron.

129
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,960
 And the way that it got there, we think, is a massive meteor comes in,

130
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,080
 hits the earth, vaporizes, goes into the sky,

131
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,680
 and then rains down and eventually seeps into the center of the planet.

132
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,840
 So it's, it tunneled its way in.

133
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840
 Kind of. Well, it's dead, so isn't it?

134
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
 Then anything else around it, and that's what it does.

135
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,280
 It's that one that would have been iron rain, molten iron rain.

136
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,040
 Yep. Wow.

137
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,240
 He's a strong umbrella.

138
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
 Yeah.

139
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,480
 There was another dog called Rolf. It was a terrier.

140
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,440
 And he spoke through tapping his paw against boards,

141
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,960
 each letter of the alphabet, represented by different taps.

142
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,280
 So if you ask them, all dogs are called Rolf.

143
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
 Yeah.

144
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,240
 It's a real dad joke, that one.

145
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:32,240
 I read about a Bible-themed amusement park,

146
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,040
 which is in Bonacera's Tierra Santa.

147
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,960
 And it is, it was meant to have like roller coasters and stuff like that.

148
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,240
 They didn't end up doing that.

149
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,680
 So it's a lot of sort of plastic Bible scenes that they've made.

150
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,920
 So the scale down has gone quite a bit,

151
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,200
 except for their one centerpiece for the whole thing,

152
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,800
 which is that they have in the distance with a hill,

153
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,000
 a 40-foot tall animatronic Jesus that comes out from the side of the mountain,

154
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
 every hour as part of the resurrection.

155
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,200
 He resurrects every hour of 40-foot Jesus out the side of the vaulted.

156
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,080
 Well, it wasn't resurrected as a giant.

157
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,480
 No, but he's really far away.

158
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,120
 So maybe he looks really cloister when he, when you see it.

159
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,080
 Wow, that sounds absolutely terrifying.

160
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,800
 Yeah.

161
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,720
 So nowhere the largest Jesus statue in the world is, just as a petrivia?

162
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,200
 I would have said in Rio de Janeiro.

163
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,880
 No, there's a taller one in Sphibod's in Poland.

164
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480
 It's called Christ the King.

165
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
 It's 108 feet tall.

166
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,520
 And it has Wi-Fi transmitter in its crown.

167
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,640
 Wow.

168
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,520
 Just like the real Jesus.

169
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,280
 Yes.

170
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,000
 Any stuff on King Louis the 13th of France?

171
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,360
 Got some stuff, yeah.

172
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,320
 Because he did not calm his hair until he was nine months old.

173
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,160
 Well, he probably didn't do it at that age.

174
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,400
 But no one calmed his hair until he was nine months old.

175
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,200
 How come?

176
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
 And no one washed his legs until he was five.

177
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,800
 And he had his first bath at the age of seven.

178
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,320
 Why did he start somewhere?

179
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,040
 So sorry, did they start with his legs?

180
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,360
 So they washed the rest of his body and then they didn't get to his legs until he was five.

181
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,240
 They washed his legs first when he was five and tepid water.

182
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,960
 And then when he was seven, he had his first bath at that stage.

183
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,920
 Everything was clean.

184
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,400
 Yeah, it's not like until he was five.

185
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,440
 They only just quickly dumped him in the bath, but they were holding his legs.

186
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,880
 So obviously he couldn't wash the legs.

187
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,000
 No, he just didn't wash anything.

188
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,040
 So they didn't wash anything.

189
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,120
 So it was in the time when washing was seen to be perhaps not great for you.

190
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,600
 Yeah.

191
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,920
 His hair's combed what more do you want?

192
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,080
 At one stage, he boasted that he takes after his father and he smells of armpits.

193
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,800
 Yeah.

194
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,160
 He was a smelly man.

195
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,960
 He was.

196
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,800
 But he had a horrible upbringing.

197
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,920
 I think his parents might have just not washed him out of spite.

198
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,680
 He was a very, very sad man.

199
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,280
 I grew to really like him.

200
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,640
 And so his mother tried to keep the throne for as long as possible.

201
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,360
 So he was made king officially, I think, about age nine.

202
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,560
 But his mother was desperate to stay region and hated her son.

203
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,840
 And so she would humiliate him or keep him out of power.

204
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,880
 So once when he was 15 and he's king, he's in front of his court,

205
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,560
 she'd just still up and slapped him in the face just to tell him off.

206
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,640
 Another time he tried to attend a meeting of the Royal Council that he was supposed to be holding.

207
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,440
 And whereupon the source I was reading said,

208
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,480
 "Whereupon she took him by the shoulders and threw him out of it."

209
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,120
 So she was real harsh.

210
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,080
 That was harsh.

211
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,600
 And she also forced him to sleep with his wife.

212
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,000
 So we really know almost every historian can curse that he was gay.

213
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
 And he never had any mistress.

214
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,760
 He never showed any interest in women, showed a lot of interest in men.

215
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,080
 And he was married off to Anavostria,

216
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,840
 who was confusingly a Spanish queen when they were both gay.

217
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,520
 And shut that must have been so annoying for her,

218
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,920
 always being asked, "So what's it like in Austria?"

219
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,840
 My parents just had a silly sense of humour.

220
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,320
 She, Anavostria of Spain, came over.

221
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,600
 Her brother Dave of Denmark.

222
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,200
 [LAUGHTER]

223
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,840
 Yes, she came over to marry him and he had to be physically carried into the wedding bed

224
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,880
 because he was desperate not to sleep with her and he was really freaked out.

225
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,000
 And two nurses were there to monitor the act to make sure it happened,

226
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,240
 because otherwise you could sort of get an annulment,

227
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,960
 and that would ruin the alliance between Spain and France.

228
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,120
 And then he ran out of the bedroom as soon as he'd done it and refused to even enter it,

229
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,000
 or eat with his wife or speak to her for about six months.

230
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,960
 Wow.

231
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,320
 He had a regimental Croatian mercenaries that he liked.

232
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,640
 We were actually from Portugal.

233
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,440
 [LAUGHTER]

234
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,120
 And they are famous for what reason?

235
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,000
 Because they uniform.

236
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,200
 Ooh.

237
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,920
 The crevettes.

238
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,200
 Because they wore crevettes.

239
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,160
 They wore neckties.

240
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,320
 And because crevazka is Croatian for Croatia,

241
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,640
 they became known as crevettes,

242
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,000
 and that's where we get the word from.

243
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,080
 Ooh, that's so cool.

244
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,440
 And he was also big on wigs.

245
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,960
 He was sort of the original--

246
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,840
 Yeah, he was a big wig.

247
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,200
 He was the original wig wearer.

248
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
 Let's see.

249
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,040
 In the way that crevettes sort of became fashionable,

250
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,560
 he brought them back into wigs back into fashion as well.

251
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,840
 So he was thinning in his hair, and he wanted to disguise that.

252
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,560
 And the surrounding friends all thought,

253
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,320
 "We want to help you out and not make you look like the only person wearing a wig."

254
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,160
 So they wore wigs as well, and that spread,

255
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,840
 and everyone was wig wearing again.

256
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,440
 Anavastria popularized hot chocolate.

257
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,640
 Did she?

258
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,720
 Yeah, she brought it over from Spain.

259
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,560
 And it became an instance data symbol,

260
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,600
 and they said that only the aristocracy were allowed to drink it.

261
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,200
 And that was true for a while, and then after a while,

262
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,280
 everyone was allowed to drink it in front.

263
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,960
 I know I've said this before.

264
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
 It is easy to see why they had a revolution

265
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,120
 if they're saying only we can drink hot chocolate.

266
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,640
 Yeah.

267
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,400
 I'm amazed it took a hundred years after this.

268
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,160
 There is a theory that there is a bonus track hidden in the last supper.

269
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,840
 What do you mean?

270
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,680
 Is that the bread rolls on the table are a musical arrangement?

271
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,240
 Come on.

272
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,960
 And if you play the bread rolls from left to right along the last supper, it plays a tune.

273
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,320
 So presumably people have done this.

274
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,480
 Yes, I clicked on it earlier today, and it said video unavailable.

275
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,400
 We just, so we don't know what the tune is now.

276
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
 No, I've actually heard it.

277
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,560
 Yeah, and it's a tune that does work.

278
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,360
 So it's--

279
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,480
 So I'm not making this up.

280
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,360
 No, you're not making this up.

281
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:27,760
 Thank you.

282
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,240
 Yeah.

283
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,960
 I've never seen this before.

284
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,320
 I've never seen it like I've been making it up.

285
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,400
 I mean, the guy who discovered it is insane,

286
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,840
 but it's not real.

287
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,880
 It's not a real thing.

288
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,080
 He's looked at bread rolls and thought that looks like a quaver.

289
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,200
 Like that's not a thing.

290
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,800
 Did you guys hear about the countdown thieves in 2009?

291
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,600
 No.

292
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,960
 So these were some, I think I might have read this in the Daily Mail,

293
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,920
 but these were thieves that the police were hunting for who were stealing

294
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,400
 some bit letters from shop signs.

295
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,280
 In Norwich, they did it to seven stores over three nights,

296
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,360
 and they were seeing specific letters,

297
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,800
 and then one of them was caught on camera and was overheard saying,

298
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,640
 "I'm just trying to spell my own name."

299
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,160
 And so then the police released the fact that they were looking for people

300
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,960
 who might be called one of these names.

301
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,240
 Sam, Danny, Alan, Lloyd, Glyn, or Manning.

302
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,000
 Can they realize that Manning did turn Manning?

303
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,360
 He pulled on hard times.

304
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,920
 I once tried to convince Dan Schreiber that one of the lines

305
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
 in the English national anthem was,

306
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,800
 "Oscopistoria."

307
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,400
 Has it?

308
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,800
 Everything else seems to rhyme with that.

309
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,160
 And he was like, "That's not true.

310
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,280
 Surely, surely, isn't that."

311
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,840
 And I was like, "When are they going to pull out his phone and Google it?"

312
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,880
 And he pulled out his phone.

313
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,920
 He was like, "It's not true, right?"

314
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,280
 And I was like, "No, of course it's not true."

315
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,000
 "You're not going to do anything."

316
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,880
 He sounds like an idiot.

317
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,920
 Yeah, but I'm on.

318
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,000
 I discovered a few things that genuinely surprised me about both ears

319
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,440
 and what we can hear and what we can't hear.

320
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,560
 So first thing that shocked me is that when we're asleep,

321
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,240
 our ears are still listening.

322
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,840
 Isn't that weird?

323
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
 Well, how do you think loud noise is where you are?

324
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,480
 I pull out.

325
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,840
 Just so you went deaf, deaf and blind.

326
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
 Oh, she's got her there, pal.

327
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,720
 I assumed that that was some sort of like secret knock to let.

328
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,240
 Like it's just, if it's at a certain loudness and maybe,

329
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,440
 then you get woken up.

330
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,400
 But I did genuinely think that when you went to sleep,

331
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
 you sort of just, "Boo, shut down."

332
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
 And your ears kind of just went, "Okay, I'm taking the night off as well."

333
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,040
 And you are alone in thinking that, I think, "Yeah."

334
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,880
 Really?

335
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,800
 So let's move on to my next amazing thing.

336
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,520
 Apparently, when this is a noise that we can't hear that we make on our own,

337
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,000
 when you rub your forefinger and your thumb together,

338
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,920
 you make an ultrasonic signal.

339
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:58,640
 It works so clearly that people often use it to detect

340
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,040
 whether a bat detector is working.

341
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,560
 So you rub it against a back detector, and that will give you a signal.

342
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,400
 So anyone listening, I'm doing it now.

343
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,680
 If you just go to your bat detector, and I wonder if over a podcast, I can set it off.

344
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,400
 Well, do you know that?

345
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,200
 Anna.

346
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,760
 I'm so sorry.

347
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,240
 I mean, change.

348
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,920
 Sorry, what is a bat detector?

349
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,480
 Who has bat detectors?

350
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,280
 People with bats.

351
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,320
 What do you mean a bat detector?

352
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
 Something that's detecting the ultrasonic sounds of bats,

353
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,360
 like a scientific instrument.

354
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,320
 Right, yeah.

355
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,120
 Must be.

356
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,160
 But yeah, that's...

357
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,720
 Dan, for the listener at home,

358
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,080
 Dan has been rubbing his finger and thumb by the mic for about 30 seconds now.

359
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,400
 And if I could get, and your home will be full of bats.

360
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,120
 Did you know that laughing cow is Comte?

361
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,920
 Cheese.

362
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,720
 What do you mean?

363
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,360
 I love...

364
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,320
 Sorry, I don't know Comte.

365
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
 Oh, maybe...

366
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,840
 No, maybe this is just a thing that we have in my family because I love it.

367
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,480
 It's like really creamy, nice European cheese.

368
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,120
 I don't think you're family the only people here.

369
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,440
 I don't think there's a special Tujensky family cheese.

370
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,640
 Tujensky's?

371
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,120
 I...

372
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,920
 Wow.

373
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
 I mean, it was a hard one,

374
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
 and I tried it, and it didn't work out.

375
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,960
 It used in ski.

376
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
 Yeah, it does the obvious shit.

377
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,480
 The great Pitch and Race disaster

378
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,600
 was something that Anna posted about on the QI Bards a few years ago,

379
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,560
 and that I read about.

380
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,360
 Do you remember that?

381
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,480
 I love it.

382
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,000
 I couldn't believe I've never mentioned it before,

383
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,680
 when all the pigeons disappeared.

384
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,000
 Because there's an extremely famous Pitch and Race.

385
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,160
 Sorry, extremely famous among Pitch and Fancy's.

386
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,560
 And it's between Paris and London.

387
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,000
 It's between France and the UK.

388
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,560
 And it was in the 80s or 90s.

389
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,320
 It was from Nantes to the UK to the people's homes in the UK.

390
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,080
 And yeah, there were 60,000 pigeons taking part

391
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,840
 and 90% of them disappeared.

392
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,160
 And no, it never happened, like every year before that, they'd all arrive back.

393
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,960
 No, a new way.

394
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,360
 There's a theory that there was a Concorde flight

395
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,120
 that was going over the channel at the time,

396
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,760
 and that disrupted their magnetic impulses and cookies.

397
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,200
 Sorry, were we in?

398
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,920
 '97.

399
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,280
 Oh, okay.

400
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,160
 So quite recently.

401
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,960
 Yeah.

402
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,680
 And there was one guy called Tom Rodin

403
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,320
 who lost his winning champion Pitch and White Tail.

404
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,960
 And five years later, the Pitch and was on his doorstep.

405
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,440
 Yeah.

406
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,240
 Oh, no way.

407
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,440
 Five years.

408
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,640
 I want to see the movie about one hundred and five years.

409
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,280
 I'm guessing that was awesome.

410
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,560
 Do you think he over the dawn?

411
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,840
 Where the hell have you been?

412
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,040
 Have you heard of Bristol's punctuation Banksy?

413
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,200
 This is an amazing guy.

414
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,600
 He was active at least until last year.

415
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,640
 So he goes around just correcting poor punctuation.

416
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,120
 And there was an interview with him recently.

417
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,160
 He has built himself a device he calls an apostrophyser,

418
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,840
 which is a very long-handled bit of kit,

419
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 which allows him to either cover over an apostrophe

420
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,440
 or shouldn't be there in a sign,

421
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,480
 or add one in if he needs an extra one.

422
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,080
 And someone said to him what he was doing was probably illegal,

423
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,760
 going around, knocking around with businesses sign,

424
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,520
 just for having an apostrophe in the wrong place.

425
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,480
 And he said,

426
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,560
 "I'm sticking on a bit of sticky-back plastic.

427
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,800
 It's more of a crime to have the apostrophys wrong."

428
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,680
 He's wrong about that.

429
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,640
 I think he's wrong.

430
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,400
 But he's been going since 2003.

431
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,120
 Wow.

432
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,840
 So, yeah.

433
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,440
 So he's been getting away with it that long?

434
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,320
 Yeah, and also...

435
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,120
 How has he not been apprehended?

436
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,600
 How misspelled is Bristol that he's still in operation?

437
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,320
 Is he only correcting the word Bristol?

438
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,560
 Yeah, imagine if he thought that Bristol had two S's.

439
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,440
 He's like, "They've got it run again."

440
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,320
 I think it's not a full-time job.

441
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,200
 It's also not a job.

442
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,000
 But he is cool, as you say,

443
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,640
 the Banksy of Punctuation or Apostrophe Avenger.

444
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,080
 So he's got, you know, cool names.

445
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,920
 They feel ironic to me, those names.

446
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,120
 They feel self-given.

447
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,000
 Yeah.

448
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,520
 There is a National Punctuation Day in America.

449
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:43,760
 So...

450
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,840
 And CNN interviewed the guy, he's called Jeff Rubin, who set it up.

451
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,200
 He used to be a reporter.

452
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,440
 And CNN wrote that he grew increasingly frustrated

453
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
 as he spotted errors in the newspaper.

454
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,480
 I quoted him,

455
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,880
 "I would sit at the kitchen table with my red Sharpie,

456
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,280
 screaming obscenities, which were upset my wife."

457
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,680
 She encouraged me to find another outlet for my aggravation.

458
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,880
 So he set up National Punctuation Day.

459
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,400
 Oh, good on him.

460
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,600
 I mean, good on...

461
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,120
 Yeah, it's better for his wife.

462
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,320
 Sort of. I wonder if that has solved his quite deep-seater character flaws

463
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,240
 that I'm interpreting from that story.

464
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,480
 But...

465
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,440
 Whatever he had to do.

466
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,280
 They had things called dog dramas in the 19th century,

467
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,320
 early 19th century,

468
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
 where the dog was like the hero of the play.

469
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,120
 So they would usually have other human actors,

470
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,440
 but the dog would do the really heroic things.

471
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,120
 There was one where the show ended with a dog jumping in the pool of water

472
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,240
 and saving a child.

473
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,400
 But what would often happen is

474
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,480
 mischievous theater goers would throw meat onto the stage to describe the dogs.

475
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,920
 That's so funny.

476
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,680
 Thus drowning a child, but...

477
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,120
 It's all good fun for the audience, isn't it?

478
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,680
 So you know the idea of just going back to the fire of London.

479
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,400
 Did you guys know that the sort of, there's a worshipful company of bakers,

480
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,760
 it's sort of the union of the bakers.

481
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,240
 They apologized officially for it.

482
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,800
 Yeah, 320 years later.

483
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,440
 So after the legal threat, it's diminished.

484
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,600
 Well, it's never too late to apologize.

485
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,320
 Said the then Lord Mayor of London, who's called Alan Davis.

486
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,000
 Oh, yeah.

487
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,120
 Do you guys remember Alan Davis?

488
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,080
 That must have been only an excuse.

489
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
 I remember the guy who was in QI.

490
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,520
 Yeah, it's still in QI, by the way.

491
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,480
 He used people here in this.

492
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,920
 Yeah, he used to be the Mayor of London.

493
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,720
 No, no, Alan Davis.

494
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,120
 I think around 1986, this would have happened if it's 320 years after 1666.

495
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,680
 And I did work that out.

496
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,840
 And it did take ages.

497
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,120
 This is closest as I come to sounding intelligent.

498
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,400
 Yeah, they they apologize to officially for it.

499
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,520
 That's good that they admitted to it finally, because at the time,

500
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,080
 the French and the Dutch were blamed all across town.

501
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,160
 And loads of French and Dutch were arrested.

502
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,480
 And I think that was beaten up.

503
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,080
 And yeah, beaten constantly.

504
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,520
 So we were at war or Britain was at war with France and in Netherlands,

505
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,280
 there was probably Protestant plots everywhere.

506
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,240
 And so I think there was a French woman who had a breast cut off

507
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,760
 because people thought what she was carrying was explosive devices.

508
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,560
 And it was just...

509
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,520
 It was chickens.

510
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,480
 Oh, right.

511
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,280
 She was carrying some chickens and people thought they were fireballs.

512
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,240
 You would have thought in the process of chopping off someone's boobies.

513
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,720
 You would find out that they weren't fireballs.

514
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,400
 They were chicks, wouldn't you?

515
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,200
 Yeah.

516
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,160
 You've gone too far, then.

517
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,760
 You've got to go through with it.

518
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,800
 You're right.

519
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,080
 There are parallels with our current political climate.

520
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,960
 Unfortunately, have we progressed?

521
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,800
 Yes.

522
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,240
 This is the big breast cutting off of the 21st century.

523
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,080
 Yeah, it's the horrific metaphor that we find ourselves in.

524
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,880
 Wow.

525
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,120
 In 2010, in Belgium, there was a guy who was experimenting with the idea

526
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,920
 of solving the problem of pigeons pooing all over cities.

527
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,120
 So massive problem, poo on your head, poo on car windows.

528
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,920
 Yeah.

529
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,600
 It's on your head.

530
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,640
 And so what he's attempted to do,

531
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,080
 and I don't know if this has actually worked,

532
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,120
 but he's tempted to create a special bacteria

533
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,760
 that when it's fed to the pigeons, it metabolises,

534
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,160
 and when they defecate what comes out is not poo,

535
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,000
 but a soapy-like substance.

536
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,760
 So they end up cleaning your head, shampooing your head,

537
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,800
 and cleaning the streets.

538
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,240
 I'd say we've had a few shelters, I think.

539
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,040
 You don't want to squeeze a pigeon over your head in the shower.

540
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,600
 Yeah, so the idea is that-

541
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
 It's not make them poo soap.

542
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,160
 It's not fair.

543
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,080
 It's not fair, but it's probably possible.

544
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,680
 But I just couldn't-

545
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,600
 Where's the waste product going?

546
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,440
 I mean, there's poo in that soap.

547
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,400
 Yeah, there is poo in there.

548
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,360
 It's pooey soap.

549
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,640
 It's pooey soap in there.

550
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,040
 Yeah.

551
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,520
 I suppose what they're saying is, okay,

552
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,920
 so there are soapy molecules in there.

553
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,720
 Yep.

554
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,960
 Which will attach to the pooey substances,

555
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,120
 and when it rains, it will be easier to flush away.

556
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,480
 Does that make sense?

557
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,280
 It feels like-

558
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,600
 I forgot that poo has to come out at some point.

559
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,320
 So yeah, that must be the logic.

560
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,560
 Unless these pigeons are just growing bigger and bigger and bigger,

561
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,880
 and eventually they're just explode with their own feces.

562
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,840
 But I don't think-

563
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,000
 It's more problems to completing a facility.

564
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,800
 It certainly does.

565
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,280
 But they were-

566
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,400
 It's a very short-term solution.

567
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,760
 This wasn't just a mad guy.

568
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,280
 They were given a grant by the Flemish Architecture and Design Committee

569
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,320
 and Ministry of Culture.

570
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,560
 Like it was a funded proper science-

571
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,320
 So we're going to the Ministry of Culture, though, wouldn't you?

572
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,120
 If you had this-

573
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,560
 Not slightly strange idea.

574
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,960
 That's true.

575
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,160
 There's no other science people.

576
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,000
 There is a thing, there's a-

577
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,040
 This is another amphipod, which this is originally about,

578
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,000
 and it's called-

579
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,600
 And I'm going to take a run up at this-

580
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,640
 Sudamphithoidis Incavaria.

581
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,880
 It lives in the Caribbean and it eats seaweed.

582
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,960
 And this is another really sort of just a weird defense mechanism in nature.

583
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,160
 So the seaweed that it eats has chemicals which deter fish.

584
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,240
 Same deal, it gives off toxic chemicals.

585
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,360
 But the amphipod, it doesn't just eat it.

586
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,080
 It also makes a little house for itself out of this algae.

587
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,600
 And it has-

588
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
 Have it some food, I guess, right?

589
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,600
 Yeah.

590
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
 Like a gingerbread house kind of thing.

591
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,200
 Yeah, exactly like that.

592
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,800
 And so, exactly like that.

593
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,280
 And it swims around with its head and front legs sticking out of this-

594
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,960
 It's more like a sleeping bag, I guess.

595
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,480
 It's more like a more sleeping bag than a house.

596
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,600
 A gingerbread sleeping bag.

597
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,440
 Yeah.

598
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,000
 Or like a ham sleeping bag.

599
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,080
 Like a hamock.

600
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,520
 Like a hamock.

601
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,120
 Wow.

602
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,880
 You guys are going to be so surprised by the laugh that comes after that when the podcast comes out.

603
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,040
 I don't remember that being nearly as funny on the night.

604
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:30,800
 A lot of pigeons are being smuggled out of Syria at the moment.

605
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:37,840
 So because Syria was the world-leading pigeon breeding place.

606
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,120
 So in the Middle East they say, you know, all the best pigeon breeders are Syrians.

607
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,800
 And now they're getting sent over the board because obviously it's not safe for them to be there

608
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,080
 anymore and pigeon fanciers in Syria can't keep them anymore.

609
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,600
 And so there are lots of collectors who are going on these kind of death-defying missions

610
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,440
 to get them. There's a guy who's spent five million dollars on Syrian pigeons.

611
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,240
 This is a guy called NASA who's a Jordanese, Jordanian, who's Jordanian.

612
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,160
 And there was one instance where 70 pigeons were killed when they were being smuggled across

613
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,960
 the border and they got caught in a fight.

614
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,320
 So yeah, it's taken its toll on the poor pigeons.

615
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,440
 But yeah, they are- they are really valuable there.

616
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,680
 That's amazing. Act by the Great, who was a Mughal Emperor around there.

617
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,600
 In the 16th century, he always travelled wherever he went with his personal colony of 10,000 pigeons.

618
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,560
 10,000?

619
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,600
 What? They're only small.

620
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,520
 I can have 10,000 of one rooms, please.

621
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,200
 I don't think they all got their own room.

622
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,720
 No, maybe not.

623
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,960
 But they could like- some of them were really beautiful.

624
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,000
 Some of them could do tricks and tumble through the air and, you know.

625
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,040
 Some of the poods so well.

626
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,560
 There's a whole whole thing.

627
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,400
 Did he name them all?

628
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,400
 I don't know. I doubt it.

629
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,240
 No, he probably named his favourite ones.

630
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,120
 Yeah, yeah.

631
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,040
 That is impressive.

632
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,200
 I'm taking a register every day for that.

633
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,520
 Do you guys know what's happened to actually the original manuscript of the origin of species?

634
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,560
 On the origin of species?

635
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:02,720
 Nope.

636
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,480
 So it has various drawings on it.

637
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,840
 So for instance, it has a drawing of a green fish with pink legs and fins and a bright blue umbrella.

638
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,960
 And this is covered in these doodles.

639
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,440
 And this is because Charles Darwin was a really fun dad.

640
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,880
 So we wrote the origin of species.

641
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,800
 And then he gave it to his kid.

642
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,240
 So I was like, "Well, I'm done with this now.

643
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,200
 I've had this idea.

644
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,680
 Have that."

645
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,440
 And it's covered in his kid's doodles.

646
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,920
 Cool.

647
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,880
 And so,

648
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,440
 I read the book and thought maybe one day animals will evolve to have an umbrella.

649
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,800
 Yes.

650
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,920
 Yeah, maybe actually Darwin discovered a lot more than he led on.

651
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,320
 Yeah.

652
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,200
 You know, he did, we wanted to keep it secret.

653
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,680
 Yeah.

654
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,480
 So he put around the story,

655
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,920
 "Oh yeah, my kids just drew that weird creature with 15 legs and...

656
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
 ...an umbrella growing out of its fin."

657
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,360
 Yeah.

658
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,680
 Yeah.

659
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,800
 So it was actually him who drew it and he was backtracking on his own illustrations.

660
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,600
 That's what I'm saying, right?

661
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,320
 Darwin drew these secret animals that didn't exist.

662
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,520
 Because he thought if they don't believe that,

663
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,600
 relatively plausible evolution and stuff,

664
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
 they're never going to believe in the umbrella fish.

665
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,080
 Another Canadian thing.

666
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,840
 Well, do you know what the national animal of Canada is?

667
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,640
 Which I think is a bit right.

668
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,440
 It's not a user?

669
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,240
 Yeah, it's a beaver.

670
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,040
 It's a beaver, yeah.

671
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,960
 It's what I just always think it's such a great thing to have bears.

672
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,400
 I would have picked that.

673
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,040
 But it's really controversial, they're not really into having the beaver.

674
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,040
 It's been debated whether they should ditch it since the mid-19th century.

675
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,880
 And in 1964, I was reading a lecture that a Canadian historian gave

676
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,680
 that complained that the beaver is representative of English Canada rather than French.

677
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,000
 And that means that it represents a pretty intelligent animal on a rather low level

678
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,120
 who is very fond of work and has not much idea beyond that.

679
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,920
 So that was his impression of what the English element of Canada

680
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,320
 had given to the country that the beaver represented.

681
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,560
 And what did the French area want in?

682
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,680
 I'm not sure actually, what would the French animal be?

683
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:51,840
 Not a beaver or something with fur that was cute that we would kill.

684
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,120
 Yes, a bear.

685
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,000
 Yes, a bear, or a seal butt.

686
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,440
 Lovely.

687
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,280
 But we're introducing beavers to Scotland at the moment, isn't that?

688
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,080
 Yeah.

689
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,800
 The new thing.

690
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,360
 Yeah.

691
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,160
 And very interestingly, when they were introduced wolves in the various parks in North America,

692
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:14,320
 particularly in Yellowstone, it had this extraordinary effect of increasingly beaver population,

693
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,560
 which no one had considered, but it just a sort of another example of how into

694
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,840
 related everything uses, that the wolves slightly kept down the elk's stroke moose.

695
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,480
 And they didn't go as far south and they didn't eat the young vegetation

696
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,880
 on which the beavers relied to make that sort of fluff up their dams.

697
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,200
 But they thrived because of the, but miles, you know, a thousand miles north

698
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,400
 where the wolves were was affecting the beavers in the south.

699
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,600
 Wow, you couldn't have predicted that, really, could you?

700
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,680
 No, it's marvellous, it's like a butterfly effect in a way.

701
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
 It is, so I wish a mess with it.

702
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:59,840
 Another Canadian thing, one more thing, Poutine, so this...

703
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,040
 Yes, nice delicious food.

704
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,280
 Yeah, gravy, sort of gravy on...

705
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,040
 Gravy on chips with curd.

706
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,840
 That's it.

707
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,240
 ...on it.

708
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,480
 Right, and they give it a post-sounding name to convince us.

709
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,400
 It doesn't sound like Ellie D's name for a lady part.

710
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:17,680
 Well, the thing is, in French parting speaking Canada, it's kind of unusual sounding to them,

711
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,680
 because in France, you don't call Vladimir Putin, Poutine.

712
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,000
 Because in France, Putin means prostitute.

713
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,040
 Of course, Putin, yes.

714
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,680
 Putin, yes.

715
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,720
 So in France, they all call him Vladimir Poutine.

716
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,720
 And so in Canada, they have like a Vladimir's Poutine

717
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,520
 and restaurants.

718
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,720
 Ah!

719
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,160
 Very cool.

720
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,440
 Do you know when the queen takes her Christmas decorations down?

721
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,840
 Never. Never.

722
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,360
 She's one of those weirdos who has them all here.

723
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,840
 Yeah, she waits till February, February the 6th, and it's actually quite sweet.

724
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,800
 It's an honor of her father who died on that day.

725
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,200
 And then they do these weird things when they have their Christmas dinners.

726
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,320
 So this year, Meghan Markle will be weighed before she has her Christmas turkey,

727
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,720
 as will all of the royal members.

728
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,320
 They do this thing where they weigh them.

729
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,520
 They all stand on a weighing scale.

730
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,080
 Just the numbers, though, the people as well, right?

731
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,320
 Sorry, I'm ashamed.

732
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,200
 Yes, they will be weighed.

733
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,280
 The royal Christmas toddler weigh it.

734
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:26,560
 So they weigh the full of humans, and they then have the meal,

735
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,680
 and then they weigh them afterwards again to see whether or not they've been

736
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,480
 well fed enough.

737
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
 That's the symbolic idea of that.

738
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,240
 So you have to eat the most.

739
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,040
 Do you have to gain the most?

740
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,840
 I don't think it's a game.

741
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,320
 I think it's just a tradition.

742
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,760
 And also, the queen likes to wear it.

743
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,320
 Again, this is, like you say, a lot of this stuff is put out there,

744
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,960
 who knows if it's true, from their official sources.

745
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,160
 She likes to wear the paper crown from a cracker.

746
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,800
 That's her thing.

747
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,160
 Is she?

748
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,360
 Quite nice image, isn't it?

749
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:59,280
 Wouldn't it be great to rig up Prince Charles's cracker?

750
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,960
 So there's never a crown inside?

751
