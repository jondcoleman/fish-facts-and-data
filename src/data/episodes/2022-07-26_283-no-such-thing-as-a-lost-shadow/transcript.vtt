00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.600
 And welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast this week

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:32.220
 coming to you live from Geneva. My name is Dan Schreiber I am sitting here with Anna

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.640
 Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.480
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.920
 here we go starting with you Anna. My fact this week is that jobs that have recently

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:57.840
 been added to the US census include dose scaler, automotive window tinter and blimp pilot.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.000
 These are the jobs of the modern world apparently. What is a pilot? Well we'll come onto that blimp

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.480
 the back in baby. What is a dose scaler? Yeah it's a really good question it's something

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:18.880
 to do with baking. Now I understand thank you. The US has a census every every ten years

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.360
 like a lot of places and then every year they do the American community survey where

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.480
 they still interview lots of people and the way they find out about the jobs people

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.840
 have got is they just ask describe what you do you know what your roles in in tail and

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.160
 then if enough people describe a similar thing that doesn't yet fit into a category they

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.080
 add that category and enough people to describe the work that goes into scaling dough.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.320
 It's amazing. To make dose scaler a new job. There are a lot out there there are a lot

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.400
 of these jobs as an entire spreadsheet which I've read through well I've read through the

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.880
 start of it. The first in the list is Abeloni Fisherman. It's on the alphabetical order.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.400
 You can be an abrasive grinder. I know I am. You have an abrasive grinder profile.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.800
 There is alcoholic counsellor which sounds like it's the counsellor who's an alcoholic.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.960
 Yeah. Oh I'm your local counsellor I just want to count on your vote.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.440
 There is some people in America who describe themselves as an animal killer and also an

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:34.080
 animal avisorator. Wow. I know. And just let me do this. This is all things from the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:46.400
 B category. So baby nurse. I'm not sure if that's a baby who's a nurse or a bull holder.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:55.840
 Bull holder. Bull shagger. Bull point pen cartridge tester. Banana expert. Bean snapper.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:07.840
 Bean robber. Beef killer. Belly builder. Biscuit wear. Bladder blower. Bone puller. Bone worker.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:17.920
 Boring machine operator. Bottom cementer. Bottom filler. Bottom sprayer. I'm breast worker.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.240
 Breast worker. That old genuine thing that you can do. Do you say beef killer? Beef killer.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.720
 Is that for people who are still not sure if they're cow's dead and they just really want

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.000
 to really make sure. I think that's what they've been in it for, you know, some time presumably.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.680
 They're old so they have the latest one up there so I don't know if they're new. I don't

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.400
 know when they came in. It's a weird thing because these are the census jobs. It's sort

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.120
 of there's a lot of I guess humor as well in it where people just write a fake job down

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.080
 and those have been collected over the years. So these are obviously all real but I was reading.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.920
 It goes back to the 1881 census from the British in Britain. Sorry. They have great ones

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.720
 that are on there and this was tweeted by someone called Jordan Erica Weber. She found these.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:12.520
 So on the census in 1881 there was artificial skon maker. Body washer. Body is in your bum bum.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:20.440
 It's got me the medical mumbo jumbo down. Examiner of underclothing ferret weaver fish

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:31.800
 bender, grape dryer, turnip shepherd and 52 years in imbecile. I wrote this list too because

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.120
 some people just put their sort of status in life as opposed to their job. So one person

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:45.640
 wrote fatuous pauper. Another one wrote very feeble. One person, this intrigues me, wrote

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:54.200
 drowning. I want to know about the circumstances under which then the answer to the next question

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:02.760
 was I assume when I saw that it was for rabid animals maybe. You have to drown an animal

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.720
 that's going to kill people. Why do you have to drown it? How are you going to kill a rabid

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.800
 kitten? Why have you turned this back on me? Why are you going to drown it? Sorry, I'll

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.720
 give my rabid kitten to you next time I have one. I'm actually only qualified as a beef

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.720
 killer. They're always doing weird stuff in the olden days with animals like contorting

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.080
 them into weird shapes. Did you mention fish bender? Is that before they invented balloons

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.920
 and they just had to do it with the real thing. Children's birthday parties were so traumatic.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:42.760
 They were poodle but it was a cat before. They had a cow banger. Don't you mention that cow

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.960
 banger and then the fish bender which you mentioned. What is a cow banger an abattoir person?

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.040
 I assume it must be and maybe there were more flu between what beef men in that you can

00:05:52.040 --> 00:06:00.240
 kill it and bang cows. When the census happens in the USA, there are 600,000 people working

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.560
 on it which means that the act of taking the census alters the unemployment rate by 0.2%.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:14.920
 So when they're going through is it just like census taker, census taker. There's a weird

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.320
 thing that happens with the American census which is on the, I think it's done on April

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.600
 the 1st, weirdly. So it must encourage a lot of people to write bizarre things. Except for

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.080
 one place which is Alaska where it happens on the 25th of January and the reason for that

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.000
 is because by the time April the 5th comes around it's too cold there so everyone's gone.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.440
 They've just gone to warmer places and no one's there to do the census.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.160
 Mate, why do you think it's getting colder as the year goes on?

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.280
 Sorry. Do you think it's colder in April in Alaska that it is in January?

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:53.640
 The reason is...

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.720
 Hang on, we'll spend December in January in Alaska when it's lovely.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.400
 But then we'll get out of there for April.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.240
 35 years at Inbecile.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:10.160
 Sorry, I come from Australia. Our seasons are different there.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.600
 Yeah, yeah. I've actually quite a good excuse.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.800
 I've been there for 16 years. It's a terrible excuse.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.720
 I think it's because it gets a bit warmer there and when it gets warmer in Alaska, then the

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.440
 people who live there go and do things like fishing, they're in communities that go fishing

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.000
 and hunting so when you go round to take, look, join my notes.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.440
 When they go round to take the census no one's home. I think that's partly silly with

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.440
 it, right?

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.480
 That's not so sure.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.560
 People used to prank the census. This was really exciting in 1911 in the UK.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.680
 It was the first time that people got to actually hand right their own responses.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.240
 So that's quite cool for a number of reasons because it means you find very famous people

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.200
 in there, Winston Churchill is in there, just listing what he does.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.320
 But there's also, for example, a man who, it was only the head of the household who wrote

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:05.520
 the responses. One man listed one of the occupants of his house as Peter Tabby, whose occupation

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:12.360
 is Mouser and his nationality is Persian and the census representative has crossed out

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.440
 this line. You can see the cross-out line and Britain beneath it, this is a cat.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.880
 We have to round it now.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.680
 We're going to have to move on in a second, guys.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.880
 Oh, can I just say some things that other things that have been written on censuses is.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.560
 So the people who are taking them, right, interesting stuff, in the 19th century, in America, in the

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.160
 19th century in the UK, this was, the censors take up a go round and often they'd ask

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.880
 the questions and then write down the answers themselves and it was about taking a census

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.720
 of everyone in the household. But sometimes you had a homeless person who was camping

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.160
 out in a barn or things like that. So, for instance, in one census, someone was recorded

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:55.400
 on the census, but he just wrote next to him drinking, slept in shed, unclear whether he

00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.160
 was a member of the household. Another one was recorded as at home, but dead.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.160
 Would you want someone to clarify? If you go, "Oh, it's James in," you want someone to

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:13.040
 clarify. I was like, "Yes, but he is dead." There was one really snooty one in Hampshire,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.120
 in the Hampshire Parish Record, actually, that someone found online and it was recording

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:24.280
 the existence of the baptised bastard child of Mary Brown, gotten of John Smith, brackets,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.360
 so she say it, close brackets.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:35.560
 Well, because it was often vickers who recorded it and they were very judgmental. So the very

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.240
 reverend Dr. Peter Scrimshire would go to go around doing all of his parishes and responses,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.000
 and so he found an unmarried mother and he just described her occupation as "man-trap."

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:57.600
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact. My fact this week is, heavy metal

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.520
 musician Tony Iomi began playing heavy metal guitar with two metal fingers because he

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:12.000
 lost his real ones while working at a metal factory. This is Tony Iomi from the band "Black

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.920
 Sabbath." I got this fact, I just have to say, it's one of the best books I've read in

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.640
 a long time. It's called "History of Heavy Metal" by a friend of ours, Andrew O'Neal, who's

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.200
 a comedian, but he's written a proper history of heavy metal as just brilliant, packed with

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.440
 facts, lots of funny jokes. The opening line is one of my favourite opening lines to a book.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.880
 He says, "This is the opening line. There are two types of people in the world. People

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:39.840
 who like heavy metal and dicks." So Tony Iomi, he was working in a metal factory and he was

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.440
 asked to do a job that he would never done before and he was meant to quit that very day and

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.000
 he, in fact, stayed at home and his mum made him go in to do the job. He was working and

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.560
 suddenly, when operating machine, the two tips of his second and third finger were chopped

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.940
 off. The bone was still there. He went to the hospital and they said, "We're going

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.460
 to have to saw the bones off." And he was very depressed and a friend of his brought in a record

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.300
 of a guy called Django Reinhardt, very famous guitarist who could only play with two fingers

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.620
 on his guitar because the rest were paralyzed and he thought, "Okay, I can do this." So he

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.780
 started experimenting with ways that he could make tips for his fingers so that he could

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:22.900
 start playing again. And the first iteration of that was metal. He used metal to make that.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:29.420
 Then he moved on to soldering a cap from a soap bottle down, attaching some leather around

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.060
 it and using that. And what's extraordinary about this is what it's saying is that Tony

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.140
 Iomi is credited with inventing heavy metal. Black Sabbath is said to be the first heavy metal

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.260
 album and it was because of the situation that he couldn't play with regular strings. So

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:49.180
 he had to buy banjo strings for his guitar. He lowered them down and by lowering down the

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.180
 notes, he started playing the first metal riffs and that's why we have heavy metal because

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:58.020
 he lost two fingers in the metal factory. That is unbelievable.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:04.780
 It's almost like he set it up. It's too perfect. I think he did it just to get his

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:10.180
 mum back before he seemed to go to work. The only thing I know about Tony Iomi is that he

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:15.340
 was pretty nuts. I think like Black Sabbath did behave in a gratifyingly crazy way back

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:21.060
 in the day, like you think they did, but he once exploded Richard Branson's prize cup.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.980
 They went to say Richard Branson's house, Black Sabbath, and he decided to launch some

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.540
 fireworks into his let into Branson's lake, where there were his prize cup, which do cost

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.740
 many thousands of pounds and he exploded them all.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.220
 Occupation, cup detonator.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:47.180
 Do you know that heavy metal has a birthday? Oh, stop it. No it does. I mean, what is it? Because

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.900
 Black Sabbath's first album was seen as the very first heavy metal album and it was released

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:59.780
 on Friday the 13th in February 1970. That's the birthday of heavy metal. Yeah, surely deliberate.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:05.660
 Metal probably has more subgenres than any other kind of music I reckon. There's a big

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:12.740
 list on Wikipedia. They have national socialist black metal on the far right and red and anarchist

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:19.540
 black metal on the far left. They have Viking metal, war metal, unblack metal, sludge metal,

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:26.020
 pirate metal, space metal, grind core, death core, core grind, death grind, porno grind,

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:36.980
 math core. Math core. No, math core. Math core. Just maths. Very loud, shouting maths. They have,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:42.020
 speaking of school subjects, they have Latin metal, but unfortunately it's about Latin American

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.620
 music, not all in Latin. So they have geography metal?

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.220
 Wow. But I wonder if it's like the people's front of Judea and the Judea's people's front.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.700
 Do you think they all hate each other? All the metal. Because they sound pissed off about

00:13:54.700 --> 00:14:01.020
 something. From the book, the, the, the, the suggestion that yeah, the split groups are,

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.860
 they don't think there is, you know, hardcore as each other. Yeah. So that's it. Like glam

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.780
 metal, motley crew and all that sort of famously wearing lycra and stuff like that. Oh, glam.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:16.420
 Yes, sorry, I thought it was a gland metal. That's another, it's so genre. Well, they had, in the

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:21.260
 Simpsons once, there was a Simpsons episode where they quoted a Judea's priest song and they

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.660
 referred to it as death metal and they got so many furious letters from metal fans saying

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.340
 Judea's priest is not death metal. That in the next episode of The Simpsons, the message

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.300
 that brought up on the board, what, you know, he writes on the blackboard, the message was

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:42.220
 Judea's priest is not death metal. Wow. Some people who are, some things that do like death metal

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:49.460
 is sharks. Yeah. Um, the tips. Well, let's face it. There was a team from the Discovery Channel

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:57.580
 in 2015 who wanted to attract a large female great whites called Joan of Shark. Do, do, do,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:04.260
 do. And they put this speaker in the water and played a load of death metal and it didn't

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:09.460
 attract Joan, but it attract a load of other sharks. So it does seem like they like the vibrations

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:15.260
 of death metal in particular. Oh, very good. Oh, I have a, I have a fact about, it's, it's

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.780
 related and you'll see why, but it's about Mozart. It's not about metal. But it's about, I was

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.860
 looking at musicians who've overcome impairments basically. Okay. So Mozart started going deaf

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:31.620
 at the age of 26, which is a huge problem, obviously, but it's, sorry, Beethoven? Yes, it

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:42.860
 is. Yeah. Great. Should we begin again? So Beethoven started going deaf at, no, stop it.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.780
 No. Come on. How's that going to sound? What am I going to say? Beethoven started going

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:52.100
 deaf at the age of 26 and it started with Timotus and there are lots of theories as to why he

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.900
 had the Timotus. So the theories as to why include that he may have had lead poisoning or

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:02.700
 syphilis or typhus or that it was due to his habit of immersing his head in cold water to keep

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:09.780
 himself awake. Wow. Yeah. Wait, and that's so the relationship to the previous fact is the

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:17.100
 sharks are also immersed in cold water. Correct. Got it. I couldn't tell you that at the beginning

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:22.460
 because it was the end of this phase. Spoiler. Yeah. Spoiler that. Brilliant fact about

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.580
 Mozart or Beethoven or whoever it was. We need to move on to something like that. I've got some

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:32.260
 stuff about people who've lost fingers. Okay. Yeah. So one group of people who've lost a lot of

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:42.740
 fingers is cavemen and women. So cavepersons. So do you mean historical ones? I do. I don't mean

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.580
 people who live in caves today. I mean, how on earth do we know this? The main physical

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.820
 impression that we have of people who live particularly in caves is handprints that were

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.540
 left in lots of caves in France and in a few other countries. So there's the gargous cave in France

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:03.180
 which has 231 handprints left by the people who live there. Of those, 114 are missing at least one

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:08.380
 finger. And there are other caves where it's also 50/50. The handprints that are there are missing

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.940
 at least. And we think they were all working in metal factories too. Yeah. It was the bronze age.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:18.220
 There was a lot of it going on. There's lots of theories. So one is that it was a punishment or

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.380
 one is that it was a kind of ritual thing. Some people think it was frostbite and some people

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:30.300
 think they were just folding down their fingers. They were doing in the metal sign. Well, the ancient

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:34.860
 Greeks used to cut off dead people's fingers. So this was they were paranoid that people weren't

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.540
 actually dead and they cremated them or buried them when they were still alive. And so to check,

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:43.100
 they cut off a finger. The reasoning being that if you weren't dead then you'd say something.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:49.660
 Wow. Well, we know he's at home but we're not sure if he's dead or not. You know, if you do the

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:55.740
 peace sign with your two fingers, if you do that and you're photographed from within nine feet

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.860
 on a smartphone, your fingerprints can be stolen, reconstructed, printed out and used to access

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.940
 your stuff. No. Yeah. Wow. I know. We should say that, I don't know if they gave us permission

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.020
 to say this, but I'm sure they did. When we were at Sir and earlier, we were talking about the idea

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:16.220
 that you get your eyeballs scanned and checked to give you entry to places. I think it came up in

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:21.740
 angels and demons and downbrowns at it. And so apparently they tested it out. Some scientists tested

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:26.700
 that out to see if that does work and it turns out it doesn't. So if anyone was going to murder somebody

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:32.220
 to get their eyeball to let them into a building, it doesn't work at my point. Yeah. If it's not used

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:41.900
 any of Dan Brown's works as a way to live your life. Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:48.860
 James. Okay, my fact this week is that in 19th century Romania, there were people who sold shadows

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:56.220
 and they would sell your shadow without your permission. So then you would die less than one year later.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:03.340
 According to superstition. So in Southeast Europe, they used to have this tradition where you could

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:10.140
 use your shadow as a sacrifice when making a new building. Okay, so basically you would stand there

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.940
 in the sun and then they would put where your shadow is and they would put the first block there

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.540
 and then they would build the rest of the house and supposedly it would stop the house from falling

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:23.180
 down. But like I say, unfortunately it would mean that the person who shadow it was would die within a

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:29.900
 year according to superstition. So people didn't really want to do that and so what they would do is they

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:37.980
 would sneakily entice people to stand over next to a building site and say, oh, just stand over that

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:43.340
 and they're like, you're not going to stop building the house here, are you? No, no, no, no. And then they

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:49.980
 would do it and then they would die within a year according to superstition. And then people kind

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.860
 of got wise to that and you had shadow traders who would kind of stand next to you in the street and

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.820
 they'd see your shadow and then they'd sneakily measure it and then they'd give the measurements to

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:05.180
 a builder and that supposedly counted that if they put the measurements in their foundations and

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:10.460
 that would work as well. And so did these people go home and then suddenly look down at the floor and

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:16.460
 say, oh my god, I've got no shadow. No, unfortunately the laws of physics stayed the same.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.820
 They always, they mostly do. One of these are the same guys who are in.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:28.620
 Do you know what the precursor to this was though? This tradition. This was actually a more humane

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.340
 version of what came before it apparently, which was that the idea was that you had to ward ghosts

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:38.540
 and terrible spirits away from this new house. So what they used to do was either crush someone under

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:45.260
 the foundation stone of a house or put a living person into like in between the walls of the house

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.260
 so that they would die there and their spirit could haunt it and scare away other spirits now.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:54.380
 I can see where the dying within a year bit comes out. Yeah. Not according to superstition at all.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:59.100
 That's just... You wouldn't want to buy a new build house in 19th century Romania, would you?

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.980
 Was that someone at the door? No, that's just the guy in the wall who's still dying.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:09.020
 You know whenever, whenever any man goes to look at a new house, all they do is kind of knock on the

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:13.580
 walls, don't they? And no one has any idea why they're doing it. It's a ritual as old as you're

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:19.900
 just finding the guy. Yeah. So I was looking a bit at shadows. Oh yeah. And I was looking at shadow

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:27.340
 puppets. Okay. So most shadow puppet shapes were invented by the same man. Really? This is amazing.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:33.820
 So he was called Felicia Truey and the art was called Chinese shadows or Ormbrushing was.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:38.140
 And he popularized it basically and he wrote a book saying I can do everything. I can do the elephant,

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:43.180
 the bird, the cat. And there were a lot of people as well. There was the volunteer, the fisherman,

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.500
 the preacher, the jockey, the rope dancer. He didn't entire play, which was just him doing hand

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.940
 shadows. Yeah. And this was, it was really, really popular in the 19th century. And he had one other

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:58.860
 trick as well. His other art was Chapagraphy. Chapagraphy. Can you guess what that is?

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:05.260
 Hey, writing? It's hats. He would get a single piece of felt. Okay, single normal piece of felt.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.980
 He would fold it into different shapes repeatedly to make different kinds of hat.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.900
 And this was really huge. This was the most exciting thing.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:22.140
 And sorry, this was before the internet was it? There is actually, there's footage of very late,

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.020
 like a 19th century Chapagraphy happening. It doesn't call actually. It doesn't, and he, you know,

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:32.060
 he takes it off or it's a later practitioner takes it off. He could do 35 differently shaped hats

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.860
 with a single piece of felt. And when he puts on everyone, he does a little face to say, look,

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:44.060
 this is the nun, or this is the fisherman, or this is the other person. But it was not bad.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.100
 Again, it's just the precursor to the balloon contorter, isn't it?

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.260
 Yeah. Children's birthday parties have always been the same.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:53.580
 Yeah, right. Shadow puppetry, there's the reason they called it Chinese Shadow puppetry.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:23:01.020
 I mean, it is because China did it for 2,000 years before this guy started. But they didn't,

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:07.580
 but they, but they used them, actually, they didn't use their hands because they made wooden puppets

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.580
 in the cast their shadows. Yes, it's the plagiarist.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:14.380
 Oh, here comes the lawyer.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:22.380
 Chinese, so in China, there's evidence of it happening since the 2nd century BC.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.940
 And the legend always went in China that the reason it was invented was because there was an emperor,

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:32.700
 the emperor Wu D, and his favorite concubine died, and he was really devastated.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.380
 And so one of his mystic assistants started Shadow puppetry in order to convince him that his

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:42.860
 concubine had come back from the dead. So he just made the figure of his concubine and cast her shadow

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.580
 on the wall and was like, look, she's just over there in the room. And apparently that made

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:52.940
 she had him up no end. And it caught on. I don't know if he fully believed that she'd come back.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.780
 He could never quite have a conversation with her again. But it caught on and then it was brought

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:04.060
 to you by Genghis Khan, or by Genghis Khan and the Mongols of marauding armies. That wasn't the

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:11.980
 main aim though, was it? Spread the shadow puppetry. That's why they did it. He's always painted

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:18.140
 in a bad light. He was just trying to spread the arts and culture. This one is the invading Horde,

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:24.620
 who will burn your village. The invading Mongol armies traveled with a horde of shadow puppeteers

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.980
 to keep them entertained. They did not. They did. They had shadow puppeteers in their troop. Wow.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:35.900
 You were even the Mongols had an off day. Wait, do you mean a day off when they'd enjoy the shadow

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:42.060
 puppetry? I mean a day off, not bad day. Do you know they've invented building skyscrapers that

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:49.420
 don't have shadows? Wow. This is really cool. Using computers, they've done this. You need two of

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:55.500
 them. You have these two big buildings and then the light comes on and they reflect off like a mirror,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.900
 but then one reflects on to the other and the other reflects on to that one. Basically the light

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.860
 just very slowly goes to the floor and there's no shadow at all. It only works if they're exactly

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:11.980
 on the Greenwich Meridian in London. So you have to build them exactly there in the centre where

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:20.380
 they're already as a museum. Yeah. But in theory it works. Does it have a use? That's the question.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:26.620
 The shadowless building. So the idea is like if you were to build it, you could put it anywhere

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.620
 and slightly change the metrics and you could build it in a different place. These ones

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.780
 only work in Greenwich but other ones can work anywhere. And let's say you want to build a massive

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:39.740
 building near Central Park, for instance, in New York, but you don't want to have a massive shadow

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:44.140
 over the park because people want to sunbathe. You can put these things there and then they won't be

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.860
 getting in people's way. And the other thing is there's a lot of buildings that are now being built

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:54.140
 at a solar powered. And so if you've got a solar powered building or a house or a farm and

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:59.020
 suddenly a big building is just knocking out the sun, you can't operate. So there's new laws

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.180
 that are being put in place to say that you can't have a shadow come over you if you're. Wow.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.980
 Yeah. Because they do, they have a tax on shadows in Italy in some places already which I thought

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.700
 was absurd but it's sounding more sensible. But this is small business owners in mainly in a place

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:18.780
 called Konegliano in Italy have to pay local tax on the shadows that their buildings cast.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.300
 And it's like a hundred years per annum and they didn't really know they were paying it until recently

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:28.780
 and they went what the fuck? I'm paying for my shadow. And the idea is that if you're building

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:34.380
 a castle shadow on someone else's land then you are occupying that person's land. And so you have

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:40.140
 to pay a tax on that. That's really interesting. Yeah. You can get a shadow boyfriend in Japan. That's good.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:46.540
 This is kind of like the Chinese emperor thing actually. So it's a device that was allegedly

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.220
 at the prototype stage last year although I don't think it's made it very much further than that.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:56.780
 But it projects the shadow of a man onto your curtains. It's basically what Kevin does in

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:02.540
 home alone. If you remember that he pretends he's hosting a party. Yeah. So is that a boyfriend or a

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:08.940
 burglar? No, it's the burglar season and he sees oh well there's a big strong man there

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.780
 so I won't try and burglar that home. And you can choose the activities. There are as a range

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:18.380
 of activities you can get them to do. So wait lifting, playing guitar, boxing, just swinging a

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:25.180
 baseball bat around. It feels like overkill. And there are more realistic ones where they're just

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:32.460
 sitting at a computer for ages. But if he's on the other side of the curtain, which is right against

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:37.900
 the window, right? No, no. So you're looking at the building from outside. And as the homeowner,

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:42.620
 you project the shadow onto the closed blinds of the closed curtain. So someone looking from the

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:49.020
 outside thinks they see a bodybuilder. Yeah. What's your beef? Well, who hangs out in front of a

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:54.060
 curtain by their window or a blind? Exactly. So you'd probably think the house was being

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:59.580
 burgled and reported. Oh wait, lots of people hang out. Burglers don't break it and just start

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:06.300
 doing some weightlifting. Not the weightlifting one, but it would be great if you could get a shadow

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.700
 thing to project the image of someone robbing your home. Because then the burglar will see it and

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:18.940
 think oh, the someone's already got that. Yes. Okay, we need to move on to our final fact of the show

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:25.500
 and that is Andy. My fact is that some aphids fix their homes by exploding themselves and plastering

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:32.860
 their own bodies over the holes in the walls. So this is a species called Nippon aphist monzani.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:41.660
 And this is a scientific study by someone called Takema Fukatsu. And they live in very big lumps on

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:48.620
 trees, these aphids called ghouls. And sometimes these are invaded by caterpillars. And these young aphids

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:54.620
 are called nymphs. Technically they're dispatched to assassinate it to stab it to death. And as those

00:28:54.620 --> 00:29:01.820
 guys get fighting, other little aphids soldiers rush there and their job is to explode. They're just

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:06.380
 full of fluid and they get there and then there are these two holes near their bottom and they just

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:12.220
 explode these globules of goo all over the place. And some of them get stuck in the glue as it

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.300
 hardens around them. So they're trying to mend the hole in the wall and fix the breach. And others

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.860
 release so much fluid. They shrink to a third of their original size and then they're just these

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:27.740
 little shrunken balloon aphids who can't do anything. And they die. That's a sad ending to that story

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:32.380
 actually. It's a sort of heroic sacrifice I guess. Oh yeah, yeah. Look at it like that. It's really

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:37.500
 amazing though, isn't it? And they think that the way it might have evolved is that originally these

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.300
 fluids would be helped if you just they just had like a cut on their elbow or something like that.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:47.500
 It was almost like a scabbing thing like a human word, but then it's kind of got more and more and more

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.740
 and more so that now it's learned to scab over a plant rather than just the aphid itself.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:58.780
 This is amazing, isn't it? Some of them seem to go outside the home and so some of them do the

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:04.460
 exploding and then some of them just secrete the gluey stuff and paste it on. But a lot of them do it

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:09.580
 from outside. So then they paste themselves outside their own home. That's tragic. And then they can

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:15.180
 never get back in. Can't get back in. They're bugged. Yeah. That's the real idiot kind of construction

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:23.660
 worker, isn't it? What have I done? They also do this exploding against predators, some of them. So

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:30.380
 cabbage aphids, they get chemicals from cabbages and they can mix certain chemicals and if a lady bird

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:35.660
 or something tries to eat them, they can explode and it's like almost like a mustard gas that goes into

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:42.300
 the lady bird's eyes and then it runs away and they can, well, they are dead. Oh, they die in the

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:47.580
 thing. Yeah, but they've saved their mates. That's the important thing. That's so cool. So they've got

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:51.580
 these two chemicals in different bits of their body and when they're attacked, they combine them.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:55.660
 Yeah, that's right. And that's like in die hard three. That's the bomb in die hard three.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.700
 That's the structure of the bomb in die hard three. That's amazing. They're incredible.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:07.180
 Aphids. Can we talk about die hard three? Sorry. Sorry. Yeah, yeah. No, but they are extraordinary,

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.740
 aren't they? I was reading this thing about them, which is so they'll all exist on a plant, a colony

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:16.620
 of them will exist on a plant, but they don't have wings. So they all hang out there and a lot of them

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:22.380
 do have wings. Well, no, so yeah, but this is, yeah, so let's say with the species that don't have it,

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.780
 they'll be on this plant and they'll suck it dry or it'll get too overcrowded and they need to move

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:33.820
 on. So when that happens, they produce a generation of the same species with wings to fly away and then

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.980
 they land on another plant and then they lose the wings again and just hang out there. They can just,

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.700
 they can just suddenly have a generation of winged aphids of their species. That's really good. They

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.860
 have weird reproduction because they sort of alternate between sexually reproducing and then the

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:51.260
 women going, we can't be bothered to use men and then a sexually reproducing, which mostly they,

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:55.420
 they do the laughter. Don't they? Yeah. But when they're on plants, sometimes they'll be a whole bunch

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:59.180
 of aphids on a plant feeding on it and then they see a deer or something coming towards the

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:03.420
 plant and it's going to eat it so they all need to throw themselves off like a mass leap and then

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.980
 they get to the floor and the little ones piggyback on the bigger ones to escape. So you see the little

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.380
 aphids climbing onto the older aphids back and this is when it becomes more individualistic because

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.940
 a scientist who've watched this say the old ones are there trying to scrape them off as they're trying

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:24.940
 to escape. Go off me, but they do do it. That's amazing and you were saying how they can kind of reproduce

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:30.460
 without males, the females, they could do that up to 41 generations without having any sexual

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:38.140
 act with a male. But it does mean that if you had one aphid, one female aphid in a room and no aphids

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:44.380
 died, then there would be more than 1.5 billion, billion, billion aphids at the end of the season,

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:50.620
 which means that the earth could be covered in a layer of aphids 149 kilometers deep within a year.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:56.940
 Wow, so they're just all most of them are dying. Well, that's why that's why ladybirds are so great.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:03.900
 That's amazing. Is it true that they, sorry Andy, is it true that they are basically born pregnant?

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:08.140
 I kept reading this thing. That's extraordinary and then they give birth to offspring which

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.900
 already have embryos. Which are really like Russian dolls. They're just like there's a tinier aphid.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:19.340
 Three times over. And then they just lift that upper torso off and out comes the smaller version.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:25.020
 So the thing they really like is sap. They love sap. They also get called sap suckers. That's so much

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:31.740
 they like sap. And they excrete this thing as they feed which is called honeydew. And they have to eat

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:36.700
 so much plant sap because they need various nutrients and they can only get those nutrients in the

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:42.700
 quantities they need by ingesting a huge amount of sap. So the giant willow aphid produces four

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:48.540
 times its own body weight in sugar every day that it's excreting. So that's the equivalent of a human

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:54.940
 leaving behind a couple of bathtubs of water every day with 300 bags of sugar inside. That's what

00:33:54.940 --> 00:34:01.340
 they're doing each day. And also other animals love this honeydew which is their aphid excrement.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:07.340
 So sometimes if bees can't get nectar they will just lick up aphid poo instead because it's

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:12.060
 very high in sugar. It's fine. It is fine. It's just it's fine but it's not quite as good as nectar is it?

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:18.220
 It's not quite as good but it does still I mean if honey honey can be made of plant sap but it if

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:22.700
 that's been filtered through an aphid's bum and then formatted up by a bee. But the reason that

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.780
 their sugary excretions are most important is because of this amazing relationship they have with

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.180
 ants right that you can't talk about aphids without talking about ants because the ants love their

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:39.020
 honeydew which is such a weird euphemism for poo. But so they they have this really symbiotic

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.540
 relationship with ants and it's hard to know who's winning and who's losing in that relationship

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:47.500
 and so sometimes ants will bite off aphids' wings so they can't fly away but they can't kill them

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:52.460
 because they need to keep on licking their this honey stuff and so that means they defend them so

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:57.100
 when other attackers come and they want to eat their aphids then the ants will fight them off because

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:02.940
 they'll stop anyone killing them. This is really cool ant actually which is we think is the first

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:08.140
 meat farmer aside from humans. So it's an ant that farms aphids but for their meat because these

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:14.620
 aphids that don't actually produce this sweet stuff and so it's called the melissa tossus and it's

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:19.500
 about three millimeters long and basically they keep all these aphids together inside the bark of trees

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.860
 and they sort of farm them and they gradually eat them but what's quite quite cool about these

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.660
 ants is they've obviously got six legs but one of their pairs of legs their middle pair points

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:32.940
 up not down because they what uses that oh I guess if you fall on your back you can turn yourself

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:37.980
 over again. No it's because they're always burrowing through tunnels in trees and so it helps them

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.220
 get there to two feet on the roof while they've got four feet on the ground. That's amazing. It's cool

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:47.980
 right and also so we don't we're not totally sure they eat the aphids because they really hate being

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:53.260
 spied on they're very private like a lot of us and so we've seen that they keep the aphids sort of

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:57.580
 farmed inside the tree but whenever scientists drill holes in the tree the ants immediately block

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:03.180
 them up again so we haven't been able to watch yet. That's amazing we have to wrap up in a second.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:11.580
 Some aphids defend themselves by having sex with other aphids and getting STDs and they actively seek out

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:17.180
 STDs because they give them superpowers. What superpowers do they get? Well it's a very specific superpower

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:22.700
 wasps like to lay eggs inside aphids and this is a big problem obviously because no one likes to have

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:29.180
 an egg laid inside them by a wasp. So but the good news is that there are particular STI bacteria

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:35.500
 which destroy developing wasp grubs in your body so the only way for a female to protect herself

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:40.300
 is to seek out a male with a sexually transmitted infection. Well how does she know? It's on

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:45.900
 this Tinder profile or something. I don't I don't know how the female knows that the male has it.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:52.300
 So she's been parasitically implanted. I think it's before that. She might be like a prophylactic kind

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:58.300
 of mess. It's like a condom rather than the morning after pills. Yes. Yeah it's except the condom is

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:08.700
 getting an STD. Do you know that due to aphids or aphids had a real thing with wine in the 1900s,

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:14.300
 early 1900s and they really started attacking all the wine in the world. They were eating all of the

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:19.100
 roots and it meant that the French wine industry almost went out of business and actually all of

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:25.500
 Europe did and what they found is that the aphids loved the roots of French vines and other European

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:32.940
 vines but they really hated American vines. And so these days almost all French wine even though

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:39.740
 it's French grapes they're grafted onto American roots. And so actually most French wine is actually half

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:48.780
 American. Wow. We're gonna get letters. Glad we didn't do this back to our Paris bit of the talk.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:55.900
