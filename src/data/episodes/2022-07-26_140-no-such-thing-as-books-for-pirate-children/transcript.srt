1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,840
 *odd noises*

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,240
 to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,600
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,600
 and Annotzzynski and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,840
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,640
 Starting with fact number one and that is my fact.

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,640
 My fact this week is that a pub in London has just renamed itself the Bill Murray.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,840
 However, because they couldn't get his permission they had to name it after William Murray

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,640
 who was King Charles the first whipping boy instead.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,720
 So this is a pub in Angel, North London and they wanted to give tribute as a fact that

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,580
 they were renovating the pub and renaming it but there's a law that you can't name

13
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,280
 a thing like a pub after a living person unless you get their absolute permission.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,800
 That's why they needed his permission.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
 Try to not know.

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,480
 That's why you don't see pubs called like the Pears Morgan everywhere.

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,320
 Did he try to get Bill Murray's permission?

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
 They did quite a few things.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,440
 They found a friend of Bill Murray's brother who they got in contact with.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,080
 Bill Murray famously doesn't have an agent but there's a number that you can call him on

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,920
 and propose projects.

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
 And they left.

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,560
 Or for parts too presumably that's the main function of that.

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
 Exactly.

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,640
 His answer phone is his agent and he listens to them so I think they left a few messages

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,360
 on that and they were going to take an ad out in the newspaper in the local city where

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,960
 he lives so that he might see it just in the paper but then they thought that's a bit

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
 creepy.

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
 Yeah.

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
 Yeah.

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,600
 He's such a fun guy, Bill Murray.

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,320
 He's always crashing random people's parties isn't he?

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
 Yes.

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,040
 He's a bit of a legendary character in that sense.

35
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,680
 Do you think it's because he assumes he's been invited but hasn't got the invite?

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
 Yeah.

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,280
 He went to a 22 year old Norwegian students party I think and then started doing the washing

38
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,880
 up halfway through it which is such a massive sacrifice if you've ever washed up anything

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
 in a student's party.

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
 That's amazing.

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
 Yeah.

42
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,880
 It's one of those things where there's a lot of these stories and the assumption is that

43
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
 they're all fake.

44
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,460
 So actually there has been a site that's set up where you can share your personal Bill

45
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,460
 Murray stories.

46
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,460
 I think it's called Bill Murray Stories.com.

47
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,460
 It's a good name.

48
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,460
 Yeah.

49
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
 It's confusing though, right?

50
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,460
 But so yeah.

51
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,920
 So like all these stories that turns out they are true of people constantly submitting stories

52
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
 about William.

53
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,680
 They should have childhood whipping boy and childhood first.

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,240
 Actually you should explain what a whipping boy is.

55
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
 Yeah.

56
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,840
 So being non-British I had never heard of a whipping boy until I heard about William Murray

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,400
 and it is unbelievable.

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,560
 The idea of a whipping boy, this is back King Charles of Rosa.

59
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,360
 He was 1600s and what would happen is as a child if the prince was naughty.

60
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,760
 There was this rule where you couldn't hit them and you couldn't make them be disciplined

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,200
 off the back of a slapper or anything.

62
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,400
 So they had a best friend who was called the whipping boy.

63
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,360
 If they did anything bad, their best friend would get beaten for it.

64
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,240
 They tried to encourage friendship between the whipping boy and the young prince so that

65
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,760
 the prince would have an incentive not to behave badly.

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,960
 Do you know what an even bigger incentive would be if the prince actually just got whipped

67
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
 every time he behaved badly?

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,440
 I know, but the divine right of kings, it's an absolute kicker.

69
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
 Yeah.

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
 So that was it wasn't it.

71
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,760
 It was because kings are ruled by divine right and so no one's allowed to punish the king

72
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
 except God himself.

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,760
 Although Charles did later go on to be punished in a very big way by Parliament.

74
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
 Yes.

75
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,880
 He was able to nominate Bill Murray to be executed in that place.

76
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,520
 I struggled to find evidence that much whipping was done with the whipping boy and whether

77
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,840
 it was a bit of a nominal thing and idealised thing and actually it was a really privileged

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
 position wasn't it?

79
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,040
 So he eventually was given a great estate somewhere and they often were knighted or became

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,520
 important members of the Nability.

81
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,280
 There was a historical society I read about where they had a debate about where the William

82
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,160
 Murray actually liked Charles I first or not and they did a big debate and they all voted

83
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,680
 that he would definitely not have liked Charles I first.

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
 How come?

85
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,800
 Because he was getting beaten up every time.

86
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,400
 Let's be honest all kids are little shit so what you would do is you would always at least

87
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,200
 be threatening your friends that you're going to do something naughty and you're going

88
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,840
 to go beat up for it.

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,360
 You would and even if I do it to my best friend if I was 10, even if it was your friend, friend

90
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,280
 doesn't mean much when you're 10 years old except someone to be tortured.

91
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:42,400
 I discovered another role which you three might know but I think non-Britz won't know.

92
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:51,280
 The necessary woman was someone who was effectively personal cleaner to the king and had what

93
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,720
 was seen as a very very important job of emptying the toilet.

94
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,840
 That was seen as like a high privilege but the title was the necessary woman.

95
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,840
 Is there anything more necessary than someone tipping the poo out of your toilet?

96
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,560
 No there is not.

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
 There's also a whipping father in existence.

98
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,320
 I'm surprised I hadn't come across this but this is a Christmas character who is a French

99
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,320
 Christmas character who accompanies St Nicholas on his rounds on St Nicholas Day on the

100
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,560
 6th of December and St Nicholas tradition has it goes around and dispenses nice stuff to

101
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,840
 children who've done well but he's also accompanied by the whipping father, the pair Fouetta who

102
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,640
 judges whether or not a child's been naughty and if it has whips it.

103
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
 Where is this?

104
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
 France and Belgium.

105
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,640
 Wow.

106
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,920
 And is Santa cool with this?

107
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,320
 Feels like he should step in.

108
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
 Santa's pro.

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
 Yeah.

110
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,520
 Santa is an ass like if you think about it because he is deciding on whether people get gifts

111
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
 on them.

112
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
 Yeah who made him like moral.

113
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
 Exactly.

114
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
 He was right and right.

115
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
 He has the authority.

116
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
 Yeah.

117
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,520
 Like Christmas knows he has a list.

118
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,520
 He only checks it twice.

119
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,800
 Like I've loads of things I've checked twice and then the third time I've realised there was

120
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 a mistake.

121
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
 That's true.

122
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,400
 Most of the job of Father Christmas is data entry and then there's a brief careering service

123
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
 at the end of it.

124
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
 Can you imagine that?

125
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,440
 You're given this amazing role of being Santa and you didn't realise that for 364 days

126
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
 it's at it.

127
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
 It's Excel.

128
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
 It's all spreadsheet.

129
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
 There are columns.

130
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
 Check one.

131
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
 Check two.

132
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,920
 Presidents delivered, child whipped question mark.

133
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,040
 Just while we're on whipping boys and people being punished for things that aren't their

134
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
 fault.

135
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,040
 So this kind of extended into adulthood as well.

136
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,160
 So Henry IV of France, he became Catholic or he had a ceremony with the Catholic Church

137
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,040
 in 1593 but he obviously had to do penance.

138
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,600
 So what he did instead, he sent two ambassadors to Rome and he said to the Pope, look if I've

139
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,320
 done anything wrong just punish these guys will you?

140
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,080
 And these two ambassadors were beaten on the steps of some Peters while singing the

141
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,000
 misery by the representatives of the Pope.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Wow.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,440
 So the Pope didn't even go out and beat them himself.

144
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,080
 He sent bloody representatives out saying if you need to be beaten please let my representatives

145
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
 do.

146
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
 Yeah.

147
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,920
 The Pope is very much the Father Christmas in this situation.

148
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
 So some other William Murray's.

149
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
 Oh yeah.

150
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,120
 So we've got Bill Murray, haven't we and we've got the whipping boy William Murray.

151
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,720
 There's a William Murray who wrote the Peter and Jane books, do you remember those?

152
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
 No.

153
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
 It was children's books.

154
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,320
 80 million of these were sold around the world and they're extremely kind of simple books

155
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,840
 like Peter plays with the ball.

156
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
 Jane climbs a hill.

157
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
 That's good for you.

158
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,760
 He works out that 12 words make a quarter of all words used by children.

159
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
 Wow.

160
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,600
 And they are a and he I in is it of that, the two and was.

161
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,560
 And so we wrote all these books to kind of just try and teach you those words first.

162
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,560
 Because if you can get those ones nailed to them, the other 20,000 that you learn just

163
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,560
 kind of immediately.

164
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
 I'd love it.

165
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,640
 Please tell me he wrote the books just including all of those words which are just a sequence

166
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,600
 of prepositions and conjunctions and no nouns, no verbs just.

167
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,160
 You can say that was I if you're a pirate child.

168
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
 Yeah.

169
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 So that would be page one.

170
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
 What have you got for page two?

171
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
 Ooh.

172
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
 That was she.

173
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,800
 She isn't one of them.

174
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,720
 And there was a guy called William Murray who invented vacations.

175
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
 What do you mean?

176
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
 The concept of vacation.

177
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
 Yeah.

178
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,560
 So he was American and he there's a mountain range called the ad ion DAX.

179
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,460
 And he used to take people up there to go walking.

180
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,480
 And it used to be that you would call it holiday, the British people called it holiday.

181
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,040
 But he called it kind of vacating your home and going to these mountains.

182
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,640
 And so he kind of coined the word vacation.

183
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
 Wow.

184
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
 So when you go away.

185
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
 That's very cool.

186
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
 Yeah.

187
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,720
 Vacation really sounds like an advertisement to Boglars, doesn't it?

188
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,640
 You act to be saying I'm emptying my house for the week.

189
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,800
 I think it sounds medical.

190
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
 Do you?

191
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
 Yes.

192
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
 Like vacating your balls.

193
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
 Yes.

194
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
 I'm afraid so.

195
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
 I'm afraid so.

196
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
 What?

197
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,600
 It's like you're talking to your necessary woman.

198
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
 I'm afraid.

199
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
 I vacated.

200
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,280
 Once again, it's not the kind of vacation you were hoping to happen to me.

201
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
 Okay.

202
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,640
 We're going to have to move on to our next facts soon.

203
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
 So we can just say a couple of things about pubs.

204
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
 Yeah.

205
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,560
 So Bizarre Coincidence, the pub with the longest name in the country, is in the same town as

206
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,760
 the pub with the shortest name in the country, which is Staley Bridge.

207
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,320
 And I think this is actually like, it's almost in Manchester.

208
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
 But yeah, isn't that weird?

209
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,680
 So it's got the queue in, which is just a queue.

210
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,560
 And then it's got the longest name pub in the country, which is the old 13th Cheshire Astley

211
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
 Volunteer Rifleman call in.

212
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,000
 Also, there are four pubs in the UK called the Blob Shop.

213
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,880
 If that's a derogatory reference to women's mental cycles, then I think that's still okay.

214
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,680
 I'm afraid it is.

215
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,520
 Oh, that kind of vacation again.

216
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,640
 I got this fact from Chordall, the comedy website.

217
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,680
 They reported on the fact that they were changing the name.

218
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,600
 And at the bottom of the article, they had a link to other comedian named pubs.

219
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,360
 So these were all in the UK.

220
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:11,800
 There's the Eric Bartholomew, and that's in Morkum, and that's after Eric Morkum, very lovely.

221
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,800
 There's the four candles in Oxford, which is a tribute to the Ronnie Barker, the two Ronnie

222
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
 Sketch.

223
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,520
 Trolley Chaplin has one in Elephant and Castle, but it's being demolished.

224
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,600
 But in the article, they point out that it might not actually be missed, because the

225
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,880
 online reviews for it include unremitting horror and what a shit hole.

226
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
 Oh, I go.

227
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,840
 Yeah, well, I think it's been demolished now, unfortunately.

228
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
 Very quickly.

229
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,960
 In 2013, a glittering ceremony to reward pubs and clubs in Wiggen for preventing night scene

230
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:48,680
 violence ended in a fight.

231
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,280
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

232
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,680
 Okay, my fact this week is that it is impossible to paint a picture with the world's blackest

233
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,320
 black and the world's pinkest pink because it's a really bad clash.

234
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,920
 It would be, wouldn't it?

235
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,600
 Actually, I think they go very nicely together, but why is it impossible?

236
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,440
 So the pinkest pink has been invented by an artist called Stuart Semple, and he sort of

237
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,480
 has control of this pigment, but the blackest black is under control of another artist called

238
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,600
 Anish Kapoor, and Anish Kapoor doesn't want anyone else to use it, so Stuart Semple has

239
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,520
 said anyone can use my pink apart from Anish Kapoor.

240
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,680
 When you go onto his website to buy it, you have to promise that you are not Anish Kapoor,

241
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,320
 you are no way affiliated with Anish Kapoor.

242
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,920
 You are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor.

243
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,240
 To the best of your knowledge, information and belief, this paint will not make its way

244
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,440
 into the hands of Anish Kapoor.

245
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
 It's such a nice idea.

246
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,840
 So basically, everyone in the world can use the pink apart from Anish Kapoor, and only

247
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,040
 Anish Kapoor, no one else in the world can use the black.

248
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040
 Yeah.

249
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,840
 So the way that they measure the blackest black is that it's how much light it absorbs

250
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,160
 and reflects.

251
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,160
 And this blackest black absorbs all but 0.035% of the light that you shine on it, which

252
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,040
 is very black indeed, and the previous record was 0.040, so it's kind of incrementally increasing.

253
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,280
 They can only make tiny amounts of it as well, so he can't really paint a huge amount.

254
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:25,920
 When he started, they could make two square centimetre patches of it, but it's made

255
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,240
 of these stems of colour, which are really, really, really tall and not at all white.

256
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
 So it's like the forest of palm trees, basically.

257
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
 Yeah.

258
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,040
 When you say really tall, you mean not really tall?

259
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
 I mean tiny.

260
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
 Absolutely tiny.

261
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
 Sorry.

262
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,800
 What I mean is there are 300 times as tall as they are white.

263
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,000
 And so one of the guys said it's like splitting a hair 10,000 times to make one of these

264
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 things.

265
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,960
 And then when you shine a light in it, it gets reflected all around inside this forest

266
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,640
 of pine trees, basically, until it gets absorbed and dissipated as heat.

267
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,440
 So the light turns into heat because it can't make its way out.

268
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,360
 The moon absorbs 88% of the light that hits it, so it only reflects 12% of visible light.

269
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,800
 So the moon, which always looks obviously white to us, or bright silvery, actually, is the

270
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,440
 colour of worn pavement.

271
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
 Yeah.

272
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,880
 And that's because it's against an extremely dark sky, isn't it?

273
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:24,720
 And actually, comets are even more absorbent of light, only 2 to 4% of light is reflected.

274
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,400
 So actually they're extremely dark, but again, they're against a night sky, so you can kind

275
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,120
 of see them better.

276
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,640
 To compare that lump of coal is about 8%.

277
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
 Oh, wow.

278
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,040
 So they're four times darker than a lump of coal.

279
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
 That's amazing.

280
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,520
 So that's the moon is almost the colour of a lump of coal, really?

281
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,680
 Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

282
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,600
 On pink, got a question for you guys, what colour is pink?

283
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,840
 It's like a mixture of white and red.

284
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
 No.

285
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
 Oh.

286
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
 Pink is dark yellow.

287
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
 Yeah.

288
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
 Originally, if you go to the--

289
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
 Originally.

290
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,360
 Originally, they're the revamps.

291
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
 What?

292
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,480
 So I was reading this book called The Accidental Dictionary.

293
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,440
 It's by Paul Anthony Jones, otherwise known as Haggard Hawks, on Twitter.

294
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,520
 And in it, he points out that back in the mid-15th century, pink was a yellowish or greenish

295
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,840
 yellow lake pigment made by combining a vegetable colouring matter with a white base.

296
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,360
 So originally, that's what pink was defined as.

297
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
 That's amazing.

298
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
 It's a dark yellow.

299
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,760
 What's interesting as well is they're not quite sure about the etymology of the word pink,

300
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
 but there's a lot of theories.

301
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,960
 And one of the theories is that it comes from a German word, which is pink on, and that

302
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,480
 means to piss.

303
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,360
 So the colour of dark urine.

304
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
 And that's why it sits pink.

305
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,040
 It's someone who sits down to go to the Lou.

306
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,700
 Oh, and that's why during the World Cup of the Euros, when they were in Germany, they

307
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,200
 had a problem with football fans urinating everywhere, and they called it the pinkal problem.

308
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,820
 It was also very manly, used to be very masculine.

309
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,400
 So pink was seen as a version of red, which was a kind of a warlike colour.

310
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,960
 And so pink was the colour that men would wear.

311
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,200
 And I think there's a quote, even from 1918, a trade catalog in 1918, which recommends blue

312
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,640
 for girls close, for young girls close, and pink for boys close, because blue was the colour

313
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,120
 of the Virgin Mary as well.

314
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,880
 So you'd have pink for boys, blue for girls.

315
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,880
 Even in 1927, I found a thing from Time magazine, there was a princess who'd given birth, and

316
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,800
 they said, "Oh, we were hoping for a boy, but unfortunately we've painted the nursery pink

317
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,920
 to get ready for it, and unfortunately it's a girl, so we've got to repaint the nursery."

318
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,160
 Wow, she's a princess as well, that's kind of...

319
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,200
 It's true, it's really strange.

320
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,720
 If you're a flamingo, and you're pink, like a little bit pink, I'm talking about the

321
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,400
 modern day colour pink here.

322
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,560
 If you're a little bit pink and you've got a mate who's really pink, your mate who's

323
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,760
 really pink will be more popular than you.

324
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,160
 The more pink you are, the more popular you are as a flamingo.

325
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,640
 How do you get more pink?

326
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
 Eat more algae.

327
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
 Right.

328
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
 Okay.

329
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,560
 So I mean, that's really achievable.

330
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,200
 It's something to aim for at least, isn't it?

331
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
 Yeah.

332
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,920
 And it's a study by Paul Rose at the University of Exeter.

333
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
 Paul Rose.

334
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
 Rose.

335
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
 Oh yeah.

336
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,920
 Yeah.

337
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,040
 So, you guys all have to watch David Attenborough's Planet Earth 2, and I don't know if you guys have

338
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
 seen it.

339
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
 Do you see the one this week?

340
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,920
 It focused on some flamingos, which live up in the Andes, I think, they're the flamingos

341
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,120
 that live higher than any other flamingo in the world.

342
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
 Wow.

343
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,520
 So it's one of these places, which is extremely hot in the daytime, and extremely cold

344
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,040
 overnight, and the lake that you sit in freezes overnight, and they just stand there and it freezes

345
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
 over their legs.

346
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,400
 And then in the morning, they have to spend a couple of hours pulling their legs out of

347
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,120
 the ice and then trying to walk to the shore and then falling back into the ice.

348
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
 You would think that one flamingo would have worked out maybe that we should go and sit on

349
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
 a tree on the ice.

350
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
 Oh yeah.

351
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
 That happens every night.

352
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
 I mean, come on guys.

353
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
 Stand on the bank.

354
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
 Yeah.

355
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,120
 I think we've said before that the inside of their egg shells is pink, and the yolks of

356
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
 their eggs is pink.

357
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
 I think we've mentioned that before.

358
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
 Yeah.

359
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,520
 Also, we only mentioned this on the TV show, so a lot of the podcast listeners might know

360
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,360
 of heard this, but we got sent in a new story that Australia has one flamingo.

361
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
 Is that right?

362
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
 Is that the flamingo?

363
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
 Yes.

364
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,360
 It's like 85 years old or something.

365
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
 Really old flamingo.

366
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,360
 Hey, if you want the accurate version of that fact rather than the misremembered one, you

367
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
 should watch our TV show.

368
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
 No such thing as the news.

369
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
 Absolutely seamless.

370
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,360
 I didn't know I was being advertised too.

371
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
 Yeah, I found myself watching the show.

372
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
 I saw flamingos earlier this year for the first time in my life.

373
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
 Yeah.

374
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
 That's your life.

375
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
 Yeah.

376
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
 Sorry.

377
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
 I've grown up in South London.

378
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
 They may not have them in St James's Park.

379
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
 All right.

380
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,360
 It's literally in St James's Park.

381
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
 500 metres away.

382
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
 They don't have flamingos at St James's Park.

383
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
 Okay, clearly.

384
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
 All right.

385
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
 I saw them in Spain for the first time in my life.

386
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
 It's the first time I've been...

387
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
 All right.

388
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
 Go on.

389
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
 Tell us, is St James's Park?

390
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
 Are you sure they were flamingos?

391
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,360
 The woman dancing.

392
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,360
 Flamingos.

393
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,360
 The women stuck in ice every night.

394
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
 Yeah.

395
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,360
 They lay pink eggs, did you know?

396
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,360
 So it was in the 19th century.

397
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,360
 It's when they installed all the birds for the first time in the park.

398
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
 And they brought over these beautiful exotic birds.

399
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
 And they put them in.

400
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,360
 And people went along in their hundreds to throw stones at them to kill them.

401
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
 No.

402
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
 That was huge.

403
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,360
 And it was like a coconut shy at a fair.

404
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,360
 They would cheer whenever they got an especially big or beautiful one of the birds with a stone.

405
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 Yeah, they killed them by the dozen.

406
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,360
 Just on colours.

407
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,360
 Do you know how purple was first made?

408
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
 By the Murex nail.

409
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
 Oh no, I mean made by human synthetic purple.

410
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
 This was first made by a guy called William Henry Perkin.

411
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,360
 And he was the first person ever to synthetically make colours.

412
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,360
 So we used to get colours from natural dyes that existed in the world like from beetles or shells or whatever.

413
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
 And this was in the 1850s.

414
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,360
 And he accidentally made purple while trying to cure malaria.

415
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,360
 And so that feels like a game for the world in one sense but a loss in another.

416
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,360
 He was trying to synthesise quinine which would help cure malaria and he failed to do it.

417
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,360
 But then he was rinsing out his flask with alcohol afterwards and he realised it created this purple solution.

418
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
 And that meant that he could make purple.

419
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,360
 And that was vital because dye was so expensive.

420
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,360
 Before, 9,000 mollusks were needed to create one gram of tyrian purple.

421
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
 One gram from 9,000.

422
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,360
 No, surely not.

423
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
 I know.

424
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,360
 Surely that would have got you a toga or something.

425
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,360
 No, I think a toga was many, many thousands.

426
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,360
 We had a million mollusks to get a single bromontone.

427
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
 I don't believe it.

428
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,360
 Only royalty ever wore purple because they didn't have enough mollusks in the world for anyone else.

429
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,360
 Did the world just used to be completely full of mollusks?

430
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,360
 There were trillions and trillions of mollusks everywhere.

431
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
 Yeah, it did.

432
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
 Have you heard of international Klein blue?

433
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
 Just more on the invention of colours.

434
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
 And more on patented colours as well.

435
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,360
 So Eve Klein, a famous artist in the 1960s and in 1960, Klein paid into the colour which he had kind of helped to develop.

436
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,360
 So this is not the first time someone's paid into the colour.

437
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
 And he called it international Klein blue.

438
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,360
 And he did a series of shows where he splashed it on nude models in a series of artistic events

439
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,360
 that the Guardian described as sexist even by 1960s standards.

440
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
 Wow.

441
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 But that colour, Klein is dead now.

442
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,360
 The colour lives on. Do you know where?

443
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
 It stinks something that's blue.

444
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,360
 Yeah.

445
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
 A blue man group.

446
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
 The blue man group.

447
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
 No, you're kidding.

448
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
 Pay themself.

449
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
 I'm impressive.

450
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
 Wow.

451
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
 They've something blue.

452
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
 You came with that straight away.

453
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,360
 International Klein blue is the colour they paint themselves.

454
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,360
 So was Eve Klein the one who had an art exhibition? He was in his blue phase.

455
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,360
 And everyone came and there was just no art anywhere.

456
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
 And they just drank the champagne and left.

457
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
 And they're all like where the hell's all the art.

458
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,360
 But what he'd done would put something in their drink which made their urine blue.

459
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,360
 And so the exhibition was when they went for a pee afterwards.

460
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,360
 Yeah, so cool.

461
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
 Yeah.

462
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
 That's very cool.

463
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,360
 He's not the only person who have invented a blue.

464
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,360
 There's a new blue on the scene.

465
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
 Is there?

466
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
 Yeah.

467
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
 It's called Jay-Z Blue.

468
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
 It's Jay-Z who invented a blue.

469
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
 Or he had his team of designers who invented a new blue.

470
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
 You would think that the band blue should have invented a new blue.

471
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
 Yeah.

472
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
 That would have been clever.

473
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,360
 And then for the painting instructions it could just say, "Dab a D, dab a D."

474
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
 That was it.

475
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
 That was it.

476
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,360
 Can I just say, you should think Eiffel 65 should have invented a blue.

477
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
 Now your joke makes sense.

478
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,360
 So Jay-Z Blue just very quickly.

479
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
 It's a silver fish colour.

480
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,360
 It has tiny flecks of platinum in it.

481
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
 And the idea is that he wanted his own colour

482
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,360
 because he's going to be releasing a lot of Jay-Z edition style things

483
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,360
 like jeeps and motorboats.

484
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,360
 And he wants Jay-Z Blue to be the colour, the unifying colour.

485
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
 Pink should make her own pink, shouldn't she?

486
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
 Oh yeah.

487
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
 That's nothing.

488
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
 That's a great idea.

489
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,360
 I do know something about Jonathan Green and his dictionary of slang.

490
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
 But it's about pink.

491
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,360
 So I was reading through all the entries on pink in that book.

492
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,360
 And there was a gang in Ireland in the 1700s called the Pink Indie's.

493
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,360
 And what they were, they were a gang of rich young men who like causing trouble.

494
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,360
 And they like getting into fights.

495
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,360
 And the way they would get into fights with people is they would cut off

496
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,360
 the bottom few inches of their scabbards on their swords.

497
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,360
 So basically the bottom inch or two of their sword is poking out at the end.

498
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,360
 And then they'd slowly prick people that they were next to with their swords

499
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
 to make them angry and get into fights with them.

500
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
 Do you think it's pinking like pinking shears?

501
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
 How about a dose, isn't it?

502
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
 That's pink.

503
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,360
 And then was there a spin-off called the pinkie dindies who did it with their pinkie?

504
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
 [laughs]

505
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:32,360
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

506
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,360
 And that is Anna Chaczynski.

507
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:40,360
 My fact this week is that at least 30% of the cocaine in America arrives by submarine.

508
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,360
 That's amazing.

509
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,360
 It all gets there via submarine.

510
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,360
 So I didn't know about knock-o-subs.

511
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
 But they're a big deal.

512
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,360
 And so a lot of the cocaine in America comes from a Columbia.

513
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,360
 And it tends to be transported by submarine to Mexico.

514
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,360
 And then I think often makes it overland from there.

515
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,360
 But I also read something in Time Magazine which said that in 2009,

516
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,360
 experts estimated that 70% of the cocaine that was leaving Columbia,

517
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
 left Columbia and knock-o-subs.

518
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
 Wow.

519
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
 So it all goes away in submarines.

520
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
 How cool is that?

521
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
 They've not bought the submarines off navies.

522
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,360
 Like if they're not old submarines, they've made these submarines.

523
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
 So they've sort of homemade submarines.

524
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
 I'm sure there's engineers that are very qualified to make it.

525
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,360
 But they're pretty cobbled, they make them in the jungle.

526
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
 Yeah, exactly.

527
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
 Yeah, they're not.

528
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
 Yeah.

529
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,360
 Imagine just traveling that far underwater in a thing that was one they found

530
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,360
 where the flippers took control of the rising and sinking of the submarine

531
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
 were controlled by go-kart steering wheels.

532
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
 Really?

533
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
 They're quite steampunky.

534
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
 And there are pictures online.

535
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
 There are amazing photo galleries of these things.

536
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,360
 The periscope on one of these submarines.

537
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,360
 It really is basically two CCTV cameras facing an opposite directions

538
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,360
 with the Perspex bubble over the top.

539
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,360
 Like they're really rudimentary cobbled together things.

540
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
 It would work.

541
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,360
 Yeah.

542
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,360
 But actually the advantage of them being cobbled together is that most of the time

543
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
 when they've reached their destination, they sink them.

544
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,360
 Earlier on this year, there was an instance of this, I think, in March

545
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,360
 when the US authorities caught a narco sub which had 5.5 tonnes worth of cocaine in it,

546
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
 which was worth $194 million.

547
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,360
 And the people on it, they immediately scuttled it.

548
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
 So they sunk it.

549
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,360
 And that means you can't really get them from anything because the cocaine is now on the bottom of the ocean.

550
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,360
 So you don't really have any evidence that they were smuggling cocaine.

551
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
 And then the Coast Guard, you have to save them.

552
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
 So you get these three bedrackled coke dealers onto shore.

553
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
 I know just like.

554
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,360
 We were just having a swim.

555
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,360
 About half of Somali pirates are immediately freed when they get back to shore.

556
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
 How come?

557
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,360
 It's very hard to find people who are willing to try them and imprison them for the right length of time.

558
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
 It's hard finding evidence.

559
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
 Yeah, it's really maddening for the authorities.

560
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
 Wow.

561
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,360
 Yeah.

562
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
 So you just get a lift back to shore.

563
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
 It's pretty meal or two.

564
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,360
 And it's not evidence enough that you've got the skull and crossbone line.

565
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
 No.

566
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
 They need more than that, do they?

567
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
 You've got a parrot on your shell.

568
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
 Yeah.

569
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,360
 Yeah.

570
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
 Some Marines used to have their own newspapers.

571
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,360
 Did they?

572
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
 Yeah.

573
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
 There's a whole book of extracts from Submariner's newspapers.

574
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,360
 Did they not get quite, what in the delivery process?

575
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
 Well, the...

576
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,360
 That's a hell of a paper round, isn't it?

577
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 No, how did it work?

578
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
 They would just print them on board.

579
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
 They did not.

580
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
 Submariner's would write and produce their own newspaper.

581
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
 Yeah, it was amazing.

582
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
 So bad, it's a...

583
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
 Oh!

584
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,360
 Actually, they had a newspaper in the trenches as well, didn't they?

585
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
 Yeah, like Wipers Times.

586
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
 Yeah.

587
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,360
 You know about that.

588
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
 I don't know about that.

589
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,360
 Well, there was a group of soldiers who found an old printing press and they just repurposed it

590
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
 and started printing.

591
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
 And it's really satirical.

592
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,360
 So in his lap, Nick Newman of Private Eye wrote a TV thing about it, which has now become a play, actually.

593
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,360
 And it's travelling on the country.

594
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,360
 But it was very satirical, like loads.

595
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
 And it was Wipers Times, wasn't it?

596
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
 Because it was eat pro.

597
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
 It was a miscalculation of eat pro.

598
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
 So it was them China, have it laugh.

599
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
 I think funny.

600
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
 In the face of real horror, it was...

601
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,360
 So the Flammenwerfer's, the Flamethrowers that the German troops were using.

602
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,360
 Well, of course, you know, horrible, horrific, disfigurement and injury and death.

603
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,360
 And yet, in the Wipers Times, they ran a little advert for these Flammenwerfer's that it started off with.

604
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
 Is your boy a practical type?

605
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
 It's really, you know.

606
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:14,360
 During World War II, the submarines around Japan would swim along and look for a bed of pistol shrimps.

607
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,360
 Because pistol shrimps make tons of noise by snapping their claws really, really loud.

608
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,360
 And by going on these, it meant that the Japanese sonar couldn't find them.

609
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
 Because they would just hear the pistol shrimp.

610
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
 Oh, dude, we only find that out after the war.

611
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,360
 Or did they then start looking for pistol shrimps?

612
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,360
 I only found that out on Reddit just now.

613
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
 So I don't...

614
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
 Is it breaking news?

615
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
 I don't know.

616
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,360
 No, it came out after the war, I think.

617
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,360
 I think it was quite a long time after the war.

618
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
 I think it was in the '70s or something, but they first studied it.

619
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,360
 That's very clever.

620
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
 Yeah.

621
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,360
 Do you know what you get called if you're on a submarine in the Royal Navy, but you're not a submarine?

622
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
 You get called an oxygen thief.

623
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
 Gosh.

624
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,360
 I know.

625
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,360
 There was a really interesting article on the Guardian about life on a submarine.

626
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,360
 They told the author, do you know we've got a badger on board the submarine?

627
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,360
 We picked it up at this point and we're feeding it, looking after it and finding enough food for it.

628
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
 And it was not true.

629
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,360
 But this guy, the writer said, I was really starting to believe that there was a badger on board,

630
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
 because you have to entertain yourself.

631
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,360
 You have to come up with jokes and games and ideas.

632
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,360
 But in a time when you're calling non-submariner's oxygen thieves,

633
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,360
 you wouldn't think you'd have a manature of animals on there.

634
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,360
 That just reminds me that we might have said this before,

635
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,360
 you sometimes get penguins towards a North Pole because sailors have taken them as pets in the South Pole

636
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,360
 and they kind of just bring them up and then they get a bit annoying and they just let them go.

637
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
 Oh wow.

638
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,360
 I think you imagine people who are in the Arctic are responsible geographers or environmentalists

639
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,360
 or something, not people who are just like yawning a penguin up and taking it with them.

640
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,360
 Don't tell me if you were sailing down the South Pole and you saw a penguin there, you wouldn't go.

641
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
 I definitely would.

642
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
 I don't deny that.

643
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
 I'm not qualified to be doing that job.

644
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
 Try to keep on turning down your application, isn't it?

645
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,360
 The sole purpose of visit. Pick up the penguin.

646
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,360
 Can we talk a bit about drug smuggling?

647
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
 Yeah.

648
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:12,360
 So JFK Airport has a drug Lou, which is specifically for people who've been suspected of drugs muggling to go to,

649
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
 when they pick you up, they x-ray you.

650
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,360
 And if it looks like you've got drugs in your body, they say go to this Lou,

651
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,360
 because it automatically washes the pellets of drugs, which people expel.

652
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,360
 And the old days officers had to manually sift.

653
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,360
 This is the new, basically the modern day necessary woman, isn't it?

654
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
 Yeah, yes.

655
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
 Yes it is.

656
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,360
 It's the auto toilet, which just washes the packets and so that's right, there you go.

657
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
 But what if you say, "Oh, but I don't need to go."

658
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,360
 And then they say, "Well, how long can you hold off claiming constipation before you actually go?"

659
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
 Don't know.

660
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
 They'll just wait.

661
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
 So they'll just wait.

662
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,360
 Yeah, I don't think they say, "Well, he's passed the half an hour limit, so I think we can go."

663
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,360
 Mary Roach says that on long flights, so Mary Roach writes these great books.

664
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,360
 She wrote one called "Gulp" about the early in book, the gut and the stomach and everything.

665
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,360
 She says that on long flights, sometimes flight attendants will pay attention to who doesn't eat anything,

666
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,360
 because if you've got 50 heroin capsules swallowed, you don't want to eat anything.

667
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,360
 And often you've taken anti-diarrhea medication to keep yourself bunged up.

668
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,360
 And you don't want to do anything which will cause you to go to the Lou.

669
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,360
 Because obviously, if you pull out all the heroin on the flight, it's a big problem.

670
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,360
 Just one thing on smuggling drugs across the US-Mexico border.

671
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,360
 And this was that the people come up with various imaginative ways of getting drugs across the border.

672
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,360
 So they make catapults very often.

673
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,360
 Sometimes they make bits of air propulsion that can fire them over.

674
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:43,360
 And then there was someone who was found in 2012 just trying to drive a bunch of cocaine over the border in a Jeep Cherokee.

675
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,360
 But there's a huge fence, so they made a makeshift ramp on either side.

676
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,360
 And they drove up one round, and then they got stuck in their Jeep on top.

677
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
 So there are some really good pictures.

678
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,360
 You can let them up a Jeep just hovering on top of a fence.

679
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,360
 And then the police eventually turned up and there are two guys just trying to get this Jeep down from on top of a fence.

680
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,360
 There was a politician who was one of the early people who said there should be a big wall between America and Mexico.

681
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,360
 Luckily that idea went pretty quickly.

682
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,360
 But he decided as a publicity stunt to get an elephant and a mariachi band to cross the border.

683
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,360
 Well to sort of prove that you can get anything through.

684
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:27,360
 He was called Raj Peter Bacter, and he also, as well as being a politician, had appeared on the apprentice in America.

685
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
 Oh really?

686
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
 Wow.

687
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
 Everything is connected.

688
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:41,360
 Also one last thing on, so people who have two smuggle drugs on their bodies. So the practice of putting them on the bottom is called rectal stuffing.

689
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
 It's the technical name for it.

690
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,360
 Just like a heart attack.

691
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,360
 I mean rectal's technical.

692
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,360
 Yeah.

693
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,360
 Okay, well, you just wait.

694
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
 Thanksgiving me.

695
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,360
 Sanger, don't you know rectal.

696
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,360
 But the website Popside did a whole piece about this practice and this sort of trickiness of it.

697
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:06,360
 Because obviously the rectum stores feces and then when it's stretched enough, it sends a signal to your nervous system saying you have to go to the loona.

698
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,360
 But they interviewed a chap called William Whitehead from the University of North Carolina, who's an expert in these things.

699
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,360
 And he says that you might actually be able to increase the capacity by putting drugs up there and end up with what he called a mega rectum.

700
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:27,360
 It's time for a final fact of the show and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

701
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,360
 My fact is that in the Greek Odysseus myth, he escapes the Cyclops by hiding under one of the Cyclops' sheep.

702
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:41,360
 In the Apache version of the same myth, he escapes by hiding in the anus of a buffalo.

703
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,360
 I like that the Cyclops is a shepherd.

704
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,360
 Yeah, I just never thought of him doing sort of menial tasks or sort of like running a farm.

705
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,360
 And it must be hard because he can't judge the distance of his sheep because he's only got one eye.

706
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
 Oh yeah.

707
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,360
 So he doesn't know how far away they are.

708
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,360
 So that father Ted joke about the size of a cow.

709
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
 That would actually be a reality for him.

710
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
 He doesn't get that joke.

711
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
 This is a myth that goes back.

712
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,360
 And there's a French anthropologist called Julian D.

713
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,360
 Who has studied myths.

714
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,360
 And he's studied a particular ethnic group who have gone around the world for thousands and thousands of years.

715
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:28,360
 And he reckons it goes back 18,000 years and there's always the same version of the story is human goes into a monster's house to steal something.

716
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:34,360
 The monster gets home and he has a herd of wild animals and he finds the humans and he locks the humans in somehow.

717
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:42,360
 And then he waits by the door for the man to kill him as the humans start to leave and the humans escape using the herd of animals.

718
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,360
 So in the Greek version, they blind him and then they hide under the sheep and the Cyclops feels the sheep as he goes out.

719
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:55,360
 And then in the Apache version the hero gets into the anus of a buffalo.

720
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,360
 I mean it does the same job, doesn't it?

721
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
 It does the job.

722
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,360
 But actually there is some cave painting in South of France in the cave of the Twafre.

723
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,360
 So there's a picture of a bison with an extremely distended rectum.

724
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,360
 And they think that that might be part of this story as well.

725
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,360
 So actually it's not just the Apaches it might go back to ancient Stone Age European times.

726
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,360
 Is that picture the sequel of that bison's life story once you got back out?

727
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,360
 And there's another bison going, how did you get like that?

728
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,360
 You will not believe it.

729
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,360
 There's another theory that there are two main families of myth.

730
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,360
 They're called the Louration and the Gondwonan and the named after the two big super continents.

731
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,360
 And he reckons that one branch of humanity went north about 40,000 years ago out of Africa.

732
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:46,360
 And all the sheep ain't the stories, all of those come from there.

733
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,360
 And as that group moved around, so that's in Switzerland, it's in Scandinavia, it's in North America, it's in Greece.

734
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,360
 And lots of those myths are about kind of the creation of the world, the rule of the gods, the rise of man, the end of the universe.

735
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
 That's it.

736
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,360
 The ones who went south and became, for example, the Australian Aborigines are a completely different family.

737
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
 They're all about a world which already exists.

738
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,360
 The world already existed about the rise of man or the invention of man involved.

739
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:15,360
 Both families have one thing in common, which is the massive flood myth, where he was punished in some way.

740
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,360
 That's the linking myth between these two huge groups.

741
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,360
 Most places have, most ancient civilizations have a flood myth, which is so curious.

742
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:32,360
 Those, the Babylonians, they found on Cuneiform, sort of, it was the measurements for effectively an ark, a Noah's ark.

743
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,360
 And this is in Babylonian Cuneiform time.

744
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:41,360
 It was like a coracle, wasn't it? It was more of a circular thing, rather than the biblical one, which is x-cubics by y-cubics by z-cubics.

745
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
 It's more of a square.

746
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:51,360
 Yeah, they actually rebuilt it. There's a documentary, you can see Irving Finkel, who's a British museum curator, actually managed to decipher the exact measurements, and they tried to rebuild it.

747
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,360
 A very sci-fi to be a sphere.

748
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,360
 Yeah, yeah. It's true.

749
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:01,360
 Just going back very quickly to talking about how would the Apache have managed to get this myth.

750
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:08,360
 It's so interesting that, like, in recent archaeology, we keep learning more and more about cultures colliding way before we realize.

751
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,360
 And did you guys see that story about the ancient Greeks?

752
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:20,360
 They're looking at the terracotta warriors, and they're suddenly thinking that ancient Greek artists were involved in helping and the making of the terracotta army.

753
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:27,360
 And I asked a historian friend if that had any credence to it, and he said absolutely, it looks like very convincing.

754
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:34,360
 It looks extremely convincing, and this is way before Marco Polo. This is way before the first time we ever thought that they'd had proper contact culturally.

755
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
 Wow.

756
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,360
 Yes, I've seen the terracotta warriors.

757
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
 Yeah.

758
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
 I saw them in London.

759
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
 Well, okay, I saw them in London.

760
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
 They're just in St. James's part.

761
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,360
 People used to throw things at them to knock them over.

762
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
 Oh, really? So you went to where they actually went?

763
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
 I went to Shien in China, which is--

764
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
 They're natural habitat.

765
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,360
 They're natural habitat.

766
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,360
 And they're in these huge long-- it's like a much bigger-- it's bigger than a football pitch.

767
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,360
 There's massive long hanger that you see them in.

768
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,360
 And they're in trenches, and they're all lined up facing the same way-- hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.

769
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,360
 And they're finding more and more, aren't they?

770
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,360
 They're finding terracotta, acrobats, and terracotta.

771
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
 Yeah.

772
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
 Jugglers and sort of this whole society.

773
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
 Well, they have it.

774
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
 Yeah, they know that there is-- they've probably unearthed.

775
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:19,360
 I think it's something like a tenth of how many they actually believe are going to be unearthed over time.

776
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
 They've just been doing it really slowly.

777
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,360
 It's amazing.

778
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,360
 Yeah, it's so cool.

779
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,360
 And the first emperor's tomb, which supposedly is a mercury lake, on the inside,

780
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,360
 because he was obsessed with the elixir of life, and that mercury was the main thing.

781
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,360
 They found a spot that they think might be where he's buried,

782
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,360
 and using detection, the mercury levels suddenly go, "Woo, up on the dial, like really high."

783
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,360
 So they think they might have found where he is buried,

784
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,360
 and where it could be true, the myth of the mercury lake.

785
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
 That's very cool.

786
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,360
 That was a really good impression of a mercury detector, by the way.

787
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,360
 Just quickly, do you know what colour the sheep were that Odysseus escaped on?

788
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
 It might have their white.

789
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
 Jay-Z Blue.

790
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,360
 Well, you're actually quite close.

791
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
 You're closer than James.

792
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,360
 They're violet coloured.

793
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
 Really, if you believe Homer.

794
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,360
 So this is this weird thing about the Odyssey, where all of his descriptions,

795
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,360
 his coloured descriptions, don't really equate with what colours are.

796
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,360
 So like the wine coloured sea, honey is described as being green.

797
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,360
 Hector's hair is dark blue.

798
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
 And yeah, the sheep are described as being violet.

799
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,360
 In China, there are blue sheep, which are in secluded bits of China,

800
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,360
 and they constantly try to make documentaries on them, but the government...

801
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,360
 There are no documentary makers making documentaries about the documentary makers.

802
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
 Just sheep going, no comment.

803
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,360
 I think what it is is that there are certain areas of China that have been closed off

804
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,360
 by the government for people going into, and it's just so happens that where they believe the blue sheep are,

805
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,360
 it's in a territory where you're not allowed to go.

806
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
 Right. They can't get access.

807
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,360
 I only know it actually, because remember Molly went over to China to make a documentary.

808
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,360
 To try and make a documentary.

809
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,360
 Again, they couldn't, they couldn't, the whole thing fell apart as well while they were there,

810
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,360
 but they were looking for blue sheep, that's what.

811
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,360
 So that's Molly Olfield, who was one of the researchers for QI.

812
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
 Yes.

813
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,360
 You can still see, I was going to say you can still have a bath in,

814
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,360
 but you can still see a bath that featured in the Odyssey.

815
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,360
 Wow.

816
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
 Isn't that cool?

817
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,360
 So this is a bath that Odysseus's son is bathed in,

818
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,360
 and it actually said exists, so it's in Pylos,

819
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
 which is on the western coast of Greece,

820
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,360
 and you can go and see it's a bath tub of Nester,

821
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,360
 and it's still there.

822
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,360
 It's been around since 1300 BC.

823
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,360
 It was all fake, right?

824
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,360
 So the story of what Homer's writing about, the Iliad and the Odyssey,

825
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,360
 are actually two, I think, of a series of eight stories of the whole Trojan Wars,

826
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,360
 and the only those two survived in full, but I think they're six royal fragments,

827
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
 and the Trojan Wars really happened.

828
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,360
 But then obviously, they start getting crazy gods involved,

829
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,360
 which starts to become a bit fictional.

830
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,360
 But yeah, Nester's palaces.

831
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,360
 They've stood in Nester's bath tub existing.

832
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,360
 There are ruins of Troy, that they discovered, aren't they?

833
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,360
 So I know that it was a real place.

834
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
 Yes.

835
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,360
 And that there were loads of cities which were destroyed or burned down,

836
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,360
 or, you know, fell in war, and then they build another one on top,

837
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,360
 and they've got a kind of layer cake.

838
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,360
 Yes, because I think the person who discovered Troy initially got in loads of trouble,

839
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,360
 because in order to discover it, he'd destroyed an equally valuable layer of archaeology

840
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,360
 on top of it, which he'd just chucked away.

841
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,360
 And then that's book nine in the series.

842
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,360
 So in Greek mythology, a lot of, you know, when wonderful stuff happens,

843
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,360
 and particularly Zeus turning himself into things in order to get off with women,

844
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:27,360
 he turns himself into someone's husband, which at least kind of makes sense,

845
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,360
 then he turns himself into a swan to get off with leader, then some rain.

846
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,360
 Was it not a golden shower?

847
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,360
 It's described as a golden shower, which used to be called just pink shower.

848
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,360
 And that's a perseus, isn't it?

849
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,360
 Oh, I read Danny.

850
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,360
 Oh, to make perseus.

851
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
 Sorry to make, but yeah, you're absolutely right.

852
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
 And then as a bull.

853
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,360
 So this is really interesting.

854
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,360
 He disguised himself as a bull to get off with Europa, right?

855
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,360
 And Europa is the mother of King Minos of Crete, yeah?

856
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,360
 So King Minos of Crete, his mum, has had sex with a bull.

857
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,360
 And then his wife, pacify, falls in love with a bull,

858
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,360
 which is a punishment from the gods because he said he tries to trick them

859
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
 and send them an inferior sacrifice.

860
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
 It's never worth doing in the Greek myth.

861
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,360
 They always find out this is an inferior sacrifice.

862
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,360
 They never don't trick.

863
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,360
 So not only has his mum got off with a bull, his wife has now fallen in love with a bull.

864
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,360
 It just must be so embarrassing for him.

865
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
 It's a real curse.

866
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,360
 Yes.

867
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,360
 Imagine what bad luck it would be if you're trying to make an escape

868
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,360
 and you happen to pick the wrong bull's-anus to climb into.

869
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
 It turns out.

870
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
 And you find your mum in there.

871
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
 Yeah.

872
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:40,360
 Okay, that's it.

873
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360

 We'll see you then.

890
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
 Good bye.

891
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,360
 Hi all.

892
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
 Okay.

893
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
 Look.

894
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,360
 James and I admit that maybe there aren't any flamingos in St James's Park.

895
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,360
 Our further research tells us.

896
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,360
 Now, what we need to do about this is either you lot.

897
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,360
 If you have any photographic evidence that there have been flamingos in St James's Park,

898
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,360
 you need to send it to us quickly so that we feel vindicated.

899
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,360
 And if you don't and it turns out there aren't any there and there never have been

900
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,360
 and we were confusing flamingos with pelicans because we're idiots,

901
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,360
 then you just have to never, ever tell Andy that he was right.

902
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,360
 Okay. See you next week.
