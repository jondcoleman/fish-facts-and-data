00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.840
 *odd noises*

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.240
 to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.600
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.600
 and Annotzzynski and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.840
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.640
 Starting with fact number one and that is my fact.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 My fact this week is that a pub in London has just renamed itself the Bill Murray.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.840
 However, because they couldn't get his permission they had to name it after William Murray

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.640
 who was King Charles the first whipping boy instead.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.720
 So this is a pub in Angel, North London and they wanted to give tribute as a fact that

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.580
 they were renovating the pub and renaming it but there's a law that you can't name

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.280
 a thing like a pub after a living person unless you get their absolute permission.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.800
 That's why they needed his permission.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 Try to not know.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.480
 That's why you don't see pubs called like the Pears Morgan everywhere.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.320
 Did he try to get Bill Murray's permission?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.320
 They did quite a few things.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.440
 They found a friend of Bill Murray's brother who they got in contact with.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.080
 Bill Murray famously doesn't have an agent but there's a number that you can call him on

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.920
 and propose projects.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 And they left.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.560
 Or for parts too presumably that's the main function of that.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560
 Exactly.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.640
 His answer phone is his agent and he listens to them so I think they left a few messages

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.360
 on that and they were going to take an ad out in the newspaper in the local city where

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.960
 he lives so that he might see it just in the paper but then they thought that's a bit

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.960
 creepy.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 Yeah.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 Yeah.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.600
 He's such a fun guy, Bill Murray.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.320
 He's always crashing random people's parties isn't he?

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.320
 Yes.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.040
 He's a bit of a legendary character in that sense.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.680
 Do you think it's because he assumes he's been invited but hasn't got the invite?

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680
 Yeah.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.280
 He went to a 22 year old Norwegian students party I think and then started doing the washing

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.880
 up halfway through it which is such a massive sacrifice if you've ever washed up anything

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 in a student's party.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.880
 That's amazing.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.880
 Yeah.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.880
 It's one of those things where there's a lot of these stories and the assumption is that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.880
 they're all fake.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.460
 So actually there has been a site that's set up where you can share your personal Bill

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.460
 Murray stories.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.460
 I think it's called Bill Murray Stories.com.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.460
 It's a good name.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.460
 Yeah.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.460
 It's confusing though, right?

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.460
 But so yeah.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.920
 So like all these stories that turns out they are true of people constantly submitting stories

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920
 about William.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.680
 They should have childhood whipping boy and childhood first.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.240
 Actually you should explain what a whipping boy is.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.240
 Yeah.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.840
 So being non-British I had never heard of a whipping boy until I heard about William Murray

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.400
 and it is unbelievable.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.560
 The idea of a whipping boy, this is back King Charles of Rosa.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.360
 He was 1600s and what would happen is as a child if the prince was naughty.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.760
 There was this rule where you couldn't hit them and you couldn't make them be disciplined

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.200
 off the back of a slapper or anything.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.400
 So they had a best friend who was called the whipping boy.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.360
 If they did anything bad, their best friend would get beaten for it.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.240
 They tried to encourage friendship between the whipping boy and the young prince so that

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.760
 the prince would have an incentive not to behave badly.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.960
 Do you know what an even bigger incentive would be if the prince actually just got whipped

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960
 every time he behaved badly?

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.440
 I know, but the divine right of kings, it's an absolute kicker.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.440
 Yeah.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.440
 So that was it wasn't it.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.760
 It was because kings are ruled by divine right and so no one's allowed to punish the king

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760
 except God himself.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.760
 Although Charles did later go on to be punished in a very big way by Parliament.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.760
 Yes.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.880
 He was able to nominate Bill Murray to be executed in that place.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.520
 I struggled to find evidence that much whipping was done with the whipping boy and whether

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.840
 it was a bit of a nominal thing and idealised thing and actually it was a really privileged

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.840
 position wasn't it?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.040
 So he eventually was given a great estate somewhere and they often were knighted or became

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.520
 important members of the Nability.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.280
 There was a historical society I read about where they had a debate about where the William

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.160
 Murray actually liked Charles I first or not and they did a big debate and they all voted

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.680
 that he would definitely not have liked Charles I first.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680
 How come?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.800
 Because he was getting beaten up every time.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.400
 Let's be honest all kids are little shit so what you would do is you would always at least

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.200
 be threatening your friends that you're going to do something naughty and you're going

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.840
 to go beat up for it.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.360
 You would and even if I do it to my best friend if I was 10, even if it was your friend, friend

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.280
 doesn't mean much when you're 10 years old except someone to be tortured.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:42.400
 I discovered another role which you three might know but I think non-Britz won't know.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:51.280
 The necessary woman was someone who was effectively personal cleaner to the king and had what

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.720
 was seen as a very very important job of emptying the toilet.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.840
 That was seen as like a high privilege but the title was the necessary woman.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.840
 Is there anything more necessary than someone tipping the poo out of your toilet?

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.560
 No there is not.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.560
 There's also a whipping father in existence.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.320
 I'm surprised I hadn't come across this but this is a Christmas character who is a French

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.320
 Christmas character who accompanies St Nicholas on his rounds on St Nicholas Day on the

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.560
 6th of December and St Nicholas tradition has it goes around and dispenses nice stuff to

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.840
 children who've done well but he's also accompanied by the whipping father, the pair Fouetta who

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.640
 judges whether or not a child's been naughty and if it has whips it.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.640
 Where is this?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.640
 France and Belgium.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.640
 Wow.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.920
 And is Santa cool with this?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.320
 Feels like he should step in.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320
 Santa's pro.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.320
 Yeah.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.520
 Santa is an ass like if you think about it because he is deciding on whether people get gifts

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.520
 on them.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520
 Yeah who made him like moral.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.520
 Exactly.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.520
 He was right and right.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.520
 He has the authority.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.520
 Yeah.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520
 Like Christmas knows he has a list.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.520
 He only checks it twice.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.800
 Like I've loads of things I've checked twice and then the third time I've realised there was

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800
 a mistake.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800
 That's true.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.400
 Most of the job of Father Christmas is data entry and then there's a brief careering service

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.400
 at the end of it.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.400
 Can you imagine that?

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.440
 You're given this amazing role of being Santa and you didn't realise that for 364 days

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.440
 it's at it.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.440
 It's Excel.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.440
 It's all spreadsheet.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.440
 There are columns.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.440
 Check one.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.440
 Check two.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.920
 Presidents delivered, child whipped question mark.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.040
 Just while we're on whipping boys and people being punished for things that aren't their

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040
 fault.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.040
 So this kind of extended into adulthood as well.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.160
 So Henry IV of France, he became Catholic or he had a ceremony with the Catholic Church

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.040
 in 1593 but he obviously had to do penance.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.600
 So what he did instead, he sent two ambassadors to Rome and he said to the Pope, look if I've

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.320
 done anything wrong just punish these guys will you?

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.080
 And these two ambassadors were beaten on the steps of some Peters while singing the

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.000
 misery by the representatives of the Pope.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Wow.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.440
 So the Pope didn't even go out and beat them himself.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.080
 He sent bloody representatives out saying if you need to be beaten please let my representatives

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.080
 do.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.080
 Yeah.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.920
 The Pope is very much the Father Christmas in this situation.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.920
 So some other William Murray's.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.920
 Oh yeah.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.120
 So we've got Bill Murray, haven't we and we've got the whipping boy William Murray.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.720
 There's a William Murray who wrote the Peter and Jane books, do you remember those?

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.720
 No.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.720
 It was children's books.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.320
 80 million of these were sold around the world and they're extremely kind of simple books

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.840
 like Peter plays with the ball.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.840
 Jane climbs a hill.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.840
 That's good for you.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.760
 He works out that 12 words make a quarter of all words used by children.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.760
 Wow.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.600
 And they are a and he I in is it of that, the two and was.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.560
 And so we wrote all these books to kind of just try and teach you those words first.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.560
 Because if you can get those ones nailed to them, the other 20,000 that you learn just

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.560
 kind of immediately.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.560
 I'd love it.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.640
 Please tell me he wrote the books just including all of those words which are just a sequence

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.600
 of prepositions and conjunctions and no nouns, no verbs just.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.160
 You can say that was I if you're a pirate child.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160
 Yeah.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.160
 So that would be page one.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.160
 What have you got for page two?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.160
 Ooh.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.160
 That was she.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.800
 She isn't one of them.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.720
 And there was a guy called William Murray who invented vacations.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720
 What do you mean?

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.720
 The concept of vacation.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.720
 Yeah.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.560
 So he was American and he there's a mountain range called the ad ion DAX.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.460
 And he used to take people up there to go walking.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.480
 And it used to be that you would call it holiday, the British people called it holiday.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.040
 But he called it kind of vacating your home and going to these mountains.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.640
 And so he kind of coined the word vacation.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.640
 Wow.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.640
 So when you go away.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.640
 That's very cool.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.640
 Yeah.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.720
 Vacation really sounds like an advertisement to Boglars, doesn't it?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.640
 You act to be saying I'm emptying my house for the week.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.800
 I think it sounds medical.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.800
 Do you?

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800
 Yes.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800
 Like vacating your balls.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.800
 Yes.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.800
 I'm afraid so.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.800
 I'm afraid so.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.800
 What?

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.600
 It's like you're talking to your necessary woman.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600
 I'm afraid.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600
 I vacated.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.280
 Once again, it's not the kind of vacation you were hoping to happen to me.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.280
 Okay.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.640
 We're going to have to move on to our next facts soon.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.640
 So we can just say a couple of things about pubs.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.640
 Yeah.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.560
 So Bizarre Coincidence, the pub with the longest name in the country, is in the same town as

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.760
 the pub with the shortest name in the country, which is Staley Bridge.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.320
 And I think this is actually like, it's almost in Manchester.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.320
 But yeah, isn't that weird?

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.680
 So it's got the queue in, which is just a queue.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.560
 And then it's got the longest name pub in the country, which is the old 13th Cheshire Astley

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.560
 Volunteer Rifleman call in.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:41.000
 Also, there are four pubs in the UK called the Blob Shop.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.880
 If that's a derogatory reference to women's mental cycles, then I think that's still okay.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.680
 I'm afraid it is.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.520
 Oh, that kind of vacation again.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.640
 I got this fact from Chordall, the comedy website.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.680
 They reported on the fact that they were changing the name.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.600
 And at the bottom of the article, they had a link to other comedian named pubs.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.360
 So these were all in the UK.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:11.800
 There's the Eric Bartholomew, and that's in Morkum, and that's after Eric Morkum, very lovely.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.800
 There's the four candles in Oxford, which is a tribute to the Ronnie Barker, the two Ronnie

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.800
 Sketch.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.520
 Trolley Chaplin has one in Elephant and Castle, but it's being demolished.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.600
 But in the article, they point out that it might not actually be missed, because the

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.880
 online reviews for it include unremitting horror and what a shit hole.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.880
 Oh, I go.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.840
 Yeah, well, I think it's been demolished now, unfortunately.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.840
 Very quickly.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.960
 In 2013, a glittering ceremony to reward pubs and clubs in Wiggen for preventing night scene

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:48.680
 violence ended in a fight.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:54.280
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.680
 Okay, my fact this week is that it is impossible to paint a picture with the world's blackest

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.320
 black and the world's pinkest pink because it's a really bad clash.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.920
 It would be, wouldn't it?

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.600
 Actually, I think they go very nicely together, but why is it impossible?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.440
 So the pinkest pink has been invented by an artist called Stuart Semple, and he sort of

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.480
 has control of this pigment, but the blackest black is under control of another artist called

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.600
 Anish Kapoor, and Anish Kapoor doesn't want anyone else to use it, so Stuart Semple has

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.520
 said anyone can use my pink apart from Anish Kapoor.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.680
 When you go onto his website to buy it, you have to promise that you are not Anish Kapoor,

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.320
 you are no way affiliated with Anish Kapoor.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.920
 You are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.240
 To the best of your knowledge, information and belief, this paint will not make its way

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.440
 into the hands of Anish Kapoor.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.440
 It's such a nice idea.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.840
 So basically, everyone in the world can use the pink apart from Anish Kapoor, and only

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.040
 Anish Kapoor, no one else in the world can use the black.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.040
 Yeah.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.840
 So the way that they measure the blackest black is that it's how much light it absorbs

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.160
 and reflects.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:09.160
 And this blackest black absorbs all but 0.035% of the light that you shine on it, which

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:15.040
 is very black indeed, and the previous record was 0.040, so it's kind of incrementally increasing.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.280
 They can only make tiny amounts of it as well, so he can't really paint a huge amount.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:25.920
 When he started, they could make two square centimetre patches of it, but it's made

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.240
 of these stems of colour, which are really, really, really tall and not at all white.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.240
 So it's like the forest of palm trees, basically.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.240
 Yeah.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.040
 When you say really tall, you mean not really tall?

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.040
 I mean tiny.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.040
 Absolutely tiny.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.040
 Sorry.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.800
 What I mean is there are 300 times as tall as they are white.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:47.000
 And so one of the guys said it's like splitting a hair 10,000 times to make one of these

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 things.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.960
 And then when you shine a light in it, it gets reflected all around inside this forest

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.640
 of pine trees, basically, until it gets absorbed and dissipated as heat.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.440
 So the light turns into heat because it can't make its way out.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.360
 The moon absorbs 88% of the light that hits it, so it only reflects 12% of visible light.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.800
 So the moon, which always looks obviously white to us, or bright silvery, actually, is the

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.440
 colour of worn pavement.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.440
 Yeah.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.880
 And that's because it's against an extremely dark sky, isn't it?

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:24.720
 And actually, comets are even more absorbent of light, only 2 to 4% of light is reflected.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.400
 So actually they're extremely dark, but again, they're against a night sky, so you can kind

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.120
 of see them better.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.640
 To compare that lump of coal is about 8%.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.640
 Oh, wow.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.040
 So they're four times darker than a lump of coal.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.040
 That's amazing.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.520
 So that's the moon is almost the colour of a lump of coal, really?

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.680
 Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.600
 On pink, got a question for you guys, what colour is pink?

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.840
 It's like a mixture of white and red.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.840
 No.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.840
 Oh.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.840
 Pink is dark yellow.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.840
 Yeah.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.840
 Originally, if you go to the--

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.840
 Originally.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.360
 Originally, they're the revamps.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.360
 What?

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.480
 So I was reading this book called The Accidental Dictionary.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.440
 It's by Paul Anthony Jones, otherwise known as Haggard Hawks, on Twitter.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:12.520
 And in it, he points out that back in the mid-15th century, pink was a yellowish or greenish

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.840
 yellow lake pigment made by combining a vegetable colouring matter with a white base.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.360
 So originally, that's what pink was defined as.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.360
 That's amazing.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.360
 It's a dark yellow.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.760
 What's interesting as well is they're not quite sure about the etymology of the word pink,

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.760
 but there's a lot of theories.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.960
 And one of the theories is that it comes from a German word, which is pink on, and that

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.480
 means to piss.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.360
 So the colour of dark urine.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.360
 And that's why it sits pink.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.040
 It's someone who sits down to go to the Lou.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.700
 Oh, and that's why during the World Cup of the Euros, when they were in Germany, they

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:50.200
 had a problem with football fans urinating everywhere, and they called it the pinkal problem.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.820
 It was also very manly, used to be very masculine.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.400
 So pink was seen as a version of red, which was a kind of a warlike colour.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.960
 And so pink was the colour that men would wear.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:06.200
 And I think there's a quote, even from 1918, a trade catalog in 1918, which recommends blue

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.640
 for girls close, for young girls close, and pink for boys close, because blue was the colour

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.120
 of the Virgin Mary as well.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.880
 So you'd have pink for boys, blue for girls.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.880
 Even in 1927, I found a thing from Time magazine, there was a princess who'd given birth, and

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.800
 they said, "Oh, we were hoping for a boy, but unfortunately we've painted the nursery pink

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.920
 to get ready for it, and unfortunately it's a girl, so we've got to repaint the nursery."

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.160
 Wow, she's a princess as well, that's kind of...

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.200
 It's true, it's really strange.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.720
 If you're a flamingo, and you're pink, like a little bit pink, I'm talking about the

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.400
 modern day colour pink here.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.560
 If you're a little bit pink and you've got a mate who's really pink, your mate who's

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.760
 really pink will be more popular than you.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.160
 The more pink you are, the more popular you are as a flamingo.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.640
 How do you get more pink?

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.640
 Eat more algae.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.640
 Right.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640
 Okay.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.560
 So I mean, that's really achievable.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.200
 It's something to aim for at least, isn't it?

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.200
 Yeah.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.920
 And it's a study by Paul Rose at the University of Exeter.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.920
 Paul Rose.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:01.920
 Rose.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.920
 Oh yeah.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.920
 Yeah.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.040
 So, you guys all have to watch David Attenborough's Planet Earth 2, and I don't know if you guys have

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040
 seen it.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.040
 Do you see the one this week?

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.920
 It focused on some flamingos, which live up in the Andes, I think, they're the flamingos

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.120
 that live higher than any other flamingo in the world.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.120
 Wow.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.520
 So it's one of these places, which is extremely hot in the daytime, and extremely cold

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:23.040
 overnight, and the lake that you sit in freezes overnight, and they just stand there and it freezes

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040
 over their legs.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.400
 And then in the morning, they have to spend a couple of hours pulling their legs out of

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.120
 the ice and then trying to walk to the shore and then falling back into the ice.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.120
 You would think that one flamingo would have worked out maybe that we should go and sit on

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.120
 a tree on the ice.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.120
 Oh yeah.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.120
 That happens every night.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.120
 I mean, come on guys.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.120
 Stand on the bank.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.120
 Yeah.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.120
 I think we've said before that the inside of their egg shells is pink, and the yolks of

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.120
 their eggs is pink.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.120
 I think we've mentioned that before.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.120
 Yeah.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.520
 Also, we only mentioned this on the TV show, so a lot of the podcast listeners might know

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.360
 of heard this, but we got sent in a new story that Australia has one flamingo.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.360
 Is that right?

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.360
 Is that the flamingo?

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.360
 Yes.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.360
 It's like 85 years old or something.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.360
 Really old flamingo.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.360
 Hey, if you want the accurate version of that fact rather than the misremembered one, you

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.360
 should watch our TV show.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.360
 No such thing as the news.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.360
 Absolutely seamless.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.360
 I didn't know I was being advertised too.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.360
 Yeah, I found myself watching the show.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.360
 I saw flamingos earlier this year for the first time in my life.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.360
 Yeah.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.360
 That's your life.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.360
 Yeah.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360
 Sorry.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360
 I've grown up in South London.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.360
 They may not have them in St James's Park.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.360
 All right.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.360
 It's literally in St James's Park.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360
 500 metres away.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.360
 They don't have flamingos at St James's Park.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.360
 Okay, clearly.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.360
 All right.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.360
 I saw them in Spain for the first time in my life.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360
 It's the first time I've been...

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.360
 All right.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.360
 Go on.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.360
 Tell us, is St James's Park?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.360
 Are you sure they were flamingos?

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.360
 The woman dancing.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.360
 Flamingos.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.360
 The women stuck in ice every night.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.360
 Yeah.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.360
 They lay pink eggs, did you know?

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.360
 So it was in the 19th century.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.360
 It's when they installed all the birds for the first time in the park.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.360
 And they brought over these beautiful exotic birds.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.360
 And they put them in.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.360
 And people went along in their hundreds to throw stones at them to kill them.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.360
 No.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.360
 That was huge.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.360
 And it was like a coconut shy at a fair.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:17.360
 They would cheer whenever they got an especially big or beautiful one of the birds with a stone.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.360
 Yeah, they killed them by the dozen.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.360
 Just on colours.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:26.360
 Do you know how purple was first made?

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.360
 By the Murex nail.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.360
 Oh no, I mean made by human synthetic purple.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.360
 This was first made by a guy called William Henry Perkin.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.360
 And he was the first person ever to synthetically make colours.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:41.360
 So we used to get colours from natural dyes that existed in the world like from beetles or shells or whatever.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.360
 And this was in the 1850s.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.360
 And he accidentally made purple while trying to cure malaria.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.360
 And so that feels like a game for the world in one sense but a loss in another.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.360
 He was trying to synthesise quinine which would help cure malaria and he failed to do it.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.360
 But then he was rinsing out his flask with alcohol afterwards and he realised it created this purple solution.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.360
 And that meant that he could make purple.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.360
 And that was vital because dye was so expensive.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:11.360
 Before, 9,000 mollusks were needed to create one gram of tyrian purple.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.360
 One gram from 9,000.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.360
 No, surely not.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.360
 I know.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.360
 Surely that would have got you a toga or something.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.360
 No, I think a toga was many, many thousands.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.360
 We had a million mollusks to get a single bromontone.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.360
 I don't believe it.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.360
 Only royalty ever wore purple because they didn't have enough mollusks in the world for anyone else.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.360
 Did the world just used to be completely full of mollusks?

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.360
 There were trillions and trillions of mollusks everywhere.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.360
 Yeah, it did.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.360
 Have you heard of international Klein blue?

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.360
 Just more on the invention of colours.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.360
 And more on patented colours as well.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:56.360
 So Eve Klein, a famous artist in the 1960s and in 1960, Klein paid into the colour which he had kind of helped to develop.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.360
 So this is not the first time someone's paid into the colour.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.360
 And he called it international Klein blue.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:07.360
 And he did a series of shows where he splashed it on nude models in a series of artistic events

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.360
 that the Guardian described as sexist even by 1960s standards.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.360
 Wow.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.360
 But that colour, Klein is dead now.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.360
 The colour lives on. Do you know where?

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.360
 It stinks something that's blue.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.360
 Yeah.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.360
 A blue man group.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.360
 The blue man group.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.360
 No, you're kidding.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.360
 Pay themself.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.360
 I'm impressive.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.360
 Wow.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.360
 They've something blue.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.360
 You came with that straight away.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.360
 International Klein blue is the colour they paint themselves.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:37.360
 So was Eve Klein the one who had an art exhibition? He was in his blue phase.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.360
 And everyone came and there was just no art anywhere.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.360
 And they just drank the champagne and left.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.360
 And they're all like where the hell's all the art.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.360
 But what he'd done would put something in their drink which made their urine blue.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.360
 And so the exhibition was when they went for a pee afterwards.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.360
 Yeah, so cool.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.360
 Yeah.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360
 That's very cool.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.360
 He's not the only person who have invented a blue.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.360
 There's a new blue on the scene.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.360
 Is there?

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.360
 Yeah.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.360
 It's called Jay-Z Blue.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.360
 It's Jay-Z who invented a blue.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.360
 Or he had his team of designers who invented a new blue.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.360
 You would think that the band blue should have invented a new blue.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.360
 Yeah.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.360
 That would have been clever.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.360
 And then for the painting instructions it could just say, "Dab a D, dab a D."

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.360
 That was it.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.360
 That was it.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.360
 Can I just say, you should think Eiffel 65 should have invented a blue.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.360
 Now your joke makes sense.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.360
 So Jay-Z Blue just very quickly.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.360
 It's a silver fish colour.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.360
 It has tiny flecks of platinum in it.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.360
 And the idea is that he wanted his own colour

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.360
 because he's going to be releasing a lot of Jay-Z edition style things

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.360
 like jeeps and motorboats.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.360
 And he wants Jay-Z Blue to be the colour, the unifying colour.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.360
 Pink should make her own pink, shouldn't she?

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.360
 Oh yeah.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.360
 That's nothing.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.360
 That's a great idea.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.360
 I do know something about Jonathan Green and his dictionary of slang.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.360
 But it's about pink.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.360
 So I was reading through all the entries on pink in that book.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:55.360
 And there was a gang in Ireland in the 1700s called the Pink Indie's.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.360
 And what they were, they were a gang of rich young men who like causing trouble.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.360
 And they like getting into fights.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.360
 And the way they would get into fights with people is they would cut off

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.360
 the bottom few inches of their scabbards on their swords.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.360
 So basically the bottom inch or two of their sword is poking out at the end.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.360
 And then they'd slowly prick people that they were next to with their swords

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.360
 to make them angry and get into fights with them.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.360
 Do you think it's pinking like pinking shears?

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.360
 How about a dose, isn't it?

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.360
 That's pink.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.360
 And then was there a spin-off called the pinkie dindies who did it with their pinkie?

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.360
 [laughs]

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:32.360
 Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.360
 And that is Anna Chaczynski.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:40.360
 My fact this week is that at least 30% of the cocaine in America arrives by submarine.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.360
 That's amazing.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.360
 It all gets there via submarine.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.360
 So I didn't know about knock-o-subs.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.360
 But they're a big deal.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.360
 And so a lot of the cocaine in America comes from a Columbia.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.360
 And it tends to be transported by submarine to Mexico.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.360
 And then I think often makes it overland from there.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.360
 But I also read something in Time Magazine which said that in 2009,

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.360
 experts estimated that 70% of the cocaine that was leaving Columbia,

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.360
 left Columbia and knock-o-subs.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.360
 Wow.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.360
 So it all goes away in submarines.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.360
 How cool is that?

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.360
 They've not bought the submarines off navies.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.360
 Like if they're not old submarines, they've made these submarines.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.360
 So they've sort of homemade submarines.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.360
 I'm sure there's engineers that are very qualified to make it.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.360
 But they're pretty cobbled, they make them in the jungle.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.360
 Yeah, exactly.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360
 Yeah, they're not.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.360
 Yeah.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.360
 Imagine just traveling that far underwater in a thing that was one they found

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.360
 where the flippers took control of the rising and sinking of the submarine

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.360
 were controlled by go-kart steering wheels.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.360
 Really?

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.360
 They're quite steampunky.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.360
 And there are pictures online.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.360
 There are amazing photo galleries of these things.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.360
 The periscope on one of these submarines.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.360
 It really is basically two CCTV cameras facing an opposite directions

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.360
 with the Perspex bubble over the top.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.360
 Like they're really rudimentary cobbled together things.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.360
 It would work.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.360
 Yeah.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.360
 But actually the advantage of them being cobbled together is that most of the time

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.360
 when they've reached their destination, they sink them.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.360
 Earlier on this year, there was an instance of this, I think, in March

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:09.360
 when the US authorities caught a narco sub which had 5.5 tonnes worth of cocaine in it,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.360
 which was worth $194 million.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.360
 And the people on it, they immediately scuttled it.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.360
 So they sunk it.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.360
 And that means you can't really get them from anything because the cocaine is now on the bottom of the ocean.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.360
 So you don't really have any evidence that they were smuggling cocaine.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.360
 And then the Coast Guard, you have to save them.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.360
 So you get these three bedrackled coke dealers onto shore.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.360
 I know just like.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.360
 We were just having a swim.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:33.360
 About half of Somali pirates are immediately freed when they get back to shore.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.360
 How come?

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.360
 It's very hard to find people who are willing to try them and imprison them for the right length of time.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.360
 It's hard finding evidence.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.360
 Yeah, it's really maddening for the authorities.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.360
 Wow.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:44.360
 Yeah.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.360
 So you just get a lift back to shore.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.360
 It's pretty meal or two.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.360
 And it's not evidence enough that you've got the skull and crossbone line.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.360
 No.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.360
 They need more than that, do they?

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.360
 You've got a parrot on your shell.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.360
 Yeah.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.360
 Yeah.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.360
 Some Marines used to have their own newspapers.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.360
 Did they?

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.360
 Yeah.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.360
 There's a whole book of extracts from Submariner's newspapers.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.360
 Did they not get quite, what in the delivery process?

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.360
 Well, the...

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.360
 That's a hell of a paper round, isn't it?

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.360
 No, how did it work?

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.360
 They would just print them on board.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.360
 They did not.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.360
 Submariner's would write and produce their own newspaper.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.360
 Yeah, it was amazing.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.360
 So bad, it's a...

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.360
 Oh!

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.360
 Actually, they had a newspaper in the trenches as well, didn't they?

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.360
 Yeah, like Wipers Times.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.360
 Yeah.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.360
 You know about that.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.360
 I don't know about that.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.360
 Well, there was a group of soldiers who found an old printing press and they just repurposed it

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360
 and started printing.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360
 And it's really satirical.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:38.360
 So in his lap, Nick Newman of Private Eye wrote a TV thing about it, which has now become a play, actually.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.360
 And it's travelling on the country.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.360
 But it was very satirical, like loads.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.360
 And it was Wipers Times, wasn't it?

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.360
 Because it was eat pro.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.360
 It was a miscalculation of eat pro.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.360
 So it was them China, have it laugh.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.360
 I think funny.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.360
 In the face of real horror, it was...

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.360
 So the Flammenwerfer's, the Flamethrowers that the German troops were using.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.360
 Well, of course, you know, horrible, horrific, disfigurement and injury and death.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:03.360
 And yet, in the Wipers Times, they ran a little advert for these Flammenwerfer's that it started off with.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.360
 Is your boy a practical type?

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.360
 It's really, you know.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:14.360
 During World War II, the submarines around Japan would swim along and look for a bed of pistol shrimps.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.360
 Because pistol shrimps make tons of noise by snapping their claws really, really loud.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.360
 And by going on these, it meant that the Japanese sonar couldn't find them.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.360
 Because they would just hear the pistol shrimp.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.360
 Oh, dude, we only find that out after the war.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.360
 Or did they then start looking for pistol shrimps?

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.360
 I only found that out on Reddit just now.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.360
 So I don't...

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.360
 Is it breaking news?

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.360
 I don't know.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.360
 No, it came out after the war, I think.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.360
 I think it was quite a long time after the war.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.360
 I think it was in the '70s or something, but they first studied it.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.360
 That's very clever.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.360
 Yeah.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.360
 Do you know what you get called if you're on a submarine in the Royal Navy, but you're not a submarine?

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.360
 You get called an oxygen thief.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.360
 Gosh.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.360
 I know.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.360
 There was a really interesting article on the Guardian about life on a submarine.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.360
 They told the author, do you know we've got a badger on board the submarine?

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.360
 We picked it up at this point and we're feeding it, looking after it and finding enough food for it.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.360
 And it was not true.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:10.360
 But this guy, the writer said, I was really starting to believe that there was a badger on board,

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.360
 because you have to entertain yourself.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.360
 You have to come up with jokes and games and ideas.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.360
 But in a time when you're calling non-submariner's oxygen thieves,

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.360
 you wouldn't think you'd have a manature of animals on there.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.360
 That just reminds me that we might have said this before,

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:31.360
 you sometimes get penguins towards a North Pole because sailors have taken them as pets in the South Pole

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.360
 and they kind of just bring them up and then they get a bit annoying and they just let them go.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.360
 Oh wow.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.360
 I think you imagine people who are in the Arctic are responsible geographers or environmentalists

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.360
 or something, not people who are just like yawning a penguin up and taking it with them.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.360
 Don't tell me if you were sailing down the South Pole and you saw a penguin there, you wouldn't go.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.360
 I definitely would.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.360
 I don't deny that.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.360
 I'm not qualified to be doing that job.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.360
 Try to keep on turning down your application, isn't it?

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:01.360
 The sole purpose of visit. Pick up the penguin.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.360
 Can we talk a bit about drug smuggling?

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.360
 Yeah.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:12.360
 So JFK Airport has a drug Lou, which is specifically for people who've been suspected of drugs muggling to go to,

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.360
 when they pick you up, they x-ray you.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:19.360
 And if it looks like you've got drugs in your body, they say go to this Lou,

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.360
 because it automatically washes the pellets of drugs, which people expel.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.360
 And the old days officers had to manually sift.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.360
 This is the new, basically the modern day necessary woman, isn't it?

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.360
 Yeah, yes.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.360
 Yes it is.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.360
 It's the auto toilet, which just washes the packets and so that's right, there you go.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.360
 But what if you say, "Oh, but I don't need to go."

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.360
 And then they say, "Well, how long can you hold off claiming constipation before you actually go?"

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.360
 Don't know.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.360
 They'll just wait.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.360
 So they'll just wait.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.360
 Yeah, I don't think they say, "Well, he's passed the half an hour limit, so I think we can go."

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.360
 Mary Roach says that on long flights, so Mary Roach writes these great books.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:00.360
 She wrote one called "Gulp" about the early in book, the gut and the stomach and everything.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.360
 She says that on long flights, sometimes flight attendants will pay attention to who doesn't eat anything,

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:09.360
 because if you've got 50 heroin capsules swallowed, you don't want to eat anything.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.360
 And often you've taken anti-diarrhea medication to keep yourself bunged up.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.360
 And you don't want to do anything which will cause you to go to the Lou.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.360
 Because obviously, if you pull out all the heroin on the flight, it's a big problem.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:25.360
 Just one thing on smuggling drugs across the US-Mexico border.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.360
 And this was that the people come up with various imaginative ways of getting drugs across the border.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.360
 So they make catapults very often.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.360
 Sometimes they make bits of air propulsion that can fire them over.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:43.360
 And then there was someone who was found in 2012 just trying to drive a bunch of cocaine over the border in a Jeep Cherokee.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.360
 But there's a huge fence, so they made a makeshift ramp on either side.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:51.360
 And they drove up one round, and then they got stuck in their Jeep on top.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.360
 So there are some really good pictures.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.360
 You can let them up a Jeep just hovering on top of a fence.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:01.360
 And then the police eventually turned up and there are two guys just trying to get this Jeep down from on top of a fence.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:07.360
 There was a politician who was one of the early people who said there should be a big wall between America and Mexico.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.360
 Luckily that idea went pretty quickly.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:16.360
 But he decided as a publicity stunt to get an elephant and a mariachi band to cross the border.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.360
 Well to sort of prove that you can get anything through.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:27.360
 He was called Raj Peter Bacter, and he also, as well as being a politician, had appeared on the apprentice in America.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.360
 Oh really?

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.360
 Wow.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.360
 Everything is connected.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:41.360
 Also one last thing on, so people who have two smuggle drugs on their bodies. So the practice of putting them on the bottom is called rectal stuffing.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.360
 It's the technical name for it.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.360
 Just like a heart attack.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.360
 I mean rectal's technical.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:45.360
 Yeah.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.360
 Okay, well, you just wait.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.360
 Thanksgiving me.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:53.360
 Sanger, don't you know rectal.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.360
 But the website Popside did a whole piece about this practice and this sort of trickiness of it.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:06.360
 Because obviously the rectum stores feces and then when it's stretched enough, it sends a signal to your nervous system saying you have to go to the loona.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:11.360
 But they interviewed a chap called William Whitehead from the University of North Carolina, who's an expert in these things.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:18.360
 And he says that you might actually be able to increase the capacity by putting drugs up there and end up with what he called a mega rectum.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:27.360
 It's time for a final fact of the show and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:34.360
 My fact is that in the Greek Odysseus myth, he escapes the Cyclops by hiding under one of the Cyclops' sheep.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:41.360
 In the Apache version of the same myth, he escapes by hiding in the anus of a buffalo.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.360
 I like that the Cyclops is a shepherd.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:49.360
 Yeah, I just never thought of him doing sort of menial tasks or sort of like running a farm.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.360
 And it must be hard because he can't judge the distance of his sheep because he's only got one eye.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.360
 Oh yeah.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.360
 So he doesn't know how far away they are.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.360
 So that father Ted joke about the size of a cow.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.360
 That would actually be a reality for him.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.360
 He doesn't get that joke.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.360
 This is a myth that goes back.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.360
 And there's a French anthropologist called Julian D.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.360
 Who has studied myths.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:19.360
 And he's studied a particular ethnic group who have gone around the world for thousands and thousands of years.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:28.360
 And he reckons it goes back 18,000 years and there's always the same version of the story is human goes into a monster's house to steal something.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:34.360
 The monster gets home and he has a herd of wild animals and he finds the humans and he locks the humans in somehow.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:42.360
 And then he waits by the door for the man to kill him as the humans start to leave and the humans escape using the herd of animals.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:48.360
 So in the Greek version, they blind him and then they hide under the sheep and the Cyclops feels the sheep as he goes out.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:55.360
 And then in the Apache version the hero gets into the anus of a buffalo.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.360
 I mean it does the same job, doesn't it?

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.360
 It does the job.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.360
 But actually there is some cave painting in South of France in the cave of the Twafre.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.360
 So there's a picture of a bison with an extremely distended rectum.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.360
 And they think that that might be part of this story as well.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:16.360
 So actually it's not just the Apaches it might go back to ancient Stone Age European times.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:22.360
 Is that picture the sequel of that bison's life story once you got back out?

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.360
 And there's another bison going, how did you get like that?

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.360
 You will not believe it.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.360
 There's another theory that there are two main families of myth.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.360
 They're called the Louration and the Gondwonan and the named after the two big super continents.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.360
 And he reckons that one branch of humanity went north about 40,000 years ago out of Africa.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:46.360
 And all the sheep ain't the stories, all of those come from there.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:51.360
 And as that group moved around, so that's in Switzerland, it's in Scandinavia, it's in North America, it's in Greece.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:57.360
 And lots of those myths are about kind of the creation of the world, the rule of the gods, the rise of man, the end of the universe.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.360
 That's it.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:03.360
 The ones who went south and became, for example, the Australian Aborigines are a completely different family.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.360
 They're all about a world which already exists.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.360
 The world already existed about the rise of man or the invention of man involved.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:15.360
 Both families have one thing in common, which is the massive flood myth, where he was punished in some way.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.360
 That's the linking myth between these two huge groups.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:23.360
 Most places have, most ancient civilizations have a flood myth, which is so curious.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:32.360
 Those, the Babylonians, they found on Cuneiform, sort of, it was the measurements for effectively an ark, a Noah's ark.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.360
 And this is in Babylonian Cuneiform time.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:41.360
 It was like a coracle, wasn't it? It was more of a circular thing, rather than the biblical one, which is x-cubics by y-cubics by z-cubics.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.360
 It's more of a square.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:51.360
 Yeah, they actually rebuilt it. There's a documentary, you can see Irving Finkel, who's a British museum curator, actually managed to decipher the exact measurements, and they tried to rebuild it.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.360
 A very sci-fi to be a sphere.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.360
 Yeah, yeah. It's true.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:01.360
 Just going back very quickly to talking about how would the Apache have managed to get this myth.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:08.360
 It's so interesting that, like, in recent archaeology, we keep learning more and more about cultures colliding way before we realize.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.360
 And did you guys see that story about the ancient Greeks?

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:20.360
 They're looking at the terracotta warriors, and they're suddenly thinking that ancient Greek artists were involved in helping and the making of the terracotta army.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:27.360
 And I asked a historian friend if that had any credence to it, and he said absolutely, it looks like very convincing.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:34.360
 It looks extremely convincing, and this is way before Marco Polo. This is way before the first time we ever thought that they'd had proper contact culturally.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.360
 Wow.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.360
 Yes, I've seen the terracotta warriors.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.360
 Yeah.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.360
 I saw them in London.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.360
 Well, okay, I saw them in London.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.360
 They're just in St. James's part.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.360
 People used to throw things at them to knock them over.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.360
 Oh, really? So you went to where they actually went?

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.360
 I went to Shien in China, which is--

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.360
 They're natural habitat.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.360
 They're natural habitat.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:57.360
 And they're in these huge long-- it's like a much bigger-- it's bigger than a football pitch.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.360
 There's massive long hanger that you see them in.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.360
 And they're in trenches, and they're all lined up facing the same way-- hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.360
 And they're finding more and more, aren't they?

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.360
 They're finding terracotta, acrobats, and terracotta.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.360
 Yeah.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.360
 Jugglers and sort of this whole society.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.360
 Well, they have it.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.360
 Yeah, they know that there is-- they've probably unearthed.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:19.360
 I think it's something like a tenth of how many they actually believe are going to be unearthed over time.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.360
 They've just been doing it really slowly.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.360
 It's amazing.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.360
 Yeah, it's so cool.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.360
 And the first emperor's tomb, which supposedly is a mercury lake, on the inside,

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.360
 because he was obsessed with the elixir of life, and that mercury was the main thing.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.360
 They found a spot that they think might be where he's buried,

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.360
 and using detection, the mercury levels suddenly go, "Woo, up on the dial, like really high."

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.360
 So they think they might have found where he is buried,

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.360
 and where it could be true, the myth of the mercury lake.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.360
 That's very cool.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.360
 That was a really good impression of a mercury detector, by the way.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:54.360
 Just quickly, do you know what colour the sheep were that Odysseus escaped on?

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.360
 It might have their white.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.360
 Jay-Z Blue.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.360
 Well, you're actually quite close.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.360
 You're closer than James.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.360
 They're violet coloured.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.360
 Really, if you believe Homer.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.360
 So this is this weird thing about the Odyssey, where all of his descriptions,

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.360
 his coloured descriptions, don't really equate with what colours are.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:14.360
 So like the wine coloured sea, honey is described as being green.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.360
 Hector's hair is dark blue.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.360
 And yeah, the sheep are described as being violet.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.360
 In China, there are blue sheep, which are in secluded bits of China,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.360
 and they constantly try to make documentaries on them, but the government...

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.360
 There are no documentary makers making documentaries about the documentary makers.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.360
 Just sheep going, no comment.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:37.360
 I think what it is is that there are certain areas of China that have been closed off

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.360
 by the government for people going into, and it's just so happens that where they believe the blue sheep are,

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.360
 it's in a territory where you're not allowed to go.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.360
 Right. They can't get access.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.360
 I only know it actually, because remember Molly went over to China to make a documentary.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.360
 To try and make a documentary.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.360
 Again, they couldn't, they couldn't, the whole thing fell apart as well while they were there,

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.360
 but they were looking for blue sheep, that's what.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.360
 So that's Molly Olfield, who was one of the researchers for QI.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.360
 Yes.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.360
 You can still see, I was going to say you can still have a bath in,

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.360
 but you can still see a bath that featured in the Odyssey.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.360
 Wow.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.360
 Isn't that cool?

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.360
 So this is a bath that Odysseus's son is bathed in,

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.360
 and it actually said exists, so it's in Pylos,

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.360
 which is on the western coast of Greece,

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.360
 and you can go and see it's a bath tub of Nester,

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.360
 and it's still there.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.360
 It's been around since 1300 BC.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.360
 It was all fake, right?

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.360
 So the story of what Homer's writing about, the Iliad and the Odyssey,

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:38.360
 are actually two, I think, of a series of eight stories of the whole Trojan Wars,

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.360
 and the only those two survived in full, but I think they're six royal fragments,

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.360
 and the Trojan Wars really happened.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.360
 But then obviously, they start getting crazy gods involved,

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.360
 which starts to become a bit fictional.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.360
 But yeah, Nester's palaces.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.360
 They've stood in Nester's bath tub existing.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.360
 There are ruins of Troy, that they discovered, aren't they?

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.360
 So I know that it was a real place.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.360
 Yes.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.360
 And that there were loads of cities which were destroyed or burned down,

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.360
 or, you know, fell in war, and then they build another one on top,

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.360
 and they've got a kind of layer cake.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.360
 Yes, because I think the person who discovered Troy initially got in loads of trouble,

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.360
 because in order to discover it, he'd destroyed an equally valuable layer of archaeology

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.360
 on top of it, which he'd just chucked away.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.360
 And then that's book nine in the series.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.360
 So in Greek mythology, a lot of, you know, when wonderful stuff happens,

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:22.360
 and particularly Zeus turning himself into things in order to get off with women,

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.360
 he turns himself into someone's husband, which at least kind of makes sense,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.360
 then he turns himself into a swan to get off with leader, then some rain.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.360
 Was it not a golden shower?

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:40.360
 It's described as a golden shower, which used to be called just pink shower.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.360
 And that's a perseus, isn't it?

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.360
 Oh, I read Danny.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.360
 Oh, to make perseus.

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.360
 Sorry to make, but yeah, you're absolutely right.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.360
 And then as a bull.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.360
 So this is really interesting.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.360
 He disguised himself as a bull to get off with Europa, right?

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.360
 And Europa is the mother of King Minos of Crete, yeah?

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.360
 So King Minos of Crete, his mum, has had sex with a bull.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.360
 And then his wife, pacify, falls in love with a bull,

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.360
 which is a punishment from the gods because he said he tries to trick them

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.360
 and send them an inferior sacrifice.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.360
 It's never worth doing in the Greek myth.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.360
 They always find out this is an inferior sacrifice.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.360
 They never don't trick.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.360
 So not only has his mum got off with a bull, his wife has now fallen in love with a bull.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.360
 It just must be so embarrassing for him.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.360
 It's a real curse.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.360
 Yes.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.360
 Imagine what bad luck it would be if you're trying to make an escape

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.360
 and you happen to pick the wrong bull's-anus to climb into.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.360
 It turns out.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.360
 And you find your mum in there.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.360
 Yeah.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:40.360
 Okay, that's it.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.360
 That is all of our facts.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.360

 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.360
 We'll see you then.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.360
 Good bye.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:28.360
 Hi all.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.360
 Okay.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.360
 Look.

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:35.360
 James and I admit that maybe there aren't any flamingos in St James's Park.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.360
 Our further research tells us.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.360
 Now, what we need to do about this is either you lot.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.360
 If you have any photographic evidence that there have been flamingos in St James's Park,

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.360
 you need to send it to us quickly so that we feel vindicated.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.360
 And if you don't and it turns out there aren't any there and there never have been

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.360
 and we were confusing flamingos with pelicans because we're idiots,

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:57.360
 then you just have to never, ever tell Andy that he was right.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.360
 Okay. See you next week.
