00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Little Fish. We've been so happy to get

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,080
 a message from you guys to say that you've been enjoying this show and we certainly enjoy

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,440
 making it. It's a little bit more loose, a little bit more silly than the normal shows,

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,120
 but we really, really love getting your facts so please do keep sending those in.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,480
 The reason I've disturbed the start of your show today is because I want to tell you about

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,880
 a quiz that we're doing. It is for Patreon subscribers on the top tier and it will take

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,200
 place on the 23rd of January at 7pm UK time, so that'll be sometime in the afternoon

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,360
 if you're in North America and it'll be very early in the morning if you're in Australia

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,440
 or New Zealand, but hopefully you will still be able to join us. It's going to be a whole

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,740
 load of fun. We've got loads of amazing stuff planned for you and if you are not a member

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,460
 of Patreon right now, then you have to go to patreon.com/nosuchthingsaffish and join

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,500
 our top tier. You could probably just do it for a month and then quit if you just want

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,860
 to do the quiz, but honestly there's so much good stuff on our Patreon that I really think

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,740
 once you join you will be hooked because we have extra content, we have merch, we have

15
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,980
 video content, there's all sorts of stuff on there. We hope we've made it value for money

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,420
 because people going on there help to support the podcast so it is a real good mutual benefit

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,420
 thing. Anyway, enough of that. Really hope you enjoyed this episode of Little Fish.

18
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:43,740
 Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Little Fish. This is our bonus Monday episode

19
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,380
 where we put down our facts and we go through the inbox and we find your best facts from

20
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,860
 the last seven days. And if you want to send in yours by the way and be part of this

21
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,980
 show podcast at qi.com is the place to do it, but we have had so many entries this week so

22
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,660
 let's get straight to it. Point of order. At what stage does this stop being a bonus episode

23
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,980
 and just become part of our normal day to day, cut to the end. Monday lives. How many weeks

24
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,660
 are we in now? 10. This will be about our 8th or 9th or 10th. So when does a relationship

25
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,660
 stop being new? Oh well, with my relationship in case my wife's listening, I wake up every

26
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,220
 morning and think how much I'm in love with her. Yeah, still a lot of lives every day. Same thing

27
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,100
 for me. I wake up. I think Helena, I really just would do anything to be with you. I'm stuck

28
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:40,380
 in my situation. I can't see it out yet. Andy. Me three. I'd you the list that podcast

29
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:49,220
 a queue. I don't know. I think this is our now we're settling into a very happy life as

30
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,100
 this being the other episode, the other weekly episode we do. Yeah, can we do it? Let's

31
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,240
 do it. Let's get into it. Who's got a factor once I open up? Well, I've got one from Peter

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,620
 Drake, who has sent us a raunchy math fact. Oh, great. Yes. And Peter says properties

33
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:12,860
 of mathematical graphs include girth and weiner index, weiner index, weiner index. That's

34
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,380
 funny. And separately, Jess Weyer has written to us and said, my fact this week is that there

35
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,020
 is a mathematical function called the popcorn function of the names include the raindrop

36
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,300
 function, the countable cloud function and the stars over Babylon. So these are just some

37
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,620
 mathematicians making fun names for things. Did you have this when you because you studied

38
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:40,020
 math, James? Yeah, I was aware of, well, I know about the girth of graph theory. These are

39
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,180
 not graphs like you would see a graph on a news article or something. This is a mathematical

40
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,220
 graph where you get lots of points and you draw lines in between them and it's the connections

41
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,820
 between different things. Is it graphic? If you're measuring your girth on the weiner

42
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,260
 No, no, no, they're extremely boring. The girth is the shortest way you can go between

43
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,860
 two objects where only the first and the last ones are the same. Yeah, it does. It's

44
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:12,100
 quite boring. And these popcorn functions and the stars over Babylon. So basically, it's

45
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,260
 like the kind of math. So it's like, if this, then that, you know, like how computers work.

46
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,860
 But it's basically you put in some number and it goes through this function and it comes

47
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,180
 out as either a zero or a one and it kind of is like random if it's zero or one. So it pops

48
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:32,180
 around like popcorn. Oh, nice. But yeah, I do remember some fun names from when I did

49
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:41,020
 maths at university at the tits group invented by French mathematician Jacques Titz. And if

50
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,860
 you want to work out the tits group, then you first have to find the coxeta complex named

51
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:55,780
 after Harold coxeta. Wow. His school days. I just think, good Lord. I wonder if he became

52
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,260
 a mathematician. Why? Just you'd spend more time with your books, wouldn't you, working?

53
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,460
 What'd you? Your for vengeance. Oh, this guy's outside of the playground. Well, I'm

54
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:14,060
 just randomly, you know, his math is so oblique that it can never be used in real life. It's

55
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,900
 not like he worked out the trajectory of a missile that he could fire at his enemies.

56
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,100
 His is like some extremely random bit of group theory. That's brilliant. He's fled his

57
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:30,700
 own name into the realms of pure mathematics. Yeah. Love it. Love it. Any more facts? Yeah.

58
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,100
 Well, do you know what? I have something in a similar vein. So why don't we jump to

59
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:39,020
 the one that I got sent in by David Reed? So David Reed, he's an observatory coordination

60
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:45,700
 support officer at Cicero, C-I-S-I-R-O, Merchison Radiostronomy Observatory. That's in Western

61
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,700
 Australia. So this comes from international land. And he says, I know you have covered

62
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,500
 the occasional clever acronym created by scientists that clunkly describe their experiments.

63
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:03,980
 Did you know a radio telescope imaging program called P-Y-B-D-S-F pronounced P-B-D-S-F was

64
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:10,180
 the Python coded blob detector and source finder. Right. But that's not what it does. It's actually

65
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:17,140
 a blob detector and source measure, but they didn't want to call it P-B-D-S-M. I see. I see

66
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,580
 where we're going. It was given away at the end. The punchline there wasn't it? I had no

67
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,700
 idea where we would go with any of that. As often the punchline does. Not all you'll stand

68
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,860
 up, Dan. Sometimes you'll stick it at the front, won't you? Keep it fresh. Keep it fresh.

69
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,020
 Keep them guessing. So they decided they didn't want it to be called B-D-S-M, so they changed

70
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,340
 the final words. Exactly. Yeah. To make it something that is slightly a redundant acronym.

71
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,820
 I saw someone's personalized number plate the other day, which was, I won't say exactly

72
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,140
 what it was, because you don't want to say people's number plates. But it was something

73
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:56,940
 like P-I-I-H-L-P. So it was like, when you looked at it and glance at it, it was obviously

74
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:05,140
 Philip. Yeah. Right. When you actually spent any time looking at it, it was like P-E-L-O-P.

75
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,060
 You do want to sometimes the things that people pay lots for, unless that's P-L-N-A-M. Yeah.

76
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,060
 Which it might be. I think it's fine to read out people's number plates. Yeah. I think it's

77
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,380
 absolutely fine, as long as you're not saying. Well, I did, I did the Kia's car, I said, "Well,

78
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,820
 I passed the car, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it. So I found a few other

79
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,060
 acronym things that I thought were quite fun. Oh, yeah. Have you heard of RAS syndrome? R-A-S,

80
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,760
 syndrome? No. RAS syndrome is redundant acronym syndrome. Very nice. And this is to describe

81
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,220
 any time that people say PIN number or ATM machine because the end in PIN is. That's really

82
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,460
 fun. Yeah. So that's one. I really like E-GOT. So we all know E-GOT, right? Which is M-E-Grammy,

83
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,940
 Oscar and Tony. The idea is you become the ultimate actor if you win an E-GOT. That was created

84
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,020
 by an actor called Philip Michael Thomas. He used to walk around with a golden medallion around

85
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,940
 his chest saying, "E-GOT massively." What could he go on? No, it's his plan. He was like, I want to win

86
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,980
 all of these things. Oh, yeah. Anyway, he's now retired and he was never even nominated for a single one

87
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,340
 of these things. But he was a good actor. He did a lot of stuff, so he had a great career. I always thought

88
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:20,420
 it was the E-GOT because you had all those that you said and also the chartle award. Is the real one

89
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:26,500
 that everyone goes for? Obviously, we've got one-fifth of a E-GOT. Yes. Unless not say which fifth.

90
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:34,500
 Or Andy, what have you got? Oh, I've got some really fun ones. Do you remember we had a bit of

91
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,020
 correspondence on "Dropers Align", which is our audience feedback show, from the House of Lords. I do remember

92
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,900
 that. Well, I just thought I'd say Lord Borwick also sent in a fact as well as a bit of bonus info.

93
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,620
 So same Lord, we haven't yet cracked more than one member. Your Highness. Thank you for writing in.

94
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:59,540
 Your Grace. Your Excellence. Right, here's a quiz question. Okay. How many times does the letter

95
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,020
 X appear on the face of Big Ben? And for the purposes of this, Big Ben is the clock.

96
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,660
 I can't get into Stephen's Tower, the Elizabeth Tower, blah, blah, blah. Okay. The clock.

97
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:15,780
 Turn 11, 12, three. Oh, but there are four faces. 12. Very nice. Okay, so you said 12, Dan.

98
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:24,420
 I think an aerial view of the Big Ben itself will have an X. That's the one on top. It's how you

99
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,100
 signal the X files. It's okay. So James, when I was a kid, I put an X on my window in my bedroom

100
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:39,460
 to signal that I was to lure Julian Allison. It was worth a try. It wasn't spotted in Bolton once again.

101
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:45,460
 Oh, my God. Was David be coffee every day? Are you sure you're still that interested?

102
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,780
 I'm like, no, I've, I've holding out for Anderson. Oh, you did the X. That's so cool.

103
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,220
 That's very cool. What was that? Just to, is that what people do? No, I think it was in the show

104
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,540
 that you put an X there and it showed that you knew the truth was out there. It was a thing. Yeah,

105
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,700
 I can't remember the exact meaning of it, but that was a thing that you do. Aliens would know

106
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,220
 not to touch you. Never seen an episode of it. Andy. It's great. Honestly, I would go to the start,

107
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,420
 watch them all. Yeah. Really? Yeah. You'll love them. That I mean, they're brilliant. I assume that

108
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,580
 they have an age badly. No, they're great. I watch them all. Not all, but I watched series one

109
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,140
 quite recently. Did you? Yeah. In between few weeks of. Now you see me. Now you see me.

110
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,740
 Great. Brilliant. Okay. So what's the, did we get the question? We did.

111
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,740
 Did we get the answer? Well, you haven't had you submitted your guess yet. Why is it James' 12 plus,

112
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:42,980
 so 13? Just saying 13. Yeah. It's zero. What? Because the designer, Pugin, Augustus Wellby Northmore Pugin,

113
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,700
 he designed all of their parliament building. Didn't he, Pugin? A lot of it. Yeah. Crazy name,

114
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,300
 crazy guy. He, he did actually die of insanity. Anyway, I might have been mercury poisoning,

115
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,020
 might have been syphilis. Anyway, he decided he didn't want an X. He wanted an F.

116
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,940
 No. No. It's F. It's so weird. If you look at it, it goes one F for nine.

117
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:14,660
 I've got nine. Yes. Then F, then F one, and then F one I, I for 12. It's just F. I don't know.

118
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:21,300
 Is it because of the mercury poisoning, maybe? It's possible. It's very possible. He was a really

119
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:27,060
 interesting guy. Also had a link to Ramsgate, which we discussed on an episode that we have recorded,

120
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,620
 but it's not yet been broadcast. So this is a call forward to a really fun episode coming up.

121
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,220
 And what is it? What's the link? He lived there. Oh, fantastic.

122
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,140
 He lived there, but he dressed as a sailor, and he would frequently take his boat out to rescue

123
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,020
 sailors in difficulties. Wow. I mean, a really peculiar, a really peculiar guy. Imagine how excited

124
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:51,300
 the audience is now for the Ramsgate episode. Oh my gosh. Facts like that. We didn't even put that

125
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:58,180
 in the show. Can I tell you one more factor found in about the Big Ben thing as a result of this?

126
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:05,060
 It's last year a company won a special prize in Elevator World's Project of the Year Awards

127
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,340
 for the lifts in the Big Ben Tower, okay? Can you guess which company it was?

128
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,380
 Schindler. Schindler. Wasn't Schindler. They do do lifts.

129
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:20,100
 Otis. No. What's another? They're the only two right now. I mean, in fairness, I think we did

130
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,420
 quite well to think of two names of lift manufacturers. Is it going to be something like Churchill,

131
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,140
 like something that's very relevant? Wellington. What's a lift? No, it's not that. It's a lift

132
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,620
 company, but it's not a traditional lift company. What's another kind of lift? It doesn't go up

133
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,740
 and down straight. It goes up the side of the lift, huh? It's not a finicular. It's on your,

134
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,620
 if I say this, you'll get it. It's on your stairs. Yeah. Stana. Stana. Good day. Stana did the lifts

135
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,660
 in the Big Ben Tower. Really? Really? They won a special prize from Elevator World for it.

136
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,660
 House business, up and down. There we go. Very nice. That's the fact I found. That's a great fact.

137
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,580
 That is really good. Thank you. Anyway, look forward to that Ram's Gate episode in about a month's time.

138
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:08,980
 This one has been sent into us by Peter Monroe. It says, "A new species of terrasaur has been discovered

139
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:16,820
 in a pile of fossilized vomit." It was pretty amazing, so this is over 100 million years ago. You're

140
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,620
 saying someone threw up a whole dinosaur? Yeah, I think someone, someone, I mean, a big dinosaur.

141
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,780
 The suggestion is that it might have been a spinosaurus. They don't know for sure, but you have to,

142
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:32,980
 I guess, scale up for size. Scale for you. They vomited. When they vomited, they vomited up two

143
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:41,140
 terrasors and somehow that vomit fossilized and these geologists were looking through the fossil

144
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,700
 when they suddenly spotted the bones and it's a new species altogether of a terrasaur.

145
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,540
 So that's pretty exciting stuff. This is called, by the way, when you go through vomit,

146
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:59,460
 it's called a regurgertelite. That's what a... I like a coprolite. A coprolite, but it's a regurgertelite.

147
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:05,620
 That's good. Yeah. You guys had quite a heavy QI Christmas party this week. How do you think?

148
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:11,060
 Well, I wasn't there. I wasn't invited, but couldn't make it. We left some fossils around.

149
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:18,180
 Fossils to be. Here's hoping. Did you know? A new type of canopy was discovered.

150
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:32,260
 I've got a fact. Oh yeah. From Marcus Dallion, or Dallion, I hope I'm saying that right, Marcus,

151
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,820
 the modern, Celsius scale of temperature is based on the melting and freezing point of water.

152
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,220
 That's not the fact. That's not the fact. But that's not even good enough to get into our Ramsgate

153
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:50,500
 episode. But previous proposals included some of the following as fixed points. The melting point

154
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:58,180
 of butter, like that's boiling, whatever. Water hottest to be endured by a handheld still,

155
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,140
 like just what's the hottest water you can take in your hand. And then the temperature at the center

156
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:10,820
 of the Great Pyramid of Giza. And basically, the guy who proposed this Great Pyramid of Giza thing

157
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,740
 was this insane astronomer royal for Scotland called Charles Piazzi Smive. He was obsessed with

158
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,180
 the Great Pyramid basically. And I'm obsessed with the pyramid. I thought these have to be what we

159
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:26,900
 measure everything based off. So he suggested the pyramid inch pyramid pint pyramid gallon.

160
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:32,180
 He said all of these come from the sacred pyramid. And they were all basically, let's say a pyramid

161
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,860
 inch could be one one thousandth of the length of a pyramid. Basically, yes. He claimed they were all

162
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,780
 core metrological qualities. I don't mind that though. I think like as long as you choose something

163
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,580
 and stick with it. And was the was the heat measured by because it was deep in the center by the

164
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,780
 Atlantean crystals. That's right. Had been left there. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. I'm preaching to the

165
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,620
 choir here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Actually, that's good to know. I didn't know how all those were.

166
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,340
 It's an ancient computer system that they left buried there for us. I genuinely gave a speech

167
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:08,740
 about that school when I was about 16 years old. The trial was farther to the man. Yeah. Amazing.

168
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:16,100
 And I got good marks. It was a starting school. Oh, yeah. Okay. James, you got another.

169
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:24,340
 This one is from Robbie. No surname here, but Robbie writes about German chocolate cake and

170
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:29,940
 regular listness to little fish will know that I mentioned this on a previous episode. But Robbie

171
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,060
 sent this email before he'd heard that. Yeah. Or she actually, Robbie could be a girl. It's got to be

172
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:41,140
 Robbie Williams. Sorry. It's not spelled. Robbie Williams is IE, isn't it? Robbie is IE.

173
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,780
 Yeah. This is Robbie with a Y. He's trying to mask it. Yeah. It's Robbie Williams.

174
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:52,100
 Well, I must say, I didn't really care much for your performance at the World Cup draw.

175
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:58,260
 But I do like your fact. And it is as well as German chocolate cake, not being German,

176
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:04,260
 being named after someone called German. It's made out of Baker's chocolate. And Baker's

177
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:10,740
 chocolate was named after the company founder, Dr. James Baker. Oh, it was brilliant. Brilliant.

178
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:17,380
 Isn't that amazing? How far did this go? That's so good. And yeah, I decided to look into this

179
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,380
 a little bit more. So German chocolate cake, it was quite early that they, this mistake was made

180
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:31,300
 that they thought it was German. So it was invented in 1957. And in 1963, Lyndon B. Johnson

181
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,140
 served it to the German Chancellor Ludwig Erhardt, thinking that it was a German dessert,

182
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,780
 brilliant. Even though it was named after an American called German. That's really good.

183
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:50,500
 So yeah. Imagine that. That's really good. Well, can I jump on this with Ben Wright has written in.

184
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,980
 So this is another correspondent of ours with a great fact. So Ben has said, this is rather thin

185
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:07,220
 stuff, but it's so nice when someone acknowledges. He knows how standard he knows the

186
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:16,180
 loop and made it to the show Ben. But Italian nationalist, Garibaldi of biscuit fame was born

187
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:23,140
 in Nice, which is Nice Biscuits as well or Nice Biscuits. Nice in France. So of biscuit fame.

188
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:30,180
 Interesting. And he defeated the ball bonds of biscuit fame as well. That's very good.

189
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,300
 I thought he was Italian Garibaldi and Nice is in France, but I guess the borders were a little

190
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,060
 bit different in those years. He was Italian. He's the hero of Italian education for sure.

191
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,900
 But he was born in France. That's weird. No. That is weird. That feels like it needs a Google.

192
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:51,940
 I think Nice Biscuits are named after Nice the town. Some royal had been there or something.

193
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,300
 Maybe Queen Victoria or something had been there and it was very fashionable. It became very

194
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,860
 fashionable so they named the biscuits after them. Because everyone thinks they're Nice Biscuits.

195
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,780
 Well, they are Nice Biscuits. Do you think so? I think they're quite boring.

196
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,020
 Well, speaking of biscuits, boring people. I was given an amusingly shaped biscuit today.

197
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:17,220
 Oh, are you? Oh my God. What was it? No, no, no, guys. Like, there's some bits of going behind

198
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,540
 the curtain of faith that people are really going to like. I'm going to find really interesting.

199
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,420
 But this unbelievably tedious conversation that you two had before the bites came on. I think

200
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:32,980
 should stay there. Okay, let's, yeah, let's preserve the magic. Yeah. The mystique of this show.

201
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:41,540
 All we can say is it revolves around the biscuits, a railway station and a mutt. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

202
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,380
 I actually, I decided I would see if I could build on this great discovery by Ben about

203
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:53,220
 Garibaldi to see if there are any other biscuit connections to Garibaldi. So he was known for

204
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,020
 leading military campaigns. What did he bring with them? Wagon's. How do they roll?

205
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,540
 Wagon wheels. Wagon wheels. Really good. Surrounded by wagon wheels.

206
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,020
 Would he use a wagon in 1850s Europe? Maybe. It's more of a car. The tank hadn't been invented yet.

207
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,780
 Tank. No, that's true. All right. I googled it. Brilliant. I'll check. He definitely had some wagons.

208
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:21,140
 Okay. He died in 1882. Oh, yeah. Guys, 1882. What's that? That was the year that AF Brockhofen

209
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:29,380
 co-biscuits were established in Australia. It's 1882. Oh, sorry. Oh, Brockhofen, yeah. It is

210
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:36,100
 confusing. Yeah. This was a call. Brockhofen just for the international listener. Yeah.

211
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,580
 Who's not from Australia? Well, they don't really exist anymore, I don't think. But they

212
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,940
 did merge with Arnott's biscuits down the line, which is Australia's digestives. You know,

213
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,020
 it's a massive biscuit over there. Oh, okay. So any Aussie listening will know Arnott's.

214
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:57,300
 So that's a lot. Oh, and then one more. Which is that? No, the first two were so strong. Can you

215
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,780
 really cap those? No, this is the headlighter, I think. Sorry, yeah. Well, I discovered that he was a

216
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:10,340
 redhead. He would have been running around with the pair of ginger nuts. Wow. Ben, Ben writes.

217
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,620
 Thank you for that email, which sparked this. Ben is now wishing he hadn't even done his laptop

218
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:22,820
 that day. Well, listen, those are your facts, everyone. But now it's time for us to do something

219
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,300
 very exciting, which we love to do at the end of each little fish episode, which is to allocate

220
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:33,380
 some custodians to one of the facts, one of the headlines from our 600-plus episodes that we

221
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,260
 have done that will belong to you forever. And you get this by being part of our friend of the

222
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:44,260
 podcast here on Clubfish, which is your point on Patreon if you want to check it out. So let's

223
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:51,140
 dish out a batch of new headlines. So James, yeah, this fact is now under the custodians ship

224
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:57,620
 of Spoonie. I don't know if that's Spoonie, the Radio One DJ from the early 2000s or a different Spoonie.

225
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:04,500
 But Spoonie, you now own this fact. It is that the Aztecs warn necklaces made of popcorn,

226
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:11,140
 warners and offering to the gods. Lovely. Now, I hope you two were listening before because my

227
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:17,620
 question to you is, how would you describe the mathematical popcorn function? It's literally

228
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:23,380
 just 10 minutes ago. Just going up and down, up and down in a, and Andy, you do that in the next bit.

229
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:30,260
 So it goes all over the place, the results are a bit haywire. Okay, disappointingly, you both

230
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,180
 more or less know that. So well done, you too. Do you remember anything about the Aztecs?

231
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:44,900
 Great girth. Another mathematical. No, no, I'm just asking about the time that we mentioned them in

232
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:51,140
 episode 15 of the podcast. Oh, the Aztecs were more recent than we think they were. Oxford University

233
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,980
 overlaps with the Aztecs. Do you know what I mean? Well, yeah, the Aztecs were there when

234
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:01,060
 Columbus went off. Oh, okay, okay. So, yeah, they were around in the 15th century.

235
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,260
 Okay, sure. Yeah, probably a 16th as well. That's all I remember. Yeah, I can't. Have you got a good

236
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,060
 Aztec fact outside of this brilliant headline? Sweet or sweet or salty popcorn? I know that

237
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:18,340
 a Montezuma supposedly drank 50 cups of hot chocolate at a single meal. Wow, nice. But it was

238
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:25,860
 that account was written by a noted conquistador liar called Diaz. When you look at everything else,

239
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,820
 he wrote is like, yeah, this probably didn't happen. So was that trying to slank off Montezuma?

240
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:36,260
 No, it wasn't really because I think the Spanish were quite impressed by him, but it was basically

241
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:42,660
 had so many lovers that he needed the hot chocolate to to keep him going. But I think usually a hot

242
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:49,700
 chocolate goes before bedtime, not sexy times, but sleepy times. And that would be the hell of a

243
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:56,980
 regurgitalite waiting to happen, isn't it? There's probably fossilized hot chocolate. Yeah, his one,

244
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:03,620
 his one. This goes out to Lizzie Uting. Congratulations to you. This is the fact that in 2011,

245
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:09,940
 China tried to pass off a scene from top gun as footage of its own air force. Right. They just,

246
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,700
 I think there was some national security display or something and they were saying, look at our amazing

247
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:19,220
 jets and they cut the like- Was it crews in a way? Was it the scene of top gun weather roll in a

248
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:28,500
 bar singing Take My Breath Away? It was some hot, hot, hot beach volleyball. Look at our super

249
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,780
 stud airman. Yeah, yeah. So that's what they did. I doubt they would need to do that these days.

250
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:40,580
 I think that's a function of 2011 versus 2025. Oh, yeah, probably the US Air Force is using footage from

251
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:48,820
 Asia too. Yeah, I love that fact. That's very cool. That's an anotoshinsky that you've got there. Lizzie,

252
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,900
 so well done to that. Okay, let's do another one. This is going out to Steph. Steph, this is the fact

253
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,820
 that in 2003, someone lost the keys to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the replacement

254
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:08,740
 locks cost over one million pounds. Oh, an awful vibance. I don't remember that one. I have to say. Imagine

255
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:16,180
 saying, I'll buy the new keys. It's fine. I'll get the new lock. The guy who made those keys

256
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:24,500
 would not have to make another pair of shoe sols or trophy ever again. Yeah. It's a million for

257
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:33,780
 the keys and it's 50p for the key ring. That was my fact, by the way. So congrats to Steph. Okay, so

258
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:42,100
 the next fact comes from us. But it now is under the custodianship of Helen. And Helen, your fact

259
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:50,180
 is probably the most feminist facts to date. And it was from Andy in episode 15 and it was that

260
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:57,460
 Ken is officially an accessory to Barbie. Right on, sister. There you go. We've all felt like that.

261
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,420
 Barb is giving us so much over the years, hasn't it? When you think about how many times it has come up.

262
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:09,780
 Yeah. She has got the brand. The brand. The brand. Okay. Well, we feminized brands in this podcast.

263
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:19,300
 Like ships and countries. But it has, hasn't it? In fact, it was mentioned just recently on a little fish

264
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:24,740
 or a jewel. No, it was in the episode. It doesn't go out until the middle of January with Tom Allen.

265
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:30,180
 So let's hold it in. The timelines have gone but none is on this. Yeah. Yeah. Really good.

266
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:36,260
 All right. Let's do another fact now. This is from episode 16. This is a James Harken fact.

267
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:43,220
 This is a classic fact and it's going to Oliver Castles, which is the world record for most kicks

268
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:52,260
 to one's own head is 127 in a minute. Yeah. That was, we mentioned, I believe it was on the last

269
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:58,100
 episode that we did our first ever photo shoot where we each put a fact down on a placard and we held

270
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,340
 it for the camera and that was yours in that one. And these was it's sausage to me. That's right.

271
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:09,300
 That's right. Yeah. And if you are so inclined go on to the internet and search for kicking

272
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:16,580
 own head world record and it is remarkable. Is it both feet? Yeah. I guess it's even more

273
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:21,300
 impressive because it impresses me the way. It's like doing the can cam but you go too far.

274
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:26,420
 Bloody hell. Is he sitting down or she? It's a he and I think he is sitting down. Because you

275
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,020
 have to get your head right now. I couldn't do it once. I'm not flexible enough. No.

276
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,260
 And this is 11 years ago is no one beat the record. They have but they've forgotten.

277
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:41,700
 Well, you have to do an even number of times. Yeah, Fancy putting me on the spotlight.

278
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:48,420
 That does it if I know every world record when it gets changed. Okay. Well done. Oliver. That is

279
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,900
 now your fact. Let's get another one. Andy. Yes, here's a little one. Quick brackets. We had an

280
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:59,540
 email from Arge Geese. Yeah. Just saying that last time Arge was absolutely blown away to get a fact

281
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,580
 which was one of Dr Karl's facts on the show. It's like correction says Arge. "Damn mispronounced my name."

282
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,940
 You read it as a series of letters. "ARJG". And it's actually Arge Geese. Just wanted to correct

283
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,220
 that. But by the way, if in future damn mispronounces your name. Do write it but we may not be able to

284
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,460
 fit in all of Dan's mispronunciations. It's just that's a hard, that's a high bar to clear.

285
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:26,420
 Just hold it as a as a badge of respect. Absolutely. Yeah. Exactly. I mean, to be fair, the G was

286
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:31,940
 connected to the ARJ in our document. Therefore, I thought it was an internet nickname. Dan, it's not

287
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:38,100
 your fault. We've all got cool names online. Like your cool guy, one, two, three. Don't give away my

288
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:44,820
 secret super cool online identity, guys. So here's the fact going out to Tori. And this is T-O-R-E-Y

289
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,820
 Tori. And the fact is there's a bear in the Pyrenees called Pyros who is facing castration because

290
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:57,380
 he's fathered almost all other bears. Yes. So basically this is an anti-insessed bear castration

291
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:06,740
 move because Pyros was clearly getting too frisky with his own children bears. It's not a nice

292
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:12,580
 fact, Tori. I'm going to level with you. It's a market. But look, this is what you have to do. It's

293
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:19,620
 nature. It's nature. This, by the way, is an Ann Miller fact. Ann's been on the show recently.

294
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,780
 If you're a listener of the main show, I assume you are. I haven't just come for the bonus.

295
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:29,860
 Ann has been with us for many, many years. One of the QILs been on the show probably as much as

296
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:35,780
 as any other person guest we've ever had. This is her debut onto the show. That's cool fact to have.

297
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,460
 It was written up at the time with one headline saying, "Bare might have necessities removed."

298
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:46,260
 It's a very good headline. Very strong. That's nice. James, it's good to you.

299
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,540
 Okay. This is another one from that same episode, and it's from Dan Schreiber. Actually,

300
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,620
 you don't need me to tell you that because it will be come very obvious when I read it.

301
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:02,340
 Poland's only official ghost hunter thinks ghosts have given up haunting humans because we're too

302
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:11,780
 skeptical. Now, Finley, Tyson, Carter, that is your fact. Yes. Use the word fact very loosely.

303
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:17,380
 Now, you know who told me this fact, James Harkin. You did. In that case, it's a great fact.

304
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,580
 I begged you to let me do it. I got in contact with the Polish ghost hunter.

305
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,300
 We had a few emails together. As the emails went on, he kept changing my name to something

306
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,020
 just more familiar. It was like Daniel first, and then he was like, "Hi, Danny."

307
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:47,380
 We do. This is going out to Beverly Hart. Fallout from the Cold War has been used to solve murders.

308
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:57,620
 Interesting. We don't remember how. Yeah, I wonder how. It was because there was nuclear testing

309
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:05,060
 in the Cold War. That caused a big spike in carbon-14. I think everyone had it in them,

310
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,220
 and then eventually they banned weapons testing. Then it declined again to the amount of carbon-14.

311
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:14,580
 Around the place. So it's basically carbon dating. It's basically just how when this murder happened.

312
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:22,420
 All right. Well, there we go. Hope you are happy with your facts. Once again, Spoony, Lizzy,
