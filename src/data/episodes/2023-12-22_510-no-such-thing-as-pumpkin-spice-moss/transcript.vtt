00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Soho Theater in London!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 and we are into Murray and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 with our four favourite Christmas facts for our Christmas special,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 and in no particular order, here we go!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 My fact this week is that when concocting its pumpkin spice latte flavour,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Starbucks tried various ratios of pumpkin to spice,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 before eventually settling on 100% spice, 0% pumpkin.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Was there a big pumpkin tax that they were trying to avoid?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Come on James, you're an apolitical podcast.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 I think I've just saw a sign for pumpkin spice latte the other day

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 and realised I've got no clue what it is.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 And I still haven't had one, by the way.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 I think we established that none of us have ever tried it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 I've had one.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Has anyone else in the room never had a pumpkin spice anything?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Wait, has anyone ever had one?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Not many people.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Well, it's not the sensation that it claims.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 That's too 50 minutes on how popular it is.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 For something that not many people have had,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 I'm shocked that you're not asking me for the experience,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 for where did I have it, how was it?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 I wanted to be a surprise.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Let's move on.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 So Starbucks, they're a coffee selling company

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 and they were looking for a new kind of holiday PR thing

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 in about 2003, holiday flavour.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 And they set up a sort of testing room,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 I think they called it a lab, a coffee lab.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 They called it a liquid lab.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 A liquid lab, yes.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 And they sampled lots of different drinks.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 And they had 100 ideas for new autumn drinks,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 fall drinks.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 People in America can listen to this show as well,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 a lot of them do.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 And if you're listening in America,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 just sit back and feel right at home.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Exactly, because we're talking about the fall.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 And they said, they realised at the time that there was,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 and I quote, nothing around pumpkin in the market.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 And so they thought, let's come up with a pumpkin spice,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 pumpkin pie, which is obviously a Thanksgiving thing in America.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 And so they thought, okay, let's create a pumpkin flavour

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 with the spices that come with pumpkin pie.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 And they just tested a high pumpkin, low spice option,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 high spice, low pumpkin option.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 And then they settled on zero pumpkin,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 because pumpkin does not taste of anything.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And what it is, it's like what cinnamon, nutmeg,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 clove, soldos kind of Christmas.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Those are the spices that go with pumpkin.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 But they did massively popularise it.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 I bet you wouldn't have heard of pumpkin spice in 2002.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Oh, it was huge, wasn't it?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Like Starbucks particularly, those fans is a secret society

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 of pumpkin spice lovers.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 It's the PSL.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 How secret?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 What infiltration work have you done to find out there's a secret?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 I reckon you'd be able to tell, if there was one in this room,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 I reckon we'd be able to smell it, put it that way.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 But people really went into it, so the secret society,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 you basically, when you joined it, they gave you a sort of,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 you know, the cardboard slip that comes over a coffee.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 It was a sort of woolly version of it, and it was orange,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 and so you got that as part of the society.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 There was a Twitter account that had 120,000 followers.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 That was 2015, but I checked it today,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 and they've now gone down to 85,000 followers.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 And the tweets have gone private, so something...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 The tweets weren't even private.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 The secret society.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 It had public tweets.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 I don't know what's happened, but something's gone on.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 I'm a member of some pretty niche societies,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 but that is very niche.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Well, 2015 was a huge year for pumpkin spice flavour,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 because we should say that was the year that they did add pumpkin

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 due to public outcry.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 So there is pumpkin in it now,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 because there were various people who spotted that there was no pumpkin in it before.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 I believe there was a blogger called Food Babe,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 who she wrote an article about all the ingredients in Starbucks stuff,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 and it was meant to be an article about the fact that they were unethical

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 or unhealthy and stuff, but she added on the end.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 And also, there's no pumpkin in pumpkin spice lattes,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 and they hit on that and added pumpkin.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Okay.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 It has spread to everything now, mostly in America,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 but there's quite a bit over here as well.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 There are pumpkin spice, hummus, pumpkin spice salad,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 pumpkin spice butter, pumpkin spice peanut butter.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Peanut butter already has a flavour.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Peanuts.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Pumpkin spice water, wallpaper, toilet spray.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Wallpaper.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 I'm afraid there are...

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 There's a thing called "dude wipes",

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 which are male-pitched wet wipes.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Okay.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 I'm really sorry to announce they're called "dumpkin spice".

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Okay.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 There's pumpkin spice spam as well that you can get.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 And they sort of announced it as a joke.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Yeah, spam announced it as a joke, and it was not real.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 And then the outcry suddenly was there going,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 "But we want it to be real."

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 And so they put it out as a limited series,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 because they thought, "Okay, no one's really going to buy it."

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 And everyone bought it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 And for two years, they had this huge selling pumpkin spice spam,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 which no one really liked, but they just wanted it, you know?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 You know, Andy, you can get pumpkin spice moss.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 No.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Really? Wait.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Those of you who haven't been here before, Andy, is very much into his moss.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Yeah, I like moss, yeah.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 What are those secret societies we were talking about earlier?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 It's not officially that,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 but in Jamaica, you can buy Irish moss, which is an aphrodisiac,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 and it comes spiced with vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 So, to all intents and purposes, it's pumpkin spiced.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 I believe, isn't that...

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 What kind of moss is it called again?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Okay, it's not real moss. It's not technically moss, is it?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 It's algae, yes.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Sorry, just the last newsletter was quite big on that kind of stuff.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 I was reading some psychology about why pumpkin spice is so popular.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 As we've established, it isn't, but let's go with it is.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Apparently, scarcity is one of the main reasons

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 that you can only get it in the fall.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Did I do that right, Anna, yeah?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Yeah, but I need to question your pronunciation of scarcity.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Apparently, because you can only get it in the autumn and in the winter,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 it makes people desire it more.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Also, a lot of the ingredients are aphrodisiacs,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 supposedly.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 What?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Oh, the spices?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Yeah, so cinnamon is known to relax muscles

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 and increase sexual desire.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 It's been used in Indian traditional medicine for a long time for that.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Nutmeg, there's been one study on rats

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 that found that if you give it to rats...

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 What? Have you given them nutmeg?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 You're not picky, are you, James?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 I'll tell you what, I was chasing them around that maze for a long time.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Apparently, if you give a rat nutmeg,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 they have increased number of mounting episodes.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 Mounting episodes?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 Wow.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Nutmeg used to be so popular that people would carry it around with them,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 and they would carry their own nutmeg graters.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 This was in the Victorian times.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 And Charles Sackfield, the sixth Earl of Dorset,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 used to just eat spoonfuls of nutmeg,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 which you shouldn't do because it is poisonous if you have too much of it.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 But he did it, and he had so much one evening

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 that he was imprisoned after running up and down all night,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 almost naked, through the street in a nutmeg frenzy.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Wow.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 So pumpkin spice, I have a few issues with it,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 and the things it's been included in.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Mostly dog-based things.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 So it's in dog brew,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 which is a kind of doggy beer, non-alcoholic dog beer,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 because I guess you shouldn't give dogs alcohol.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Doggy donuts, dog biscuits.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 They all come in pumpkin spice flavour.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 And this just reminded me of the fact

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 that there's a shitload of human food that has dog versions now.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Have you seen?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Dog ice cream? Have you not seen dog ice cream?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 No.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 So in Aldi, you get dog ice cream for dogs that you feed dogs.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 It's literally everywhere.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 There's a cool dog vegan ice cream

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 that costs £120 for a tub of it.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 To be fair, a five-litre tub.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 The mouth has changed.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 But is it non-dairy,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 because dogs can't have dairy, right?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 This one is non-dairy because it's vegan,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 and that's one of the things they say,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 is dogs are lactose intolerant.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Therefore, we've made our dog ice cream dairy-free.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Well, hang on, if they're not allowed dairy,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 and there's dairy-free ice cream for dogs,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 what's a Pappuccino?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Because I saw someone order a Pappuccino in front of me

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 in a coffee shop.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 OK, for a dog? Yeah, for a dog.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Right, so you do know of this phenomenon.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Pappuccino sounds like it's a dog cat.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 I sort of thought that was a, like,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 a horrific isolated outbreak of that kind of thing.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 Well, did the guy or the person behind the count

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 go, "What the fuck are you talking about?"

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Or did they give them something?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Because it's not isolated.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Well, they might have misheard cappuccino

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 and just given them a cappuccino,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 because I frequently say, "Can I have a cappatee?"

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 and they say, "Cappuccino," and I say, "No, cappatee."

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Well, that happens to me on a few times a year.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Well, your accent is so hard to understand, isn't it, Andy?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Can I have a cappatee?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Well, you know, the dog, the company

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 that comes up with these ridiculous ice creams

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 is called Don Thor,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 which is quite nice for an ice cream inventing guy.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 But still, I hate him.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Pumpkin Spice is...

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 So it began to be, you know,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 a global phenomena when Starbucks started doing it,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 but it is old, isn't it?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 I mean, it appears in America's first-ever cookbook.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 There was a lady

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 who was called Amelia Simmons,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 and she wrote this book in 1796,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 and it has this recipe in it.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 And it was a pretty amazing cookbook,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 because on it, it says, "Buy Amelia Simmons,"

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 but then underneath, it says, "American Orphan,"

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 and there was this whole thing about being an orphan in it

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 and needing to know how to cook for when you have to move,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 even as an adult, you know, into new places

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 and be the person who is now going to provide food

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 for a new family that you're living for.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 So it's really odd.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 The first-ever American cookbook was basically designed

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 for women and orphans as the mains rushed.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 Yeah, it was the main thrush.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 The main thrust.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 That was one of the recipes, wasn't it?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 The main thrush.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 What's the mains thrush?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 We're going to have to move on in a second.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Can I tell you about a quick food promotion?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 This was about how you can make stuff popular.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 OK, I really like this one.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 This is, again, 2003.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 This is the year that Pumpkin Spice Latte was launched.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 There's a seafood chain. They're in the States as well.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 They're called Red Lobster,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 and they had about 700 restaurants at this time,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 and they thought, "We need to get more punters in."

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 So they launched a promotion which was called Endless Crab.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 And you could order as much crab, snow crab,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 there's a kind of crab, as you want, for $23.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 And they assumed most people would have one or two plates

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 of this crab, and boy, did they assume wrong.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Because as soon as someone ordered three plates of crab,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 the restaurant was making a loss.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 And the problem is, people were turning up

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 and ordering Endless Crab, basically,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 as it was perfectly their right to do.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 It's those crabs with really long legs, though, isn't it?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Yeah. So it's just a very cumbersome process to eat.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 You end up bleeding all over the dish.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Do you? Yeah, you cut your fingers.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 I've been to one of these restaurants where you eat lobster and crab,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 and I remember there was a dish full of blood in the end.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Red Lobster was just called Lobster.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 But basically, people were coming in,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 filling up the entire restaurant, ordering crab.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 They're not leaving for four hours, because it takes so long to eat.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 So no other punters were getting in toward any non-crab dishes.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 I think they lost half a billion dollars,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 their parent company.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 I know, billion.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 This year, they introduced Ultimate Endless Shrimp,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 and they had almost exactly the same problem all over again.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Oh, my God.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 There was a restaurant in Chicago which had an all-you-can-eat thing,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 and a woman sat down at a table with a bunch of friends who were like six of them,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 and she ordered the all-you-can-eat pancakes,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 and the other said, "No, we'll just have some water, please."

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 And they all let all of her pancakes,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 and they kept getting more pancakes, and people just kept eating them,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 and the police were called eventually.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 What? The police were called?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Because they refused to leave, and they were like,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 "Well, we're going to have to call the police."

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 They were like, "We want more pancakes!"

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 Oh, my God. I read one that this just happened recently.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 There's a new McDonald's burger, which is the McCrispy,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 and in Cornwall, they were forced to take down a poster

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 because they'd accidentally put it up right opposite a crematorium.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Nice.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Oh, gosh, okay.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 That just felt a bit...

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 Hey, grief can make you hungry.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Smart move.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 My fact is that when making sherry,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 it is important that you leave space for two fists inside your bunghole.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 So, the fortify...

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Making sherry what? Making her happy?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 No.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 Guys, come on, let's be serious for a bit.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Let's just have a nice...

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Cherry grows in... grows in...

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 Cherry grows...

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 ...grows on trees, doesn't it?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 All sort of, like, wine bushes.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Vines, if you like.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 Are you okay, Andy?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Yeah, I'm fine.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 I feel weirdly calm in the...

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 I feel like I'm in the eye of the storm,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 and everything's happening around me,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 and everything's all right.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 And I know I'm not all right, so...

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Sherry.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Can you tell us what your bunghole is?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Sherry is a drink.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 It grows in Spain.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 It's made in Spain.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 In a place genuinely called the Sherry Triangle.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Pretty cool. Very cool.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 This sort of region where the soil is amazing,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 and it has very chalky soil,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 and it's absolutely perfect for growing the grapes that make sherry,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 and it is matured in casks.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 You take the grapes, you press them,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 you leave the pressings, then it is must.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 They ferment, and then they go into barrels,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 and they are aged for ages in the barrels,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 and, you know, that's where the flavours mature.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 And so they go into these...

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 They're called butts. They're sherry butts,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 which are 500 litres, is one butt.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And obviously, you need access to the butt,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 so you need a bunghole.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 You know, so you drill a hole,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 and you put the bung in, the bunghole,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 and then you...

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 The point...

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 The point is that I am fine.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Some sherrys, dry sherrys,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 they have this layer that grows on the top.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 It's called floor, and it's a layer of different kinds of yeast,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 and it really contributes to the flavour.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 And so you want to let the floor grow.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 You need to leave space on top of the wine.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 So, traditionally, you leave two spaces,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 two fists worth of space, on the inside of the barrel,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 below the bunghole.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And that's it. That's all it is.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 So it's enough it's do a fisting.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 That's all the material I've got.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Do you know what an escafina is?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Escafina, no. Escafina.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Yeah, I looked into... There's a glossary.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 It's the tool that they use.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 It's a semicircular tool used to remove splinters

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 on the inside of the butt caused by drilling the bungholes.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 So that is the tools that we use.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 That's very cool. Yeah.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 There are loads of... There's so much, like, cool terminology.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 They have the special tools designed to, like,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 extract a sample from the middle of the barrel,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 which is where you want to be tasting it,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 and they have this amazing stacking system as well.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 It's like a pyramid. The new barrels go on top,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 and then gradually you transfer the sherry down bit by bit.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 But that means that the sherry's always mingling with newer and older stuff.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 And there are some of these systems. They're called soleras.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Some of them are more than 100 years old.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 You know, there will be fractions of tiny droplets,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 which are more than 100 years old with that barrel system, I think,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 which is why we're really remaining in there, which is cool.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 And the weird thing about the sherry system that I didn't know

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 is, well, let me see if you know.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 So if I'm in a restaurant, I order a sherry, and they say...

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 No, sorry, madam. You're under 80 years old.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 You can't do that. That's not normal.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 It's making a comeback, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 But you say, "Oh, what vintage is that?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 What year is that sherry from?"

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 What's wrong with what I've just said?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Vintage. From no year.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 From no year. Exactly.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 How's that right? Talk to me, Dan.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 It's a time-travelling barrel.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Stop talking to me.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 No, cos it's been going through this pyramid system.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Exactly. So it's not from one year, it's from a range of...

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 It's all mixed up. I didn't realise this at all.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 So it's from lots of different years, each sherry.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 And the solera system is like the mixing up of different vintages.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 And apparently, the older wine matures the younger wine,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 and the younger wine keeps the older wine fresh and vigorous.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 OK. So once you've got your sherry, you put it in a barrel,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 you can improve it by sending it round the world.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 And this is something that, again, is making a comeback.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 So quite recently, there has been a ship

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 called the Juan Sebastián del Cano,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 where they've sent a barrel around the world.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 And when it comes back, it's going to be tastier, apparently.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 It's all the sloshing around.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 It's known as Mariedos sherry, which is seasick sherry.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 And apparently, cos it sloshes around all that time, it tastes way better.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Isn't it amazing that, like, that's the theory, but we don't know.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 So they just go, like, everyone reports that this makes it better.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 It must be the swaying of the boat as you go along.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 Absolutely. And back in the day, they used to do this all the time.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 And whenever anyone would go on the round the world,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 they would take some sherry with them.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 And you would put it on the boat, and when it came back,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 it'd be worth five times more than when you left it.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Really? Yeah. So you could sell it for five times more.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 So as long as you put enough on there,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 it was worth it to sail it all the way around the world to make that money.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 That's very cool. Couldn't you just, like, employ an intern

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 to knock it over and pick it up most of the time?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 It's not quite as romantic, is it?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 Yeah. Like, this has been interned.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 I was going to know the difference.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 But Magellan, when he went around the world,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 he brought way more sherry than he did actual armory

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 to protect the people on his boats.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 20% of the funds that were spent on the things brought onto the boat

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 were for exclusively sherry.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 To be fair, he wasn't meant to be declaring war on anyone.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 No, but it did get him into a situation where on the day that he died,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 he did have to bring in a group of people on the island

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 in order to make up the missing armory, basically.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 And then he died in the subsequent attack.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 So they say sherry very slightly was involved in his demise as a result.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 But he brought on 203 butts barrels of sherry,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 which is equivalent of 243,000 litres.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 That's what they had for these trips.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Wow. That's amazing.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Another person who sailed with a lot of sherry was Sir Francis Drake.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 So after he attacked Cadiz,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 known as the singeing of the King of Spain's beard,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 you might know about it, it's like around the time of the Spanish Armada and stuff,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 he came back with a load of sherry barrels.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 In fact, he came back with 2,900 casks of the stuff.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 And that began something called the sherry craze in Britain

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 because they suddenly had all this sherry,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 all the rich people in the country could drink it.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 They'd never had it before and it became really, really popular.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 And the really interesting thing about that is after a little while

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 had a lot of empty sherry barrels because they drank it all.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 So what did they do with that?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 They started putting alcohol in there in Scotland.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 They gave it more flavour and we invented whisky.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 So whisky came from sherry. Hooray!

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Yeah!

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 And that's how you make whisky.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 But there's a huge problem, which is that sherry became really unpopular.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 It's sort of the sales absolutely cratered in the 80s.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 And as a result, they were making a fifth of the sherry they used to.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 And it's not shipped in barrels anymore.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 So what do you do for the whisky?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 You can't make whisky anymore if you don't have the sherry

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 and it's not being made and even if it is made, it's not in the barrels.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 So now, sherry makers are filling barrels with sherry just to flavour the barrel.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 No.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 What, and then just tipping it into the ocean?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Pretty much.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 Like I've got space in my house.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 Have you got space for a million litres of sherry?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 You know what?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 I'll find room.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 But some sherry makers make a million litres of sherry to season whisky casks.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 No.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 I'm sure they find it used for the sherry but that's why they're doing it.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Because there are a billion litres of Scotch exported from Scotland every year.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 It's a massive trade.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 So, yeah.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 I like...So sherry's a fortified wine, basically.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 And I like the fact that you make fortified wine by adding wine to wine.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 It's just double wine.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 It's just like you and a knight.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 I'm fortifying the wine gradually.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 I guess, because I'm always a bit confused about how you make all these things that are so related to the grape.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 But basically, you get the wine from this region of Spain and you make it in a certain way that they make it.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 And then you add brandy to it.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 And all brandy is distilled wine, i.e. wine where they've removed as much of the liquid as possible and left the distilled alcohol.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 And so you just chuck that in.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 So sherry is just wine plus wine.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 And it's good because wine, I didn't realise, has a maximum possible strength.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Really?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 You know, I'd never questioned why, you know, wine hovers around the 13, 14% can never quite crack above into 15, 16.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 Why not?

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 That's probably Anna turning around every single bottle on this huge supermarket aisle.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 There will be one, there will be one 15.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 You're right, because like 14 is a horrifically strong wine to me.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Absolutely.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 And I like a nice, you know, 10 or 11.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 Something a bit watered down, yeah.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 Please, you're drinking the 0.5% beers.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 But yeah, it actually can't survive if the alcohol concentration gets too high.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 So wine is made by having yeast convert the sugar.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 So it's made by fermentation where yeast converts the sugars.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 But yeast dies in a certain concentration of alcohol.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 So awfully, it's killed by the thing it creates.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 It creates ethanol and then it's killed by it if it gets above 16%.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 And so that's why we need things like sherry and brandy, because they are able to exist above the 16% hurdle.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 I was reading the Australian Dictionary of Slang about the word bung, because this was about bung holes.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 And it says, bung is a term which may refer to two very separate things.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 It may be the hole in the barrel where beer is poured from, or it may also be an anus.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 So I'm going to give you some bung phrases.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 And you have to decide whether the bung in the phrase refers to the barrel or the anus.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Great. OK.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 OK, so bung juice.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Is bung juice a slang word where the bung part refers to an anus or a barrel?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 Now, I think I've got a bit of inside knowledge here, because I think...

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 I think it's the barrel, because I think there is a thing called bung hole sniffing,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 where you're testing the whisky by just giving the barrel a quick sniff,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 and it's permeated through it.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 So I'm going to say barrel.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Yeah, how we all in agreement.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 I'm going to go with Andy the expert on bung holes, yeah.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 No, you're right. Bung juice just means beer, it's another word.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 OK, OK.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 To hit the bung.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Shake your territory here.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 What country did you say?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Australia.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Come on, mate, let's hit the bung.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 It's... Oh, mate, you hit the bung hard last night.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 OK.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 It's amazing seeing you pretend to be the thing you actually are, Australia.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 I'm going to say it is, again, a wine thing.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Yeah, you're right, it means to get drunk, just to go out.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Hit the bung, hit the bung.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 It's very nice. Bung ball. Bung ball.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Bung ball. That's got to be anal.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 It's...

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Oh, yes.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 What, no, I think it's wine.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Yes, weirdly, I read about a mythological creature

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 that seeks out the bung ball,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 and it's where it's believed the soul is kept.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 It's a little ball inside the anus

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 that this beast comes to eat.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 What are you talking about?

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Is this real?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 Yeah, it's a... It's the whole what James has on his face.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 There's a mythological creature that eats the bung-hole soul ball

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 that's in our anuses.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 No.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 Australia.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 It's a legend in Australia.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 Very different to the classical ancient Greece.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 A horse with wings.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Australia is going to win your bung ball, mate.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 No, it's a dance run by someone who runs a pub.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Brilliant.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 A bung ball.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 A bung ball.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 They've all been beers so far, or...

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Well, I didn't want to go, you know.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 Fair enough.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 There's been a period where rude words have been allowed

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 to be added to the names of wines now.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 So, for example, before 2001,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 the word "bitch" was never used on a bottle of wine before.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Since then, in the subsequent seven years,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 there's been 65 wines that all have that as part of their name,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 and words like "ass" and "asshole".

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Does that say "allowed" by the government of the wine government?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Are there international wine authorities?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 I think there's in one country...

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Is it here, for example, in the UK?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Yeah, there is a governing body that allows people to say,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 "Yeah, it will be for certain countries."

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 And call it "bitch" to its wine now.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 Yeah.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 Nice.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 There's never going to be a 15% wine.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 That is interesting.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 APPLAUSE

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 OK, it is time for fact number three,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 and that is James.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 OK, my fact this week is that the 1894

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 Baltimore Orioles baseball team

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 had a superstition in which every player

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 would drink a glass of gravy before every match.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 Wow.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 So, this is from a book called "Field of Magic",

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 and it's a book all about different superstitions.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 And yeah, I just thought it was strange

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 and a very Christmassy gravy.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 The Orioles were, they were, like, quite a good team at the time.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 They were quite a dirty team.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 A lot of people thought that they had very good team morale

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 and they were a good team together,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 and apparently one of the reasons was they would drink

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 a glass of turkey gravy before batting practice on game days.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Was that one of the reasons why they were a dirty team?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Had they all thrown up gravy down my front?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Yeah, what's a dirty team?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 Are they cheating or are they...

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 They would put soap around the mounds

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 so that if an opposing pitcher was trying to get their hands nice

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 and slippery, or, sorry, to dry them in the dirt,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 it would get slippery instead.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 And so they did just little psychological things to...

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 Wait, so as a pitcher, you want to have, just to explain,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 pitcher, you want to have hands that are dried in the dirt?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 Yeah, well, you want to throw with precision, right?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 So you want your hands as dry as possible and not sweaty.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 You want grip.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Because spitting on balls, obviously, in other related sports,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 can be an advantage.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Spitting on baseballs was a thing as well, wasn't it, spitballs?

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 And the idea was you would normally have a good grip on them,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 but with the spitball, they might go in a really weird direction

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 when they flew through the air. They became quite dangerous

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 and they got banned because someone actually died, I think,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 when they got hit by a spitball. Get out. Yeah, yeah.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 Before we get into the... They blamed the spit for that!

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Like, surely, that's the very outermost layer

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 of a hard baseball travelling through the air first.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 What are they otherwise going to do, just use foam?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 No, I know, I know. I just think that's, like, blame the ball.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 No, I completely agree.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 I think it's all very questionable whether these things

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 make that much of a difference to the ball.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 You know in cricket where it's cloudy and so people go,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 "Oh, it's cloudy, the ball's going to move around a lot today."

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Or, I don't know, you know, it's a little bit of a fog.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 It's like, "Oh, the ball's going to swing to the left constantly."

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 And no one actually... I think a lot of these things have not been proven

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 and no one can actually say why.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 They've got to talk about something for five days.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 I'll tell you a thing about gravy.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 Oh, yeah? Yeah.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 This is a story about an elderly lady in Scotland,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 in West Dunbartonshire, right? This is three years ago, 2020.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 Her family, she was, I think, in her 80s,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 they were tidying up her house.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 She was still around, but she was just having it clear out.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 And they threw away some old Bisto tins, right?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 Like, a load of clutter in the kitchen, a load of old Bisto tins.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Chuckle them out.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 She had hidden her life savings of £20,000 in cash.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Oh, not in gravy.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 No, and she'd hidden 20 grand in the Bisto tins of her family.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 There was a happy ending.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 They went to the recycling centre

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 and two absolute heroes who worked there

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 searched for two hours through all the chucked-away bags,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 and they found the tins.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 She got it back. Thank God.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 Listen, guys, you don't need to applaud the recycling workers.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 Also, two hours.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 That wasn't 48 hours.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 You know what Bisto is called? Bisto.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 I actually don't. Bisto.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Bisto, I... Cos you bestow it on...

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 Well, your daughter, if she hadn't chucked it out, for instance.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 That's a great answer, but it's wrong.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Well, it sort of rhymes with bliss, a bit, not quite the first time.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Bliss, though. Like, I thought it was an ad campaign.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 A bit of the word rhymes with bliss.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 I thought there was an ad campaign

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 which used the word bliss and Bisto together.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 There might have been. There was quite a lot of ad campaigns,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 but that wasn't... No, no.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 It is an acronym for Browns, Seasons and Thickens, all in one.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Oh. Is that cool? Sorry, but that doesn't...

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Well, I added some extra words in.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Browns, Seasons, Thickens in one.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Where's the "I"?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Bisto. Bisto.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 The "in" one, the "in" has been taken

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 and moved to earlier in the acronym.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 Right, so we should call it Bisto-y.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 Well, there's an ad in there as well.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Steve.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Bissatio. Bissatio.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Bissatio.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 These guys don't know what they're doing. They're drunk on gravy.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 They probably changed it to what it became,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 cos they were like, "This is getting nothing like the word bliss."

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 What will we do?

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 A gravy train. Yeah.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 That's a phrase. Yes.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Found myself looking for whether there was ever an actual gravy train.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 Yeah. Doesn't appear so.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 Wow.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 We don't know why we say gravy train.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 We don't know why it's a train.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 And gravy obviously is slang for something that's like easily won.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 Hence the reason we say gravy train.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 But why train?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 And apparently there was a writer who theorised that

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 it was actually a mishearing.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 And he wrote that since "gravid" means laden with eggs,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 a "gravid rain" would imply a fall of eggs.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 So gravy train is probably a mishearing of "gravid rain".

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 What a disgusting sounding.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 The eggs raining down on you.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Wow.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 We don't think that's where it comes from.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 No.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 I was looking at...

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 What is gravy but the juices of meat?

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 So I was...

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Right?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 Thank you, Slavoj Cizek.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 Yeah, it sounds like a sort of philosophical paper

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 that you've been working on for 12 years.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 Yeah, no, I'm building it up.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 Yeah.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 I mean, gravy is just the juices of meat

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 and then you thicken it, right, by chucking in a thickener.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Exactly, cornflour.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 And so, you know, when you get rare meat and it's red,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 why is it red? Blood?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Yeah, it's all that.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 What's not blood, is it?

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Meat juice.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 Meat juice.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 It's... Thank you from backstage.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 Sinister heckle.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Because it sounded like it came from behind...

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Is it you who said it?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Have you been there the whole show?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 I'm so sorry, you've got the worst view in the house.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 I'm so sorry.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 It's just got a view of my bunk.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 Oh, yeah, you've got to be...

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 Well, thank you for quietly and cynically murmuring,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 "Meat juice".

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 That was amazing.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 I thought this was interesting.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 When people say, "Is that meat really nice and bloody?"

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 It's got nothing to do with blood,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 the redness of rare meat and the juices,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 the red juices that squeeze out of it.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 So, it's from myoglobin.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 So, it's from the muscle.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 And myoglobin is the protein that transports oxygen through muscles,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 like hemoglobin transports it around our body.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 And similarly, like with hemoglobin, the reason that's red,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 when myoglobin is exposed to oxygen, it goes red.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 So, it's just this protein in the muscles that goes red

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 when you cut into meat.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 When it's sitting inside the meat, it's not red at all.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 When it's not exposed to oxygen.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 But then it becomes red.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 It's kind of our fault, in a way.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 We've turned it red.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 The red stuff is there, as in...

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 I think it is indeed our fault, yes.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 The World Gravy Wrestling Championships.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 Gravy Wrestling.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 Gravy Wrestling takes place at the Rosenbowl Pub

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 in Rosendale in Lancashire.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 And the Fire Brigade are always there.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 What?

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 Can't they just use the gravy if there's a fire?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Yeah, deploy the gravy cannon.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Can you guess why they're always there?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 People get stuck.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 No, people don't get stuck. They're covered in gravy.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 You could drown in gravy, so they're sort of like a life rescue.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 I guess the Fire Brigade would do that.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 No, they just...

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 You need a big fire, you need a big flame to make all that gravy.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 No, they just wash down the wrestlers between belts.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 Oh!

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 Very good.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 They specifically say that if you're a pro wrestler,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 you shouldn't take parks, because it's just for fun.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 It's like the people who win it are the people who have the best outfits

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 and who have the best style and stuff like that.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 There was a professional wrestler called Tommy Jupiter who went and did it.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Can you tell what the difference between pro wrestling and gravy wrestling is?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 What's the biggest problem, perhaps, with gravy wrestling?

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Boiling water.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Boiling water is not boiling hot gravy.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 I should say it's cold gravy.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 Another year of third-degree burns at the gravy wrestling championships.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 Shall we go cold makeshift?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 No, no.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Apparently, you can't get grip on people,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 but also it gets into your eyes and your ears,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 and you can't see or hear anything,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 and you just end up flailing around the whole time.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 So, was this the pro wrestler's excuse for losing?

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Can I just quickly ask the room?

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Those of you here who are millennial or Gen Z,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 if you know what roughly age group you're in, can you give me a chair?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 And those who are, I know it's a slightly younger crowd,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 so those who are over 50, give us a chair.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 Okay, right, so the first lot,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 if you like gravy of the millennials or Gen Z lot, give us a chair.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 Okay, that's completely ruined my fact, thank you.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 And the slightly older group, the fifties and over,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 if you like gravy, give me a chair.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Okay, right, that's...

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Okay, now let's hear the fact.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 The words I've got written down are,

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 "Young people don't like gravy anymore."

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Not in this room.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 This room is the absolute nexus of young gravy lovers.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 It doesn't surprise me that our fans are weirdo outliers.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 So I'll give anything.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 If we ask millennials or Gen Z,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 give us a chair if you like Sherry.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 See, I told you, weirdo outliers.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 I was reading a lot of surveys about gravy

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 and about who likes it and who doesn't, and I did read...

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 Okay, just listen to this, I'm quite indirectly right.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 British people are so obsessed with gravy

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 that they drink it through straws, take it on holiday,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 and even pour it over pizza and pasta.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 This is a poll of 2,000 adults

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 that found that 13% of people eat it in the car,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 11% carry it in a flask,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 and 14% take it on holiday with them.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 And this happens to be a survey commissioned by Schwartz Gravy.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 Claudia Winkelman uses it to tan.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 Gravy, really? Yeah.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 She does what she used to.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 I think now she has someone else who sprays tan on her.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 But yeah, when she was at uni...

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 What did she use? Like, painted on?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 Well, you know, all she did was she told women's hour

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 that she used gravy granules to generate her tan,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 her fake tan at uni, when she first got obsessed with tanning.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 Didn't they do that in the while when they didn't have stockings?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 They did. Yeah, darkened their legs with gravy, wartime thing.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 But I don't think...

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 I don't think it was even Second World War

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 when Claudia Winkelman was at uni.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 and that is my fact.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 My fact this week is that every year,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 on November 29th,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 people in the Netherlands put a pancake on their head.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 It's just a thing they do in the lead-up to the Christmas period.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 It's what day is it today?

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 They get the pancakes out, and they just plop it on their head.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 Is this everyone?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 Like, if you watch the news, are they all wearing pancakes?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Exactly.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 Is it like a poppy, and if you don't wear it on TV,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 then people really kick in?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 It's a bloody pancake. It's so disrespectful.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 Yeah, this is a growing trend.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 Basically, this erupted off the back of a cartoon

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 that was published in 1986,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 where, in the cartoon, pancakes are put on their...

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 There's a long convoluted story,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 but the basic premise is a joke is made,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 a pancake is put on a head,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 and it kind of just got picked up by people in the Netherlands,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 and slowly, in the subsequent, what?

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 You know, 30-ish years,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 people are now doing it to the point that

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 I've asked three people from the Netherlands,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 they go, "Yeah, yeah, we do that."

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 So, effectively, in the cartoon,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 for one of the reasons that it was used

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 is that it's very cold in late November,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 and if you have a bald head or even a bald spot,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 you can use the pancake as effectively...

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 No, not a reason. OK.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Not the reason they're doing it.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Not in the post-hat world.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 No, yeah.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 You're right. Before the invention of the hat,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 and it is correct, this would be plausible.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 Absolutely fair enough to know.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 But you can't eat your hat afterwards, can you?

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 No, that's where the phrase comes from, doesn't it?

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 I mean, that's from when the hats were pancakes.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 I'm sorry, I should have properly researched this.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Made-up story from a comic book.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 Don't start where you can't finish, all right?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 We've got more questions about this. OK, keep going.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Do the pancakes end up being eaten, or are they disposed of?

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 No, I think... Oh, God, yeah.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 Do you eat your own pancake, or is it like you...

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 You see someone... What?

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 Do you think that's a bit sexy?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 You see someone else's pancake?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 Well, you see someone else's pancake.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 And they've got a nice pancake on their head.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 It gets to 11.59, and you're like, "Oh, look at your lips."

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 Boy, you're both upside down, eating each other's pancakes, you know?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 Well, you'd think, given I'd spoke to three people who do this,

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 I would have asked more questions than just,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 "Do you put it on your head?"

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 Yeah, OK, good, thank you, goodbye.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 But that's what happened, I just asked that one question.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 Silly me, what a great question. Do they eat it afterwards?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 I have no idea. I think they do.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 OK, there we go. I believe they do.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 And I think it's just for a photo, isn't it?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 Often, maybe the cheats do it for a photo.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 And no toppings on the pancakes at the time, as far as I can tell.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 Is it the sort of smaller diameter thicker pancakes,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 or is it like the big crepes that you have?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 Oh, that's a great question.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 Like thin or thick pancakes?

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 I think if I had a bald patch, I'd go for the thick, smaller one.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 Yeah, but I've seen the photos, and they're more like the crepes.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 Yeah. Not to be like a yamlka, wouldn't it?

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 Well, that's what I was thinking it was. It was like a winter yamlka, which is...

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 But yeah, no, it's more like the bigger, a bucket hat.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 So they are like the crepe ones, OK, good?

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 Yeah.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 All right.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 Any further?

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 I'm actually not taking any more questions at this time.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 It is quite a niche, and it feels like quite a modern social media-driven tradition, isn't it?

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 Yeah.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 Well, people sharing pictures of themselves.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 And I was looking at kind of weird modern Christmas traditions that grow.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 So in Sweden, I don't think we've mentioned Kalle Anka before,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 which is such a phenomenon.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 So this is the fact that half of people in Sweden on Christmas Eve watch Donald Duck.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 50% of the country.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 Wow.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 Mid-40s percent since, you know, Netflix and stuff.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 But yeah, and it's these Disney short cartoons that's been happening since 1959.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 And I was reading an article by a guy who's going out with a Swedish girl,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 and he spent Christmas with their family, and he said, "It's not at all a light-hearted thing.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 You can not eat or prepare dinner while watching. Everyone sits very quietly and watches."

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 Really?

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 "People plan their Christmas around it, so you've got lunch before Kalle Anka.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 You've got Father Christmas comes after Kalle Anka.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 But when that's on, you've all got to watch."

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 And they've seen it, you know, 40, 50, 60 times before.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 And the biggest complaint scandals in Swedish television come

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 the few times that they suggest cancelling it.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 I think the 1970s, they said they wanted to alter it or cancel it.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 And yeah, huge outcry.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 It's the same cartoon, like five-minute shorts every time.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Yeah.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 Like, "Wow."

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Yeah.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 A series of cartoons.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 That's amazing. What country do you say?

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 In Sweden and also in Denmark, I think they do it as well.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 Wow.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 Is anyone from Sweden or Denmark in the audience?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 And Norway.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 And Norway.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 And so you guys do that?

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 Yeah.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 Wow. Do you like it?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 The first ten times was okay.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 The first ten times was okay.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 There's a guy called Arne Weiss, who is a presenter in Sweden.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 And he was the presenter of the show that kind of hosted it.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 And he said it broke up three of his marriages.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 What?

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 Sorry, wait.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 Again, who would like to take first question on this one?

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Donald Duck.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 Do we know how?

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Like, was he walking around like Donald Duck without any trousers on?

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 And kept bumping into other women.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Wait, him presenting it broke up three of his marriages?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 This feels like a lot of transference by him.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 I think he did drink a lot as well.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 No, no, he had to present it every year.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 And one year he said, "Do you mind if I record it in advance?"

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 Because it is literally the same thing every year.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 Record it in advance and I can spend Christmas with my family.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 And Rumour got out that he wanted to record it in advance.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 And there was genuine proper public outcry.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 The media got hold of it and said, "Absolutely not.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 It has to be live. It has to be Christmas Eve."

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 And Christmas Eve, I think, is a bigger deal on Christmas Day.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 Not those places.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 And it broke up as marriages.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 It's not like we're getting brownie points, if anything.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 No, because it's on the rocks already.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 The wife said, "Get back to your producers and tell them you're not going in this year."

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 He's asked them, he's come back till between his legs.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 And the producer's like...

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 That's, whoa, gosh, poor guy.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 Poor guy?

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 Yeah.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 Spending Christmas with your family is kind of a modern tradition.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 I guess, in this country.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 And apparently spending Christmas with your in-laws

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 can have a detrimental effect on your bowels.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 This is a study in 2016 that collected gut bacteria

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 from people who had spent Christmas in their own family

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 or people who had spent Christmas with their in-laws.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 And they found a significant decrease in the Ruminococcus species

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 in people who visited in-laws.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 And if you don't have as much of this kind of gut bacteria,

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 it's associated with stress, with depression,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 and it can give you very loose bowels.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 Right.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 Is it the stress and depression that causes the bacterial thing?

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 That's what we're thinking, yeah, exactly.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 So it's more stressful and depressing to be?

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 It's more stressful for you because you're with your in-laws,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 you have less of this bacteria, you need to go to the toilet more.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 Right.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 And we're sure it's not just an excuse.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 The scientists writing this, we're visiting their in-laws,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 and they just want to excuse themselves for the 19th time at Christmas.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 Oh, where's Daniel? Oh, it's just the bowel thing.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 You wrote that study, didn't you? Yeah.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 In these papers, the scientists are always really rigorous,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 and they give their, like, caveats in case there's anything.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 They said, "It is possible that participants

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 "with greater aversion towards their in-laws

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 "have used the excuse of participating in a scientific study

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 "addressing Christmas poo

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 "to not visit their in-laws during Christmas."

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 Well, just while I remember, as well as a pumpkin spice latte,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 Starbucks also recently released an olive oil latte,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 and allegedly, if you have it, you may shit yourself.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 So, be near a toilet if you go there.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 Yeah. I mean, with a latte, you're in danger of shitting yourself anyway, right?

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 Exactly. Then put some oil in.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Well, that's the thing, it's like, yeah, the oil loosens you up,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 and the coffee makes you want to go.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 Lubricates. Yeah.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 Sorry, why would anyone order an olive oil latte?

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 That sounds absolutely foul.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 It's much smoother, apparently.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 I mean...

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 I wasn't struggling.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 I wasn't treating it normal latte like it was made of gravel.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 I'd be like...

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 I know I'm not a frontier pioneer kind of guy,

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 but I'm capable of getting to the end of a latte

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 without, you know, lacerating my throat.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 All right, can I tell you about another tradition?

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 Yeah. It's an old tradition, actually.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 This is a very ancient French tradition.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 It's called the Feast of the Ass,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 and it dates back to Grow Up.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 It's also known as the Feast of the Donkey,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 but it's much less funny.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 And it's basically that you take a donkey...

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 Take it where, Andy?

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 You take it to church, actually.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 Do you? Yeah, you take the donkey through the town,

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 and then it's...

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 And then you take it...

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 Well, guys, there's literally everything you say

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 sounds like a useless thing.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 No, I can't...

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 I can't sort of track, I'm in a maze.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 And it is suggestive.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 Often there's someone riding the donkey,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 and it goes into the...

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 I'm just trying to whip through all the innuendo,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 so we can, you know, like...

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 And it stands next to the altar in the church,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 and the priest does the sermon,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 and then at the end of the sermon,

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 the priest and the congregation,

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 they both do a call and response,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 kind of mimicking the donkey's voice.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 They all go...

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 And it's a really fun thing to do.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 It's like a cross-century, so this is...

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 This is as fun as life gets, basically.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 And then you have a raucous party outside,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 and it's basically that old Christmas tradition

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 of inverting normal society.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 Well, a lot of misrule.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 A lot of misrule.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 The bosses are not in charge, the servants are in charge,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 all of that, and it's basically all folded into that.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 Yeah, but that was Christmas for centuries,

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 was not a family affair,

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 it wasn't something sort of pleasant and homely,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 and, like, Christmassy and snugly.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 It was, like, out in the streets,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 there's a whiff of violence and a lot of alcohol.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 And a lot of shagging, I think.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 I seem to have my feet to the ass.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 There were a lot of people...

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 A lot of pancake gone through, yeah.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 I think so.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 West Sailing was another thing they did, wasn't there?

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 Was that it? West Sailing?

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 I don't really know what West Sailing is.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 It's when you go house to house singing,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 basically, and they give you, like,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 some money or some candy or whatever.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 But traditionally, it was...

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 It was, like, over a thousand years old,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 maybe the idea of it.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 And what would happen was the lords of the Manor

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 would be in their house,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 and the local people would go around to their house

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 and would sail, and they'd be given gifts

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 by the Lord of the Manor.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 It's kind of like Christmas trick-or-treating.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 It is, apart from the fact that the gift that they got

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 given was often animal manure.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 Oh!

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 Because in those days, obviously,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 you know, it was good for growing your plants

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 and crops and stuff like that.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 Very hard to wrap, though.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 Yeah.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 Oh, what could it be?

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 Is it maybe the tricycle

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 my little boy's been asking for?

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 You could mold it into deceptive shapes

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 to get people's hopes up.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 Yeah.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 It's very hard to wrap if you've had a dolly by a latte.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 Oh, God.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 I found a few other Dutch traditions.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 So there's this thing that they do in the Netherlands,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 which is they'll take children,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 sort of about ten to ten years old,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 sort of about ten to 13,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 about that sort of age,

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 and they just drop them off

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 in the woods at the middle of the night.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 They just drop them off.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 Is this Hans Lund Gretel you've been reading?

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 It's basically this thing. It's a scout thing

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 where they just get them into a car in the middle of the night.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 They drop them off at the woods, and they just have to find their way back.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 And they say that in the towns, at like 2 to 3 a.m.,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 these kids come stumbling.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 Yeah, it's a genuine tradition.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 Again, I spoke to three people who've done it,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 and I asked one question of them

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 and then hung up.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 And then there's this other amazing thing,

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 which I think is really sweet.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 In the Netherlands, there's this town that's called Margretten,

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 and it has an American cemetery.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 And so there are 8,300 Americans

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 who were buried there from the Second World War.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 And there's a thing that they have there,

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 which is you adopt a grave.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 And so each family goes,

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 and they maintain the grave,

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 and they bring flowers every weekend and so on,

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 and they make sure that the person

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 is being remembered and looked after.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
 Quite a cool tradition.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 Yeah. Do you guys know Elf on the Shelf?

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 Do you know what Elf on the Shelf is?

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 Again, I'm clinging on by my fingernails to Elf on the Shelf.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 I don't really know what it is.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 So it's where you, as a parent,

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 mostly in America, you buy an Elf on the Shelf

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 and you hide it in a different place in the house

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 every day in the Christmas period.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 We do it at home. It's a little stuffed toy elf.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 Yeah, and you put it up and it's like,

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
 "What's he doing up there today?"

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 "What's she hiding in that cupboard for today?"

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 Not, though, that the Elf is watching over you

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 and making sure that you're not naughty.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 That's what I thought it was.

 That's exactly correct, yes.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 So I thought it'd been around forever Elf on the Shelf,

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 but it's based on a 2005 self-published book.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000
 It must be the most successful self-published book ever

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 by a mother and daughter

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 who told this story to each other about these elves

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 that spy on the kids before Christmas

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 and report back to Santa every night,

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 whether they've been naughty or nice,

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 and they fly back in the morning

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 and hide in a different place.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 And, yeah, it's been on the bestseller list

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 every year since 2013,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 which is quite good for a self-published book.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000

 that you sit on your shelf.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 But, yeah, it's caused so much outrage.
