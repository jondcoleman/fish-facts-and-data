00:00:11,00:00:16,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:20,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Soho Theater in London!
00:00:20,00:00:23,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:23,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:27,00:00:31,"and we are into Murray and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around"
00:00:31,00:00:34,"with our four favourite Christmas facts for our Christmas special,"
00:00:34,00:00:38,"and in no particular order, here we go!"
00:00:38,00:00:41,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:00:41,00:00:47,"My fact this week is that when concocting its pumpkin spice latte flavour,"
00:00:47,00:00:51,"Starbucks tried various ratios of pumpkin to spice,"
00:00:51,00:00:58,"before eventually settling on 100% spice, 0% pumpkin."
00:00:58,00:01:04,Was there a big pumpkin tax that they were trying to avoid?
00:01:04,00:01:08,"Come on James, you're an apolitical podcast."
00:01:08,00:01:11,I think I've just saw a sign for pumpkin spice latte the other day
00:01:11,00:01:14,and realised I've got no clue what it is.
00:01:14,00:01:16,"And I still haven't had one, by the way."
00:01:16,00:01:18,I think we established that none of us have ever tried it.
00:01:18,00:01:20,I've had one.
00:01:20,00:01:24,Has anyone else in the room never had a pumpkin spice anything?
00:01:24,00:01:27,"Wait, has anyone ever had one?"
00:01:27,00:01:30,Not many people.
00:01:30,00:01:33,"Well, it's not the sensation that it claims."
00:01:33,00:01:36,That's too 50 minutes on how popular it is.
00:01:36,00:01:39,"For something that not many people have had,"
00:01:39,00:01:41,"I'm shocked that you're not asking me for the experience,"
00:01:41,00:01:44,"for where did I have it, how was it?"
00:01:44,00:01:46,I wanted to be a surprise.
00:01:46,00:01:48,Let's move on.
00:01:48,00:01:51,"So Starbucks, they're a coffee selling company"
00:01:51,00:01:56,and they were looking for a new kind of holiday PR thing
00:01:56,00:01:59,"in about 2003, holiday flavour."
00:01:59,00:02:03,"And they set up a sort of testing room,"
00:02:03,00:02:07,"I think they called it a lab, a coffee lab."
00:02:07,00:02:09,They called it a liquid lab.
00:02:09,00:02:11,"A liquid lab, yes."
00:02:11,00:02:14,And they sampled lots of different drinks.
00:02:14,00:02:18,"And they had 100 ideas for new autumn drinks,"
00:02:18,00:02:20,fall drinks.
00:02:20,00:02:24,"People in America can listen to this show as well,"
00:02:24,00:02:26,a lot of them do.
00:02:26,00:02:28,"And if you're listening in America,"
00:02:28,00:02:30,just sit back and feel right at home.
00:02:30,00:02:33,"Exactly, because we're talking about the fall."
00:02:33,00:02:37,"And they said, they realised at the time that there was,"
00:02:37,00:02:40,"and I quote, nothing around pumpkin in the market."
00:02:40,00:02:43,"And so they thought, let's come up with a pumpkin spice,"
00:02:43,00:02:47,"pumpkin pie, which is obviously a Thanksgiving thing in America."
00:02:47,00:02:51,"And so they thought, okay, let's create a pumpkin flavour"
00:02:51,00:02:54,with the spices that come with pumpkin pie.
00:02:54,00:02:57,"And they just tested a high pumpkin, low spice option,"
00:02:57,00:02:59,"high spice, low pumpkin option."
00:02:59,00:03:01,"And then they settled on zero pumpkin,"
00:03:01,00:03:04,because pumpkin does not taste of anything.
00:03:04,00:03:07,"And what it is, it's like what cinnamon, nutmeg,"
00:03:07,00:03:09,"clove, soldos kind of Christmas."
00:03:09,00:03:12,Those are the spices that go with pumpkin.
00:03:12,00:03:14,But they did massively popularise it.
00:03:14,00:03:17,I bet you wouldn't have heard of pumpkin spice in 2002.
00:03:17,00:03:19,"Oh, it was huge, wasn't it?"
00:03:19,00:03:22,"Like Starbucks particularly, those fans is a secret society"
00:03:22,00:03:24,of pumpkin spice lovers.
00:03:24,00:03:26,It's the PSL.
00:03:26,00:03:28,How secret?
00:03:28,00:03:31,What infiltration work have you done to find out there's a secret?
00:03:31,00:03:33,"I reckon you'd be able to tell, if there was one in this room,"
00:03:33,00:03:36,"I reckon we'd be able to smell it, put it that way."
00:03:36,00:03:38,"But people really went into it, so the secret society,"
00:03:38,00:03:41,"you basically, when you joined it, they gave you a sort of,"
00:03:41,00:03:44,"you know, the cardboard slip that comes over a coffee."
00:03:44,00:03:47,"It was a sort of woolly version of it, and it was orange,"
00:03:47,00:03:49,and so you got that as part of the society.
00:03:49,00:03:52,"There was a Twitter account that had 120,000 followers."
00:03:52,00:03:54,"That was 2015, but I checked it today,"
00:03:54,00:03:57,"and they've now gone down to 85,000 followers."
00:03:57,00:04:00,"And the tweets have gone private, so something..."
00:04:00,00:04:02,The tweets weren't even private.
00:04:02,00:04:04,The secret society.
00:04:04,00:04:06,It had public tweets.
00:04:06,00:04:08,"I don't know what's happened, but something's gone on."
00:04:08,00:04:10,"I'm a member of some pretty niche societies,"
00:04:10,00:04:12,but that is very niche.
00:04:12,00:04:15,"Well, 2015 was a huge year for pumpkin spice flavour,"
00:04:15,00:04:19,because we should say that was the year that they did add pumpkin
00:04:19,00:04:21,due to public outcry.
00:04:21,00:04:23,"So there is pumpkin in it now,"
00:04:23,00:04:27,because there were various people who spotted that there was no pumpkin in it before.
00:04:27,00:04:30,"I believe there was a blogger called Food Babe,"
00:04:30,00:04:33,"who she wrote an article about all the ingredients in Starbucks stuff,"
00:04:33,00:04:36,and it was meant to be an article about the fact that they were unethical
00:04:36,00:04:38,"or unhealthy and stuff, but she added on the end."
00:04:38,00:04:41,"And also, there's no pumpkin in pumpkin spice lattes,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,and they hit on that and added pumpkin.
00:04:43,00:04:45,Okay.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"It has spread to everything now, mostly in America,"
00:04:48,00:04:50,but there's quite a bit over here as well.
00:04:50,00:04:53,"There are pumpkin spice, hummus, pumpkin spice salad,"
00:04:53,00:04:56,"pumpkin spice butter, pumpkin spice peanut butter."
00:04:56,00:04:58,Peanut butter already has a flavour.
00:04:58,00:05:00,Peanuts.
00:05:00,00:05:03,"Pumpkin spice water, wallpaper, toilet spray."
00:05:03,00:05:05,Wallpaper.
00:05:05,00:05:07,I'm afraid there are...
00:05:07,00:05:09,"There's a thing called ""dude wipes"","
00:05:09,00:05:12,which are male-pitched wet wipes.
00:05:12,00:05:14,Okay.
00:05:14,00:05:17,"I'm really sorry to announce they're called ""dumpkin spice""."
00:05:17,00:05:19,Okay.
00:05:19,00:05:22,There's pumpkin spice spam as well that you can get.
00:05:22,00:05:24,And they sort of announced it as a joke.
00:05:24,00:05:27,"Yeah, spam announced it as a joke, and it was not real."
00:05:27,00:05:29,"And then the outcry suddenly was there going,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,"""But we want it to be real."""
00:05:31,00:05:33,"And so they put it out as a limited series,"
00:05:33,00:05:35,"because they thought, ""Okay, no one's really going to buy it."""
00:05:35,00:05:37,And everyone bought it.
00:05:37,00:05:40,"And for two years, they had this huge selling pumpkin spice spam,"
00:05:40,00:05:43,"which no one really liked, but they just wanted it, you know?"
00:05:43,00:05:46,"You know, Andy, you can get pumpkin spice moss."
00:05:46,00:05:48,No.
00:05:48,00:05:50,Really? Wait.
00:05:50,00:05:52,"Those of you who haven't been here before, Andy, is very much into his moss."
00:05:52,00:05:54,"Yeah, I like moss, yeah."
00:05:54,00:05:57,What are those secret societies we were talking about earlier?
00:05:57,00:05:59,"It's not officially that,"
00:05:59,00:06:03,"but in Jamaica, you can buy Irish moss, which is an aphrodisiac,"
00:06:03,00:06:06,"and it comes spiced with vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg."
00:06:06,00:06:09,"So, to all intents and purposes, it's pumpkin spiced."
00:06:09,00:06:11,"I believe, isn't that..."
00:06:11,00:06:13,What kind of moss is it called again?
00:06:13,00:06:15,"Okay, it's not real moss. It's not technically moss, is it?"
00:06:15,00:06:17,"It's algae, yes."
00:06:17,00:06:19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:19,00:06:23,"Sorry, just the last newsletter was quite big on that kind of stuff."
00:06:23,00:06:27,I was reading some psychology about why pumpkin spice is so popular.
00:06:27,00:06:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:29,00:06:31,"As we've established, it isn't, but let's go with it is."
00:06:31,00:06:34,"Apparently, scarcity is one of the main reasons"
00:06:34,00:06:36,that you can only get it in the fall.
00:06:36,00:06:38,"Did I do that right, Anna, yeah?"
00:06:38,00:06:41,"Yeah, but I need to question your pronunciation of scarcity."
00:06:41,00:06:47,"Apparently, because you can only get it in the autumn and in the winter,"
00:06:47,00:06:49,it makes people desire it more.
00:06:49,00:06:52,"Also, a lot of the ingredients are aphrodisiacs,"
00:06:52,00:06:54,supposedly.
00:06:54,00:06:56,What?
00:06:56,00:06:58,"Oh, the spices?"
00:06:58,00:07:01,"Yeah, so cinnamon is known to relax muscles"
00:07:01,00:07:03,and increase sexual desire.
00:07:03,00:07:06,It's been used in Indian traditional medicine for a long time for that.
00:07:06,00:07:09,"Nutmeg, there's been one study on rats"
00:07:09,00:07:12,that found that if you give it to rats...
00:07:12,00:07:14,What? Have you given them nutmeg?
00:07:14,00:07:16,"You're not picky, are you, James?"
00:07:16,00:07:21,"I'll tell you what, I was chasing them around that maze for a long time."
00:07:22,00:07:25,"Apparently, if you give a rat nutmeg,"
00:07:25,00:07:28,they have increased number of mounting episodes.
00:07:28,00:07:30,Mounting episodes?
00:07:30,00:07:32,Wow.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"Nutmeg used to be so popular that people would carry it around with them,"
00:07:35,00:07:38,and they would carry their own nutmeg graters.
00:07:38,00:07:41,This was in the Victorian times.
00:07:41,00:07:44,"And Charles Sackfield, the sixth Earl of Dorset,"
00:07:44,00:07:46,"used to just eat spoonfuls of nutmeg,"
00:07:46,00:07:49,which you shouldn't do because it is poisonous if you have too much of it.
00:07:49,00:07:52,"But he did it, and he had so much one evening"
00:07:52,00:07:55,"that he was imprisoned after running up and down all night,"
00:07:55,00:07:58,"almost naked, through the street in a nutmeg frenzy."
00:07:58,00:08:00,Wow.
00:08:00,00:08:04,"So pumpkin spice, I have a few issues with it,"
00:08:04,00:08:06,and the things it's been included in.
00:08:06,00:08:08,Mostly dog-based things.
00:08:08,00:08:10,"So it's in dog brew,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,"which is a kind of doggy beer, non-alcoholic dog beer,"
00:08:13,00:08:15,because I guess you shouldn't give dogs alcohol.
00:08:15,00:08:17,"Doggy donuts, dog biscuits."
00:08:17,00:08:20,They all come in pumpkin spice flavour.
00:08:20,00:08:23,And this just reminded me of the fact
00:08:23,00:08:27,that there's a shitload of human food that has dog versions now.
00:08:27,00:08:29,Have you seen?
00:08:29,00:08:31,Dog ice cream? Have you not seen dog ice cream?
00:08:31,00:08:33,No.
00:08:33,00:08:36,"So in Aldi, you get dog ice cream for dogs that you feed dogs."
00:08:36,00:08:38,It's literally everywhere.
00:08:38,00:08:40,There's a cool dog vegan ice cream
00:08:40,00:08:43,that costs £120 for a tub of it.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"To be fair, a five-litre tub."
00:08:45,00:08:47,The mouth has changed.
00:08:47,00:08:50,"But is it non-dairy,"
00:08:50,00:08:52,"because dogs can't have dairy, right?"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"This one is non-dairy because it's vegan,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,"and that's one of the things they say,"
00:08:56,00:08:58,is dogs are lactose intolerant.
00:08:58,00:09:00,"Therefore, we've made our dog ice cream dairy-free."
00:09:00,00:09:02,"Well, hang on, if they're not allowed dairy,"
00:09:02,00:09:04,"and there's dairy-free ice cream for dogs,"
00:09:04,00:09:06,what's a Pappuccino?
00:09:06,00:09:08,Because I saw someone order a Pappuccino in front of me
00:09:08,00:09:10,in a coffee shop.
00:09:10,00:09:12,"OK, for a dog? Yeah, for a dog."
00:09:12,00:09:14,"Right, so you do know of this phenomenon."
00:09:14,00:09:16,Pappuccino sounds like it's a dog cat.
00:09:16,00:09:18,"I sort of thought that was a, like,"
00:09:18,00:09:20,a horrific isolated outbreak of that kind of thing.
00:09:20,00:09:22,"Well, did the guy or the person behind the count"
00:09:22,00:09:24,"go, ""What the fuck are you talking about?"""
00:09:24,00:09:26,Or did they give them something?
00:09:26,00:09:28,Because it's not isolated.
00:09:28,00:09:30,"Well, they might have misheard cappuccino"
00:09:30,00:09:32,"and just given them a cappuccino,"
00:09:32,00:09:34,"because I frequently say, ""Can I have a cappatee?"""
00:09:34,00:09:36,"and they say, ""Cappuccino,"" and I say, ""No, cappatee."""
00:09:36,00:09:38,"Well, that happens to me on a few times a year."
00:09:38,00:09:40,"Well, your accent is so hard to understand, isn't it, Andy?"
00:09:40,00:09:42,Can I have a cappatee?
00:09:42,00:09:44,"Well, you know, the dog, the company"
00:09:44,00:09:46,that comes up with these ridiculous ice creams
00:09:46,00:09:48,"is called Don Thor,"
00:09:48,00:09:50,which is quite nice for an ice cream inventing guy.
00:09:50,00:09:52,"But still, I hate him."
00:09:52,00:09:54,(LAUGHTER)
00:09:54,00:09:56,Pumpkin Spice is...
00:09:56,00:09:58,"So it began to be, you know,"
00:09:58,00:10:00,"a global phenomena when Starbucks started doing it,"
00:10:00,00:10:02,"but it is old, isn't it?"
00:10:02,00:10:04,"I mean, it appears in America's first-ever cookbook."
00:10:04,00:10:06,There was a lady
00:10:06,00:10:08,"who was called Amelia Simmons,"
00:10:08,00:10:10,"and she wrote this book in 1796,"
00:10:10,00:10:12,and it has this recipe in it.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"And it was a pretty amazing cookbook,"
00:10:14,00:10:16,"because on it, it says, ""Buy Amelia Simmons,"""
00:10:16,00:10:19,"but then underneath, it says, ""American Orphan,"""
00:10:19,00:10:22,and there was this whole thing about being an orphan in it
00:10:22,00:10:24,"and needing to know how to cook for when you have to move,"
00:10:24,00:10:27,"even as an adult, you know, into new places"
00:10:27,00:10:30,and be the person who is now going to provide food
00:10:30,00:10:32,for a new family that you're living for.
00:10:32,00:10:34,So it's really odd.
00:10:34,00:10:36,The first-ever American cookbook was basically designed
00:10:36,00:10:39,for women and orphans as the mains rushed.
00:10:39,00:10:41,"Yeah, it was the main thrush."
00:10:41,00:10:43,The main thrust.
00:10:43,00:10:45,"That was one of the recipes, wasn't it?"
00:10:45,00:10:47,The main thrush.
00:10:47,00:10:49,What's the mains thrush?
00:10:49,00:10:51,We're going to have to move on in a second.
00:10:51,00:10:53,Can I tell you about a quick food promotion?
00:10:53,00:10:55,This was about how you can make stuff popular.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"OK, I really like this one."
00:10:57,00:10:59,"This is, again, 2003."
00:10:59,00:11:01,This is the year that Pumpkin Spice Latte was launched.
00:11:01,00:11:03,There's a seafood chain. They're in the States as well.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"They're called Red Lobster,"
00:11:05,00:11:07,"and they had about 700 restaurants at this time,"
00:11:07,00:11:09,"and they thought, ""We need to get more punters in."""
00:11:09,00:11:13,So they launched a promotion which was called Endless Crab.
00:11:13,00:11:17,"And you could order as much crab, snow crab,"
00:11:17,00:11:20,"there's a kind of crab, as you want, for $23."
00:11:20,00:11:22,And they assumed most people would have one or two plates
00:11:22,00:11:25,"of this crab, and boy, did they assume wrong."
00:11:25,00:11:28,"Because as soon as someone ordered three plates of crab,"
00:11:28,00:11:30,the restaurant was making a loss.
00:11:30,00:11:32,"And the problem is, people were turning up"
00:11:32,00:11:34,"and ordering Endless Crab, basically,"
00:11:34,00:11:36,as it was perfectly their right to do.
00:11:36,00:11:38,"It's those crabs with really long legs, though, isn't it?"
00:11:38,00:11:41,Yeah. So it's just a very cumbersome process to eat.
00:11:41,00:11:43,You end up bleeding all over the dish.
00:11:43,00:11:45,"Do you? Yeah, you cut your fingers."
00:11:45,00:11:47,"I've been to one of these restaurants where you eat lobster and crab,"
00:11:47,00:11:50,and I remember there was a dish full of blood in the end.
00:11:50,00:11:52,Red Lobster was just called Lobster.
00:11:52,00:11:56,"But basically, people were coming in,"
00:11:56,00:11:58,"filling up the entire restaurant, ordering crab."
00:11:58,00:12:00,"They're not leaving for four hours, because it takes so long to eat."
00:12:00,00:12:03,So no other punters were getting in toward any non-crab dishes.
00:12:03,00:12:05,"I think they lost half a billion dollars,"
00:12:05,00:12:07,their parent company.
00:12:07,00:12:09,"I know, billion."
00:12:09,00:12:12,"This year, they introduced Ultimate Endless Shrimp,"
00:12:12,00:12:16,and they had almost exactly the same problem all over again.
00:12:16,00:12:18,"Oh, my God."
00:12:18,00:12:21,"There was a restaurant in Chicago which had an all-you-can-eat thing,"
00:12:21,00:12:24,"and a woman sat down at a table with a bunch of friends who were like six of them,"
00:12:24,00:12:27,"and she ordered the all-you-can-eat pancakes,"
00:12:27,00:12:30,"and the other said, ""No, we'll just have some water, please."""
00:12:30,00:12:32,"And they all let all of her pancakes,"
00:12:32,00:12:35,"and they kept getting more pancakes, and people just kept eating them,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,and the police were called eventually.
00:12:37,00:12:39,What? The police were called?
00:12:39,00:12:41,"Because they refused to leave, and they were like,"
00:12:41,00:12:43,"""Well, we're going to have to call the police."""
00:12:43,00:12:45,"They were like, ""We want more pancakes!"""
00:12:45,00:12:47,"Oh, my God. I read one that this just happened recently."
00:12:47,00:12:50,"There's a new McDonald's burger, which is the McCrispy,"
00:12:50,00:12:53,"and in Cornwall, they were forced to take down a poster"
00:12:53,00:12:56,because they'd accidentally put it up right opposite a crematorium.
00:12:56,00:12:58,Nice.
00:12:58,00:13:00,"Oh, gosh, okay."
00:13:00,00:13:02,That just felt a bit...
00:13:02,00:13:04,"Hey, grief can make you hungry."
00:13:04,00:13:06,Smart move.
00:13:06,00:13:13,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:13:13,00:13:15,"My fact is that when making sherry,"
00:13:15,00:13:19,it is important that you leave space for two fists inside your bunghole.
00:13:19,00:13:21,"So, the fortify..."
00:13:21,00:13:24,Making sherry what? Making her happy?
00:13:27,00:13:29,No.
00:13:29,00:13:31,"Guys, come on, let's be serious for a bit."
00:13:31,00:13:33,Let's just have a nice...
00:13:33,00:13:35,Cherry grows in... grows in...
00:13:35,00:13:37,Cherry grows...
00:13:37,00:13:39,"...grows on trees, doesn't it?"
00:13:39,00:13:43,"All sort of, like, wine bushes."
00:13:43,00:13:45,"Vines, if you like."
00:13:45,00:13:47,"Are you okay, Andy?"
00:13:47,00:13:49,"Yeah, I'm fine."
00:13:49,00:13:51,I feel weirdly calm in the...
00:13:51,00:13:53,"I feel like I'm in the eye of the storm,"
00:13:53,00:13:55,"and everything's happening around me,"
00:13:55,00:13:57,and everything's all right.
00:13:57,00:13:59,"And I know I'm not all right, so..."
00:13:59,00:14:01,Sherry.
00:14:01,00:14:03,Can you tell us what your bunghole is?
00:14:03,00:14:05,Sherry is a drink.
00:14:05,00:14:07,It grows in Spain.
00:14:07,00:14:09,It's made in Spain.
00:14:09,00:14:12,In a place genuinely called the Sherry Triangle.
00:14:12,00:14:14,Pretty cool. Very cool.
00:14:14,00:14:16,"This sort of region where the soil is amazing,"
00:14:16,00:14:18,"and it has very chalky soil,"
00:14:18,00:14:21,"and it's absolutely perfect for growing the grapes that make sherry,"
00:14:21,00:14:24,and it is matured in casks.
00:14:24,00:14:26,"You take the grapes, you press them,"
00:14:26,00:14:28,"you leave the pressings, then it is must."
00:14:28,00:14:30,"They ferment, and then they go into barrels,"
00:14:30,00:14:32,"and they are aged for ages in the barrels,"
00:14:32,00:14:35,"and, you know, that's where the flavours mature."
00:14:35,00:14:37,And so they go into these...
00:14:37,00:14:39,"They're called butts. They're sherry butts,"
00:14:39,00:14:42,"which are 500 litres, is one butt."
00:14:42,00:14:44,"And obviously, you need access to the butt,"
00:14:44,00:14:46,so you need a bunghole.
00:14:46,00:14:48,"You know, so you drill a hole,"
00:14:48,00:14:50,"and you put the bung in, the bunghole,"
00:14:50,00:14:52,and then you...
00:14:52,00:14:54,The point...
00:14:54,00:14:59,The point is that I am fine.
00:14:59,00:15:01,I'm fine. I'm fine.
00:15:01,00:15:03,"Some sherrys, dry sherrys,"
00:15:03,00:15:05,they have this layer that grows on the top.
00:15:05,00:15:08,"It's called floor, and it's a layer of different kinds of yeast,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,and it really contributes to the flavour.
00:15:10,00:15:12,And so you want to let the floor grow.
00:15:12,00:15:14,You need to leave space on top of the wine.
00:15:14,00:15:16,"So, traditionally, you leave two spaces,"
00:15:16,00:15:19,"two fists worth of space, on the inside of the barrel,"
00:15:19,00:15:21,below the bunghole.
00:15:21,00:15:23,And that's it. That's all it is.
00:15:23,00:15:25,So it's enough it's do a fisting.
00:15:25,00:15:28,That's all the material I've got.
00:15:28,00:15:33,Do you know what an escafina is?
00:15:33,00:15:35,"Escafina, no. Escafina."
00:15:35,00:15:37,"Yeah, I looked into... There's a glossary."
00:15:37,00:15:39,It's the tool that they use.
00:15:39,00:15:41,It's a semicircular tool used to remove splinters
00:15:41,00:15:43,on the inside of the butt caused by drilling the bungholes.
00:15:43,00:15:45,So that is the tools that we use.
00:15:45,00:15:47,That's very cool. Yeah.
00:15:47,00:15:50,"There are loads of... There's so much, like, cool terminology."
00:15:50,00:15:52,"They have the special tools designed to, like,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,"extract a sample from the middle of the barrel,"
00:15:54,00:15:56,"which is where you want to be tasting it,"
00:15:56,00:15:58,and they have this amazing stacking system as well.
00:15:58,00:16:00,"It's like a pyramid. The new barrels go on top,"
00:16:00,00:16:04,and then gradually you transfer the sherry down bit by bit.
00:16:04,00:16:07,But that means that the sherry's always mingling with newer and older stuff.
00:16:07,00:16:09,And there are some of these systems. They're called soleras.
00:16:09,00:16:11,Some of them are more than 100 years old.
00:16:11,00:16:15,"You know, there will be fractions of tiny droplets,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,"which are more than 100 years old with that barrel system, I think,"
00:16:18,00:16:20,"which is why we're really remaining in there, which is cool."
00:16:20,00:16:23,And the weird thing about the sherry system that I didn't know
00:16:23,00:16:25,"is, well, let me see if you know."
00:16:25,00:16:28,"So if I'm in a restaurant, I order a sherry, and they say..."
00:16:28,00:16:31,"No, sorry, madam. You're under 80 years old."
00:16:31,00:16:33,You can't do that. That's not normal.
00:16:33,00:16:35,"It's making a comeback, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:35,00:16:38,"But you say, ""Oh, what vintage is that?"
00:16:38,00:16:40,"What year is that sherry from?"""
00:16:40,00:16:42,What's wrong with what I've just said?
00:16:42,00:16:44,Vintage. From no year.
00:16:44,00:16:46,From no year. Exactly.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"How's that right? Talk to me, Dan."
00:16:48,00:16:50,It's a time-travelling barrel.
00:16:50,00:16:54,Stop talking to me.
00:16:54,00:16:58,"No, cos it's been going through this pyramid system."
00:16:58,00:17:01,"Exactly. So it's not from one year, it's from a range of..."
00:17:01,00:17:04,It's all mixed up. I didn't realise this at all.
00:17:04,00:17:07,"So it's from lots of different years, each sherry."
00:17:07,00:17:10,And the solera system is like the mixing up of different vintages.
00:17:10,00:17:13,"And apparently, the older wine matures the younger wine,"
00:17:13,00:17:16,and the younger wine keeps the older wine fresh and vigorous.
00:17:16,00:17:20,"OK. So once you've got your sherry, you put it in a barrel,"
00:17:20,00:17:23,you can improve it by sending it round the world.
00:17:23,00:17:26,"And this is something that, again, is making a comeback."
00:17:26,00:17:29,"So quite recently, there has been a ship"
00:17:29,00:17:32,"called the Juan Sebastián del Cano,"
00:17:32,00:17:35,where they've sent a barrel around the world.
00:17:35,00:17:37,"And when it comes back, it's going to be tastier, apparently."
00:17:37,00:17:39,It's all the sloshing around.
00:17:39,00:17:43,"It's known as Mariedos sherry, which is seasick sherry."
00:17:43,00:17:46,"And apparently, cos it sloshes around all that time, it tastes way better."
00:17:46,00:17:49,"Isn't it amazing that, like, that's the theory, but we don't know."
00:17:49,00:17:52,"So they just go, like, everyone reports that this makes it better."
00:17:52,00:17:55,It must be the swaying of the boat as you go along.
00:17:55,00:17:58,"Absolutely. And back in the day, they used to do this all the time."
00:17:58,00:18:01,"And whenever anyone would go on the round the world,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,they would take some sherry with them.
00:18:03,00:18:05,"And you would put it on the boat, and when it came back,"
00:18:05,00:18:07,it'd be worth five times more than when you left it.
00:18:07,00:18:09,Really? Yeah. So you could sell it for five times more.
00:18:09,00:18:11,"So as long as you put enough on there,"
00:18:11,00:18:14,it was worth it to sail it all the way around the world to make that money.
00:18:14,00:18:17,"That's very cool. Couldn't you just, like, employ an intern"
00:18:17,00:18:21,to knock it over and pick it up most of the time?
00:18:21,00:18:23,"It's not quite as romantic, is it?"
00:18:23,00:18:26,"Yeah. Like, this has been interned."
00:18:26,00:18:28,I was going to know the difference.
00:18:28,00:18:30,"But Magellan, when he went around the world,"
00:18:30,00:18:33,he brought way more sherry than he did actual armory
00:18:33,00:18:35,to protect the people on his boats.
00:18:35,00:18:38,20% of the funds that were spent on the things brought onto the boat
00:18:38,00:18:40,were for exclusively sherry.
00:18:40,00:18:43,"To be fair, he wasn't meant to be declaring war on anyone."
00:18:43,00:18:47,"No, but it did get him into a situation where on the day that he died,"
00:18:47,00:18:50,he did have to bring in a group of people on the island
00:18:50,00:18:53,"in order to make up the missing armory, basically."
00:18:53,00:18:55,And then he died in the subsequent attack.
00:18:55,00:18:59,So they say sherry very slightly was involved in his demise as a result.
00:18:59,00:19:03,"But he brought on 203 butts barrels of sherry,"
00:19:03,00:19:06,"which is equivalent of 243,000 litres."
00:19:06,00:19:08,That's what they had for these trips.
00:19:08,00:19:10,Wow. That's amazing.
00:19:10,00:19:14,Another person who sailed with a lot of sherry was Sir Francis Drake.
00:19:14,00:19:17,"So after he attacked Cadiz,"
00:19:17,00:19:20,"known as the singeing of the King of Spain's beard,"
00:19:20,00:19:24,"you might know about it, it's like around the time of the Spanish Armada and stuff,"
00:19:24,00:19:27,he came back with a load of sherry barrels.
00:19:27,00:19:31,"In fact, he came back with 2,900 casks of the stuff."
00:19:31,00:19:35,And that began something called the sherry craze in Britain
00:19:35,00:19:37,"because they suddenly had all this sherry,"
00:19:37,00:19:40,all the rich people in the country could drink it.
00:19:40,00:19:43,"They'd never had it before and it became really, really popular."
00:19:43,00:19:46,And the really interesting thing about that is after a little while
00:19:46,00:19:50,had a lot of empty sherry barrels because they drank it all.
00:19:50,00:19:51,So what did they do with that?
00:19:51,00:19:54,They started putting alcohol in there in Scotland.
00:19:54,00:19:57,They gave it more flavour and we invented whisky.
00:19:57,00:20:00,So whisky came from sherry. Hooray!
00:20:00,00:20:01,Yeah!
00:20:01,00:20:04,And that's how you make whisky.
00:20:04,00:20:08,"But there's a huge problem, which is that sherry became really unpopular."
00:20:08,00:20:11,It's sort of the sales absolutely cratered in the 80s.
00:20:11,00:20:15,"And as a result, they were making a fifth of the sherry they used to."
00:20:15,00:20:18,And it's not shipped in barrels anymore.
00:20:18,00:20:20,So what do you do for the whisky?
00:20:20,00:20:22,You can't make whisky anymore if you don't have the sherry
00:20:22,00:20:25,"and it's not being made and even if it is made, it's not in the barrels."
00:20:25,00:20:29,"So now, sherry makers are filling barrels with sherry just to flavour the barrel."
00:20:29,00:20:30,No.
00:20:30,00:20:32,"What, and then just tipping it into the ocean?"
00:20:32,00:20:33,Pretty much.
00:20:33,00:20:36,Like I've got space in my house.
00:20:36,00:20:39,Have you got space for a million litres of sherry?
00:20:39,00:20:40,You know what?
00:20:40,00:20:42,I'll find room.
00:20:42,00:20:46,But some sherry makers make a million litres of sherry to season whisky casks.
00:20:46,00:20:47,No.
00:20:47,00:20:50,I'm sure they find it used for the sherry but that's why they're doing it.
00:20:50,00:20:54,Because there are a billion litres of Scotch exported from Scotland every year.
00:20:54,00:20:56,It's a massive trade.
00:20:56,00:20:57,"So, yeah."
00:20:57,00:21:00,"I like...So sherry's a fortified wine, basically."
00:21:00,00:21:05,And I like the fact that you make fortified wine by adding wine to wine.
00:21:05,00:21:07,It's just double wine.
00:21:07,00:21:09,It's just like you and a knight.
00:21:09,00:21:13,I'm fortifying the wine gradually.
00:21:16,00:21:22,"I guess, because I'm always a bit confused about how you make all these things that are so related to the grape."
00:21:22,00:21:27,"But basically, you get the wine from this region of Spain and you make it in a certain way that they make it."
00:21:27,00:21:29,And then you add brandy to it.
00:21:29,00:21:36,"And all brandy is distilled wine, i.e. wine where they've removed as much of the liquid as possible and left the distilled alcohol."
00:21:36,00:21:38,And so you just chuck that in.
00:21:38,00:21:40,So sherry is just wine plus wine.
00:21:40,00:21:44,"And it's good because wine, I didn't realise, has a maximum possible strength."
00:21:44,00:21:45,Really?
00:21:45,00:21:54,"You know, I'd never questioned why, you know, wine hovers around the 13, 14% can never quite crack above into 15, 16."
00:21:54,00:21:56,Why not?
00:21:56,00:22:02,That's probably Anna turning around every single bottle on this huge supermarket aisle.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"There will be one, there will be one 15."
00:22:04,00:22:07,"You're right, because like 14 is a horrifically strong wine to me."
00:22:07,00:22:08,Absolutely.
00:22:08,00:22:10,"And I like a nice, you know, 10 or 11."
00:22:10,00:22:12,"Something a bit watered down, yeah."
00:22:12,00:22:14,"Please, you're drinking the 0.5% beers."
00:22:15,00:22:20,"But yeah, it actually can't survive if the alcohol concentration gets too high."
00:22:20,00:22:23,So wine is made by having yeast convert the sugar.
00:22:23,00:22:26,So it's made by fermentation where yeast converts the sugars.
00:22:26,00:22:31,But yeast dies in a certain concentration of alcohol.
00:22:31,00:22:34,"So awfully, it's killed by the thing it creates."
00:22:34,00:22:37,It creates ethanol and then it's killed by it if it gets above 16%.
00:22:37,00:22:47,"And so that's why we need things like sherry and brandy, because they are able to exist above the 16% hurdle."
00:22:47,00:22:55,"I was reading the Australian Dictionary of Slang about the word bung, because this was about bung holes."
00:22:55,00:22:59,"And it says, bung is a term which may refer to two very separate things."
00:22:59,00:23:04,"It may be the hole in the barrel where beer is poured from, or it may also be an anus."
00:23:04,00:23:09,So I'm going to give you some bung phrases.
00:23:09,00:23:14,And you have to decide whether the bung in the phrase refers to the barrel or the anus.
00:23:14,00:23:15,Great. OK.
00:23:15,00:23:18,"OK, so bung juice."
00:23:18,00:23:25,Is bung juice a slang word where the bung part refers to an anus or a barrel?
00:23:25,00:23:28,"Now, I think I've got a bit of inside knowledge here, because I think..."
00:23:28,00:23:31,"I think it's the barrel, because I think there is a thing called bung hole sniffing,"
00:23:31,00:23:39,"where you're testing the whisky by just giving the barrel a quick sniff,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,and it's permeated through it.
00:23:41,00:23:43,So I'm going to say barrel.
00:23:43,00:23:45,"Yeah, how we all in agreement."
00:23:45,00:23:47,"I'm going to go with Andy the expert on bung holes, yeah."
00:23:47,00:23:49,"No, you're right. Bung juice just means beer, it's another word."
00:23:49,00:23:51,"OK, OK."
00:23:51,00:23:53,To hit the bung.
00:23:53,00:23:55,Shake your territory here.
00:23:55,00:23:57,What country did you say?
00:23:57,00:23:59,Australia.
00:23:59,00:24:01,"Come on, mate, let's hit the bung."
00:24:01,00:24:05,"It's... Oh, mate, you hit the bung hard last night."
00:24:05,00:24:08,OK.
00:24:08,00:24:15,"It's amazing seeing you pretend to be the thing you actually are, Australia."
00:24:15,00:24:19,"I'm going to say it is, again, a wine thing."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"Yeah, you're right, it means to get drunk, just to go out."
00:24:22,00:24:24,"Hit the bung, hit the bung."
00:24:24,00:24:26,It's very nice. Bung ball. Bung ball.
00:24:26,00:24:28,Bung ball. That's got to be anal.
00:24:28,00:24:30,It's...
00:24:30,00:24:32,"Oh, yes."
00:24:32,00:24:34,"What, no, I think it's wine."
00:24:34,00:24:39,"Yes, weirdly, I read about a mythological creature"
00:24:39,00:24:41,"that seeks out the bung ball,"
00:24:41,00:24:44,and it's where it's believed the soul is kept.
00:24:44,00:24:46,It's a little ball inside the anus
00:24:46,00:24:48,that this beast comes to eat.
00:24:48,00:24:50,What are you talking about?
00:24:50,00:24:52,Is this real?
00:24:52,00:24:55,"Yeah, it's a... It's the whole what James has on his face."
00:24:55,00:24:59,There's a mythological creature that eats the bung-hole soul ball
00:24:59,00:25:01,that's in our anuses.
00:25:01,00:25:04,No.
00:25:04,00:25:06,Australia.
00:25:06,00:25:08,It's a legend in Australia.
00:25:08,00:25:11,Very different to the classical ancient Greece.
00:25:11,00:25:13,A horse with wings.
00:25:13,00:25:16,"Australia is going to win your bung ball, mate."
00:25:16,00:25:23,"No, it's a dance run by someone who runs a pub."
00:25:23,00:25:24,Brilliant.
00:25:24,00:25:25,A bung ball.
00:25:25,00:25:27,A bung ball.
00:25:27,00:25:30,"They've all been beers so far, or..."
00:25:30,00:25:32,"Well, I didn't want to go, you know."
00:25:32,00:25:34,Fair enough.
00:25:34,00:25:36,There's been a period where rude words have been allowed
00:25:36,00:25:38,to be added to the names of wines now.
00:25:38,00:25:40,"So, for example, before 2001,"
00:25:40,00:25:43,"the word ""bitch"" was never used on a bottle of wine before."
00:25:43,00:25:46,"Since then, in the subsequent seven years,"
00:25:46,00:25:49,"there's been 65 wines that all have that as part of their name,"
00:25:49,00:25:51,"and words like ""ass"" and ""asshole""."
00:25:51,00:25:54,"Does that say ""allowed"" by the government of the wine government?"
00:25:54,00:25:56,"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:25:56,00:25:59,Are there international wine authorities?
00:25:59,00:26:01,I think there's in one country...
00:26:01,00:26:03,"Is it here, for example, in the UK?"
00:26:03,00:26:06,"Yeah, there is a governing body that allows people to say,"
00:26:06,00:26:08,"""Yeah, it will be for certain countries."""
00:26:08,00:26:10,"And call it ""bitch"" to its wine now."
00:26:10,00:26:11,Yeah.
00:26:11,00:26:12,Nice.
00:26:12,00:26:14,There's never going to be a 15% wine.
00:26:14,00:26:16,That is interesting.
00:26:16,00:26:18,APPLAUSE
00:26:18,00:26:24,"OK, it is time for fact number three,"
00:26:24,00:26:26,and that is James.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"OK, my fact this week is that the 1894"
00:26:29,00:26:31,Baltimore Orioles baseball team
00:26:31,00:26:34,had a superstition in which every player
00:26:34,00:26:37,would drink a glass of gravy before every match.
00:26:37,00:26:39,Wow.
00:26:39,00:26:42,"So, this is from a book called ""Field of Magic"","
00:26:42,00:26:45,and it's a book all about different superstitions.
00:26:45,00:26:47,"And yeah, I just thought it was strange"
00:26:47,00:26:49,and a very Christmassy gravy.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"The Orioles were, they were, like, quite a good team at the time."
00:26:52,00:26:54,They were quite a dirty team.
00:26:54,00:26:57,A lot of people thought that they had very good team morale
00:26:57,00:26:59,"and they were a good team together,"
00:26:59,00:27:01,and apparently one of the reasons was they would drink
00:27:01,00:27:05,a glass of turkey gravy before batting practice on game days.
00:27:05,00:27:07,Was that one of the reasons why they were a dirty team?
00:27:07,00:27:09,Had they all thrown up gravy down my front?
00:27:09,00:27:11,"Yeah, what's a dirty team?"
00:27:11,00:27:13,Are they cheating or are they...
00:27:13,00:27:15,They would put soap around the mounds
00:27:15,00:27:18,so that if an opposing pitcher was trying to get their hands nice
00:27:18,00:27:21,"and slippery, or, sorry, to dry them in the dirt,"
00:27:21,00:27:23,it would get slippery instead.
00:27:23,00:27:25,And so they did just little psychological things to...
00:27:25,00:27:28,"Wait, so as a pitcher, you want to have, just to explain,"
00:27:28,00:27:31,"pitcher, you want to have hands that are dried in the dirt?"
00:27:31,00:27:33,"Yeah, well, you want to throw with precision, right?"
00:27:33,00:27:35,So you want your hands as dry as possible and not sweaty.
00:27:35,00:27:37,You want grip.
00:27:37,00:27:39,"Because spitting on balls, obviously, in other related sports,"
00:27:39,00:27:41,can be an advantage.
00:27:41,00:27:44,"Spitting on baseballs was a thing as well, wasn't it, spitballs?"
00:27:44,00:27:47,"And the idea was you would normally have a good grip on them,"
00:27:47,00:27:50,"but with the spitball, they might go in a really weird direction"
00:27:50,00:27:52,when they flew through the air. They became quite dangerous
00:27:52,00:27:54,"and they got banned because someone actually died, I think,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,"when they got hit by a spitball. Get out. Yeah, yeah."
00:27:56,00:27:59,Before we get into the... They blamed the spit for that!
00:27:59,00:28:03,"Like, surely, that's the very outermost layer"
00:28:03,00:28:06,of a hard baseball travelling through the air first.
00:28:06,00:28:09,"What are they otherwise going to do, just use foam?"
00:28:09,00:28:12,"No, I know, I know. I just think that's, like, blame the ball."
00:28:12,00:28:14,"No, I completely agree."
00:28:14,00:28:16,I think it's all very questionable whether these things
00:28:16,00:28:18,make that much of a difference to the ball.
00:28:18,00:28:21,"You know in cricket where it's cloudy and so people go,"
00:28:21,00:28:24,"""Oh, it's cloudy, the ball's going to move around a lot today."""
00:28:24,00:28:27,"Or, I don't know, you know, it's a little bit of a fog."
00:28:27,00:28:30,"It's like, ""Oh, the ball's going to swing to the left constantly."""
00:28:30,00:28:33,And no one actually... I think a lot of these things have not been proven
00:28:33,00:28:35,and no one can actually say why.
00:28:35,00:28:38,They've got to talk about something for five days.
00:28:38,00:28:40,I'll tell you a thing about gravy.
00:28:40,00:28:42,"Oh, yeah? Yeah."
00:28:42,00:28:46,"This is a story about an elderly lady in Scotland,"
00:28:46,00:28:49,"in West Dunbartonshire, right? This is three years ago, 2020."
00:28:49,00:28:52,"Her family, she was, I think, in her 80s,"
00:28:52,00:28:54,they were tidying up her house.
00:28:54,00:28:57,"She was still around, but she was just having it clear out."
00:28:57,00:29:00,"And they threw away some old Bisto tins, right?"
00:29:00,00:29:03,"Like, a load of clutter in the kitchen, a load of old Bisto tins."
00:29:03,00:29:05,Chuckle them out.
00:29:05,00:29:10,"She had hidden her life savings of £20,000 in cash."
00:29:10,00:29:12,"Oh, not in gravy."
00:29:12,00:29:18,"No, and she'd hidden 20 grand in the Bisto tins of her family."
00:29:18,00:29:20,There was a happy ending.
00:29:20,00:29:22,They went to the recycling centre
00:29:22,00:29:24,and two absolute heroes who worked there
00:29:24,00:29:26,"searched for two hours through all the chucked-away bags,"
00:29:26,00:29:28,and they found the tins.
00:29:28,00:29:30,She got it back. Thank God.
00:29:30,00:29:34,"Listen, guys, you don't need to applaud the recycling workers."
00:29:34,00:29:37,"Also, two hours."
00:29:37,00:29:40,That wasn't 48 hours.
00:29:40,00:29:42,You know what Bisto is called? Bisto.
00:29:42,00:29:44,I actually don't. Bisto.
00:29:44,00:29:47,"Bisto, I... Cos you bestow it on..."
00:29:47,00:29:50,"Well, your daughter, if she hadn't chucked it out, for instance."
00:29:50,00:29:52,"That's a great answer, but it's wrong."
00:29:52,00:29:55,"Well, it sort of rhymes with bliss, a bit, not quite the first time."
00:29:55,00:29:57,"Bliss, though. Like, I thought it was an ad campaign."
00:29:57,00:30:00,A bit of the word rhymes with bliss.
00:30:00,00:30:02,I thought there was an ad campaign
00:30:02,00:30:04,which used the word bliss and Bisto together.
00:30:04,00:30:06,"There might have been. There was quite a lot of ad campaigns,"
00:30:06,00:30:08,"but that wasn't... No, no."
00:30:08,00:30:13,"It is an acronym for Browns, Seasons and Thickens, all in one."
00:30:13,00:30:15,"Oh. Is that cool? Sorry, but that doesn't..."
00:30:15,00:30:17,"Well, I added some extra words in."
00:30:17,00:30:20,"Browns, Seasons, Thickens in one."
00:30:20,00:30:22,"Where's the ""I""?"
00:30:22,00:30:24,Bisto. Bisto.
00:30:24,00:30:27,"The ""in"" one, the ""in"" has been taken"
00:30:27,00:30:30,and moved to earlier in the acronym.
00:30:30,00:30:33,"Right, so we should call it Bisto-y."
00:30:33,00:30:35,"Well, there's an ad in there as well."
00:30:35,00:30:36,Steve.
00:30:36,00:30:38,Bissatio. Bissatio.
00:30:38,00:30:39,Bissatio.
00:30:39,00:30:42,These guys don't know what they're doing. They're drunk on gravy.
00:30:42,00:30:44,"They probably changed it to what it became,"
00:30:44,00:30:47,"cos they were like, ""This is getting nothing like the word bliss."""
00:30:47,00:30:49,What will we do?
00:30:49,00:30:51,A gravy train. Yeah.
00:30:51,00:30:53,That's a phrase. Yes.
00:30:53,00:30:55,Found myself looking for whether there was ever an actual gravy train.
00:30:55,00:30:57,Yeah. Doesn't appear so.
00:30:59,00:31:00,Wow.
00:31:00,00:31:02,We don't know why we say gravy train.
00:31:02,00:31:04,We don't know why it's a train.
00:31:04,00:31:08,And gravy obviously is slang for something that's like easily won.
00:31:08,00:31:11,Hence the reason we say gravy train.
00:31:11,00:31:13,But why train?
00:31:13,00:31:17,And apparently there was a writer who theorised that
00:31:17,00:31:19,it was actually a mishearing.
00:31:19,00:31:24,"And he wrote that since ""gravid"" means laden with eggs,"
00:31:24,00:31:28,"a ""gravid rain"" would imply a fall of eggs."
00:31:28,00:31:33,"So gravy train is probably a mishearing of ""gravid rain""."
00:31:33,00:31:37,What a disgusting sounding.
00:31:37,00:31:40,The eggs raining down on you.
00:31:40,00:31:41,Wow.
00:31:41,00:31:43,We don't think that's where it comes from.
00:31:43,00:31:44,No.
00:31:44,00:31:48,I was looking at...
00:31:48,00:31:51,What is gravy but the juices of meat?
00:31:51,00:31:52,So I was...
00:31:52,00:31:56,Right?
00:31:56,00:31:58,"Thank you, Slavoj Cizek."
00:31:58,00:32:01,"Yeah, it sounds like a sort of philosophical paper"
00:32:01,00:32:04,that you've been working on for 12 years.
00:32:04,00:32:05,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:05,00:32:07,"Yeah, no, I'm building it up."
00:32:07,00:32:08,Yeah.
00:32:08,00:32:10,"I mean, gravy is just the juices of meat"
00:32:10,00:32:13,"and then you thicken it, right, by chucking in a thickener."
00:32:13,00:32:15,"Exactly, cornflour."
00:32:15,00:32:18,"And so, you know, when you get rare meat and it's red,"
00:32:18,00:32:20,why is it red? Blood?
00:32:20,00:32:21,"Yeah, it's all that."
00:32:21,00:32:22,"What's not blood, is it?"
00:32:22,00:32:23,Meat juice.
00:32:23,00:32:25,Meat juice.
00:32:25,00:32:27,It's... Thank you from backstage.
00:32:27,00:32:28,Sinister heckle.
00:32:28,00:32:30,Because it sounded like it came from behind...
00:32:30,00:32:32,Is it you who said it?
00:32:32,00:32:34,Have you been there the whole show?
00:32:34,00:32:36,"I'm so sorry, you've got the worst view in the house."
00:32:36,00:32:37,I'm so sorry.
00:32:37,00:32:39,It's just got a view of my bunk.
00:32:39,00:32:41,"Oh, yeah, you've got to be..."
00:32:41,00:32:44,"Well, thank you for quietly and cynically murmuring,"
00:32:44,00:32:46,"""Meat juice""."
00:32:46,00:32:48,That was amazing.
00:32:48,00:32:49,I thought this was interesting.
00:32:49,00:32:51,"When people say, ""Is that meat really nice and bloody?"""
00:32:51,00:32:53,"It's got nothing to do with blood,"
00:32:53,00:32:55,"the redness of rare meat and the juices,"
00:32:55,00:32:57,the red juices that squeeze out of it.
00:32:57,00:32:59,"So, it's from myoglobin."
00:32:59,00:33:00,"So, it's from the muscle."
00:33:00,00:33:03,"And myoglobin is the protein that transports oxygen through muscles,"
00:33:03,00:33:05,like hemoglobin transports it around our body.
00:33:05,00:33:09,"And similarly, like with hemoglobin, the reason that's red,"
00:33:09,00:33:12,"when myoglobin is exposed to oxygen, it goes red."
00:33:12,00:33:15,"So, it's just this protein in the muscles that goes red"
00:33:15,00:33:17,when you cut into meat.
00:33:17,00:33:20,"When it's sitting inside the meat, it's not red at all."
00:33:20,00:33:22,When it's not exposed to oxygen.
00:33:22,00:33:24,But then it becomes red.
00:33:24,00:33:26,"It's kind of our fault, in a way."
00:33:26,00:33:27,We've turned it red.
00:33:27,00:33:29,"The red stuff is there, as in..."
00:33:29,00:33:31,"I think it is indeed our fault, yes."
00:33:31,00:33:34,The World Gravy Wrestling Championships.
00:33:34,00:33:35,Gravy Wrestling.
00:33:35,00:33:38,Gravy Wrestling takes place at the Rosenbowl Pub
00:33:38,00:33:40,in Rosendale in Lancashire.
00:33:40,00:33:43,And the Fire Brigade are always there.
00:33:43,00:33:45,What?
00:33:45,00:33:47,Can't they just use the gravy if there's a fire?
00:33:47,00:33:49,"Yeah, deploy the gravy cannon."
00:33:49,00:33:52,Can you guess why they're always there?
00:33:52,00:33:53,People get stuck.
00:33:53,00:33:56,"No, people don't get stuck. They're covered in gravy."
00:33:56,00:33:59,"You could drown in gravy, so they're sort of like a life rescue."
00:33:59,00:34:01,I guess the Fire Brigade would do that.
00:34:01,00:34:03,"No, they just..."
00:34:03,00:34:07,"You need a big fire, you need a big flame to make all that gravy."
00:34:07,00:34:10,"No, they just wash down the wrestlers between belts."
00:34:10,00:34:12,Oh!
00:34:12,00:34:14,Very good.
00:34:14,00:34:17,"They specifically say that if you're a pro wrestler,"
00:34:17,00:34:20,"you shouldn't take parks, because it's just for fun."
00:34:20,00:34:24,It's like the people who win it are the people who have the best outfits
00:34:24,00:34:27,and who have the best style and stuff like that.
00:34:27,00:34:30,There was a professional wrestler called Tommy Jupiter who went and did it.
00:34:30,00:34:35,Can you tell what the difference between pro wrestling and gravy wrestling is?
00:34:35,00:34:38,"What's the biggest problem, perhaps, with gravy wrestling?"
00:34:38,00:34:40,Boiling water.
00:34:40,00:34:43,Boiling water is not boiling hot gravy.
00:34:43,00:34:46,I should say it's cold gravy.
00:34:46,00:34:50,Another year of third-degree burns at the gravy wrestling championships.
00:34:50,00:34:52,Shall we go cold makeshift?
00:34:52,00:34:54,"No, no."
00:34:54,00:34:57,"Apparently, you can't get grip on people,"
00:34:57,00:35:00,"but also it gets into your eyes and your ears,"
00:35:00,00:35:03,"and you can't see or hear anything,"
00:35:03,00:35:06,and you just end up flailing around the whole time.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:08,00:35:11,"So, was this the pro wrestler's excuse for losing?"
00:35:11,00:35:13,Can I just quickly ask the room?
00:35:13,00:35:17,"Those of you here who are millennial or Gen Z,"
00:35:17,00:35:22,"if you know what roughly age group you're in, can you give me a chair?"
00:35:22,00:35:24,"And those who are, I know it's a slightly younger crowd,"
00:35:24,00:35:27,"so those who are over 50, give us a chair."
00:35:27,00:35:29,"Okay, right, so the first lot,"
00:35:29,00:35:34,"if you like gravy of the millennials or Gen Z lot, give us a chair."
00:35:34,00:35:38,"Okay, that's completely ruined my fact, thank you."
00:35:38,00:35:40,"And the slightly older group, the fifties and over,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,"if you like gravy, give me a chair."
00:35:42,00:35:44,"Okay, right, that's..."
00:35:44,00:35:46,"Okay, now let's hear the fact."
00:35:46,00:35:50,"The words I've got written down are,"
00:35:50,00:35:52,"""Young people don't like gravy anymore."""
00:35:52,00:35:54,Not in this room.
00:35:54,00:35:58,This room is the absolute nexus of young gravy lovers.
00:35:58,00:36:03,It doesn't surprise me that our fans are weirdo outliers.
00:36:03,00:36:05,So I'll give anything.
00:36:05,00:36:07,"If we ask millennials or Gen Z,"
00:36:07,00:36:09,give us a chair if you like Sherry.
00:36:09,00:36:12,"See, I told you, weirdo outliers."
00:36:12,00:36:14,I was reading a lot of surveys about gravy
00:36:14,00:36:17,"and about who likes it and who doesn't, and I did read..."
00:36:17,00:36:20,"Okay, just listen to this, I'm quite indirectly right."
00:36:20,00:36:22,British people are so obsessed with gravy
00:36:22,00:36:25,"that they drink it through straws, take it on holiday,"
00:36:25,00:36:28,and even pour it over pizza and pasta.
00:36:28,00:36:30,"This is a poll of 2,000 adults"
00:36:30,00:36:34,"that found that 13% of people eat it in the car,"
00:36:34,00:36:37,"11% carry it in a flask,"
00:36:37,00:36:40,and 14% take it on holiday with them.
00:36:40,00:36:44,And this happens to be a survey commissioned by Schwartz Gravy.
00:36:44,00:36:49,Claudia Winkelman uses it to tan.
00:36:49,00:36:51,"Gravy, really? Yeah."
00:36:51,00:36:53,She does what she used to.
00:36:53,00:36:55,I think now she has someone else who sprays tan on her.
00:36:55,00:36:57,"But yeah, when she was at uni..."
00:36:57,00:36:59,"What did she use? Like, painted on?"
00:36:59,00:37:01,"Well, you know, all she did was she told women's hour"
00:37:01,00:37:04,"that she used gravy granules to generate her tan,"
00:37:04,00:37:07,"her fake tan at uni, when she first got obsessed with tanning."
00:37:07,00:37:10,Didn't they do that in the while when they didn't have stockings?
00:37:10,00:37:14,"They did. Yeah, darkened their legs with gravy, wartime thing."
00:37:14,00:37:16,But I don't think...
00:37:16,00:37:18,I don't think it was even Second World War
00:37:18,00:37:20,when Claudia Winkelman was at uni.
00:37:20,00:37:28,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:37:28,00:37:30,and that is my fact.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"My fact this week is that every year,"
00:37:32,00:37:34,"on November 29th,"
00:37:34,00:37:38,people in the Netherlands put a pancake on their head.
00:37:38,00:37:42,It's just a thing they do in the lead-up to the Christmas period.
00:37:42,00:37:44,It's what day is it today?
00:37:44,00:37:46,"They get the pancakes out, and they just plop it on their head."
00:37:46,00:37:48,Is this everyone?
00:37:48,00:37:50,"Like, if you watch the news, are they all wearing pancakes?"
00:37:50,00:37:52,Exactly.
00:37:52,00:37:54,"Is it like a poppy, and if you don't wear it on TV,"
00:37:54,00:37:56,then people really kick in?
00:37:56,00:37:58,It's a bloody pancake. It's so disrespectful.
00:37:58,00:38:00,"Yeah, this is a growing trend."
00:38:00,00:38:02,"Basically, this erupted off the back of a cartoon"
00:38:02,00:38:04,"that was published in 1986,"
00:38:04,00:38:06,"where, in the cartoon, pancakes are put on their..."
00:38:06,00:38:08,"There's a long convoluted story,"
00:38:08,00:38:10,"but the basic premise is a joke is made,"
00:38:10,00:38:12,"a pancake is put on a head,"
00:38:12,00:38:14,"and it kind of just got picked up by people in the Netherlands,"
00:38:14,00:38:16,"and slowly, in the subsequent, what?"
00:38:16,00:38:18,"You know, 30-ish years,"
00:38:18,00:38:20,people are now doing it to the point that
00:38:20,00:38:22,"I've asked three people from the Netherlands,"
00:38:22,00:38:24,"they go, ""Yeah, yeah, we do that."""
00:38:24,00:38:26,"So, effectively, in the cartoon,"
00:38:26,00:38:28,for one of the reasons that it was used
00:38:28,00:38:30,"is that it's very cold in late November,"
00:38:30,00:38:32,"and if you have a bald head or even a bald spot,"
00:38:32,00:38:34,you can use the pancake as effectively...
00:38:34,00:38:36,"No, not a reason. OK."
00:38:36,00:38:38,Not the reason they're doing it.
00:38:38,00:38:40,Not in the post-hat world.
00:38:40,00:38:42,"No, yeah."
00:38:42,00:38:44,"You're right. Before the invention of the hat,"
00:38:44,00:38:46,"and it is correct, this would be plausible."
00:38:46,00:38:48,Absolutely fair enough to know.
00:38:48,00:38:50,"But you can't eat your hat afterwards, can you?"
00:38:50,00:38:52,"No, that's where the phrase comes from, doesn't it?"
00:38:52,00:38:54,"I mean, that's from when the hats were pancakes."
00:38:54,00:38:56,"I'm sorry, I should have properly researched this."
00:38:56,00:38:58,Made-up story from a comic book.
00:38:58,00:39:00,"Don't start where you can't finish, all right?"
00:39:00,00:39:02,"We've got more questions about this. OK, keep going."
00:39:02,00:39:04,"Do the pancakes end up being eaten, or are they disposed of?"
00:39:04,00:39:06,"No, I think... Oh, God, yeah."
00:39:06,00:39:08,"Do you eat your own pancake, or is it like you..."
00:39:08,00:39:10,You see someone... What?
00:39:10,00:39:12,Do you think that's a bit sexy?
00:39:12,00:39:14,You see someone else's pancake?
00:39:14,00:39:16,"Well, you see someone else's pancake."
00:39:16,00:39:18,And they've got a nice pancake on their head.
00:39:18,00:39:20,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:20,00:39:22,"It gets to 11.59, and you're like, ""Oh, look at your lips."""
00:39:22,00:39:24,(LAUGHTER)
00:39:24,00:39:28,"Boy, you're both upside down, eating each other's pancakes, you know?"
00:39:28,00:39:30,(LAUGHTER)
00:39:30,00:39:34,"Well, you'd think, given I'd spoke to three people who do this,"
00:39:34,00:39:36,"I would have asked more questions than just,"
00:39:36,00:39:38,"""Do you put it on your head?"""
00:39:38,00:39:40,"Yeah, OK, good, thank you, goodbye."
00:39:40,00:39:42,"But that's what happened, I just asked that one question."
00:39:42,00:39:44,"Silly me, what a great question. Do they eat it afterwards?"
00:39:44,00:39:46,I have no idea. I think they do.
00:39:46,00:39:48,"OK, there we go. I believe they do."
00:39:48,00:39:50,"And I think it's just for a photo, isn't it?"
00:39:50,00:39:52,"Often, maybe the cheats do it for a photo."
00:39:52,00:39:55,"And no toppings on the pancakes at the time, as far as I can tell."
00:39:55,00:40:00,"Is it the sort of smaller diameter thicker pancakes,"
00:40:00,00:40:02,or is it like the big crepes that you have?
00:40:02,00:40:03,"Oh, that's a great question."
00:40:03,00:40:04,Like thin or thick pancakes?
00:40:04,00:40:07,"I think if I had a bald patch, I'd go for the thick, smaller one."
00:40:07,00:40:10,"Yeah, but I've seen the photos, and they're more like the crepes."
00:40:10,00:40:13,"Yeah. Not to be like a yamlka, wouldn't it?"
00:40:13,00:40:16,"Well, that's what I was thinking it was. It was like a winter yamlka, which is..."
00:40:16,00:40:19,"But yeah, no, it's more like the bigger, a bucket hat."
00:40:19,00:40:21,"So they are like the crepe ones, OK, good?"
00:40:21,00:40:22,Yeah.
00:40:22,00:40:23,All right.
00:40:23,00:40:24,Any further?
00:40:24,00:40:28,I'm actually not taking any more questions at this time.
00:40:28,00:40:33,"It is quite a niche, and it feels like quite a modern social media-driven tradition, isn't it?"
00:40:33,00:40:34,Yeah.
00:40:34,00:40:36,"Well, people sharing pictures of themselves."
00:40:36,00:40:41,And I was looking at kind of weird modern Christmas traditions that grow.
00:40:41,00:40:46,"So in Sweden, I don't think we've mentioned Kalle Anka before,"
00:40:46,00:40:48,which is such a phenomenon.
00:40:48,00:40:54,So this is the fact that half of people in Sweden on Christmas Eve watch Donald Duck.
00:40:54,00:40:56,50% of the country.
00:40:56,00:40:57,Wow.
00:40:57,00:41:00,"Mid-40s percent since, you know, Netflix and stuff."
00:41:00,00:41:04,"But yeah, and it's these Disney short cartoons that's been happening since 1959."
00:41:04,00:41:09,"And I was reading an article by a guy who's going out with a Swedish girl,"
00:41:09,00:41:14,"and he spent Christmas with their family, and he said, ""It's not at all a light-hearted thing."
00:41:14,00:41:19,"You can not eat or prepare dinner while watching. Everyone sits very quietly and watches."""
00:41:19,00:41:20,Really?
00:41:20,00:41:23,"""People plan their Christmas around it, so you've got lunch before Kalle Anka."
00:41:23,00:41:26,You've got Father Christmas comes after Kalle Anka.
00:41:26,00:41:29,"But when that's on, you've all got to watch."""
00:41:29,00:41:33,"And they've seen it, you know, 40, 50, 60 times before."
00:41:33,00:41:37,And the biggest complaint scandals in Swedish television come
00:41:37,00:41:40,the few times that they suggest cancelling it.
00:41:40,00:41:44,"I think the 1970s, they said they wanted to alter it or cancel it."
00:41:44,00:41:47,"And yeah, huge outcry."
00:41:47,00:41:49,"It's the same cartoon, like five-minute shorts every time."
00:41:49,00:41:50,Yeah.
00:41:50,00:41:51,"Like, ""Wow."""
00:41:51,00:41:52,Yeah.
00:41:52,00:41:53,A series of cartoons.
00:41:53,00:41:54,That's amazing. What country do you say?
00:41:54,00:41:57,"In Sweden and also in Denmark, I think they do it as well."
00:41:57,00:41:58,Wow.
00:41:58,00:42:00,Is anyone from Sweden or Denmark in the audience?
00:42:00,00:42:01,And Norway.
00:42:01,00:42:02,And Norway.
00:42:02,00:42:03,And so you guys do that?
00:42:03,00:42:04,Yeah.
00:42:04,00:42:05,Wow. Do you like it?
00:42:05,00:42:07,The first ten times was okay.
00:42:07,00:42:09,The first ten times was okay.
00:42:09,00:42:14,"There's a guy called Arne Weiss, who is a presenter in Sweden."
00:42:14,00:42:17,And he was the presenter of the show that kind of hosted it.
00:42:17,00:42:20,And he said it broke up three of his marriages.
00:42:20,00:42:21,What?
00:42:21,00:42:22,"Sorry, wait."
00:42:22,00:42:26,"Again, who would like to take first question on this one?"
00:42:26,00:42:27,Donald Duck.
00:42:27,00:42:28,Do we know how?
00:42:28,00:42:33,"Like, was he walking around like Donald Duck without any trousers on?"
00:42:33,00:42:35,And kept bumping into other women.
00:42:35,00:42:38,"Wait, him presenting it broke up three of his marriages?"
00:42:38,00:42:41,This feels like a lot of transference by him.
00:42:41,00:42:44,I think he did drink a lot as well.
00:42:44,00:42:49,"No, no, he had to present it every year."
00:42:49,00:42:53,"And one year he said, ""Do you mind if I record it in advance?"""
00:42:53,00:42:55,Because it is literally the same thing every year.
00:42:55,00:42:58,Record it in advance and I can spend Christmas with my family.
00:42:58,00:43:01,And Rumour got out that he wanted to record it in advance.
00:43:01,00:43:03,And there was genuine proper public outcry.
00:43:03,00:43:05,"The media got hold of it and said, ""Absolutely not."
00:43:05,00:43:07,"It has to be live. It has to be Christmas Eve."""
00:43:07,00:43:09,"And Christmas Eve, I think, is a bigger deal on Christmas Day."
00:43:09,00:43:10,Not those places.
00:43:10,00:43:12,And it broke up as marriages.
00:43:12,00:43:14,"It's not like we're getting brownie points, if anything."
00:43:14,00:43:16,"No, because it's on the rocks already."
00:43:16,00:43:20,"The wife said, ""Get back to your producers and tell them you're not going in this year."""
00:43:20,00:43:23,"He's asked them, he's come back till between his legs."
00:43:23,00:43:25,And the producer's like...
00:43:25,00:43:31,"That's, whoa, gosh, poor guy."
00:43:31,00:43:32,Poor guy?
00:43:32,00:43:33,Yeah.
00:43:33,00:43:36,Spending Christmas with your family is kind of a modern tradition.
00:43:36,00:43:38,"I guess, in this country."
00:43:38,00:43:41,And apparently spending Christmas with your in-laws
00:43:41,00:43:44,can have a detrimental effect on your bowels.
00:43:44,00:43:48,This is a study in 2016 that collected gut bacteria
00:43:48,00:43:51,from people who had spent Christmas in their own family
00:43:51,00:43:54,or people who had spent Christmas with their in-laws.
00:43:54,00:43:58,And they found a significant decrease in the Ruminococcus species
00:43:58,00:44:00,in people who visited in-laws.
00:44:00,00:44:03,"And if you don't have as much of this kind of gut bacteria,"
00:44:03,00:44:05,"it's associated with stress, with depression,"
00:44:05,00:44:08,and it can give you very loose bowels.
00:44:08,00:44:09,Right.
00:44:09,00:44:12,Is it the stress and depression that causes the bacterial thing?
00:44:12,00:44:14,"That's what we're thinking, yeah, exactly."
00:44:14,00:44:16,So it's more stressful and depressing to be?
00:44:16,00:44:18,"It's more stressful for you because you're with your in-laws,"
00:44:18,00:44:21,"you have less of this bacteria, you need to go to the toilet more."
00:44:21,00:44:22,Right.
00:44:22,00:44:24,And we're sure it's not just an excuse.
00:44:24,00:44:26,"The scientists writing this, we're visiting their in-laws,"
00:44:26,00:44:30,and they just want to excuse themselves for the 19th time at Christmas.
00:44:30,00:44:33,"Oh, where's Daniel? Oh, it's just the bowel thing."
00:44:33,00:44:35,"You wrote that study, didn't you? Yeah."
00:44:35,00:44:38,"In these papers, the scientists are always really rigorous,"
00:44:38,00:44:41,"and they give their, like, caveats in case there's anything."
00:44:41,00:44:43,"They said, ""It is possible that participants"
00:44:43,00:44:45,"""with greater aversion towards their in-laws"
00:44:45,00:44:49,"""have used the excuse of participating in a scientific study"
00:44:49,00:44:51,"""addressing Christmas poo"
00:44:51,00:44:54,"""to not visit their in-laws during Christmas."""
00:44:54,00:44:58,"Well, just while I remember, as well as a pumpkin spice latte,"
00:44:58,00:45:02,"Starbucks also recently released an olive oil latte,"
00:45:02,00:45:05,"and allegedly, if you have it, you may shit yourself."
00:45:05,00:45:08,"So, be near a toilet if you go there."
00:45:08,00:45:11,"Yeah. I mean, with a latte, you're in danger of shitting yourself anyway, right?"
00:45:11,00:45:13,Exactly. Then put some oil in.
00:45:13,00:45:16,"Well, that's the thing, it's like, yeah, the oil loosens you up,"
00:45:16,00:45:18,and the coffee makes you want to go.
00:45:18,00:45:20,Lubricates. Yeah.
00:45:20,00:45:22,"Sorry, why would anyone order an olive oil latte?"
00:45:22,00:45:24,That sounds absolutely foul.
00:45:24,00:45:26,"It's much smoother, apparently."
00:45:26,00:45:28,I mean...
00:45:28,00:45:30,I wasn't struggling.
00:45:30,00:45:32,I wasn't treating it normal latte like it was made of gravel.
00:45:32,00:45:34,I'd be like...
00:45:34,00:45:36,"I know I'm not a frontier pioneer kind of guy,"
00:45:36,00:45:38,but I'm capable of getting to the end of a latte
00:45:38,00:45:41,"without, you know, lacerating my throat."
00:45:41,00:45:44,"All right, can I tell you about another tradition?"
00:45:44,00:45:46,"Yeah. It's an old tradition, actually."
00:45:46,00:45:48,This is a very ancient French tradition.
00:45:48,00:45:50,"It's called the Feast of the Ass,"
00:45:50,00:45:53,and it dates back to Grow Up.
00:45:53,00:45:55,"It's also known as the Feast of the Donkey,"
00:45:55,00:45:57,but it's much less funny.
00:45:57,00:46:01,And it's basically that you take a donkey...
00:46:01,00:46:05,"Take it where, Andy?"
00:46:05,00:46:07,"You take it to church, actually."
00:46:07,00:46:10,"Do you? Yeah, you take the donkey through the town,"
00:46:10,00:46:12,and then it's...
00:46:12,00:46:14,And then you take it...
00:46:14,00:46:16,"Well, guys, there's literally everything you say"
00:46:16,00:46:18,sounds like a useless thing.
00:46:18,00:46:20,"No, I can't..."
00:46:20,00:46:22,"I can't sort of track, I'm in a maze."
00:46:22,00:46:25,And it is suggestive.
00:46:25,00:46:28,"Often there's someone riding the donkey,"
00:46:28,00:46:30,and it goes into the...
00:46:30,00:46:32,"I'm just trying to whip through all the innuendo,"
00:46:32,00:46:34,"so we can, you know, like..."
00:46:34,00:46:36,"And it stands next to the altar in the church,"
00:46:36,00:46:38,"and the priest does the sermon,"
00:46:38,00:46:40,"and then at the end of the sermon,"
00:46:40,00:46:42,"the priest and the congregation,"
00:46:42,00:46:44,"they both do a call and response,"
00:46:44,00:46:46,kind of mimicking the donkey's voice.
00:46:46,00:46:48,They all go...
00:46:48,00:46:50,And it's a really fun thing to do.
00:46:50,00:46:52,"It's like a cross-century, so this is..."
00:46:52,00:46:54,"This is as fun as life gets, basically."
00:46:54,00:46:56,"And then you have a raucous party outside,"
00:46:56,00:46:58,and it's basically that old Christmas tradition
00:46:58,00:47:00,of inverting normal society.
00:47:00,00:47:02,"Well, a lot of misrule."
00:47:02,00:47:04,A lot of misrule.
00:47:04,00:47:06,"The bosses are not in charge, the servants are in charge,"
00:47:06,00:47:08,"all of that, and it's basically all folded into that."
00:47:08,00:47:10,"Yeah, but that was Christmas for centuries,"
00:47:10,00:47:12,"was not a family affair,"
00:47:12,00:47:14,"it wasn't something sort of pleasant and homely,"
00:47:14,00:47:16,"and, like, Christmassy and snugly."
00:47:16,00:47:18,"It was, like, out in the streets,"
00:47:18,00:47:20,there's a whiff of violence and a lot of alcohol.
00:47:20,00:47:22,"And a lot of shagging, I think."
00:47:22,00:47:24,I seem to have my feet to the ass.
00:47:24,00:47:26,There were a lot of people...
00:47:26,00:47:28,"A lot of pancake gone through, yeah."
00:47:28,00:47:30,I think so.
00:47:30,00:47:32,"West Sailing was another thing they did, wasn't there?"
00:47:32,00:47:34,Was that it? West Sailing?
00:47:34,00:47:36,I don't really know what West Sailing is.
00:47:36,00:47:38,"It's when you go house to house singing,"
00:47:38,00:47:40,"basically, and they give you, like,"
00:47:40,00:47:42,some money or some candy or whatever.
00:47:42,00:47:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:47:44,00:47:46,"But traditionally, it was..."
00:47:46,00:47:48,"It was, like, over a thousand years old,"
00:47:48,00:47:50,maybe the idea of it.
00:47:50,00:47:52,And what would happen was the lords of the Manor
00:47:52,00:47:54,"would be in their house,"
00:47:54,00:47:56,and the local people would go around to their house
00:47:56,00:47:58,"and would sail, and they'd be given gifts"
00:47:58,00:48:00,by the Lord of the Manor.
00:48:00,00:48:02,It's kind of like Christmas trick-or-treating.
00:48:02,00:48:04,"It is, apart from the fact that the gift that they got"
00:48:04,00:48:06,given was often animal manure.
00:48:06,00:48:08,Oh!
00:48:08,00:48:10,"Because in those days, obviously,"
00:48:10,00:48:12,"you know, it was good for growing your plants"
00:48:12,00:48:14,and crops and stuff like that.
00:48:14,00:48:16,"Very hard to wrap, though."
00:48:16,00:48:18,Yeah.
00:48:18,00:48:20,"Oh, what could it be?"
00:48:20,00:48:22,Is it maybe the tricycle
00:48:22,00:48:24,my little boy's been asking for?
00:48:24,00:48:26,You could mold it into deceptive shapes
00:48:26,00:48:28,to get people's hopes up.
00:48:28,00:48:30,Yeah.
00:48:30,00:48:32,It's very hard to wrap if you've had a dolly by a latte.
00:48:32,00:48:34,"Oh, God."
00:48:34,00:48:36,I found a few other Dutch traditions.
00:48:36,00:48:38,"So there's this thing that they do in the Netherlands,"
00:48:38,00:48:40,"which is they'll take children,"
00:48:40,00:48:42,"sort of about ten to ten years old,"
00:48:42,00:48:44,"sort of about ten to 13,"
00:48:44,00:48:46,"about that sort of age,"
00:48:46,00:48:48,and they just drop them off
00:48:48,00:48:50,in the woods at the middle of the night.
00:48:50,00:48:52,They just drop them off.
00:48:52,00:48:54,Is this Hans Lund Gretel you've been reading?
00:48:54,00:48:56,It's basically this thing. It's a scout thing
00:48:56,00:48:58,where they just get them into a car in the middle of the night.
00:48:58,00:49:00,"They drop them off at the woods, and they just have to find their way back."
00:49:00,00:49:02,"And they say that in the towns, at like 2 to 3 a.m.,"
00:49:02,00:49:04,these kids come stumbling.
00:49:04,00:49:06,"Yeah, it's a genuine tradition."
00:49:06,00:49:08,"Again, I spoke to three people who've done it,"
00:49:08,00:49:10,and I asked one question of them
00:49:10,00:49:12,and then hung up.
00:49:12,00:49:14,"And then there's this other amazing thing,"
00:49:14,00:49:16,which I think is really sweet.
00:49:16,00:49:18,"In the Netherlands, there's this town that's called Margretten,"
00:49:18,00:49:20,and it has an American cemetery.
00:49:20,00:49:22,"And so there are 8,300 Americans"
00:49:22,00:49:24,who were buried there from the Second World War.
00:49:24,00:49:26,"And there's a thing that they have there,"
00:49:26,00:49:28,which is you adopt a grave.
00:49:28,00:49:30,"And so each family goes,"
00:49:30,00:49:32,"and they maintain the grave,"
00:49:32,00:49:34,"and they bring flowers every weekend and so on,"
00:49:34,00:49:36,and they make sure that the person
00:49:36,00:49:38,is being remembered and looked after.
00:49:38,00:49:40,Quite a cool tradition.
00:49:40,00:49:42,Yeah. Do you guys know Elf on the Shelf?
00:49:42,00:49:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:49:44,00:49:46,Do you know what Elf on the Shelf is?
00:49:46,00:49:48,"Again, I'm clinging on by my fingernails to Elf on the Shelf."
00:49:48,00:49:50,I don't really know what it is.
00:49:50,00:49:52,"So it's where you, as a parent,"
00:49:52,00:49:54,"mostly in America, you buy an Elf on the Shelf"
00:49:54,00:49:56,and you hide it in a different place in the house
00:49:56,00:49:58,every day in the Christmas period.
00:49:58,00:50:00,We do it at home. It's a little stuffed toy elf.
00:50:00,00:50:02,"Yeah, and you put it up and it's like,"
00:50:02,00:50:04,"""What's he doing up there today?"""
00:50:04,00:50:06,"""What's she hiding in that cupboard for today?"""
00:50:06,00:50:08,"Not, though, that the Elf is watching over you"
00:50:08,00:50:10,and making sure that you're not naughty.
00:50:10,00:50:12,That's what I thought it was.
00:50:12,00:50:14,"That's exactly correct, yes."
00:50:14,00:50:16,"So I thought it'd been around forever Elf on the Shelf,"
00:50:16,00:50:18,but it's based on a 2005 self-published book.
00:50:18,00:50:20,It must be the most successful self-published book ever
00:50:20,00:50:22,by a mother and daughter
00:50:22,00:50:24,who told this story to each other about these elves
00:50:24,00:50:26,that spy on the kids before Christmas
00:50:26,00:50:28,"and report back to Santa every night,"
00:50:28,00:50:30,"whether they've been naughty or nice,"
00:50:30,00:50:32,and they fly back in the morning
00:50:32,00:50:34,and hide in a different place.
00:50:34,00:50:36,"And, yeah, it's been on the bestseller list"
00:50:36,00:50:38,"every year since 2013,"
00:50:38,00:50:40,which is quite good for a self-published book.
00:50:40,00:50:42,"And it came with a free, like, elf"
00:50:42,00:50:44,that you sit on your shelf.
00:50:44,00:50:46,"But, yeah, it's caused so much outrage."
00:50:46,00:50:48,Does it have cameras in it and stuff?
00:50:48,00:50:50,[ Laughter ]
00:50:50,00:50:52,It doesn't need to. It's got eyes that can see.
00:50:52,00:50:54,Right. Let's see. Okay.
00:50:54,00:50:56,"But no, it doesn't. But it gives your kids the idea"
00:50:56,00:50:58,that they're constantly being surveilled.
00:50:58,00:51:00,"Yeah. It's kind of just like, you know,"
00:51:00,00:51:02,"naughty and nice list from Santa Claus, isn't it?"
00:51:02,00:51:04,"Like, he sees you when you're sleeping."
00:51:04,00:51:06,Exactly. He knows when you're awake.
00:51:06,00:51:08,"That's how they sing it, isn't it?"
00:51:08,00:51:10,[ Laughter ]
00:51:10,00:51:12,That's how you sing it in your overcoat on street corners.
00:51:12,00:51:14,[ Laughter ]
00:51:14,00:51:16,You better watch out.
