00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Soho Theater in London!

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 and we are into Murray and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 with our four favourite Christmas facts for our Christmas special,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 and in no particular order, here we go!

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 My fact this week is that when concocting its pumpkin spice latte flavour,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Starbucks tried various ratios of pumpkin to spice,

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 before eventually settling on 100% spice, 0% pumpkin.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Was there a big pumpkin tax that they were trying to avoid?

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Come on James, you're an apolitical podcast.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I think I've just saw a sign for pumpkin spice latte the other day

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 and realised I've got no clue what it is.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 And I still haven't had one, by the way.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I think we established that none of us have ever tried it.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I've had one.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Has anyone else in the room never had a pumpkin spice anything?

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Wait, has anyone ever had one?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Not many people.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Well, it's not the sensation that it claims.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 That's too 50 minutes on how popular it is.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 For something that not many people have had,

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I'm shocked that you're not asking me for the experience,

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 for where did I have it, how was it?

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I wanted to be a surprise.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Let's move on.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 So Starbucks, they're a coffee selling company

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 and they were looking for a new kind of holiday PR thing

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 in about 2003, holiday flavour.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And they set up a sort of testing room,

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I think they called it a lab, a coffee lab.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 They called it a liquid lab.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 A liquid lab, yes.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And they sampled lots of different drinks.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And they had 100 ideas for new autumn drinks,

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 fall drinks.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 People in America can listen to this show as well,

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 a lot of them do.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And if you're listening in America,

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 just sit back and feel right at home.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Exactly, because we're talking about the fall.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And they said, they realised at the time that there was,

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 and I quote, nothing around pumpkin in the market.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And so they thought, let's come up with a pumpkin spice,

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 pumpkin pie, which is obviously a Thanksgiving thing in America.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And so they thought, okay, let's create a pumpkin flavour

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 with the spices that come with pumpkin pie.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And they just tested a high pumpkin, low spice option,

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 high spice, low pumpkin option.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And then they settled on zero pumpkin,

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 because pumpkin does not taste of anything.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And what it is, it's like what cinnamon, nutmeg,

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 clove, soldos kind of Christmas.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Those are the spices that go with pumpkin.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 But they did massively popularise it.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I bet you wouldn't have heard of pumpkin spice in 2002.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Oh, it was huge, wasn't it?

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Like Starbucks particularly, those fans is a secret society

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 of pumpkin spice lovers.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 It's the PSL.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 How secret?

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 What infiltration work have you done to find out there's a secret?

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 I reckon you'd be able to tell, if there was one in this room,

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I reckon we'd be able to smell it, put it that way.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 But people really went into it, so the secret society,

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 you basically, when you joined it, they gave you a sort of,

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 you know, the cardboard slip that comes over a coffee.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 It was a sort of woolly version of it, and it was orange,

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 and so you got that as part of the society.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 There was a Twitter account that had 120,000 followers.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 That was 2015, but I checked it today,

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 and they've now gone down to 85,000 followers.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And the tweets have gone private, so something...

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 The tweets weren't even private.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 The secret society.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 It had public tweets.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I don't know what's happened, but something's gone on.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I'm a member of some pretty niche societies,

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 but that is very niche.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Well, 2015 was a huge year for pumpkin spice flavour,

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 because we should say that was the year that they did add pumpkin

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 due to public outcry.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So there is pumpkin in it now,

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 because there were various people who spotted that there was no pumpkin in it before.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 I believe there was a blogger called Food Babe,

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 who she wrote an article about all the ingredients in Starbucks stuff,

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 and it was meant to be an article about the fact that they were unethical

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 or unhealthy and stuff, but she added on the end.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And also, there's no pumpkin in pumpkin spice lattes,

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 and they hit on that and added pumpkin.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Okay.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 It has spread to everything now, mostly in America,

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 but there's quite a bit over here as well.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 There are pumpkin spice, hummus, pumpkin spice salad,

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 pumpkin spice butter, pumpkin spice peanut butter.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Peanut butter already has a flavour.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Peanuts.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Pumpkin spice water, wallpaper, toilet spray.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Wallpaper.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I'm afraid there are...

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 There's a thing called "dude wipes",

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 which are male-pitched wet wipes.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Okay.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I'm really sorry to announce they're called "dumpkin spice".

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Okay.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 There's pumpkin spice spam as well that you can get.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And they sort of announced it as a joke.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Yeah, spam announced it as a joke, and it was not real.

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And then the outcry suddenly was there going,

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 "But we want it to be real."

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 And so they put it out as a limited series,

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 because they thought, "Okay, no one's really going to buy it."

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And everyone bought it.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And for two years, they had this huge selling pumpkin spice spam,

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 which no one really liked, but they just wanted it, you know?

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 You know, Andy, you can get pumpkin spice moss.

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 No.

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Really? Wait.

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Those of you who haven't been here before, Andy, is very much into his moss.

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Yeah, I like moss, yeah.

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 What are those secret societies we were talking about earlier?

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 It's not officially that,

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 but in Jamaica, you can buy Irish moss, which is an aphrodisiac,

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 and it comes spiced with vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg.

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So, to all intents and purposes, it's pumpkin spiced.

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I believe, isn't that...

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 What kind of moss is it called again?

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Okay, it's not real moss. It's not technically moss, is it?

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 It's algae, yes.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Sorry, just the last newsletter was quite big on that kind of stuff.

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I was reading some psychology about why pumpkin spice is so popular.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Oh, yeah.

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 As we've established, it isn't, but let's go with it is.

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Apparently, scarcity is one of the main reasons

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 that you can only get it in the fall.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Did I do that right, Anna, yeah?

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Yeah, but I need to question your pronunciation of scarcity.

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Apparently, because you can only get it in the autumn and in the winter,

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 it makes people desire it more.

144
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Also, a lot of the ingredients are aphrodisiacs,

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 supposedly.

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 What?

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Oh, the spices?

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Yeah, so cinnamon is known to relax muscles

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 and increase sexual desire.

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 It's been used in Indian traditional medicine for a long time for that.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Nutmeg, there's been one study on rats

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 that found that if you give it to rats...

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 What? Have you given them nutmeg?

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 You're not picky, are you, James?

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I'll tell you what, I was chasing them around that maze for a long time.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Apparently, if you give a rat nutmeg,

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 they have increased number of mounting episodes.

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Mounting episodes?

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Wow.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Nutmeg used to be so popular that people would carry it around with them,

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 and they would carry their own nutmeg graters.

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 This was in the Victorian times.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And Charles Sackfield, the sixth Earl of Dorset,

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 used to just eat spoonfuls of nutmeg,

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 which you shouldn't do because it is poisonous if you have too much of it.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 But he did it, and he had so much one evening

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 that he was imprisoned after running up and down all night,

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 almost naked, through the street in a nutmeg frenzy.

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Wow.

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So pumpkin spice, I have a few issues with it,

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 and the things it's been included in.

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Mostly dog-based things.

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 So it's in dog brew,

174
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 which is a kind of doggy beer, non-alcoholic dog beer,

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 because I guess you shouldn't give dogs alcohol.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Doggy donuts, dog biscuits.

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 They all come in pumpkin spice flavour.

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 And this just reminded me of the fact

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 that there's a shitload of human food that has dog versions now.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Have you seen?

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Dog ice cream? Have you not seen dog ice cream?

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 No.

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 So in Aldi, you get dog ice cream for dogs that you feed dogs.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 It's literally everywhere.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 There's a cool dog vegan ice cream

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 that costs £120 for a tub of it.

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 To be fair, a five-litre tub.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 The mouth has changed.

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 But is it non-dairy,

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 because dogs can't have dairy, right?

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 This one is non-dairy because it's vegan,

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 and that's one of the things they say,

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 is dogs are lactose intolerant.

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Therefore, we've made our dog ice cream dairy-free.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Well, hang on, if they're not allowed dairy,

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 and there's dairy-free ice cream for dogs,

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 what's a Pappuccino?

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Because I saw someone order a Pappuccino in front of me

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 in a coffee shop.

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 OK, for a dog? Yeah, for a dog.

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Right, so you do know of this phenomenon.

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Pappuccino sounds like it's a dog cat.

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I sort of thought that was a, like,

204
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 a horrific isolated outbreak of that kind of thing.

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Well, did the guy or the person behind the count

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 go, "What the fuck are you talking about?"

207
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Or did they give them something?

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Because it's not isolated.

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Well, they might have misheard cappuccino

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 and just given them a cappuccino,

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 because I frequently say, "Can I have a cappatee?"

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 and they say, "Cappuccino," and I say, "No, cappatee."

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Well, that happens to me on a few times a year.

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Well, your accent is so hard to understand, isn't it, Andy?

215
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Can I have a cappatee?

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Well, you know, the dog, the company

217
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 that comes up with these ridiculous ice creams

218
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 is called Don Thor,

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 which is quite nice for an ice cream inventing guy.

220
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 But still, I hate him.

221
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 (LAUGHTER)

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Pumpkin Spice is...

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 So it began to be, you know,

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 a global phenomena when Starbucks started doing it,

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 but it is old, isn't it?

226
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I mean, it appears in America's first-ever cookbook.

227
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 There was a lady

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 who was called Amelia Simmons,

229
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 and she wrote this book in 1796,

230
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 and it has this recipe in it.

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And it was a pretty amazing cookbook,

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 because on it, it says, "Buy Amelia Simmons,"

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 but then underneath, it says, "American Orphan,"

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 and there was this whole thing about being an orphan in it

235
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 and needing to know how to cook for when you have to move,

236
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 even as an adult, you know, into new places

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 and be the person who is now going to provide food

238
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 for a new family that you're living for.

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 So it's really odd.

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 The first-ever American cookbook was basically designed

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 for women and orphans as the mains rushed.

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Yeah, it was the main thrush.

243
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 The main thrust.

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 That was one of the recipes, wasn't it?

245
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 The main thrush.

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 What's the mains thrush?

247
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 We're going to have to move on in a second.

248
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Can I tell you about a quick food promotion?

249
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 This was about how you can make stuff popular.

250
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 OK, I really like this one.

251
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 This is, again, 2003.

252
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 This is the year that Pumpkin Spice Latte was launched.

253
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 There's a seafood chain. They're in the States as well.

254
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 They're called Red Lobster,

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 and they had about 700 restaurants at this time,

256
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 and they thought, "We need to get more punters in."

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 So they launched a promotion which was called Endless Crab.

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And you could order as much crab, snow crab,

259
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 there's a kind of crab, as you want, for $23.

260
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And they assumed most people would have one or two plates

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 of this crab, and boy, did they assume wrong.

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Because as soon as someone ordered three plates of crab,

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 the restaurant was making a loss.

264
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And the problem is, people were turning up

265
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 and ordering Endless Crab, basically,

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 as it was perfectly their right to do.

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 It's those crabs with really long legs, though, isn't it?

268
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Yeah. So it's just a very cumbersome process to eat.

269
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 You end up bleeding all over the dish.

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Do you? Yeah, you cut your fingers.

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 I've been to one of these restaurants where you eat lobster and crab,

272
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 and I remember there was a dish full of blood in the end.

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Red Lobster was just called Lobster.

274
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 But basically, people were coming in,

275
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 filling up the entire restaurant, ordering crab.

276
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 They're not leaving for four hours, because it takes so long to eat.

277
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 So no other punters were getting in toward any non-crab dishes.

278
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 I think they lost half a billion dollars,

279
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 their parent company.

280
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 I know, billion.

281
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 This year, they introduced Ultimate Endless Shrimp,

282
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 and they had almost exactly the same problem all over again.

283
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Oh, my God.

284
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 There was a restaurant in Chicago which had an all-you-can-eat thing,

285
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 and a woman sat down at a table with a bunch of friends who were like six of them,

286
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 and she ordered the all-you-can-eat pancakes,

287
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 and the other said, "No, we'll just have some water, please."

288
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And they all let all of her pancakes,

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 and they kept getting more pancakes, and people just kept eating them,

290
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 and the police were called eventually.

291
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 What? The police were called?

292
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Because they refused to leave, and they were like,

293
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 "Well, we're going to have to call the police."

294
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 They were like, "We want more pancakes!"

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Oh, my God. I read one that this just happened recently.

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 There's a new McDonald's burger, which is the McCrispy,

297
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 and in Cornwall, they were forced to take down a poster

298
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 because they'd accidentally put it up right opposite a crematorium.

299
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Nice.

300
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Oh, gosh, okay.

301
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 That just felt a bit...

302
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Hey, grief can make you hungry.

303
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Smart move.

304
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

305
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 My fact is that when making sherry,

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 it is important that you leave space for two fists inside your bunghole.

307
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 So, the fortify...

308
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Making sherry what? Making her happy?

309
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 No.

310
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Guys, come on, let's be serious for a bit.

311
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Let's just have a nice...

312
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Cherry grows in... grows in...

313
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Cherry grows...

314
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 ...grows on trees, doesn't it?

315
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 All sort of, like, wine bushes.

316
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Vines, if you like.

317
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Are you okay, Andy?

318
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Yeah, I'm fine.

319
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 I feel weirdly calm in the...

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I feel like I'm in the eye of the storm,

321
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 and everything's happening around me,

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 and everything's all right.

323
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 And I know I'm not all right, so...

324
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Sherry.

325
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Can you tell us what your bunghole is?

326
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Sherry is a drink.

327
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 It grows in Spain.

328
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 It's made in Spain.

329
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 In a place genuinely called the Sherry Triangle.

330
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Pretty cool. Very cool.

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 This sort of region where the soil is amazing,

332
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 and it has very chalky soil,

333
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 and it's absolutely perfect for growing the grapes that make sherry,

334
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 and it is matured in casks.

335
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 You take the grapes, you press them,

336
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 you leave the pressings, then it is must.

337
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 They ferment, and then they go into barrels,

338
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 and they are aged for ages in the barrels,

339
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 and, you know, that's where the flavours mature.

340
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And so they go into these...

341
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 They're called butts. They're sherry butts,

342
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 which are 500 litres, is one butt.

343
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And obviously, you need access to the butt,

344
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 so you need a bunghole.

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 You know, so you drill a hole,

346
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 and you put the bung in, the bunghole,

347
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 and then you...

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 The point...

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 The point is that I am fine.

350
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 I'm fine. I'm fine.

351
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Some sherrys, dry sherrys,

352
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 they have this layer that grows on the top.

353
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It's called floor, and it's a layer of different kinds of yeast,

354
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 and it really contributes to the flavour.

355
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And so you want to let the floor grow.

356
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 You need to leave space on top of the wine.

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 So, traditionally, you leave two spaces,

358
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 two fists worth of space, on the inside of the barrel,

359
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 below the bunghole.

360
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And that's it. That's all it is.

361
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So it's enough it's do a fisting.

362
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 That's all the material I've got.

363
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Do you know what an escafina is?

364
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Escafina, no. Escafina.

365
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Yeah, I looked into... There's a glossary.

366
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 It's the tool that they use.

367
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 It's a semicircular tool used to remove splinters

368
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 on the inside of the butt caused by drilling the bungholes.

369
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 So that is the tools that we use.

370
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 That's very cool. Yeah.

371
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 There are loads of... There's so much, like, cool terminology.

372
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 They have the special tools designed to, like,

373
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 extract a sample from the middle of the barrel,

374
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 which is where you want to be tasting it,

375
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 and they have this amazing stacking system as well.

376
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 It's like a pyramid. The new barrels go on top,

377
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 and then gradually you transfer the sherry down bit by bit.

378
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 But that means that the sherry's always mingling with newer and older stuff.

379
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And there are some of these systems. They're called soleras.

380
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Some of them are more than 100 years old.

381
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 You know, there will be fractions of tiny droplets,

382
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 which are more than 100 years old with that barrel system, I think,

383
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 which is why we're really remaining in there, which is cool.

384
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And the weird thing about the sherry system that I didn't know

385
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 is, well, let me see if you know.

386
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 So if I'm in a restaurant, I order a sherry, and they say...

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 No, sorry, madam. You're under 80 years old.

388
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 You can't do that. That's not normal.

389
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 It's making a comeback, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

390
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 But you say, "Oh, what vintage is that?

391
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 What year is that sherry from?"

392
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 What's wrong with what I've just said?

393
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Vintage. From no year.

394
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 From no year. Exactly.

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 How's that right? Talk to me, Dan.

396
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 It's a time-travelling barrel.

397
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Stop talking to me.

398
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 No, cos it's been going through this pyramid system.

399
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Exactly. So it's not from one year, it's from a range of...

400
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 It's all mixed up. I didn't realise this at all.

401
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 So it's from lots of different years, each sherry.

402
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 And the solera system is like the mixing up of different vintages.

403
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And apparently, the older wine matures the younger wine,

404
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 and the younger wine keeps the older wine fresh and vigorous.

405
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 OK. So once you've got your sherry, you put it in a barrel,

406
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 you can improve it by sending it round the world.

407
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And this is something that, again, is making a comeback.

408
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 So quite recently, there has been a ship

409
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 called the Juan Sebastián del Cano,

410
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 where they've sent a barrel around the world.

411
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And when it comes back, it's going to be tastier, apparently.

412
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 It's all the sloshing around.

413
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 It's known as Mariedos sherry, which is seasick sherry.

414
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And apparently, cos it sloshes around all that time, it tastes way better.

415
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Isn't it amazing that, like, that's the theory, but we don't know.

416
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 So they just go, like, everyone reports that this makes it better.

417
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 It must be the swaying of the boat as you go along.

418
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Absolutely. And back in the day, they used to do this all the time.

419
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 And whenever anyone would go on the round the world,

420
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 they would take some sherry with them.

421
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And you would put it on the boat, and when it came back,

422
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 it'd be worth five times more than when you left it.

423
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Really? Yeah. So you could sell it for five times more.

424
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 So as long as you put enough on there,

425
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 it was worth it to sail it all the way around the world to make that money.

426
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 That's very cool. Couldn't you just, like, employ an intern

427
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 to knock it over and pick it up most of the time?

428
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 It's not quite as romantic, is it?

429
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Yeah. Like, this has been interned.

430
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 I was going to know the difference.

431
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 But Magellan, when he went around the world,

432
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 he brought way more sherry than he did actual armory

433
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 to protect the people on his boats.

434
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 20% of the funds that were spent on the things brought onto the boat

435
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 were for exclusively sherry.

436
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 To be fair, he wasn't meant to be declaring war on anyone.

437
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 No, but it did get him into a situation where on the day that he died,

438
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 he did have to bring in a group of people on the island

439
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 in order to make up the missing armory, basically.

440
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And then he died in the subsequent attack.

441
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 So they say sherry very slightly was involved in his demise as a result.

442
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 But he brought on 203 butts barrels of sherry,

443
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 which is equivalent of 243,000 litres.

444
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 That's what they had for these trips.

445
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Wow. That's amazing.

446
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Another person who sailed with a lot of sherry was Sir Francis Drake.

447
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 So after he attacked Cadiz,

448
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 known as the singeing of the King of Spain's beard,

449
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 you might know about it, it's like around the time of the Spanish Armada and stuff,

450
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 he came back with a load of sherry barrels.

451
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 In fact, he came back with 2,900 casks of the stuff.

452
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And that began something called the sherry craze in Britain

453
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 because they suddenly had all this sherry,

454
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 all the rich people in the country could drink it.

455
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 They'd never had it before and it became really, really popular.

456
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And the really interesting thing about that is after a little while

457
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 had a lot of empty sherry barrels because they drank it all.

458
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 So what did they do with that?

459
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 They started putting alcohol in there in Scotland.

460
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 They gave it more flavour and we invented whisky.

461
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 So whisky came from sherry. Hooray!

462
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Yeah!

463
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And that's how you make whisky.

464
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 But there's a huge problem, which is that sherry became really unpopular.

465
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 It's sort of the sales absolutely cratered in the 80s.

466
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And as a result, they were making a fifth of the sherry they used to.

467
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And it's not shipped in barrels anymore.

468
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 So what do you do for the whisky?

469
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 You can't make whisky anymore if you don't have the sherry

470
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 and it's not being made and even if it is made, it's not in the barrels.

471
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So now, sherry makers are filling barrels with sherry just to flavour the barrel.

472
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 No.

473
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 What, and then just tipping it into the ocean?

474
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Pretty much.

475
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Like I've got space in my house.

476
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Have you got space for a million litres of sherry?

477
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 You know what?

478
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 I'll find room.

479
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 But some sherry makers make a million litres of sherry to season whisky casks.

480
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 No.

481
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 I'm sure they find it used for the sherry but that's why they're doing it.

482
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Because there are a billion litres of Scotch exported from Scotland every year.

483
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 It's a massive trade.

484
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 So, yeah.

485
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 I like...So sherry's a fortified wine, basically.

486
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And I like the fact that you make fortified wine by adding wine to wine.

487
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 It's just double wine.

488
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 It's just like you and a knight.

489
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 I'm fortifying the wine gradually.

490
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 I guess, because I'm always a bit confused about how you make all these things that are so related to the grape.

491
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 But basically, you get the wine from this region of Spain and you make it in a certain way that they make it.

492
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 And then you add brandy to it.

493
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And all brandy is distilled wine, i.e. wine where they've removed as much of the liquid as possible and left the distilled alcohol.

494
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And so you just chuck that in.

495
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 So sherry is just wine plus wine.

496
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 And it's good because wine, I didn't realise, has a maximum possible strength.

497
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Really?

498
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 You know, I'd never questioned why, you know, wine hovers around the 13, 14% can never quite crack above into 15, 16.

499
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Why not?

500
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 That's probably Anna turning around every single bottle on this huge supermarket aisle.

501
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 There will be one, there will be one 15.

502
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 You're right, because like 14 is a horrifically strong wine to me.

503
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Absolutely.

504
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And I like a nice, you know, 10 or 11.

505
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Something a bit watered down, yeah.

506
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Please, you're drinking the 0.5% beers.

507
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 But yeah, it actually can't survive if the alcohol concentration gets too high.

508
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 So wine is made by having yeast convert the sugar.

509
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 So it's made by fermentation where yeast converts the sugars.

510
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 But yeast dies in a certain concentration of alcohol.

511
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So awfully, it's killed by the thing it creates.

512
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 It creates ethanol and then it's killed by it if it gets above 16%.

513
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And so that's why we need things like sherry and brandy, because they are able to exist above the 16% hurdle.

514
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 I was reading the Australian Dictionary of Slang about the word bung, because this was about bung holes.

515
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 And it says, bung is a term which may refer to two very separate things.

516
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 It may be the hole in the barrel where beer is poured from, or it may also be an anus.

517
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 So I'm going to give you some bung phrases.

518
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And you have to decide whether the bung in the phrase refers to the barrel or the anus.

519
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Great. OK.

520
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 OK, so bung juice.

521
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Is bung juice a slang word where the bung part refers to an anus or a barrel?

522
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Now, I think I've got a bit of inside knowledge here, because I think...

523
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I think it's the barrel, because I think there is a thing called bung hole sniffing,

524
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 where you're testing the whisky by just giving the barrel a quick sniff,

525
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 and it's permeated through it.

526
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 So I'm going to say barrel.

527
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Yeah, how we all in agreement.

528
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 I'm going to go with Andy the expert on bung holes, yeah.

529
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 No, you're right. Bung juice just means beer, it's another word.

530
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 OK, OK.

531
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 To hit the bung.

532
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Shake your territory here.

533
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 What country did you say?

534
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Australia.

535
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Come on, mate, let's hit the bung.

536
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 It's... Oh, mate, you hit the bung hard last night.

537
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 OK.

538
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 It's amazing seeing you pretend to be the thing you actually are, Australia.

539
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 I'm going to say it is, again, a wine thing.

540
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Yeah, you're right, it means to get drunk, just to go out.

541
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Hit the bung, hit the bung.

542
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 It's very nice. Bung ball. Bung ball.

543
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Bung ball. That's got to be anal.

544
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 It's...

545
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Oh, yes.

546
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 What, no, I think it's wine.

547
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Yes, weirdly, I read about a mythological creature

548
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 that seeks out the bung ball,

549
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 and it's where it's believed the soul is kept.

550
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 It's a little ball inside the anus

551
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 that this beast comes to eat.

552
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 What are you talking about?

553
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Is this real?

554
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Yeah, it's a... It's the whole what James has on his face.

555
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 There's a mythological creature that eats the bung-hole soul ball

556
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 that's in our anuses.

557
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 No.

558
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Australia.

559
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 It's a legend in Australia.

560
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Very different to the classical ancient Greece.

561
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 A horse with wings.

562
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Australia is going to win your bung ball, mate.

563
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 No, it's a dance run by someone who runs a pub.

564
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Brilliant.

565
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 A bung ball.

566
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 A bung ball.

567
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 They've all been beers so far, or...

568
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Well, I didn't want to go, you know.

569
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Fair enough.

570
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 There's been a period where rude words have been allowed

571
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 to be added to the names of wines now.

572
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 So, for example, before 2001,

573
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 the word "bitch" was never used on a bottle of wine before.

574
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Since then, in the subsequent seven years,

575
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 there's been 65 wines that all have that as part of their name,

576
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 and words like "ass" and "asshole".

577
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Does that say "allowed" by the government of the wine government?

578
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

579
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Are there international wine authorities?

580
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 I think there's in one country...

581
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Is it here, for example, in the UK?

582
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Yeah, there is a governing body that allows people to say,

583
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 "Yeah, it will be for certain countries."

584
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And call it "bitch" to its wine now.

585
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Yeah.

586
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Nice.

587
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 There's never going to be a 15% wine.

588
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 That is interesting.

589
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 APPLAUSE

590
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 OK, it is time for fact number three,

591
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 and that is James.

592
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 OK, my fact this week is that the 1894

593
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Baltimore Orioles baseball team

594
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 had a superstition in which every player

595
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 would drink a glass of gravy before every match.

596
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Wow.

597
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 So, this is from a book called "Field of Magic",

598
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 and it's a book all about different superstitions.

599
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 And yeah, I just thought it was strange

600
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 and a very Christmassy gravy.

601
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 The Orioles were, they were, like, quite a good team at the time.

602
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 They were quite a dirty team.

603
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 A lot of people thought that they had very good team morale

604
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 and they were a good team together,

605
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 and apparently one of the reasons was they would drink

606
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 a glass of turkey gravy before batting practice on game days.

607
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Was that one of the reasons why they were a dirty team?

608
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Had they all thrown up gravy down my front?

609
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Yeah, what's a dirty team?

610
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Are they cheating or are they...

611
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 They would put soap around the mounds

612
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 so that if an opposing pitcher was trying to get their hands nice

613
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 and slippery, or, sorry, to dry them in the dirt,

614
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 it would get slippery instead.

615
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And so they did just little psychological things to...

616
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Wait, so as a pitcher, you want to have, just to explain,

617
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 pitcher, you want to have hands that are dried in the dirt?

618
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Yeah, well, you want to throw with precision, right?

619
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So you want your hands as dry as possible and not sweaty.

620
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 You want grip.

621
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Because spitting on balls, obviously, in other related sports,

622
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 can be an advantage.

623
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Spitting on baseballs was a thing as well, wasn't it, spitballs?

624
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And the idea was you would normally have a good grip on them,

625
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 but with the spitball, they might go in a really weird direction

626
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 when they flew through the air. They became quite dangerous

627
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 and they got banned because someone actually died, I think,

628
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 when they got hit by a spitball. Get out. Yeah, yeah.

629
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Before we get into the... They blamed the spit for that!

630
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Like, surely, that's the very outermost layer

631
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 of a hard baseball travelling through the air first.

632
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 What are they otherwise going to do, just use foam?

633
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 No, I know, I know. I just think that's, like, blame the ball.

634
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 No, I completely agree.

635
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 I think it's all very questionable whether these things

636
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 make that much of a difference to the ball.

637
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 You know in cricket where it's cloudy and so people go,

638
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 "Oh, it's cloudy, the ball's going to move around a lot today."

639
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Or, I don't know, you know, it's a little bit of a fog.

640
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 It's like, "Oh, the ball's going to swing to the left constantly."

641
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And no one actually... I think a lot of these things have not been proven

642
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 and no one can actually say why.

643
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 They've got to talk about something for five days.

644
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I'll tell you a thing about gravy.

645
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Oh, yeah? Yeah.

646
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 This is a story about an elderly lady in Scotland,

647
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 in West Dunbartonshire, right? This is three years ago, 2020.

648
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Her family, she was, I think, in her 80s,

649
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 they were tidying up her house.

650
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 She was still around, but she was just having it clear out.

651
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And they threw away some old Bisto tins, right?

652
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Like, a load of clutter in the kitchen, a load of old Bisto tins.

653
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Chuckle them out.

654
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 She had hidden her life savings of £20,000 in cash.

655
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Oh, not in gravy.

656
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 No, and she'd hidden 20 grand in the Bisto tins of her family.

657
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 There was a happy ending.

658
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 They went to the recycling centre

659
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 and two absolute heroes who worked there

660
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 searched for two hours through all the chucked-away bags,

661
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 and they found the tins.

662
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 She got it back. Thank God.

663
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Listen, guys, you don't need to applaud the recycling workers.

664
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Also, two hours.

665
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 That wasn't 48 hours.

666
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 You know what Bisto is called? Bisto.

667
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 I actually don't. Bisto.

668
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Bisto, I... Cos you bestow it on...

669
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Well, your daughter, if she hadn't chucked it out, for instance.

670
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 That's a great answer, but it's wrong.

671
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Well, it sort of rhymes with bliss, a bit, not quite the first time.

672
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Bliss, though. Like, I thought it was an ad campaign.

673
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 A bit of the word rhymes with bliss.

674
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 I thought there was an ad campaign

675
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 which used the word bliss and Bisto together.

676
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 There might have been. There was quite a lot of ad campaigns,

677
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 but that wasn't... No, no.

678
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 It is an acronym for Browns, Seasons and Thickens, all in one.

679
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Oh. Is that cool? Sorry, but that doesn't...

680
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Well, I added some extra words in.

681
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Browns, Seasons, Thickens in one.

682
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Where's the "I"?

683
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Bisto. Bisto.

684
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 The "in" one, the "in" has been taken

685
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 and moved to earlier in the acronym.

686
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Right, so we should call it Bisto-y.

687
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Well, there's an ad in there as well.

688
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Steve.

689
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Bissatio. Bissatio.

690
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Bissatio.

691
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 These guys don't know what they're doing. They're drunk on gravy.

692
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 They probably changed it to what it became,

693
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 cos they were like, "This is getting nothing like the word bliss."

694
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 What will we do?

695
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 A gravy train. Yeah.

696
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 That's a phrase. Yes.

697
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Found myself looking for whether there was ever an actual gravy train.

698
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Yeah. Doesn't appear so.

699
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Wow.

700
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 We don't know why we say gravy train.

701
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 We don't know why it's a train.

702
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And gravy obviously is slang for something that's like easily won.

703
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Hence the reason we say gravy train.

704
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 But why train?

705
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 And apparently there was a writer who theorised that

706
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 it was actually a mishearing.

707
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And he wrote that since "gravid" means laden with eggs,

708
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 a "gravid rain" would imply a fall of eggs.

709
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 So gravy train is probably a mishearing of "gravid rain".

710
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 What a disgusting sounding.

711
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 The eggs raining down on you.

712
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Wow.

713
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 We don't think that's where it comes from.

714
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 No.

715
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 I was looking at...

716
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 What is gravy but the juices of meat?

717
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 So I was...

718
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Right?

719
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Thank you, Slavoj Cizek.

720
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Yeah, it sounds like a sort of philosophical paper

721
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 that you've been working on for 12 years.

722
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Yeah, yeah.

723
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Yeah, no, I'm building it up.

724
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Yeah.

725
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 I mean, gravy is just the juices of meat

726
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 and then you thicken it, right, by chucking in a thickener.

727
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Exactly, cornflour.

728
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 And so, you know, when you get rare meat and it's red,

729
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 why is it red? Blood?

730
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Yeah, it's all that.

731
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 What's not blood, is it?

732
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Meat juice.

733
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Meat juice.

734
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 It's... Thank you from backstage.

735
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Sinister heckle.

736
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Because it sounded like it came from behind...

737
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Is it you who said it?

738
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Have you been there the whole show?

739
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 I'm so sorry, you've got the worst view in the house.

740
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 I'm so sorry.

741
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 It's just got a view of my bunk.

742
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Oh, yeah, you've got to be...

743
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Well, thank you for quietly and cynically murmuring,

744
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 "Meat juice".

745
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 That was amazing.

746
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 I thought this was interesting.

747
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 When people say, "Is that meat really nice and bloody?"

748
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 It's got nothing to do with blood,

749
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 the redness of rare meat and the juices,

750
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 the red juices that squeeze out of it.

751
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 So, it's from myoglobin.

752
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 So, it's from the muscle.

753
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 And myoglobin is the protein that transports oxygen through muscles,

754
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 like hemoglobin transports it around our body.

755
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And similarly, like with hemoglobin, the reason that's red,

756
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 when myoglobin is exposed to oxygen, it goes red.

757
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 So, it's just this protein in the muscles that goes red

758
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 when you cut into meat.

759
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 When it's sitting inside the meat, it's not red at all.

760
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 When it's not exposed to oxygen.

761
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 But then it becomes red.

762
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 It's kind of our fault, in a way.

763
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 We've turned it red.

764
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 The red stuff is there, as in...

765
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 I think it is indeed our fault, yes.

766
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 The World Gravy Wrestling Championships.

767
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Gravy Wrestling.

768
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Gravy Wrestling takes place at the Rosenbowl Pub

769
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 in Rosendale in Lancashire.

770
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 And the Fire Brigade are always there.

771
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 What?

772
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Can't they just use the gravy if there's a fire?

773
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Yeah, deploy the gravy cannon.

774
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Can you guess why they're always there?

775
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 People get stuck.

776
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 No, people don't get stuck. They're covered in gravy.

777
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 You could drown in gravy, so they're sort of like a life rescue.

778
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 I guess the Fire Brigade would do that.

779
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 No, they just...

780
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 You need a big fire, you need a big flame to make all that gravy.

781
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 No, they just wash down the wrestlers between belts.

782
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Oh!

783
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Very good.

784
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 They specifically say that if you're a pro wrestler,

785
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 you shouldn't take parks, because it's just for fun.

786
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 It's like the people who win it are the people who have the best outfits

787
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 and who have the best style and stuff like that.

788
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 There was a professional wrestler called Tommy Jupiter who went and did it.

789
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Can you tell what the difference between pro wrestling and gravy wrestling is?

790
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 What's the biggest problem, perhaps, with gravy wrestling?

791
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Boiling water.

792
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Boiling water is not boiling hot gravy.

793
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 I should say it's cold gravy.

794
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Another year of third-degree burns at the gravy wrestling championships.

795
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Shall we go cold makeshift?

796
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 No, no.

797
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Apparently, you can't get grip on people,

798
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 but also it gets into your eyes and your ears,

799
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 and you can't see or hear anything,

800
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 and you just end up flailing around the whole time.

801
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

802
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 So, was this the pro wrestler's excuse for losing?

803
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Can I just quickly ask the room?

804
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Those of you here who are millennial or Gen Z,

805
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 if you know what roughly age group you're in, can you give me a chair?

806
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 And those who are, I know it's a slightly younger crowd,

807
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 so those who are over 50, give us a chair.

808
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 Okay, right, so the first lot,

809
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 if you like gravy of the millennials or Gen Z lot, give us a chair.

810
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Okay, that's completely ruined my fact, thank you.

811
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 And the slightly older group, the fifties and over,

812
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 if you like gravy, give me a chair.

813
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Okay, right, that's...

814
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Okay, now let's hear the fact.

815
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 The words I've got written down are,

816
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 "Young people don't like gravy anymore."

817
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Not in this room.

818
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 This room is the absolute nexus of young gravy lovers.

819
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 It doesn't surprise me that our fans are weirdo outliers.

820
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 So I'll give anything.

821
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 If we ask millennials or Gen Z,

822
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 give us a chair if you like Sherry.

823
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 See, I told you, weirdo outliers.

824
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 I was reading a lot of surveys about gravy

825
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 and about who likes it and who doesn't, and I did read...

826
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Okay, just listen to this, I'm quite indirectly right.

827
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 British people are so obsessed with gravy

828
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 that they drink it through straws, take it on holiday,

829
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 and even pour it over pizza and pasta.

830
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 This is a poll of 2,000 adults

831
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 that found that 13% of people eat it in the car,

832
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 11% carry it in a flask,

833
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 and 14% take it on holiday with them.

834
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 And this happens to be a survey commissioned by Schwartz Gravy.

835
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 Claudia Winkelman uses it to tan.

836
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Gravy, really? Yeah.

837
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 She does what she used to.

838
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 I think now she has someone else who sprays tan on her.

839
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 But yeah, when she was at uni...

840
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 What did she use? Like, painted on?

841
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Well, you know, all she did was she told women's hour

842
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 that she used gravy granules to generate her tan,

843
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 her fake tan at uni, when she first got obsessed with tanning.

844
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Didn't they do that in the while when they didn't have stockings?

845
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 They did. Yeah, darkened their legs with gravy, wartime thing.

846
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 But I don't think...

847
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 I don't think it was even Second World War

848
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 when Claudia Winkelman was at uni.

849
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

850
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 and that is my fact.

851
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 My fact this week is that every year,

852
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 on November 29th,

853
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 people in the Netherlands put a pancake on their head.

854
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 It's just a thing they do in the lead-up to the Christmas period.

855
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 It's what day is it today?

856
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 They get the pancakes out, and they just plop it on their head.

857
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Is this everyone?

858
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Like, if you watch the news, are they all wearing pancakes?

859
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 Exactly.

860
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Is it like a poppy, and if you don't wear it on TV,

861
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 then people really kick in?

862
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 It's a bloody pancake. It's so disrespectful.

863
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Yeah, this is a growing trend.

864
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 Basically, this erupted off the back of a cartoon

865
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 that was published in 1986,

866
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 where, in the cartoon, pancakes are put on their...

867
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 There's a long convoluted story,

868
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 but the basic premise is a joke is made,

869
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 a pancake is put on a head,

870
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 and it kind of just got picked up by people in the Netherlands,

871
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 and slowly, in the subsequent, what?

872
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 You know, 30-ish years,

873
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 people are now doing it to the point that

874
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 I've asked three people from the Netherlands,

875
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 they go, "Yeah, yeah, we do that."

876
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 So, effectively, in the cartoon,

877
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 for one of the reasons that it was used

878
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 is that it's very cold in late November,

879
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 and if you have a bald head or even a bald spot,

880
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 you can use the pancake as effectively...

881
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 No, not a reason. OK.

882
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Not the reason they're doing it.

883
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Not in the post-hat world.

884
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 No, yeah.

885
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 You're right. Before the invention of the hat,

886
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 and it is correct, this would be plausible.

887
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 Absolutely fair enough to know.

888
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 But you can't eat your hat afterwards, can you?

889
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 No, that's where the phrase comes from, doesn't it?

890
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 I mean, that's from when the hats were pancakes.

891
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 I'm sorry, I should have properly researched this.

892
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Made-up story from a comic book.

893
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Don't start where you can't finish, all right?

894
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 We've got more questions about this. OK, keep going.

895
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Do the pancakes end up being eaten, or are they disposed of?

896
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 No, I think... Oh, God, yeah.

897
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Do you eat your own pancake, or is it like you...

898
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 You see someone... What?

899
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Do you think that's a bit sexy?

900
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 You see someone else's pancake?

901
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Well, you see someone else's pancake.

902
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 And they've got a nice pancake on their head.

903
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

904
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 It gets to 11.59, and you're like, "Oh, look at your lips."

905
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 (LAUGHTER)

906
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Boy, you're both upside down, eating each other's pancakes, you know?

907
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 (LAUGHTER)

908
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Well, you'd think, given I'd spoke to three people who do this,

909
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 I would have asked more questions than just,

910
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 "Do you put it on your head?"

911
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Yeah, OK, good, thank you, goodbye.

912
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 But that's what happened, I just asked that one question.

913
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 Silly me, what a great question. Do they eat it afterwards?

914
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 I have no idea. I think they do.

915
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 OK, there we go. I believe they do.

916
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 And I think it's just for a photo, isn't it?

917
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Often, maybe the cheats do it for a photo.

918
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 And no toppings on the pancakes at the time, as far as I can tell.

919
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 Is it the sort of smaller diameter thicker pancakes,

920
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 or is it like the big crepes that you have?

921
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Oh, that's a great question.

922
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 Like thin or thick pancakes?

923
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 I think if I had a bald patch, I'd go for the thick, smaller one.

924
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 Yeah, but I've seen the photos, and they're more like the crepes.

925
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Yeah. Not to be like a yamlka, wouldn't it?

926
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 Well, that's what I was thinking it was. It was like a winter yamlka, which is...

927
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 But yeah, no, it's more like the bigger, a bucket hat.

928
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 So they are like the crepe ones, OK, good?

929
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Yeah.

930
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 All right.

931
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Any further?

932
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 I'm actually not taking any more questions at this time.

933
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 It is quite a niche, and it feels like quite a modern social media-driven tradition, isn't it?

934
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 Yeah.

935
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Well, people sharing pictures of themselves.

936
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 And I was looking at kind of weird modern Christmas traditions that grow.

937
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 So in Sweden, I don't think we've mentioned Kalle Anka before,

938
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 which is such a phenomenon.

939
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 So this is the fact that half of people in Sweden on Christmas Eve watch Donald Duck.

940
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 50% of the country.

941
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 Wow.

942
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Mid-40s percent since, you know, Netflix and stuff.

943
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 But yeah, and it's these Disney short cartoons that's been happening since 1959.

944
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 And I was reading an article by a guy who's going out with a Swedish girl,

945
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 and he spent Christmas with their family, and he said, "It's not at all a light-hearted thing.

946
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 You can not eat or prepare dinner while watching. Everyone sits very quietly and watches."

947
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Really?

948
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 "People plan their Christmas around it, so you've got lunch before Kalle Anka.

949
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 You've got Father Christmas comes after Kalle Anka.

950
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 But when that's on, you've all got to watch."

951
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 And they've seen it, you know, 40, 50, 60 times before.

952
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 And the biggest complaint scandals in Swedish television come

953
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 the few times that they suggest cancelling it.

954
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 I think the 1970s, they said they wanted to alter it or cancel it.

955
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 And yeah, huge outcry.

956
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 It's the same cartoon, like five-minute shorts every time.

957
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Yeah.

958
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Like, "Wow."

959
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Yeah.

960
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 A series of cartoons.

961
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 That's amazing. What country do you say?

962
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 In Sweden and also in Denmark, I think they do it as well.

963
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 Wow.

964
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 Is anyone from Sweden or Denmark in the audience?

965
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 And Norway.

966
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 And Norway.

967
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 And so you guys do that?

968
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Yeah.

969
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Wow. Do you like it?

970
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 The first ten times was okay.

971
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 The first ten times was okay.

972
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 There's a guy called Arne Weiss, who is a presenter in Sweden.

973
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 And he was the presenter of the show that kind of hosted it.

974
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 And he said it broke up three of his marriages.

975
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 What?

976
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 Sorry, wait.

977
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Again, who would like to take first question on this one?

978
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Donald Duck.

979
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 Do we know how?

980
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 Like, was he walking around like Donald Duck without any trousers on?

981
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 And kept bumping into other women.

982
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Wait, him presenting it broke up three of his marriages?

983
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 This feels like a lot of transference by him.

984
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 I think he did drink a lot as well.

985
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 No, no, he had to present it every year.

986
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 And one year he said, "Do you mind if I record it in advance?"

987
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 Because it is literally the same thing every year.

988
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Record it in advance and I can spend Christmas with my family.

989
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 And Rumour got out that he wanted to record it in advance.

990
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 And there was genuine proper public outcry.

991
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 The media got hold of it and said, "Absolutely not.

992
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 It has to be live. It has to be Christmas Eve."

993
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 And Christmas Eve, I think, is a bigger deal on Christmas Day.

994
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 Not those places.

995
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 And it broke up as marriages.

996
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 It's not like we're getting brownie points, if anything.

997
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 No, because it's on the rocks already.

998
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 The wife said, "Get back to your producers and tell them you're not going in this year."

999
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 He's asked them, he's come back till between his legs.

1000
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 And the producer's like...

1001
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 That's, whoa, gosh, poor guy.

1002
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 Poor guy?

1003
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 Yeah.

1004
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Spending Christmas with your family is kind of a modern tradition.

1005
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 I guess, in this country.

1006
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 And apparently spending Christmas with your in-laws

1007
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 can have a detrimental effect on your bowels.

1008
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 This is a study in 2016 that collected gut bacteria

1009
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 from people who had spent Christmas in their own family

1010
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 or people who had spent Christmas with their in-laws.

1011
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 And they found a significant decrease in the Ruminococcus species

1012
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 in people who visited in-laws.

1013
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 And if you don't have as much of this kind of gut bacteria,

1014
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 it's associated with stress, with depression,

1015
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 and it can give you very loose bowels.

1016
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Right.

1017
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Is it the stress and depression that causes the bacterial thing?

1018
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 That's what we're thinking, yeah, exactly.

1019
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 So it's more stressful and depressing to be?

1020
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 It's more stressful for you because you're with your in-laws,

1021
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 you have less of this bacteria, you need to go to the toilet more.

1022
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Right.

1023
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 And we're sure it's not just an excuse.

1024
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 The scientists writing this, we're visiting their in-laws,

1025
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 and they just want to excuse themselves for the 19th time at Christmas.

1026
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 Oh, where's Daniel? Oh, it's just the bowel thing.

1027
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 You wrote that study, didn't you? Yeah.

1028
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 In these papers, the scientists are always really rigorous,

1029
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 and they give their, like, caveats in case there's anything.

1030
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 They said, "It is possible that participants

1031
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 "with greater aversion towards their in-laws

1032
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 "have used the excuse of participating in a scientific study

1033
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 "addressing Christmas poo

1034
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 "to not visit their in-laws during Christmas."

1035
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 Well, just while I remember, as well as a pumpkin spice latte,

1036
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 Starbucks also recently released an olive oil latte,

1037
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 and allegedly, if you have it, you may shit yourself.

1038
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 So, be near a toilet if you go there.

1039
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 Yeah. I mean, with a latte, you're in danger of shitting yourself anyway, right?

1040
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Exactly. Then put some oil in.

1041
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 Well, that's the thing, it's like, yeah, the oil loosens you up,

1042
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 and the coffee makes you want to go.

1043
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 Lubricates. Yeah.

1044
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 Sorry, why would anyone order an olive oil latte?

1045
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 That sounds absolutely foul.

1046
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 It's much smoother, apparently.

1047
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 I mean...

1048
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 I wasn't struggling.

1049
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 I wasn't treating it normal latte like it was made of gravel.

1050
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 I'd be like...

1051
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 I know I'm not a frontier pioneer kind of guy,

1052
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 but I'm capable of getting to the end of a latte

1053
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 without, you know, lacerating my throat.

1054
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 All right, can I tell you about another tradition?

1055
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 Yeah. It's an old tradition, actually.

1056
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 This is a very ancient French tradition.

1057
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 It's called the Feast of the Ass,

1058
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 and it dates back to Grow Up.

1059
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 It's also known as the Feast of the Donkey,

1060
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 but it's much less funny.

1061
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 And it's basically that you take a donkey...

1062
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 Take it where, Andy?

1063
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 You take it to church, actually.

1064
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 Do you? Yeah, you take the donkey through the town,

1065
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 and then it's...

1066
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 And then you take it...

1067
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 Well, guys, there's literally everything you say

1068
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 sounds like a useless thing.

1069
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 No, I can't...

1070
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 I can't sort of track, I'm in a maze.

1071
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 And it is suggestive.

1072
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 Often there's someone riding the donkey,

1073
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 and it goes into the...

1074
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 I'm just trying to whip through all the innuendo,

1075
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 so we can, you know, like...

1076
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 And it stands next to the altar in the church,

1077
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 and the priest does the sermon,

1078
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 and then at the end of the sermon,

1079
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 the priest and the congregation,

1080
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 they both do a call and response,

1081
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 kind of mimicking the donkey's voice.

1082
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 They all go...

1083
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 And it's a really fun thing to do.

1084
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 It's like a cross-century, so this is...

1085
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 This is as fun as life gets, basically.

1086
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 And then you have a raucous party outside,

1087
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 and it's basically that old Christmas tradition

1088
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 of inverting normal society.

1089
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 Well, a lot of misrule.

1090
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 A lot of misrule.

1091
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 The bosses are not in charge, the servants are in charge,

1092
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 all of that, and it's basically all folded into that.

1093
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 Yeah, but that was Christmas for centuries,

1094
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 was not a family affair,

1095
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 it wasn't something sort of pleasant and homely,

1096
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 and, like, Christmassy and snugly.

1097
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 It was, like, out in the streets,

1098
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 there's a whiff of violence and a lot of alcohol.

1099
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 And a lot of shagging, I think.

1100
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 I seem to have my feet to the ass.

1101
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 There were a lot of people...

1102
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 A lot of pancake gone through, yeah.

1103
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 I think so.

1104
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 West Sailing was another thing they did, wasn't there?

1105
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 Was that it? West Sailing?

1106
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 I don't really know what West Sailing is.

1107
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 It's when you go house to house singing,

1108
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 basically, and they give you, like,

1109
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 some money or some candy or whatever.

1110
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 Oh, yeah.

1111
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 But traditionally, it was...

1112
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 It was, like, over a thousand years old,

1113
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 maybe the idea of it.

1114
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 And what would happen was the lords of the Manor

1115
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 would be in their house,

1116
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 and the local people would go around to their house

1117
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 and would sail, and they'd be given gifts

1118
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 by the Lord of the Manor.

1119
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 It's kind of like Christmas trick-or-treating.

1120
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 It is, apart from the fact that the gift that they got

1121
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 given was often animal manure.

1122
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 Oh!

1123
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 Because in those days, obviously,

1124
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 you know, it was good for growing your plants

1125
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 and crops and stuff like that.

1126
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 Very hard to wrap, though.

1127
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 Yeah.

1128
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 Oh, what could it be?

1129
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Is it maybe the tricycle

1130
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 my little boy's been asking for?

1131
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 You could mold it into deceptive shapes

1132
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 to get people's hopes up.

1133
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 Yeah.

1134
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 It's very hard to wrap if you've had a dolly by a latte.

1135
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 Oh, God.

1136
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 I found a few other Dutch traditions.

1137
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 So there's this thing that they do in the Netherlands,

1138
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 which is they'll take children,

1139
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 sort of about ten to ten years old,

1140
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 sort of about ten to 13,

1141
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 about that sort of age,

1142
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 and they just drop them off

1143
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 in the woods at the middle of the night.

1144
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 They just drop them off.

1145
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 Is this Hans Lund Gretel you've been reading?

1146
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 It's basically this thing. It's a scout thing

1147
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 where they just get them into a car in the middle of the night.

1148
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 They drop them off at the woods, and they just have to find their way back.

1149
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 And they say that in the towns, at like 2 to 3 a.m.,

1150
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 these kids come stumbling.

1151
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 Yeah, it's a genuine tradition.

1152
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 Again, I spoke to three people who've done it,

1153
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 and I asked one question of them

1154
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 and then hung up.

1155
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 And then there's this other amazing thing,

1156
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 which I think is really sweet.

1157
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 In the Netherlands, there's this town that's called Margretten,

1158
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 and it has an American cemetery.

1159
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 And so there are 8,300 Americans

1160
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 who were buried there from the Second World War.

1161
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 And there's a thing that they have there,

1162
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 which is you adopt a grave.

1163
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 And so each family goes,

1164
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 and they maintain the grave,

1165
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 and they bring flowers every weekend and so on,

1166
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
 and they make sure that the person

1167
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 is being remembered and looked after.

1168
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 Quite a cool tradition.

1169
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Yeah. Do you guys know Elf on the Shelf?

1170
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 Oh, yeah.

1171
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 Do you know what Elf on the Shelf is?

1172
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 Again, I'm clinging on by my fingernails to Elf on the Shelf.

1173
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 I don't really know what it is.

1174
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 So it's where you, as a parent,

1175
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 mostly in America, you buy an Elf on the Shelf

1176
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 and you hide it in a different place in the house

1177
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 every day in the Christmas period.

1178
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 We do it at home. It's a little stuffed toy elf.

1179
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 Yeah, and you put it up and it's like,

1180
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 "What's he doing up there today?"

1181
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 "What's she hiding in that cupboard for today?"

1182
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 Not, though, that the Elf is watching over you

1183
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 and making sure that you're not naughty.

1184
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 That's what I thought it was.

1185
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 That's exactly correct, yes.

1186
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 So I thought it'd been around forever Elf on the Shelf,

1187
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 but it's based on a 2005 self-published book.

1188
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 It must be the most successful self-published book ever

1189
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 by a mother and daughter

1190
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 who told this story to each other about these elves

1191
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 that spy on the kids before Christmas

1192
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 and report back to Santa every night,

1193
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 whether they've been naughty or nice,

1194
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 and they fly back in the morning

1195
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 and hide in a different place.

1196
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 And, yeah, it's been on the bestseller list

1197
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 every year since 2013,

1198
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 which is quite good for a self-published book.

1199
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 And it came with a free, like, elf

1200
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 that you sit on your shelf.

1201
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 But, yeah, it's caused so much outrage.
