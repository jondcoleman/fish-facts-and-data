00:00:00,00:00:05,Hello and welcome to the No Such Things as Fish Queens Jubilee Garden Party!
00:00:05,00:00:07,Woo!
00:00:07,00:00:15,Dan Schreiber is over there getting together all of his dubious memorabilia about the Role Family that he bought off eBay.
00:00:15,00:00:25,"Alex Bell is over there, alphabetising all of his VHS's of the Queen's Speech from over the years, filing them all under Q."
00:00:25,00:00:36,There's Anna at the Pim's Tent drinking it dry and there's Andy making a portrait of one of the Queen's Sons out of moss.
00:00:36,00:00:39,"Oh, not that one, Andy. Oh, no."
00:00:39,00:00:50,"Anyway, we are here today because we have an extra day off work and we thought what better than to give you a sneaky bonus episode of Fish."
00:00:50,00:00:57,So here is another mini compilation of 30 minutes of silliness. Really hope you enjoy it.
00:00:57,00:01:04,"We'll be back again next week with a normal episode, but in the meantime, on with the podcast!"
00:01:04,00:01:21,[Music]
00:01:21,00:01:25,"All right, it is time for our final fact and that is Andy's fact."
00:01:25,00:01:29,Andy's fact this week is that!
00:01:29,00:01:32,What was that? Are you objecting to how I presented that?
00:01:32,00:01:34,"No, no. You're doing a great job. Keep it up."
00:01:34,00:01:38,"Yeah, thank you. I'm mixing it up a bit. You know, you try something new. It doesn't work. You move on."
00:01:38,00:01:42,"Please, Andy. This is Andy's little nugget of joy coming up next."
00:01:42,00:01:46,"You really threw Andy there. Like, I think I could see Andy was just completely thrown."
00:01:46,00:01:50,"He looked at what he's written on his hand and went, ""I don't know what to do now."""
00:01:50,00:01:54,"She's gone off script. No. Mum, let me out."
00:01:54,00:02:02,"This is something that's not very well-sourced, so forgive me, but I know very slightly know someone whose dad used to be in the Navy."
00:02:02,00:02:08,"Right. And the claim from him is that, stick with it."
00:02:08,00:02:15,"He says that the last case of scurvy that happened in the Royal Navy, the British Royal Navy, was in the 1970s."
00:02:15,00:02:17,Really? Really? Nice.
00:02:17,00:02:20,Didn't James Blunt claim that he had scurvy?
00:02:20,00:02:23,"Yes, he did. He said that he was James Blunt."
00:02:23,00:02:28,"Sorry. You know, this is according to him, so whether this is true or not."
00:02:28,00:02:33,"So, he said he was at university and all the people in his class were all vegans and vegetarians."
00:02:33,00:02:42,"And he was really, he didn't like this and he thought, ""Right, I'm going to stick it to them and somehow stick it to them by only eating meat."""
00:02:42,00:02:48,And so he decided that all he was going to eat was mince and bacon and stuff like that.
00:02:48,00:02:56,"And he went on just a meat-only diet and he said that after a while he went to his doctor and his doctor said, ""Yeah, you've got scurvy."""
00:02:56,00:03:02,"Wow. I'm slightly suspicious of that, partly because there is vitamin C in meat, as long as it's fresh meat."
00:03:02,00:03:05,"There's vitamin C in that. He was one of the reasons... He was only eating very old meat, that's the thing."
00:03:05,00:03:09,He's very teeth-plunged and he will only eat very discounted elderly meat.
00:03:09,00:03:14,"He said that he lived on mince, some chicken and maybe some mayonnaise."
00:03:14,00:03:21,God. And then he said that his doctor said that he might have scurvy and so he took to drinking orange juice every night.
00:03:21,00:03:26,"And then he got acid reflux, so it was a bad time for old blunts."
00:03:26,00:03:31,Way to stick it to the vegetarians though. They must have really regretted their life choices.
00:03:31,00:03:38,"The helicopter method, they used that in the early days of the pandemic, didn't they, where they were getting people to go off parks."
00:03:38,00:03:43,"And so, yeah, yeah, they would bring helicopters in and just tilt them in the wind, just trying to push people off them."
00:03:43,00:03:45,Really? Yeah. Have you not seen the corners of that?
00:03:45,00:03:48,That just seems quite dangerous to fly a helicopter so low as well.
00:03:48,00:03:53,"It does seem a bit dangerous, I guess with the angle they were just pushing a push down wind."
00:03:53,00:03:57,You don't mean they were physically using the draft of the helicopter blades to push people out of parks.
00:03:57,00:04:01,They were telling them to get off and they were giving them a message with the wind.
00:04:01,00:04:04,"I don't think the wind was so great, they were literally..."
00:04:04,00:04:09,One of the great joys of the pandemic was looking out of your window to see people flying past.
00:04:09,00:04:14,Has anyone had a Vietnamese dish called Cao LÃ o?
00:04:14,00:04:15,"No, don't think so."
00:04:15,00:04:18,"Has anyone been to Vietnam? No, no. Well, then you definitely haven't had it."
00:04:18,00:04:20,Is it only allowed to be sold there?
00:04:20,00:04:26,It's not that. You can only make it in a very specific town called Hai An.
00:04:26,00:04:30,"Right, why do you think you can only make this in that particular town?"
00:04:30,00:04:31,It's a noodle dish.
00:04:31,00:04:38,"There's only... Okay, the noodles come from a special kind of wheat, which is grown only in Hai An."
00:04:38,00:04:41,It's a secret ingredient from a lady called Anne.
00:04:41,00:04:44,"Much better, much better."
00:04:44,00:04:46,"What it is, you're not going to guess, Anne, are you?"
00:04:46,00:04:50,Is it you have to greet the person who makes it with your Hai?
00:04:50,00:04:55,There's only one person who makes it. They've trademarked it and they say Hai
00:04:55,00:04:57,and then give you this noodle dish so you have to meet them.
00:04:57,00:05:01,I really like the way you thought that maybe it's because it's called Hai An.
00:05:01,00:05:04,"Probably I pronounced that wrong, so..."
00:05:04,00:05:09,"But anyway, so the reason you can only make it here is because you need to use a very specific"
00:05:09,00:05:13,water for the noodles and it has to come out of a very particular well in the town.
00:05:13,00:05:17,"And if you don't take the water out of this well, they're not authentic noodles."
00:05:17,00:05:21,So it's like herbs with noodles on top and then crispy pork on top of that.
00:05:21,00:05:24,But the noodles have to be made with this very specific water
00:05:24,00:05:29,and they have to be mixed with the ash from the wood of a very specific local tree.
00:05:29,00:05:34,"So you're kind of close with your wheat thing, Anne, called Kajaput."
00:05:34,00:05:36,"And apparently, if you do that, it gives..."
00:05:36,00:05:40,The water's got alum in and a few other minerals and it gives the noodles a real chewy texture
00:05:40,00:05:43,and a burnt flavour that you can't get anywhere else in the world.
00:05:43,00:05:44,"Oh, that's so cool."
00:05:44,00:05:45,It is cool.
00:05:45,00:05:46,"James, have you..."
00:05:46,00:05:47,I've never been to Vietnam.
00:05:47,00:05:51,"I was going to say, have you travelled specifically to Vietnam?"
00:05:51,00:05:53,"If I ever go to Vietnam, I'm going here."
00:05:53,00:05:55,"There's no doubt about that, but no, I haven't."
00:05:55,00:05:56,"Oh, say hi to Anne when you're there."
00:05:56,00:06:01,"You know, we were talking about setting fire to things earlier, the ashes."
00:06:01,00:06:04,"Okay, so that's Australia versus England."
00:06:04,00:06:08,"And the story goes that in 1882, Australia beat England"
00:06:08,00:06:11,and one of the newspapers called it the death of English cricket
00:06:11,00:06:15,and that the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.
00:06:15,00:06:19,And so they supposedly burnt the bales of the cricket wickets
00:06:19,00:06:23,"and they put it in a little urn and that became the prize and that's the prize we use today,"
00:06:23,00:06:28,"which is very amusing and whatever, but probably not for the relatives of a man"
00:06:28,00:06:31,who was at the match in 1882 and died in the middle of the match.
00:06:31,00:06:33,"Oh, ouch, ouch."
00:06:33,00:06:34,"Oh, no."
00:06:34,00:06:37,So they did this kind of fake thing about all the death of cricket
00:06:37,00:06:39,and burned all the ashes and put them in an urn and stuff
00:06:39,00:06:41,and there was a guy who actually died in the match.
00:06:41,00:06:43,"Wow, but they didn't incorporate him."
00:06:43,00:06:43,"No, no."
00:06:43,00:06:44,Okay.
00:06:44,00:06:45,"But that was, when did you say that?"
00:06:45,00:06:46,That was 1882.
00:06:46,00:06:47,"1882, yeah."
00:06:47,00:06:49,Because do you remember we talked about cremation a few weeks ago?
00:06:49,00:06:49,Yeah.
00:06:49,00:06:52,And it was a kind of a new science at the time
00:06:52,00:06:55,and it was actually quite controversial and it was just starting out.
00:06:55,00:06:56,That's really interesting.
00:06:56,00:06:59,"Early crematoria were, there was only about one in the UK at the time."
00:06:59,00:07:03,"So probably the reason was it was quite zeitgeisty at the time, right?"
00:07:03,00:07:03,Yeah.
00:07:03,00:07:06,That's why they thought we'll burn the ashes and that's why we have the ashes
00:07:06,00:07:08,because cremation was zeitgeisty at the time.
00:07:08,00:07:08,Wow.
00:07:08,00:07:11,We could have buried them in a graveyard.
00:07:11,00:07:15,"But they're in a museum here, aren't they?"
00:07:15,00:07:17,"Yeah, they stay in lords all the time."
00:07:17,00:07:20,"They stay in lords and the museum has, it's got the ashes"
00:07:20,00:07:22,and it's also got a dead bird just sitting there.
00:07:22,00:07:22,Does it?
00:07:22,00:07:26,"Yeah, it was a bird that was killed during a match, a famous match and yeah."
00:07:26,00:07:28,It was kind of killed.
00:07:28,00:07:29,As in by a ball hitter.
00:07:29,00:07:31,I think a flying ball hitter or a batsman accidentally.
00:07:31,00:07:32,"Yeah, something occurred."
00:07:32,00:07:35,The bird died and it's now in the museum.
00:07:35,00:07:38,It was a robin and the batsman because they didn't have the sight screens
00:07:38,00:07:42,"at the time, the robin got confused and smashed it from the sky."
00:07:42,00:07:45,Duck is also a thing in cricket that you could have used in that joke as well.
00:07:45,00:07:48,"Yeah, but not a birdie because that's the wrong sport."
00:07:48,00:07:49,"That's a golfing thing, isn't it?"
00:07:49,00:07:51,Like an an eagle as well.
00:07:51,00:07:53,All these paths that might have been for that one.
00:07:53,00:07:54,Not very good joke.
00:07:54,00:08:01,Paul Morgan in 2018 had the longest birthday ever
00:08:01,00:08:03,enjoyed by anyone on the planet.
00:08:03,00:08:05,He had a 48 hour birthday.
00:08:05,00:08:07,Did he do it with an international date line?
00:08:07,00:08:09,"He said he did, he lives in Hawaii."
00:08:09,00:08:10,He lives in Hawaii.
00:08:10,00:08:14,He flew from Samoa to Auckland to Los Angeles and then back to Hawaii
00:08:14,00:08:17,and he had to cross the international date line in one very narrow window.
00:08:17,00:08:21,So there was a one hour period where the two time zones he was crossing
00:08:21,00:08:23,"were in the same day, if you see what I mean."
00:08:23,00:08:24,And he had to cross in that one hour window
00:08:24,00:08:27,and he made it by one minute and five seconds.
00:08:27,00:08:28,That's so impressive.
00:08:28,00:08:30,"If the flight, the plane he was on,"
00:08:30,00:08:32,"which he had no control over obviously was a passenger flight,"
00:08:32,00:08:35,"had been two minutes earlier, it would all have been for nothing."
00:08:35,00:08:37,I mean arguably it was all for nothing.
00:08:37,00:08:39,"Yeah, because he had a really long birthday"
00:08:39,00:08:42,but it was all spent on an aeroplane.
00:08:42,00:08:46,"Exactly, he spent his entire 48 hours on a cramped airline."
00:08:46,00:08:48,"Yeah, and it's like you live in Hawaii, dude."
00:08:48,00:08:52,Just stay in Hawaii and have an amazing time.
00:08:52,00:08:54,Yeah.
00:08:54,00:08:57,Have you guys heard of St Kevin and the Nettles?
00:08:57,00:08:58,Sounds like a band.
00:08:58,00:09:00,It does be a great band.
00:09:00,00:09:00,Really does.
00:09:00,00:09:02,I'm St Kevin and these are the Nettles.
00:09:02,00:09:06,I can't figure out who sounds more lame.
00:09:06,00:09:08,Kevin or his Nettles.
00:09:08,00:09:13,"St Kevin, was he either feeling he was either an Irish or a Welsh saint"
00:09:13,00:09:14,"and probably wrong about this,"
00:09:14,00:09:16,but I think he once floated to Ireland on the leaf.
00:09:16,00:09:18,But am I wrong about that?
00:09:18,00:09:19,"Well, he was Irish."
00:09:19,00:09:22,I actually don't know about his leaf based record.
00:09:22,00:09:24,It sounds entirely plausible.
00:09:24,00:09:25,In Saint World.
00:09:25,00:09:27,"Yeah, that sounds like small potatoes."
00:09:27,00:09:30,Yeah. So there are two stories about him in Nettles.
00:09:30,00:09:33,One is that he only lived on Nettles for a while during Lent
00:09:33,00:09:35,"and started losing a lot of weight,"
00:09:35,00:09:37,and then someone started sneaking in food.
00:09:37,00:09:39,"The other story is that he was, when he was young,"
00:09:39,00:09:41,he was in the wilderness and he was praying.
00:09:41,00:09:44,"And a young lady was passing by, beautiful young lady,"
00:09:44,00:09:47,"and fell madly in love with him because he was very, very hot young."
00:09:47,00:09:49,I didn't even know if he was a saint at this point.
00:09:49,00:09:54,He was just a hot young priest having a pray and she saw it.
00:09:54,00:09:56,She could say in the future I fancied him before he was a saint.
00:09:56,00:09:59,"You know, back when he was just a humble, hot young priest."
00:09:59,00:10:01,And he thought a lot of her too.
00:10:01,00:10:06,"And so, to cure his lust, he rolled in a bed of Nettles"
00:10:06,00:10:08,until his lust was cooled.
00:10:08,00:10:10,And he also suggested she do the same thing.
00:10:10,00:10:11,And she did.
00:10:11,00:10:13,And later on she became a nun.
00:10:13,00:10:15,And no one had any fun at all.
00:10:15,00:10:15,And that's the story.
00:10:15,00:10:18,"And that's how you're raising your children, isn't it Andy?"
00:10:18,00:10:24,"If someone turns up at your house to live your Grammy,"
00:10:24,00:10:25,"would they be a Grammy, Graham?"
00:10:25,00:10:27,Very good.
00:10:27,00:10:28,Like a kiss a Graham or a...
00:10:28,00:10:29,"Yeah, no, you're nice."
00:10:29,00:10:30,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you get it?"
00:10:30,00:10:30,"Yeah. Good, yeah."
00:10:30,00:10:31,So that's a...
00:10:31,00:10:33,Yes.
00:10:33,00:10:34,Yeah.
00:10:34,00:10:35,"No, it's a joke."
00:10:35,00:10:38,"If you're listening to this,"
00:10:38,00:10:41,it might feel like someone edited in a pause.
00:10:41,00:10:47,That actually was how long it took everyone to recover from that joke.
00:10:47,00:10:53,Sometimes people just try to hold it together in these recording sessions
00:10:53,00:10:54,"and it's just, you know."
00:10:54,00:11:00,"Anyway, just one quick thing on jet engines."
00:11:00,00:11:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:01,00:11:04,I was reading about the procedures
00:11:04,00:11:06,by which they test jet engines these days.
00:11:06,00:11:07,"Because I know, I think we've mentioned before,"
00:11:07,00:11:09,"the chicken cannon, where they fire a bird."
00:11:09,00:11:11,So that's Royce used to fire frozen chickens.
00:11:11,00:11:12,"Yeah, exactly."
00:11:12,00:11:13,Yeah.
00:11:13,00:11:14,And there are all these procedures.
00:11:14,00:11:16,So there's General Electric have these machines
00:11:16,00:11:19,which have to create any weather for the engine.
00:11:19,00:11:20,So you see what I mean?
00:11:20,00:11:22,They're testing the jet engine in a big harness.
00:11:22,00:11:23,"When they say any weather,"
00:11:23,00:11:26,they probably don't do like just a nice day.
00:11:26,00:11:29,They don't do gentle breeze clouds.
00:11:29,00:11:31,"They just do the extreme weather, that's right."
00:11:31,00:11:32,Imagine that.
00:11:32,00:11:34,They only test the engine in extreme conditions.
00:11:34,00:11:38,They don't realize that's the one thing it can't cope with.
00:11:38,00:11:39,It's clement weather.
00:11:39,00:11:42,"It's like 12 degrees, a little bit of a breeze."
00:11:42,00:11:43,But a nice sunny day.
00:11:43,00:11:45,"So that when you're in the sun,"
00:11:45,00:11:46,it actually feels quite warm.
00:11:46,00:11:47,But when you're in...
00:11:47,00:11:48,No.
00:11:48,00:11:49,Disaster.
00:11:49,00:11:49,Yeah.
00:11:49,00:11:51,"But there's, so there's one other they do,"
00:11:51,00:11:53,which is called the blade off procedure.
00:11:53,00:11:54,"And I don't know if we've mentioned this actually,"
00:11:54,00:11:58,where they explode one of the blades at the base
00:11:58,00:11:59,to see what happens.
00:11:59,00:12:02,"But I mean, to see that the engine can stay functioning"
00:12:02,00:12:03,even if it loses a blade.
00:12:03,00:12:04,It's kind of reassuring
00:12:04,00:12:06,"because they test these things so rigorously, you know."
00:12:06,00:12:07,What's the answer?
00:12:07,00:12:09,Can it just in case that happens?
00:12:09,00:12:10,"Sometimes it passes, sometimes it fails"
00:12:10,00:12:12,and they normally wave it through in either case.
00:12:12,00:12:19,"Some of the most famous stained glass in England,"
00:12:19,00:12:21,"anyway, is at Canterbury Cathedral."
00:12:21,00:12:23,"And there's some which is so old that, you know,"
00:12:23,00:12:26,"so Thomas Beckett, the Archbishop was killed in..."
00:12:26,00:12:27,1170.
00:12:27,00:12:27,Yeah.
00:12:27,00:12:30,"So there are some windows which are older than that,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,meaning that they would have been in place at the time.
00:12:32,00:12:33,"But there are also,"
00:12:33,00:12:35,"there are windows that were created slightly later,"
00:12:35,00:12:38,which are referring to all the miracles
00:12:38,00:12:42,that were done by Thomas Beckett after he died.
00:12:42,00:12:43,Didn't we talk about him before?
00:12:43,00:12:44,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:44,00:12:47,"He was, his body was turned into some kind of homeopathic medicine."
00:12:47,00:12:49,"Basically, yeah, you would, yeah, exactly."
00:12:49,00:12:51,"They used some of his blood and they diluted it so much,"
00:12:51,00:12:52,but then they kept selling the water.
00:12:52,00:12:55,"And so, but there are incredible scenes"
00:12:55,00:12:58,in the stained glass window of people coming and being healed.
00:12:58,00:13:00,"So one of them is Islewood of Westoning,"
00:13:00,00:13:05,who prayed to St. Thomas after he was blinded
00:13:05,00:13:07,and castrated for petty theft.
00:13:07,00:13:09,He'd committed some petty theft
00:13:09,00:13:10,"and he was blinded and castrated as a result,"
00:13:10,00:13:11,which feels harsh.
00:13:11,00:13:12,It feels harsh.
00:13:12,00:13:14,"He went to Canterbury, prayed to Thomas"
00:13:14,00:13:17,and his genitals were restored big time.
00:13:17,00:13:18,Big time.
00:13:18,00:13:18,Big time.
00:13:18,00:13:22,"The window, there's a stained glass window, which shows..."
00:13:22,00:13:22,"No, it can't."
00:13:22,00:13:24,"No, no, no, it doesn't change."
00:13:24,00:13:24,I'm letting it finish.
00:13:24,00:13:29,It shows him after the prayer and after the miracle
00:13:29,00:13:33,"and behind him is a tree, which has these three huge leaves,"
00:13:33,00:13:34,which symbolize his restored genitals.
00:13:34,00:13:35,He got three of them.
00:13:35,00:13:37,He got three.
00:13:37,00:13:38,"He got three penises, that is."
00:13:38,00:13:39,Yeah.
00:13:39,00:13:40,"Well, there's one, so there's one leaf of,"
00:13:40,00:13:41,I don't want to be crude.
00:13:41,00:13:42,One leaf is the penises too.
00:13:42,00:13:45,"It's representing a, basically, it's a cock and balls"
00:13:45,00:13:49,in tree form to symbolize his renewed nads.
00:13:49,00:13:52,There's a cock and balls in Canterbury Cathedral
00:13:52,00:13:53,stained glass that you've got to do tours
00:13:53,00:13:56,of Canterbury Cathedral to tell the school children that.
00:13:56,00:13:59,"You know, the Seminole people have their own Bigfoot."
00:13:59,00:14:02,The Seminole people have the Skunk Ape of Florida.
00:14:02,00:14:03,"Oh, oh, yeah."
00:14:03,00:14:04,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:04,00:14:07,"I have a mug at home, which is the Skunk Ape of Florida,"
00:14:07,00:14:09,which James gave to me off the back of a holiday.
00:14:09,00:14:09,Was that the holiday?
00:14:09,00:14:12,"It was, it was like a museum to the Skunk Ape or something"
00:14:12,00:14:14,"and I thought you the mug, yeah."
00:14:14,00:14:17,"And we based, this is inside baseball again,"
00:14:17,00:14:20,but we based the design of our No Such Thing as a Fish mug
00:14:20,00:14:20,on that mug.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Did we?
00:14:21,00:14:21,Yeah.
00:14:21,00:14:24,"Same colors, same sort of style, yeah."
00:14:24,00:14:26,We already had the colors to be fair.
00:14:26,00:14:27,"No, because it's a blue mug."
00:14:27,00:14:28,The No Such Thing as a Fish mug?
00:14:28,00:14:29,Yeah.
00:14:29,00:14:30,It's not blue.
00:14:30,00:14:30,It's black.
00:14:30,00:14:31,"Oh, did we go black in the end?"
00:14:31,00:14:31,Yeah.
00:14:31,00:14:32,With yellow on the inside?
00:14:32,00:14:33,"We went with yellow and black,"
00:14:33,00:14:35,which are the colors we've used for the podcast
00:14:35,00:14:36,for the last eight years.
00:14:36,00:14:37,Controversial.
00:14:37,00:14:37,I don't know.
00:14:37,00:14:40,You'll spin off mug industry.
00:14:40,00:14:42,"Well, it was based on that, which was blue and yellow."
00:14:42,00:14:43,That's fun.
00:14:43,00:14:45,"Yeah, it's all falling together."
00:14:45,00:14:48,That's so far inside baseball.
00:14:48,00:14:50,You've come out the other end.
00:14:50,00:14:54,Our mug is based on a mug that I love that.
00:14:54,00:14:55,"Well, look, I did expect it to come up."
00:14:55,00:14:58,"There's an interesting thing that I quite like,"
00:14:58,00:15:00,"which was in ancient Greece,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,you might have two ages kind of.
00:15:02,00:15:05,"So you would have Kronos,"
00:15:05,00:15:07,which is the amount of time that went since you were born.
00:15:07,00:15:09,And so that's like an objective.
00:15:09,00:15:10,This is how old you are.
00:15:10,00:15:12,I'm 43 years old or whatever.
00:15:12,00:15:14,"And they would also have Kairos,"
00:15:14,00:15:18,which was your own personal sense of time passing.
00:15:18,00:15:20,"So if you felt much younger than you actually were,"
00:15:20,00:15:22,that would be your Kairos.
00:15:22,00:15:24,"So in my Kairos, I feel about 21,"
00:15:24,00:15:26,"but in my Kronos, I'm 43."
00:15:26,00:15:28,You were never 21.
00:15:28,00:15:30,"Even in your Kronos team, you were never 20."
00:15:30,00:15:33,You came out fully born.
00:15:33,00:15:35,The ancient Greeks are actually where we get
00:15:35,00:15:37,"a lot of our birthday celebrations,"
00:15:37,00:15:38,which I genuinely find quite surprising
00:15:38,00:15:39,because it's the sort of thing you read
00:15:39,00:15:40,and you think that's got to be a myth.
00:15:40,00:15:44,"And then we can actually trace the birthday cake from then,"
00:15:44,00:15:46,when they used to celebrate Artemis' birthday.
00:15:46,00:15:48,You could work out the birthday of the birthday cake.
00:15:48,00:15:51,"The birthday of the birthday cake is, yeah,"
00:15:51,00:15:54,"17th of December, 5000 BC."
00:15:54,00:15:56,"And birthday candles, they were your Greeks as well."
00:15:56,00:15:57,"They were, weren't they?"
00:15:57,00:15:58,Really?
00:15:58,00:15:59,"But yeah, it was for Artemis."
00:15:59,00:15:59,"For a long time,"
00:15:59,00:16:03,people only celebrated God's and King's birthdays in Queens.
00:16:03,00:16:04,"So you would have had a celebration in UCI, I suppose,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,but the rest of us would have been.
00:16:06,00:16:07,We'd have been lost.
00:16:07,00:16:10,"And they celebrated Artemis and, you know,"
00:16:10,00:16:12,"had these moon-shaped cakes that are always described as,"
00:16:12,00:16:14,which surely is just a cake.
00:16:14,00:16:17,And then it was a different moon shape
00:16:17,00:16:18,once you'd eaten some of the cake.
00:16:18,00:16:21,"Yeah, maybe you had to eat it like you were waning it."
00:16:21,00:16:23,"Yeah, oh, that's quite nice."
00:16:23,00:16:23,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:23,00:16:25,You need a huge mouth to make that crescent shape.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"Where's my cake, God?"
00:16:27,00:16:28,"It's a new moon, sorry."
00:16:28,00:16:30,I want to give us cake.
00:16:30,00:16:35,Just one thing on Gramophones.
00:16:35,00:16:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:36,00:16:38,As we're on the Grammys.
00:16:38,00:16:40,"So, singer Nick Drake?"
00:16:40,00:16:41,"Yeah, him."
00:16:41,00:16:41,"Yeah, of course."
00:16:41,00:16:44,"So, you know Drake, the rapper?"
00:16:44,00:16:45,His first name's Nick.
00:16:45,00:16:49,"So the first three albums were folk,"
00:16:49,00:16:51,and then he got rid of the first name.
00:16:51,00:16:55,So Nick Drake died in 1974.
00:16:55,00:16:57,"Nonetheless, he's going on tour this year."
00:16:57,00:17:00,"Again, are you sure you have a mistaken Nick Drake"
00:17:00,00:17:01,with actual Drake?
00:17:01,00:17:02,"Nominated, he's nominated."
00:17:02,00:17:03,"Sorry, nominated."
00:17:03,00:17:06,"No, his personal, this is the way I think,"
00:17:06,00:17:09,his personal Gramophone is the thing that's going on tour.
00:17:09,00:17:09,Okay.
00:17:09,00:17:12,He's going on tour with his personal test recording
00:17:12,00:17:14,of one of his albums called Pink Moon.
00:17:14,00:17:15,Yeah.
00:17:15,00:17:16,And it's going to be taken around and played
00:17:16,00:17:18,in several different locations.
00:17:18,00:17:18,That's awesome.
00:17:18,00:17:19,That's the tour.
00:17:19,00:17:21,"Well, the kind of people who like him"
00:17:21,00:17:24,"are the kind of people who would love that shit, right?"
00:17:24,00:17:26,"Whereas normal people, probably not that interested."
00:17:26,00:17:27,"That's good enough, yeah, yeah."
00:17:27,00:17:28,That's definitely good.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"Well, there's a double reason you'd like us down,"
00:17:30,00:17:32,because this is not the first time this has happened.
00:17:32,00:17:36,"In 2007, John Lennon's piano went on tour around the USA."
00:17:36,00:17:37,Did he?
00:17:37,00:17:37,Yeah.
00:17:37,00:17:38,The white piano?
00:17:38,00:17:40,The Imagine piano?
00:17:40,00:17:42,I'm not sure which piano it was actually.
00:17:42,00:17:42,This time.
00:17:42,00:17:43,He probably owned a couple.
00:17:43,00:17:44,"He had a few Bob by the end, but yeah."
00:17:44,00:17:45,Cool.
00:17:45,00:17:46,"Yeah, no, I think you're right, James."
00:17:46,00:17:48,"Like, this turns out I just don't need"
00:17:48,00:17:49,the actual musicians to come on tour.
00:17:49,00:17:52,"I'm just happy just seeing, like, what?"
00:17:52,00:17:54,"Are you telling me his, his, what?"
00:17:54,00:17:55,Trousers are going on tour?
00:17:55,00:17:58,You can't be in.
00:17:58,00:17:59,MC Hammer's trousers.
00:18:00,00:18:01,The tar of the world.
00:18:01,00:18:04,They just dance by themselves.
00:18:04,00:18:06,They just move them up and down on a rail.
00:18:06,00:18:10,Great.
00:18:10,00:18:12,Seals have retractable nipples.
00:18:12,00:18:14,"No, yes."
00:18:14,00:18:14,Handy.
00:18:14,00:18:15,Yeah.
00:18:15,00:18:18,"So the idea is that it's when they're in the,"
00:18:18,00:18:21,"this is the female seals, when they're in a breastfeeding stage,"
00:18:21,00:18:23,"what they will do is, and this is,"
00:18:23,00:18:26,they do this because sometimes they're restricted fully to the sea.
00:18:26,00:18:28,"And I guess they, they don't want another way of, you know,"
00:18:29,00:18:31,"flooding and, and heading to the bottom of the water."
00:18:31,00:18:33,"Well, as the water going in through the nipples."
00:18:33,00:18:35,That doesn't feel like it would happen.
00:18:35,00:18:37,"It feels like that's not, yep, that's a good point."
00:18:37,00:18:41,"Whenever I have a bath, my breasts get to 10 times their size."
00:18:41,00:18:44,"So you have to squat it all out afterwards, isn't it?"
00:18:44,00:18:47,But have you gone swimming?
00:18:47,00:18:53,Water's a bit lower today.
00:18:53,00:18:54,"Oh, it's been ladies hour."
00:18:55,00:19:03,"I think he was quite inspired by a guy called Walking Stuart,"
00:19:03,00:19:07,who was a man he met in France and he loved walking Stuart.
00:19:07,00:19:10,And this is actually a guy who loads of the great philosophers
00:19:10,00:19:11,and writers of the day really loved.
00:19:11,00:19:14,And he was a bloke who'd basically walked from India
00:19:14,00:19:16,and through Persia and Abyssinia and African countries.
00:19:16,00:19:18,And then he walked through America later.
00:19:18,00:19:22,He loved walking and he didn't record his travels
00:19:22,00:19:24,because he thought that they should be travels of the mind.
00:19:24,00:19:26,So he never wrote anything.
00:19:26,00:19:28,"He sounds like an absolute wanker, doesn't he?"
00:19:28,00:19:29,You can imagine him propping up some bar
00:19:29,00:19:31,as he tries to chat you up.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"So, well, actually, I'm a traveler of the mind,"
00:19:33,00:19:36,which is why I haven't found a publisher yet.
00:19:36,00:19:40,"I don't want a publisher, you know."
00:19:40,00:19:42,"He was, we've all met them on our gap years."
00:19:42,00:19:43,He's definitely candidate for that.
00:19:43,00:19:44,How do we know about him?
00:19:44,00:19:45,Is it just through other people's accounts?
00:19:45,00:19:46,He was written about a lot.
00:19:46,00:19:49,"And he also did end up publishing a lot of stuff,"
00:19:49,00:19:52,including what he called his stupendous essay.
00:19:53,00:19:55,He thought it was a great work.
00:19:55,00:19:57,Very much the Russell Brand of V.
00:19:57,00:20:04,"Voldemort, Janusak, who's basically my favourite human alive,"
00:20:04,00:20:07,"who's, he did a series, he's a presenter in the UK,"
00:20:07,00:20:10,"and he did a series called The Dark Ages, Age of Light."
00:20:10,00:20:12,And it was fantastic.
00:20:12,00:20:16,"Fun fact, on the previous 400 episodes,"
00:20:16,00:20:18,"we've always cut out and referred to her favourite human alive,"
00:20:18,00:20:19,"Voldemort, Janusak."
00:20:19,00:20:21,She's never referred to him before now.
00:20:21,00:20:22,What's going on?
00:20:23,00:20:24,"I feel that you've really been, you've been holding out."
00:20:24,00:20:25,I'm trying to keep it quiet.
00:20:25,00:20:26,I'm trying to keep it quiet.
00:20:26,00:20:28,I can't.
00:20:28,00:20:29,I'm obsessed with him.
00:20:29,00:20:33,"Just on a side, technically, I learned this the other day,"
00:20:33,00:20:34,suckling.
00:20:34,00:20:35,Babies don't suckle.
00:20:35,00:20:38,Babies suck and the mother suckles.
00:20:38,00:20:41,"Yes, you're so right."
00:20:41,00:20:42,A mother is the suckler.
00:20:42,00:20:43,"Yeah, I'm sorry about that."
00:20:43,00:20:47,"You like to go around correcting breastfeeding women, don't you, James?"
00:20:47,00:20:48,Just in Starbucks.
00:20:48,00:20:51,"I'm like, excuse me, just in case you thought"
00:20:52,00:20:53,the baby was suckling.
00:20:53,00:20:55,It's not.
00:20:55,00:20:56,You are.
00:20:56,00:21:01,"Yeah, and then I go, although to be fair,"
00:21:01,00:21:04,"in modern parlance, you can have it either way."
00:21:04,00:21:07,"But I'm just saying technically, etymologically, that's what's up."
00:21:07,00:21:09,"And you sell those t-shirts saying your baby sucks, which..."
00:21:09,00:21:16,"Actually, that reminds me of something that,"
00:21:16,00:21:17,"something I submitted as a fact for this week,"
00:21:17,00:21:20,"but which was not chosen by the committee of you guys,"
00:21:20,00:21:21,which was that reptiles don't suck.
00:21:22,00:21:23,They can't suck.
00:21:23,00:21:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:23,00:21:24,Was it? I didn't see that.
00:21:24,00:21:25,I didn't even see that one.
00:21:25,00:21:25,I saw it.
00:21:25,00:21:26,"Yeah, all right."
00:21:26,00:21:27,James deleted it.
00:21:27,00:21:30,They literally can't suck.
00:21:30,00:21:34,"If you left a lizard next to a smoothie, it would die."
00:21:34,00:21:36,What?
00:21:36,00:21:38,Yeah.
00:21:38,00:21:42,"Yeah, they can't form the shape with their mouths to suck."
00:21:42,00:21:44,That's an exclusively mammalian thing.
00:21:44,00:21:44,"Yeah, okay."
00:21:44,00:21:45,How interesting.
00:21:45,00:21:47,"Yeah, and there was one reptile,"
00:21:47,00:21:48,"I think about a hundred million years ago, which could."
00:21:48,00:21:51,They found that it had evidence of the muscles
00:21:51,00:21:52,and then it just lost it.
00:21:52,00:21:53,"That's the only one they've ever found, I think."
00:21:53,00:21:55,"So what do they, how do they eat?"
00:21:55,00:21:58,Because you can eat a smoothie by just tipping it over.
00:21:58,00:22:01,Not if you don't have opposable thumbs
00:22:01,00:22:03,and there's a top on it and there's a straw.
00:22:03,00:22:04,It's hard to get at it.
00:22:04,00:22:07,"It's a sealed, it's a sealed shop fresh smoothie."
00:22:07,00:22:08,"Okay, right."
00:22:08,00:22:09,"Yeah, which they can't tip over"
00:22:09,00:22:11,because it's in a little indentation on the ground.
00:22:11,00:22:12,Yeah.
00:22:12,00:22:13,Yeah.
00:22:13,00:22:13,That's a great fact.
00:22:13,00:22:15,I've done this dozens of times.
00:22:15,00:22:16,The lizard dies every single time.
00:22:18,00:22:20,"Do you know, I don't think I've mentioned this before"
00:22:20,00:22:21,about mirrors.
00:22:21,00:22:22,"Sorry, this is a random tangent,"
00:22:22,00:22:23,but I remember finding it so amazing.
00:22:23,00:22:26,If you're looking at yourself in a mirror
00:22:26,00:22:28,and you want to see how your legs are looking
00:22:28,00:22:31,"and you can only see your top half, what do you do?"
00:22:31,00:22:32,Walk backwards.
00:22:32,00:22:34,"Like, everyone think you would do that?"
00:22:34,00:22:34,I'd move the mirror.
00:22:34,00:22:40,"Because in my mind, I'm holding a small silver-backed mirror."
00:22:40,00:22:42,"Ah, you see, now I've got a full-length mirror"
00:22:42,00:22:44,and I'm just thinking I need to get as far away
00:22:44,00:22:46,from it as possible to get my full body in it.
00:22:47,00:22:51,"Yeah, it's welded to the wall, so you can't move it."
00:22:51,00:22:52,You can only move yourself.
00:22:52,00:22:55,But you...
00:22:55,00:22:56,"Oh, but hang on."
00:22:56,00:22:59,"No, but if you leaned in really close..."
00:22:59,00:23:00,"Oh, that's so clever."
00:23:00,00:23:01,"If you leaned in really close and kind of looked down,"
00:23:01,00:23:02,then you'd see your legs.
00:23:02,00:23:03,"If you leaned in really close and you looked down,"
00:23:03,00:23:04,you can see your legs.
00:23:04,00:23:04,Exactly.
00:23:04,00:23:06,Moving back doesn't help at all.
00:23:06,00:23:08,So if you look at your...
00:23:08,00:23:11,"Yeah, you stay exactly the same size in a mirror."
00:23:11,00:23:13,It's just the mirror gets more distant in your view.
00:23:13,00:23:15,So if you look at your head in a mirror
00:23:15,00:23:20,"and then you measure it by putting your fingers in front of your eyes,"
00:23:20,00:23:21,you're looking at your reflection.
00:23:21,00:23:23,"Yeah, and so you can..."
00:23:23,00:23:25,There's a certain distance between your fingers
00:23:25,00:23:26,and that accommodates your head.
00:23:26,00:23:28,"If you walk back and back and back endlessly,"
00:23:28,00:23:32,"your head's, I think, always going to be the same size"
00:23:32,00:23:35,until the mirror disappears out of view.
00:23:35,00:23:35,That's amazing.
00:23:35,00:23:38,"The thing is, I guess, I can already see my legs"
00:23:38,00:23:40,without the use of a mirror.
00:23:40,00:23:42,That's why it hasn't presented such a problem
00:23:42,00:23:43,"for humanity, as you might think."
00:23:45,00:23:46,"So, Anna, what's going on?"
00:23:46,00:23:47,Why do people...
00:23:47,00:23:49,"Because I think we all do think to ourselves,"
00:23:49,00:23:50,"""Oh, yeah, just walk backwards."""
00:23:50,00:23:52,So why do we think that?
00:23:52,00:23:54,I think it's basically to do with the fact
00:23:54,00:23:55,"that as you walk backwards, you think,"
00:23:55,00:23:58,"""I'll get smaller, so the mirror will accommodate more of me."""
00:23:58,00:23:59,But the logical way of thinking about it
00:23:59,00:24:01,is the mirror gets proportionally smaller as well.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"So as you're getting smaller in the mirror,"
00:24:03,00:24:04,the mirror is getting proportionally smaller.
00:24:04,00:24:05,It's further away.
00:24:05,00:24:07,"The mirror is staying, as in it's further away, sorry."
00:24:07,00:24:08,"Yeah, so it looks smaller."
00:24:08,00:24:11,So I guess if you were taking a photograph of somebody
00:24:11,00:24:12,or if you were trying to take in more of a scene
00:24:12,00:24:14,"or you're sketching for watercolors or whatever,"
00:24:15,00:24:17,"the further back you go, the more you see,"
00:24:17,00:24:18,but it doesn't work for the mirror.
00:24:18,00:24:20,"It would work with a filial camera, right?"
00:24:20,00:24:21,Yes.
00:24:21,00:24:25,"So if I'm trying to film my own legs, that's fine."
00:24:25,00:24:26,Or sketch your own legs.
00:24:26,00:24:29,"Yeah, if someone else is trying to film your own legs,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,"then if they walk further and further back,"
00:24:31,00:24:33,they will accommodate your legs eventually.
00:24:33,00:24:35,"It's one of those cute, viral things on the internet."
00:24:35,00:24:37,This guy sketched his own legs every day for a year.
00:24:37,00:24:40,Do you know Hawaiian monk seals?
00:24:40,00:24:43,Keep getting eels stuck up their noses.
00:24:43,00:24:44,"No, yeah, I saw a photo of it."
00:24:44,00:24:45,Have you seen the pictures?
00:24:45,00:24:46,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:24:46,00:24:47,Seals and eels.
00:24:47,00:24:49,"Seals and eels, yeah, it's a great double ax."
00:24:49,00:24:51,"There aren't many of them left, about 1400,"
00:24:51,00:24:53,so we don't want them to stop the eels.
00:24:53,00:24:54,The monk seals.
00:24:54,00:24:55,"The monk seals, yeah."
00:24:55,00:24:57,And...
00:24:57,00:24:58,"They suffocate, what, as in they die?"
00:24:58,00:24:59,"No, they actually don't die, they're fine,"
00:24:59,00:25:01,but we just don't want it happening.
00:25:01,00:25:01,"Yeah, you want to keep..."
00:25:01,00:25:02,You sure?
00:25:02,00:25:03,What's the reason for it?
00:25:03,00:25:05,And presumably the eel hasn't given consent.
00:25:05,00:25:08,"It's dark when no one's interviewed the eels,"
00:25:08,00:25:10,because they're all dead by the time it's happened.
00:25:10,00:25:11,I don't know if it's like in a 60-wan game.
00:25:11,00:25:12,"They're sucking them, yeah, head for us,"
00:25:12,00:25:15,so it's just a mottled interview you get out of there.
00:25:15,00:25:17,What on earth are you doing?
00:25:17,00:25:21,They're not sure why.
00:25:21,00:25:24,Conservation has suggested two ways it's happened.
00:25:24,00:25:26,Either when seals are foraging around for food
00:25:26,00:25:28,"in rock crevices and there's an eel in there,"
00:25:28,00:25:30,it launches itself defensively at the seal
00:25:30,00:25:32,"and shoots up its nose, maybe,"
00:25:32,00:25:33,"but they think that's a bit weird,"
00:25:33,00:25:35,because they are really deep in the nose.
00:25:35,00:25:38,"Like, it takes a minute to pull the full eel all the way out."
00:25:38,00:25:39,"Oh, my gosh."
00:25:39,00:25:41,"That's a great magic trick, isn't it?"
00:25:41,00:25:43,Like the handkerchief's in his pocket.
00:25:43,00:25:43,It is.
00:25:43,00:25:45,There's more eel.
00:25:45,00:25:50,So they think that it's not that.
00:25:50,00:25:53,They think that the seals have swallowed the eel's hole
00:25:53,00:25:56,and then they've regurgitated them through their nose.
00:25:56,00:25:57,Some has made them laugh.
00:25:57,00:25:58,Some hasn't.
00:25:58,00:26:02,Wow.
00:26:02,00:26:06,He was so funny.
00:26:06,00:26:08,I had the anus of an eel poking out
00:26:08,00:26:09,of my nose.
00:26:09,00:26:10,He's brilliant.
00:26:10,00:26:11,You'll love him.
00:26:11,00:26:14,It's better than any applause for a comedian.
00:26:14,00:26:16,Eel anuses throughout the audience.
00:26:16,00:26:23,"Oh, lovely."
00:26:24,00:26:24,Yeah.
00:26:24,00:26:25,So you.
00:26:25,00:26:53,Yeah.
00:26:53,00:26:54,What was that?
00:26:54,00:26:57,That was some seals.
00:26:57,00:26:59,Singing kiss from a rose by seals.
00:26:59,00:27:00,What were seals singing?
00:27:00,00:27:01,That was actual seals.
00:27:01,00:27:05,Beautiful.
00:27:05,00:27:05,That's incredible.
00:27:05,00:27:06,That's very good.
00:27:06,00:27:08,Very good.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"Do you remember on Don't Forget Your Toothbrush,"
00:27:10,00:27:13,"the TV show of the late 90s, early 2000s?"
00:27:13,00:27:14,Chris Evans posted.
00:27:14,00:27:16,"And they used to do a thing called Superfan,"
00:27:16,00:27:20,where they had a celebrity and then a superfan.
00:27:20,00:27:23,And obviously it was they pitted against to see who knew more
00:27:23,00:27:25,"about the celebrity, the celebrity themselves,"
00:27:25,00:27:26,or the superfan.
00:27:26,00:27:29,"Oh, it sounds like an absolute stalker's charter."
00:27:29,00:27:29,"Well, yeah."
00:27:29,00:27:29,Wasn't it?
00:27:29,00:27:30,Yeah.
00:27:30,00:27:31,Was there a scream between them?
00:27:31,00:27:34,Was there a Hannibal Lecter mask at any point?
00:27:34,00:27:37,"Well, the prize was that something."
00:27:37,00:27:40,You get to spend a day on your own in their house.
00:27:40,00:27:44,You can wear their skin like a mask.
00:27:44,00:27:48,"It was, yeah, because as far as I remember,"
00:27:48,00:27:52,"I remember one with Barry White, and it was some massive fan."
00:27:52,00:27:55,So Barry White gave this woman a handkerchief
00:27:55,00:27:59,"that he had mopped the sweat from his brow with, which you sort of go,"
00:27:59,00:28:02,"""Yeah, just hanging onto your favorite celebrity's DNA."""
00:28:02,00:28:04,I think that's encouraging some questionable behavior
00:28:04,00:28:06,that we shouldn't be.
00:28:06,00:28:07,"What, giving them sort of your own sweats?"
00:28:07,00:28:08,Make your own.
00:28:08,00:28:09,"Well, you can make your own, can't you at home?"
00:28:09,00:28:10,Make your own Barry White.
00:28:10,00:28:12,Just sell those kids.
00:28:12,00:28:14,Clone your own.
00:28:14,00:28:15,With their sweat.
00:28:15,00:28:16,Can you clone someone from their sweat?
00:28:16,00:28:17,I believe not.
00:28:18,00:28:19,"It's just water, isn't it?"
00:28:19,00:28:20,Salty water.
00:28:20,00:28:23,You're just going to get a giant human-shaped lump of salty water.
00:28:23,00:28:26,Or somebody else had used it.
00:28:26,00:28:29,"You know, Chris Evans had used it to wipe his sweat as well."
00:28:29,00:28:31,And then you accidentally caught Chris Evans.
00:28:31,00:28:34,And you made an Evans White crossover.
00:28:34,00:28:35,Like the fly.
00:28:35,00:28:35,Yeah.
00:28:35,00:28:39,"Great version of the fly though, but it comes out he's half Chris Evans."
00:28:39,00:28:41,It's the dream man.
00:28:41,00:28:42,"Barry Ginger, it would be."
00:28:44,00:28:48,Have you guys heard of Eithelbert's code?
00:28:48,00:28:50,This is an Anglo-Ithelbert.
00:28:50,00:28:51,Great.
00:28:51,00:28:52,It's just an Ethelbert.
00:28:52,00:28:55,"Yeah, it's definitely an AE at the start of it."
00:28:55,00:28:56,I believe it's pronounced Ethelbert.
00:28:56,00:29:00,Like my local church in Bolton is St. Ethelbert's.
00:29:00,00:29:01,"But it's felt like that, AE."
00:29:01,00:29:03,"Well, they got rid of the AE."
00:29:03,00:29:04,"Well, I'm going to keep up."
00:29:04,00:29:06,"Look, they're all dead."
00:29:06,00:29:07,No one's going to complain.
00:29:07,00:29:09,Eithelbert.
00:29:09,00:29:10,You have to say it like that.
00:29:10,00:29:13,"All right, Ethelbert's might be Ethel."
00:29:13,00:29:16,This code is a legal encyclopedia from the 7th century.
00:29:16,00:29:21,"And it's basically, it has an extensive list of crimes and punishments."
00:29:21,00:29:25,And normally for lots of them are for injuries.
00:29:25,00:29:29,"So I just wanted if you could guess, which was worth more or less."
00:29:29,00:29:31,"So it's kind of again, you know, it's kind of higher or lower."
00:29:31,00:29:32,Play your cards right style.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"Right, knocking out a front tooth."
00:29:35,00:29:37,"Okay, so the punishment for this, we're talking about."
00:29:37,00:29:38,So it's the financial penalty.
00:29:38,00:29:41,"I'll give you the first one, which is six shillings."
00:29:41,00:29:42,"Six shillings, okay."
00:29:42,00:29:44,What's that worth these days?
00:29:44,00:29:46,30p.
00:29:46,00:29:48,"Yeah, 30p."
00:29:48,00:29:49,That's not a big fine.
00:29:49,00:29:50,It's a few Freddos.
00:29:50,00:29:52,"Okay, actually these days it's probably not."
00:29:52,00:29:56,Little finger.
00:29:56,00:29:57,More than a two for sure.
00:29:57,00:29:59,"Front tooth though, it's one of the big 40."
00:29:59,00:30:01,"I don't mind, little finger it must be."
00:30:01,00:30:03,Because how do you drink tea otherwise?
00:30:03,00:30:04,"Yeah, it's a good point."
00:30:04,00:30:06,It's 11 shillings.
00:30:06,00:30:06,James is right.
00:30:06,00:30:08,"Yes, makes a lot of sense."
00:30:08,00:30:09,Stabbing a man through his genitals.
00:30:10,00:30:13,"More or less than the little finger, yeah."
00:30:13,00:30:14,Does seem like it's more.
00:30:14,00:30:15,"Feels like well, yeah."
00:30:15,00:30:16,"12, 12 shillings."
00:30:16,00:30:18,"It's less, less."
00:30:18,00:30:19,Six shillings.
00:30:19,00:30:20,Really?
00:30:20,00:30:22,"Yeah, really value the little finger, yeah."
00:30:22,00:30:26,Yeah.
00:30:26,00:30:26,Crikey.
00:30:26,00:30:28,I'm taking someone's thumbnail.
00:30:28,00:30:31,More or less than stabbing someone through the penis.
00:30:31,00:30:32,"Well, oh okay."
00:30:32,00:30:35,"So I think more than stabbing someone through the penis,"
00:30:35,00:30:36,less than the little finger.
00:30:36,00:30:39,"I just, I mean, it feels like it should be way less,"
00:30:39,00:30:41,but then we've already established
00:30:41,00:30:42,that stabbing someone in the penis
00:30:42,00:30:45,is actually positively encouraged.
00:30:45,00:30:46,"That's Alphalbert's code, baby."
00:30:46,00:30:52,Why is he going so specific?
00:30:52,00:30:54,Surely you don't need a separate law
00:30:54,00:30:56,for taking someone's thumbnail.
00:30:56,00:30:58,Is it different to taking someone's index fingernail?
00:30:58,00:31:00,"Yes, it would be actually,"
00:31:00,00:31:01,because thumbs and fingers have different values.
00:31:01,00:31:04,"Little finger has a different value to the thumb,"
00:31:04,00:31:06,"and all the fingers have different values, I believe, yeah."
00:31:06,00:31:07,"All right, then."
00:31:07,00:31:08,What do you get for taking someone's thumbnail?
00:31:08,00:31:09,How would you even go about doing that?
00:31:09,00:31:10,I'd take three shillings.
00:31:10,00:31:11,Really?
00:31:11,00:31:12,"Yeah, an argan."
00:31:12,00:31:13,Do you think that's cutting the top off
00:31:13,00:31:14,or to pulling out the whole thing?
00:31:14,00:31:17,"Like pliers and then pulling it off like in torture, right?"
00:31:17,00:31:18,"Yeah, okay."
00:31:18,00:31:19,I think that's it.
00:31:19,00:31:20,Although it doesn't apply
00:31:20,00:31:22,that people went around torturing each other at the time.
00:31:22,00:31:23,Yeah.
00:31:23,00:31:24,With like a menu.
00:31:24,00:31:25,"What can we afford to do then, let's go."
00:31:25,00:31:29,"I can definitely stab him in the dick, but..."
00:31:29,00:31:31,"If you can stab him with an index fingernail,"
00:31:31,00:31:32,"you can't afford to take his little finger,"
00:31:32,00:31:34,or you can punch him in the nose for three shillings
00:31:34,00:31:38,"and take one premolar, but not a front tooth."
00:31:38,00:31:41,How much was the stabbing someone in the genitals?
00:31:41,00:31:42,That was six shillings.
00:31:42,00:31:45,So you can punch someone in the nose twice.
00:31:45,00:31:46,Or stab him in the penis.
00:31:46,00:31:49,"Yeah, that's a good point."
00:31:49,00:31:52,Craigie.
00:31:52,00:31:52,Yeah.
00:31:52,00:31:54,Which would you do?
00:31:54,00:31:56,Which would I do?
00:31:56,00:31:58,"Well, it depends what the person's done, doesn't it?"
00:31:58,00:31:59,I wouldn't do either of those things.
00:31:59,00:32:00,Yeah.
00:32:00,00:32:03,It's implying that actually taking away someone's ability
00:32:03,00:32:05,to take the piss out of someone's genitals
00:32:05,00:32:06,by removing that little finger
00:32:06,00:32:08,is worse than removing their actual genitals.
00:32:08,00:32:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:08,00:32:10,"Because that's the main thing you use your little finger for,"
00:32:10,00:32:10,isn't it?
00:32:10,00:32:11,What a good point.
00:32:11,00:32:12,Yeah.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"Yeah, that's the main thing."
00:32:14,00:32:17,And it's inhumane not to give someone the chance to do that.
00:32:17,00:32:19,"If someone had done that to me, let's say,"
00:32:19,00:32:21,I would probably want to stab that person in the penis
00:32:21,00:32:22,and could afford to.
00:32:22,00:32:24,"Well, I need to brag."
00:32:24,00:32:25,"Well, sorry."
00:32:25,00:32:27,We...
00:32:27,00:32:29,The advertising yield for this year is 18 shillings.
00:32:36,00:32:37,"OK, that's it."
00:32:37,00:32:38,That's all of our facts.
00:32:38,00:32:40,That is the end of our compilations
