00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560
 Hello and welcome to the No Such Things as Fish Queens Jubilee Garden Party!

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.560
 Woo!

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.360
 Dan Schreiber is over there getting together all of his dubious memorabilia about the Role Family that he bought off eBay.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:25.440
 Alex Bell is over there, alphabetising all of his VHS's of the Queen's Speech from over the years, filing them all under Q.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:36.800
 There's Anna at the Pim's Tent drinking it dry and there's Andy making a portrait of one of the Queen's Sons out of moss.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.280
 Oh, not that one, Andy. Oh, no.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:50.600
 Anyway, we are here today because we have an extra day off work and we thought what better than to give you a sneaky bonus episode of Fish.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.360
 So here is another mini compilation of 30 minutes of silliness. Really hope you enjoy it.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.720
 We'll be back again next week with a normal episode, but in the meantime, on with the podcast!

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:21.120
 [Music]

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.840
 All right, it is time for our final fact and that is Andy's fact.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.320
 Andy's fact this week is that!

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.160
 What was that? Are you objecting to how I presented that?

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.360
 No, no. You're doing a great job. Keep it up.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.680
 Yeah, thank you. I'm mixing it up a bit. You know, you try something new. It doesn't work. You move on.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.640
 Please, Andy. This is Andy's little nugget of joy coming up next.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.800
 You really threw Andy there. Like, I think I could see Andy was just completely thrown.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.920
 He looked at what he's written on his hand and went, "I don't know what to do now."

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.760
 She's gone off script. No. Mum, let me out.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.520
 This is something that's not very well-sourced, so forgive me, but I know very slightly know someone whose dad used to be in the Navy.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.600
 Right. And the claim from him is that, stick with it.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.760
 He says that the last case of scurvy that happened in the Royal Navy, the British Royal Navy, was in the 1970s.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.880
 Really? Really? Nice.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.520
 Didn't James Blunt claim that he had scurvy?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.880
 Yes, he did. He said that he was James Blunt.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.080
 Sorry. You know, this is according to him, so whether this is true or not.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.840
 So, he said he was at university and all the people in his class were all vegans and vegetarians.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.040
 And he was really, he didn't like this and he thought, "Right, I'm going to stick it to them and somehow stick it to them by only eating meat."

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.080
 And so he decided that all he was going to eat was mince and bacon and stuff like that.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.200
 And he went on just a meat-only diet and he said that after a while he went to his doctor and his doctor said, "Yeah, you've got scurvy."

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.440
 Wow. I'm slightly suspicious of that, partly because there is vitamin C in meat, as long as it's fresh meat.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.480
 There's vitamin C in that. He was one of the reasons... He was only eating very old meat, that's the thing.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.960
 He's very teeth-plunged and he will only eat very discounted elderly meat.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.440
 He said that he lived on mince, some chicken and maybe some mayonnaise.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.840
 God. And then he said that his doctor said that he might have scurvy and so he took to drinking orange juice every night.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.440
 And then he got acid reflux, so it was a bad time for old blunts.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.920
 Way to stick it to the vegetarians though. They must have really regretted their life choices.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.840
 The helicopter method, they used that in the early days of the pandemic, didn't they, where they were getting people to go off parks.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.520
 And so, yeah, yeah, they would bring helicopters in and just tilt them in the wind, just trying to push people off them.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.760
 Really? Yeah. Have you not seen the corners of that?

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.800
 That just seems quite dangerous to fly a helicopter so low as well.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.280
 It does seem a bit dangerous, I guess with the angle they were just pushing a push down wind.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.920
 You don't mean they were physically using the draft of the helicopter blades to push people out of parks.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.200
 They were telling them to get off and they were giving them a message with the wind.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.200
 I don't think the wind was so great, they were literally...

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.840
 One of the great joys of the pandemic was looking out of your window to see people flying past.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.120
 Has anyone had a Vietnamese dish called Cao LÃ o?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.280
 No, don't think so.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.720
 Has anyone been to Vietnam? No, no. Well, then you definitely haven't had it.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.400
 Is it only allowed to be sold there?

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.000
 It's not that. You can only make it in a very specific town called Hai An.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.320
 Right, why do you think you can only make this in that particular town?

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.520
 It's a noodle dish.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.440
 There's only... Okay, the noodles come from a special kind of wheat, which is grown only in Hai An.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.600
 It's a secret ingredient from a lady called Anne.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.000
 Much better, much better.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.240
 What it is, you're not going to guess, Anne, are you?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.800
 Is it you have to greet the person who makes it with your Hai?

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.200
 There's only one person who makes it. They've trademarked it and they say Hai

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.120
 and then give you this noodle dish so you have to meet them.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.360
 I really like the way you thought that maybe it's because it's called Hai An.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.320
 Probably I pronounced that wrong, so...

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.040
 But anyway, so the reason you can only make it here is because you need to use a very specific

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.600
 water for the noodles and it has to come out of a very particular well in the town.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.760
 And if you don't take the water out of this well, they're not authentic noodles.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.040
 So it's like herbs with noodles on top and then crispy pork on top of that.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.240
 But the noodles have to be made with this very specific water

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.920
 and they have to be mixed with the ash from the wood of a very specific local tree.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.240
 So you're kind of close with your wheat thing, Anne, called Kajaput.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.160
 And apparently, if you do that, it gives...

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.720
 The water's got alum in and a few other minerals and it gives the noodles a real chewy texture

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.200
 and a burnt flavour that you can't get anywhere else in the world.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.960
 Oh, that's so cool.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.760
 It is cool.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.560
 James, have you...

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.600
 I've never been to Vietnam.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.120
 I was going to say, have you travelled specifically to Vietnam?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.200
 If I ever go to Vietnam, I'm going here.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.040
 There's no doubt about that, but no, I haven't.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.320
 Oh, say hi to Anne when you're there.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.360
 You know, we were talking about setting fire to things earlier, the ashes.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.000
 Okay, so that's Australia versus England.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 And the story goes that in 1882, Australia beat England

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.520
 and one of the newspapers called it the death of English cricket

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.520
 and that the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.600
 And so they supposedly burnt the bales of the cricket wickets

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.920
 and they put it in a little urn and that became the prize and that's the prize we use today,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.240
 which is very amusing and whatever, but probably not for the relatives of a man

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.760
 who was at the match in 1882 and died in the middle of the match.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.360
 Oh, ouch, ouch.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.160
 Oh, no.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.600
 So they did this kind of fake thing about all the death of cricket

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.840
 and burned all the ashes and put them in an urn and stuff

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.840
 and there was a guy who actually died in the match.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.280
 Wow, but they didn't incorporate him.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.680
 No, no.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.480
 Okay.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.680
 But that was, when did you say that?

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.320
 That was 1882.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.200
 1882, yeah.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.520
 Because do you remember we talked about cremation a few weeks ago?

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.920
 Yeah.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.240
 And it was a kind of a new science at the time

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.680
 and it was actually quite controversial and it was just starting out.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.480
 That's really interesting.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.440
 Early crematoria were, there was only about one in the UK at the time.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.040
 So probably the reason was it was quite zeitgeisty at the time, right?

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.200
 Yeah.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.480
 That's why they thought we'll burn the ashes and that's why we have the ashes

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.400
 because cremation was zeitgeisty at the time.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.400
 Wow.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.680
 We could have buried them in a graveyard.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.600
 But they're in a museum here, aren't they?

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.040
 Yeah, they stay in lords all the time.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.160
 They stay in lords and the museum has, it's got the ashes

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.640
 and it's also got a dead bird just sitting there.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.960
 Does it?

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.880
 Yeah, it was a bird that was killed during a match, a famous match and yeah.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.080
 It was kind of killed.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.120
 As in by a ball hitter.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.120
 I think a flying ball hitter or a batsman accidentally.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.800
 Yeah, something occurred.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.360
 The bird died and it's now in the museum.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.800
 It was a robin and the batsman because they didn't have the sight screens

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.720
 at the time, the robin got confused and smashed it from the sky.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.840
 Duck is also a thing in cricket that you could have used in that joke as well.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.800
 Yeah, but not a birdie because that's the wrong sport.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.760
 That's a golfing thing, isn't it?

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.120
 Like an an eagle as well.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.920
 All these paths that might have been for that one.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.800
 Not very good joke.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.600
 Paul Morgan in 2018 had the longest birthday ever

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.360
 enjoyed by anyone on the planet.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.120
 He had a 48 hour birthday.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.680
 Did he do it with an international date line?

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.040
 He said he did, he lives in Hawaii.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.080
 He lives in Hawaii.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.720
 He flew from Samoa to Auckland to Los Angeles and then back to Hawaii

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.760
 and he had to cross the international date line in one very narrow window.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.280
 So there was a one hour period where the two time zones he was crossing

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.200
 were in the same day, if you see what I mean.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.720
 And he had to cross in that one hour window

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.520
 and he made it by one minute and five seconds.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.320
 That's so impressive.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.080
 If the flight, the plane he was on,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.560
 which he had no control over obviously was a passenger flight,

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.440
 had been two minutes earlier, it would all have been for nothing.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.040
 I mean arguably it was all for nothing.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.520
 Yeah, because he had a really long birthday

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.240
 but it was all spent on an aeroplane.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.800
 Exactly, he spent his entire 48 hours on a cramped airline.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.480
 Yeah, and it's like you live in Hawaii, dude.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.160
 Just stay in Hawaii and have an amazing time.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.160
 Yeah.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.200
 Have you guys heard of St Kevin and the Nettles?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.000
 Sounds like a band.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.160
 It does be a great band.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:00.880
 Really does.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.720
 I'm St Kevin and these are the Nettles.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.080
 I can't figure out who sounds more lame.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.960
 Kevin or his Nettles.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.280
 St Kevin, was he either feeling he was either an Irish or a Welsh saint

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.640
 and probably wrong about this,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.960
 but I think he once floated to Ireland on the leaf.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.720
 But am I wrong about that?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.520
 Well, he was Irish.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.320
 I actually don't know about his leaf based record.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.000
 It sounds entirely plausible.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.680
 In Saint World.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.280
 Yeah, that sounds like small potatoes.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.480
 Yeah. So there are two stories about him in Nettles.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.200
 One is that he only lived on Nettles for a while during Lent

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.040
 and started losing a lot of weight,

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.040
 and then someone started sneaking in food.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.360
 The other story is that he was, when he was young,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.760
 he was in the wilderness and he was praying.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.880
 And a young lady was passing by, beautiful young lady,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.920
 and fell madly in love with him because he was very, very hot young.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.360
 I didn't even know if he was a saint at this point.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.160
 He was just a hot young priest having a pray and she saw it.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.560
 She could say in the future I fancied him before he was a saint.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.920
 You know, back when he was just a humble, hot young priest.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.040
 And he thought a lot of her too.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.000
 And so, to cure his lust, he rolled in a bed of Nettles

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.160
 until his lust was cooled.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.640
 And he also suggested she do the same thing.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.520
 And she did.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.360
 And later on she became a nun.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.120
 And no one had any fun at all.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.920
 And that's the story.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.960
 And that's how you're raising your children, isn't it Andy?

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.640
 If someone turns up at your house to live your Grammy,

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.840
 would they be a Grammy, Graham?

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.200
 Very good.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.320
 Like a kiss a Graham or a...

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.440
 Yeah, no, you're nice.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, you get it?

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.960
 Yeah. Good, yeah.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.360
 So that's a...

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.920
 Yes.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.480
 Yeah.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.120
 No, it's a joke.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.480
 If you're listening to this,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.120
 it might feel like someone edited in a pause.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:47.840
 That actually was how long it took everyone to recover from that joke.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.680
 Sometimes people just try to hold it together in these recording sessions

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.480
 and it's just, you know.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.960
 Anyway, just one quick thing on jet engines.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.240
 I was reading about the procedures

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.160
 by which they test jet engines these days.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.360
 Because I know, I think we've mentioned before,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.600
 the chicken cannon, where they fire a bird.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.840
 So that's Royce used to fire frozen chickens.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.480
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.040
 Yeah.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.640
 And there are all these procedures.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.880
 So there's General Electric have these machines

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.840
 which have to create any weather for the engine.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.400
 So you see what I mean?

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.320
 They're testing the jet engine in a big harness.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.840
 When they say any weather,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.080
 they probably don't do like just a nice day.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.040
 They don't do gentle breeze clouds.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.360
 They just do the extreme weather, that's right.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.160
 Imagine that.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.960
 They only test the engine in extreme conditions.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.400
 They don't realize that's the one thing it can't cope with.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.520
 It's clement weather.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.640
 It's like 12 degrees, a little bit of a breeze.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.920
 But a nice sunny day.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.440
 So that when you're in the sun,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.960
 it actually feels quite warm.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.840
 But when you're in...

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.400
 No.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.200
 Disaster.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.600
 Yeah.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.600
 But there's, so there's one other they do,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.040
 which is called the blade off procedure.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.960
 And I don't know if we've mentioned this actually,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.160
 where they explode one of the blades at the base

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.280
 to see what happens.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.080
 But I mean, to see that the engine can stay functioning

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.520
 even if it loses a blade.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.320
 It's kind of reassuring

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.720
 because they test these things so rigorously, you know.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.920
 What's the answer?

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.120
 Can it just in case that happens?

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.880
 Sometimes it passes, sometimes it fails

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.560
 and they normally wave it through in either case.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:19.200
 Some of the most famous stained glass in England,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.200
 anyway, is at Canterbury Cathedral.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.200
 And there's some which is so old that, you know,

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.240
 so Thomas Beckett, the Archbishop was killed in...

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.520
 1170.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:27.920
 Yeah.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.720
 So there are some windows which are older than that,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.720
 meaning that they would have been in place at the time.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.360
 But there are also,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.760
 there are windows that were created slightly later,

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.000
 which are referring to all the miracles

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.160
 that were done by Thomas Beckett after he died.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.600
 Didn't we talk about him before?

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.520
 He was, his body was turned into some kind of homeopathic medicine.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.360
 Basically, yeah, you would, yeah, exactly.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.280
 They used some of his blood and they diluted it so much,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.480
 but then they kept selling the water.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.200
 And so, but there are incredible scenes

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.160
 in the stained glass window of people coming and being healed.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.800
 So one of them is Islewood of Westoning,

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.920
 who prayed to St. Thomas after he was blinded

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.840
 and castrated for petty theft.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.040
 He'd committed some petty theft

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.800
 and he was blinded and castrated as a result,

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.920
 which feels harsh.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.880
 It feels harsh.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.960
 He went to Canterbury, prayed to Thomas

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.520
 and his genitals were restored big time.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.160
 Big time.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.800
 Big time.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.080
 The window, there's a stained glass window, which shows...

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:22.880
 No, it can't.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.000
 No, no, no, it doesn't change.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.960
 I'm letting it finish.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.680
 It shows him after the prayer and after the miracle

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.120
 and behind him is a tree, which has these three huge leaves,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.800
 which symbolize his restored genitals.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.680
 He got three of them.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.200
 He got three.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.880
 He got three penises, that is.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.360
 Yeah.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.720
 Well, there's one, so there's one leaf of,

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.440
 I don't want to be crude.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.960
 One leaf is the penises too.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.280
 It's representing a, basically, it's a cock and balls

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.920
 in tree form to symbolize his renewed nads.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.080
 There's a cock and balls in Canterbury Cathedral

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.840
 stained glass that you've got to do tours

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.160
 of Canterbury Cathedral to tell the school children that.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.200
 You know, the Seminole people have their own Bigfoot.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.240
 The Seminole people have the Skunk Ape of Florida.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.360
 Oh, oh, yeah.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.640
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.200
 I have a mug at home, which is the Skunk Ape of Florida,

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.280
 which James gave to me off the back of a holiday.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:09.920
 Was that the holiday?

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.960
 It was, it was like a museum to the Skunk Ape or something

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.320
 and I thought you the mug, yeah.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.120
 And we based, this is inside baseball again,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.000
 but we based the design of our No Such Thing as a Fish mug

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.880
 on that mug.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.360
 Did we?

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:21.840
 Yeah.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.640
 Same colors, same sort of style, yeah.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.080
 We already had the colors to be fair.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.600
 No, because it's a blue mug.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.880
 The No Such Thing as a Fish mug?

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.200
 Yeah.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.080
 It's not blue.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.560
 It's black.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.600
 Oh, did we go black in the end?

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:31.920
 Yeah.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.560
 With yellow on the inside?

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.360
 We went with yellow and black,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.440
 which are the colors we've used for the podcast

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.400
 for the last eight years.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.120
 Controversial.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.840
 I don't know.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.800
 You'll spin off mug industry.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.720
 Well, it was based on that, which was blue and yellow.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.200
 That's fun.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.360
 Yeah, it's all falling together.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.720
 That's so far inside baseball.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.640
 You've come out the other end.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.320
 Our mug is based on a mug that I love that.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.840
 Well, look, I did expect it to come up.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.880
 There's an interesting thing that I quite like,

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.640
 which was in ancient Greece,

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.800
 you might have two ages kind of.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.040
 So you would have Kronos,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.680
 which is the amount of time that went since you were born.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.920
 And so that's like an objective.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.960
 This is how old you are.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.880
 I'm 43 years old or whatever.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.720
 And they would also have Kairos,

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.560
 which was your own personal sense of time passing.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.960
 So if you felt much younger than you actually were,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.240
 that would be your Kairos.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.400
 So in my Kairos, I feel about 21,

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.080
 but in my Kronos, I'm 43.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.560
 You were never 21.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.320
 Even in your Kronos team, you were never 20.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.360
 You came out fully born.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.440
 The ancient Greeks are actually where we get

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.040
 a lot of our birthday celebrations,

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.640
 which I genuinely find quite surprising

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.600
 because it's the sort of thing you read

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.960
 and you think that's got to be a myth.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.400
 And then we can actually trace the birthday cake from then,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.320
 when they used to celebrate Artemis' birthday.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.960
 You could work out the birthday of the birthday cake.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.440
 The birthday of the birthday cake is, yeah,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.240
 17th of December, 5000 BC.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.400
 And birthday candles, they were your Greeks as well.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.520
 They were, weren't they?

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.000
 Really?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.120
 But yeah, it was for Artemis.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.760
 For a long time,

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.120
 people only celebrated God's and King's birthdays in Queens.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.880
 So you would have had a celebration in UCI, I suppose,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.320
 but the rest of us would have been.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.840
 We'd have been lost.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.000
 And they celebrated Artemis and, you know,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.720
 had these moon-shaped cakes that are always described as,

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.800
 which surely is just a cake.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.120
 And then it was a different moon shape

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.640
 once you'd eaten some of the cake.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.680
 Yeah, maybe you had to eat it like you were waning it.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.120
 Yeah, oh, that's quite nice.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.920
 You need a huge mouth to make that crescent shape.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.680
 Where's my cake, God?

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.880
 It's a new moon, sorry.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.640
 I want to give us cake.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.680
 Just one thing on Gramophones.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.000
 As we're on the Grammys.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 So, singer Nick Drake?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.120
 Yeah, him.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.680
 Yeah, of course.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.160
 So, you know Drake, the rapper?

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.120
 His first name's Nick.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.520
 So the first three albums were folk,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.200
 and then he got rid of the first name.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.520
 So Nick Drake died in 1974.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.680
 Nonetheless, he's going on tour this year.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.720
 Again, are you sure you have a mistaken Nick Drake

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.600
 with actual Drake?

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.800
 Nominated, he's nominated.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.920
 Sorry, nominated.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.480
 No, his personal, this is the way I think,

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.280
 his personal Gramophone is the thing that's going on tour.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:09.680
 Okay.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.880
 He's going on tour with his personal test recording

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.960
 of one of his albums called Pink Moon.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:15.040
 Yeah.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.960
 And it's going to be taken around and played

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.080
 in several different locations.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:18.800
 That's awesome.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.600
 That's the tour.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.680
 Well, the kind of people who like him

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.080
 are the kind of people who would love that shit, right?

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.640
 Whereas normal people, probably not that interested.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.600
 That's good enough, yeah, yeah.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.800
 That's definitely good.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.240
 Well, there's a double reason you'd like us down,

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.400
 because this is not the first time this has happened.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.560
 In 2007, John Lennon's piano went on tour around the USA.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.120
 Did he?

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.840
 Yeah.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.800
 The white piano?

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.800
 The Imagine piano?

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.320
 I'm not sure which piano it was actually.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:42.880
 This time.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.760
 He probably owned a couple.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.800
 He had a few Bob by the end, but yeah.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.360
 Cool.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.640
 Yeah, no, I think you're right, James.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.080
 Like, this turns out I just don't need

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.680
 the actual musicians to come on tour.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.240
 I'm just happy just seeing, like, what?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.000
 Are you telling me his, his, what?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.280
 Trousers are going on tour?

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.480
 You can't be in.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.920
 MC Hammer's trousers.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.920
 The tar of the world.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.560
 They just dance by themselves.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.160
 They just move them up and down on a rail.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.320
 Great.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.560
 Seals have retractable nipples.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.320
 No, yes.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:14.960
 Handy.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.680
 Yeah.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.160
 So the idea is that it's when they're in the,

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.600
 this is the female seals, when they're in a breastfeeding stage,

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.200
 what they will do is, and this is,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.080
 they do this because sometimes they're restricted fully to the sea.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.960
 And I guess they, they don't want another way of, you know,

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.520
 flooding and, and heading to the bottom of the water.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.840
 Well, as the water going in through the nipples.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.600
 That doesn't feel like it would happen.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.440
 It feels like that's not, yep, that's a good point.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.680
 Whenever I have a bath, my breasts get to 10 times their size.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.000
 So you have to squat it all out afterwards, isn't it?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.760
 But have you gone swimming?

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.760
 Water's a bit lower today.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.960
 Oh, it's been ladies hour.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:03.120
 I think he was quite inspired by a guy called Walking Stuart,

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.600
 who was a man he met in France and he loved walking Stuart.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.720
 And this is actually a guy who loads of the great philosophers

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.920
 and writers of the day really loved.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.000
 And he was a bloke who'd basically walked from India

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.960
 and through Persia and Abyssinia and African countries.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.240
 And then he walked through America later.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.640
 He loved walking and he didn't record his travels

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.560
 because he thought that they should be travels of the mind.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.000
 So he never wrote anything.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.400
 He sounds like an absolute wanker, doesn't he?

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.920
 You can imagine him propping up some bar

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.040
 as he tries to chat you up.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.200
 So, well, actually, I'm a traveler of the mind,

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.480
 which is why I haven't found a publisher yet.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.160
 I don't want a publisher, you know.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.480
 He was, we've all met them on our gap years.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.920
 He's definitely candidate for that.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.560
 How do we know about him?

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.760
 Is it just through other people's accounts?

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.960
 He was written about a lot.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.520
 And he also did end up publishing a lot of stuff,

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.080
 including what he called his stupendous essay.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.120
 He thought it was a great work.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.680
 Very much the Russell Brand of V.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:04.240
 Voldemort, Janusak, who's basically my favourite human alive,

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.760
 who's, he did a series, he's a presenter in the UK,

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.640
 and he did a series called The Dark Ages, Age of Light.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.640
 And it was fantastic.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.160
 Fun fact, on the previous 400 episodes,

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.800
 we've always cut out and referred to her favourite human alive,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.920
 Voldemort, Janusak.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.360
 She's never referred to him before now.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.480
 What's going on?

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.160
 I feel that you've really been, you've been holding out.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.600
 I'm trying to keep it quiet.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.960
 I'm trying to keep it quiet.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.000
 I can't.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.200
 I'm obsessed with him.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.520
 Just on a side, technically, I learned this the other day,

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.400
 suckling.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.440
 Babies don't suckle.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.960
 Babies suck and the mother suckles.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.200
 Yes, you're so right.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.720
 A mother is the suckler.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.920
 Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.040
 You like to go around correcting breastfeeding women, don't you, James?

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.480
 Just in Starbucks.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.360
 I'm like, excuse me, just in case you thought

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.360
 the baby was suckling.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.680
 It's not.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.160
 You are.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.920
 Yeah, and then I go, although to be fair,

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.400
 in modern parlance, you can have it either way.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.280
 But I'm just saying technically, etymologically, that's what's up.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.840
 And you sell those t-shirts saying your baby sucks, which...

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:16.240
 Actually, that reminds me of something that,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.680
 something I submitted as a fact for this week,

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.240
 but which was not chosen by the committee of you guys,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.840
 which was that reptiles don't suck.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.120
 They can't suck.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:23.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.320
 Was it? I didn't see that.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.200
 I didn't even see that one.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:25.760
 I saw it.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.560
 Yeah, all right.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.520
 James deleted it.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.320
 They literally can't suck.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.480
 If you left a lizard next to a smoothie, it would die.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.240
 What?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.000
 Yeah.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Yeah, they can't form the shape with their mouths to suck.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.160
 That's an exclusively mammalian thing.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.880
 Yeah, okay.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.600
 How interesting.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.040
 Yeah, and there was one reptile,

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.720
 I think about a hundred million years ago, which could.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.040
 They found that it had evidence of the muscles

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.000
 and then it just lost it.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.280
 That's the only one they've ever found, I think.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.840
 So what do they, how do they eat?

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.800
 Because you can eat a smoothie by just tipping it over.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.760
 Not if you don't have opposable thumbs

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.680
 and there's a top on it and there's a straw.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.960
 It's hard to get at it.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.760
 It's a sealed, it's a sealed shop fresh smoothie.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.320
 Okay, right.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.600
 Yeah, which they can't tip over

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.600
 because it's in a little indentation on the ground.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.080
 Yeah.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.120
 Yeah.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:13.920
 That's a great fact.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.360
 I've done this dozens of times.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.960
 The lizard dies every single time.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.800
 Do you know, I don't think I've mentioned this before

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.360
 about mirrors.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.400
 Sorry, this is a random tangent,

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.920
 but I remember finding it so amazing.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.000
 If you're looking at yourself in a mirror

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.560
 and you want to see how your legs are looking

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.600
 and you can only see your top half, what do you do?

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.400
 Walk backwards.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.000
 Like, everyone think you would do that?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.880
 I'd move the mirror.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:40.080
 Because in my mind, I'm holding a small silver-backed mirror.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.480
 Ah, you see, now I've got a full-length mirror

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.320
 and I'm just thinking I need to get as far away

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.240
 from it as possible to get my full body in it.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.200
 Yeah, it's welded to the wall, so you can't move it.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.400
 You can only move yourself.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.280
 But you...

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.560
 Oh, but hang on.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.280
 No, but if you leaned in really close...

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.160
 Oh, that's so clever.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.920
 If you leaned in really close and kind of looked down,

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.400
 then you'd see your legs.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.760
 If you leaned in really close and you looked down,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.480
 you can see your legs.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:04.960
 Exactly.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.480
 Moving back doesn't help at all.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.640
 So if you look at your...

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.360
 Yeah, you stay exactly the same size in a mirror.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.920
 It's just the mirror gets more distant in your view.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.680
 So if you look at your head in a mirror

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:20.160
 and then you measure it by putting your fingers in front of your eyes,

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.280
 you're looking at your reflection.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.520
 Yeah, and so you can...

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.120
 There's a certain distance between your fingers

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.720
 and that accommodates your head.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.720
 If you walk back and back and back endlessly,

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.240
 your head's, I think, always going to be the same size

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.040
 until the mirror disappears out of view.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.760
 That's amazing.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.480
 The thing is, I guess, I can already see my legs

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.080
 without the use of a mirror.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.240
 That's why it hasn't presented such a problem

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.840
 for humanity, as you might think.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.080
 So, Anna, what's going on?

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.040
 Why do people...

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.200
 Because I think we all do think to ourselves,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.400
 "Oh, yeah, just walk backwards."

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.000
 So why do we think that?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.560
 I think it's basically to do with the fact

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.920
 that as you walk backwards, you think,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.400
 "I'll get smaller, so the mirror will accommodate more of me."

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.680
 But the logical way of thinking about it

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.840
 is the mirror gets proportionally smaller as well.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.120
 So as you're getting smaller in the mirror,

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.640
 the mirror is getting proportionally smaller.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.280
 It's further away.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.600
 The mirror is staying, as in it's further away, sorry.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.640
 Yeah, so it looks smaller.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.120
 So I guess if you were taking a photograph of somebody

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.800
 or if you were trying to take in more of a scene

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.800
 or you're sketching for watercolors or whatever,

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.040
 the further back you go, the more you see,

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.480
 but it doesn't work for the mirror.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.800
 It would work with a filial camera, right?

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.440
 Yes.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.200
 So if I'm trying to film my own legs, that's fine.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.960
 Or sketch your own legs.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.600
 Yeah, if someone else is trying to film your own legs,

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.440
 then if they walk further and further back,

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.120
 they will accommodate your legs eventually.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.280
 It's one of those cute, viral things on the internet.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.520
 This guy sketched his own legs every day for a year.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.800
 Do you know Hawaiian monk seals?

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.360
 Keep getting eels stuck up their noses.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.480
 No, yeah, I saw a photo of it.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.280
 Have you seen the pictures?

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.160
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.200
 Seals and eels.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.360
 Seals and eels, yeah, it's a great double ax.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.920
 There aren't many of them left, about 1400,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.360
 so we don't want them to stop the eels.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.160
 The monk seals.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.440
 The monk seals, yeah.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.040
 And...

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.400
 They suffocate, what, as in they die?

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.680
 No, they actually don't die, they're fine,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.120
 but we just don't want it happening.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:01.840
 Yeah, you want to keep...

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.480
 You sure?

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.600
 What's the reason for it?

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.520
 And presumably the eel hasn't given consent.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.240
 It's dark when no one's interviewed the eels,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.320
 because they're all dead by the time it's happened.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.360
 I don't know if it's like in a 60-wan game.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.960
 They're sucking them, yeah, head for us,

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.520
 so it's just a mottled interview you get out of there.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.520
 What on earth are you doing?

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.600
 They're not sure why.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.080
 Conservation has suggested two ways it's happened.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.720
 Either when seals are foraging around for food

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.640
 in rock crevices and there's an eel in there,

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.640
 it launches itself defensively at the seal

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.480
 and shoots up its nose, maybe,

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.680
 but they think that's a bit weird,

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.440
 because they are really deep in the nose.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.480
 Like, it takes a minute to pull the full eel all the way out.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.280
 Oh, my gosh.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.280
 That's a great magic trick, isn't it?

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.040
 Like the handkerchief's in his pocket.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:43.760
 It is.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.040
 There's more eel.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.400
 So they think that it's not that.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.360
 They think that the seals have swallowed the eel's hole

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.800
 and then they've regurgitated them through their nose.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.840
 Some has made them laugh.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.480
 Some hasn't.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.720
 Wow.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.000
 He was so funny.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.880
 I had the anus of an eel poking out

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.440
 of my nose.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.480
 He's brilliant.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.120
 You'll love him.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.240
 It's better than any applause for a comedian.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.240
 Eel anuses throughout the audience.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:23.200
 Oh, lovely.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:24.640
 Yeah.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.120
 So you.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:53.600
 Yeah.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.400
 What was that?

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.360
 That was some seals.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.200
 Singing kiss from a rose by seals.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.240
 What were seals singing?

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.360
 That was actual seals.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.360
 Beautiful.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:05.360
 That's incredible.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.240
 That's very good.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.320
 Very good.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.960
 Do you remember on Don't Forget Your Toothbrush,

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.280
 the TV show of the late 90s, early 2000s?

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.640
 Chris Evans posted.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.960
 And they used to do a thing called Superfan,

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.480
 where they had a celebrity and then a superfan.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.600
 And obviously it was they pitted against to see who knew more

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.600
 about the celebrity, the celebrity themselves,

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.640
 or the superfan.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.040
 Oh, it sounds like an absolute stalker's charter.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.040
 Well, yeah.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.760
 Wasn't it?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.240
 Yeah.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.920
 Was there a scream between them?

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.640
 Was there a Hannibal Lecter mask at any point?

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.440
 Well, the prize was that something.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.160
 You get to spend a day on your own in their house.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.960
 You can wear their skin like a mask.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.240
 It was, yeah, because as far as I remember,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.080
 I remember one with Barry White, and it was some massive fan.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.360
 So Barry White gave this woman a handkerchief

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.360
 that he had mopped the sweat from his brow with, which you sort of go,

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.000
 "Yeah, just hanging onto your favorite celebrity's DNA."

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.800
 I think that's encouraging some questionable behavior

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.240
 that we shouldn't be.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.920
 What, giving them sort of your own sweats?

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.480
 Make your own.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.840
 Well, you can make your own, can't you at home?

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.720
 Make your own Barry White.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.560
 Just sell those kids.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.160
 Clone your own.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.600
 With their sweat.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.800
 Can you clone someone from their sweat?

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.520
 I believe not.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.120
 It's just water, isn't it?

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.000
 Salty water.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.200
 You're just going to get a giant human-shaped lump of salty water.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.960
 Or somebody else had used it.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.680
 You know, Chris Evans had used it to wipe his sweat as well.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.840
 And then you accidentally caught Chris Evans.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.080
 And you made an Evans White crossover.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.040
 Like the fly.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.520
 Yeah.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.200
 Great version of the fly though, but it comes out he's half Chris Evans.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.040
 It's the dream man.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.240
 Barry Ginger, it would be.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.240
 Have you guys heard of Eithelbert's code?

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.960
 This is an Anglo-Ithelbert.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.200
 Great.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.320
 It's just an Ethelbert.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.520
 Yeah, it's definitely an AE at the start of it.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.880
 I believe it's pronounced Ethelbert.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.320
 Like my local church in Bolton is St. Ethelbert's.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.920
 But it's felt like that, AE.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.760
 Well, they got rid of the AE.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.960
 Well, I'm going to keep up.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.800
 Look, they're all dead.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.840
 No one's going to complain.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.600
 Eithelbert.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.400
 You have to say it like that.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.520
 All right, Ethelbert's might be Ethel.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.480
 This code is a legal encyclopedia from the 7th century.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.280
 And it's basically, it has an extensive list of crimes and punishments.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.120
 And normally for lots of them are for injuries.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.520
 So I just wanted if you could guess, which was worth more or less.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.600
 So it's kind of again, you know, it's kind of higher or lower.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.720
 Play your cards right style.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.360
 Right, knocking out a front tooth.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.280
 Okay, so the punishment for this, we're talking about.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.960
 So it's the financial penalty.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.360
 I'll give you the first one, which is six shillings.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.080
 Six shillings, okay.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.160
 What's that worth these days?

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.640
 30p.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.640
 Yeah, 30p.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.440
 That's not a big fine.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.800
 It's a few Freddos.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.960
 Okay, actually these days it's probably not.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.240
 Little finger.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.920
 More than a two for sure.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.600
 Front tooth though, it's one of the big 40.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.920
 I don't mind, little finger it must be.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.680
 Because how do you drink tea otherwise?

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.400
 Yeah, it's a good point.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.080
 It's 11 shillings.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:06.720
 James is right.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.320
 Yes, makes a lot of sense.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.760
 Stabbing a man through his genitals.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.520
 More or less than the little finger, yeah.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.800
 Does seem like it's more.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.520
 Feels like well, yeah.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.720
 12, 12 shillings.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.000
 It's less, less.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.280
 Six shillings.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.160
 Really?

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.880
 Yeah, really value the little finger, yeah.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.080
 Yeah.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:26.720
 Crikey.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.720
 I'm taking someone's thumbnail.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.040
 More or less than stabbing someone through the penis.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.000
 Well, oh okay.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.200
 So I think more than stabbing someone through the penis,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.480
 less than the little finger.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.760
 I just, I mean, it feels like it should be way less,

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.040
 but then we've already established

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.960
 that stabbing someone in the penis

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.040
 is actually positively encouraged.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.880
 That's Alphalbert's code, baby.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:52.400
 Why is he going so specific?

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.240
 Surely you don't need a separate law

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.080
 for taking someone's thumbnail.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.160
 Is it different to taking someone's index fingernail?

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.240
 Yes, it would be actually,

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.680
 because thumbs and fingers have different values.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.480
 Little finger has a different value to the thumb,

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.640
 and all the fingers have different values, I believe, yeah.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.040
 All right, then.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.400
 What do you get for taking someone's thumbnail?

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.520
 How would you even go about doing that?

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.880
 I'd take three shillings.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.200
 Really?

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.160
 Yeah, an argan.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.360
 Do you think that's cutting the top off

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.800
 or to pulling out the whole thing?

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.840
 Like pliers and then pulling it off like in torture, right?

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.880
 Yeah, okay.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.760
 I think that's it.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.480
 Although it doesn't apply

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.400
 that people went around torturing each other at the time.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.040
 Yeah.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.240
 With like a menu.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.680
 What can we afford to do then, let's go.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.520
 I can definitely stab him in the dick, but...

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.120
 If you can stab him with an index fingernail,

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.880
 you can't afford to take his little finger,

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.720
 or you can punch him in the nose for three shillings

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.480
 and take one premolar, but not a front tooth.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.840
 How much was the stabbing someone in the genitals?

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.720
 That was six shillings.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.040
 So you can punch someone in the nose twice.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.320
 Or stab him in the penis.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.760
 Yeah, that's a good point.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.720
 Craigie.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:52.880
 Yeah.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.960
 Which would you do?

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.880
 Which would I do?

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.560
 Well, it depends what the person's done, doesn't it?

00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.920
 I wouldn't do either of those things.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.400
 Yeah.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.840
 It's implying that actually taking away someone's ability

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.360
 to take the piss out of someone's genitals

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.560
 by removing that little finger

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.400
 is worse than removing their actual genitals.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:08.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.320
 Because that's the main thing you use your little finger for,

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:10.640
 isn't it?

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.200
 What a good point.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.080
 Yeah.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.880
 Yeah, that's the main thing.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.200
 And it's inhumane not to give someone the chance to do that.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.280
 If someone had done that to me, let's say,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.600
 I would probably want to stab that person in the penis

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.480
 and could afford to.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.320
 Well, I need to brag.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.680
 Well, sorry.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.440
 We...

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.840
 The advertising yield for this year is 18 shillings.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.360
 OK, that's it.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.720
 That's all of our facts.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.800
 That is the end of our compilations

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.400
 for a good little while now.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.440
 But in the meantime, if you'd like to speak to me,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.320
 go to Twitter and you'll find me on @JamesHarkin

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.800
 and he is on @AndrewHunterM.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.960
 Dan is on @Shrieberlan.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.320
 And if you'd like to speak to Anna,

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.000
 you can email her at podcast@qi.com.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.080
 You can go to notionsthingsafish.com

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.920
 for everything else to do with fish.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.240
 And if you go to qi.com/fishevents,

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.640
 you will specifically get the details

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.880
 of our upcoming tour dates.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.200
 We will see you next week with a normal episode.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.760
 And until then, enjoy your weekend.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.800
 Goodbye!

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:24.800
