00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 Hi guys just before we start this show I wanted to say hope you're all doing okay

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.400
 in this bizarre situation that we've all found ourselves in and I hope you're staying safe

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.080
 and washing your hands a billion times a minute and not going near anyone else and there's

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.880
 really nothing that we can tell you about this virus that you can't already learn from the news

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.920
 and the medical advice and all of that jazz but what we can do is we can still share with you

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.520
 our four favorite facts from the last seven days and fill your head with distracting nonsense facts

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.680
 which hopefully will distract you from the fact you're stuck in a house with your spouse or your

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.080
 kids or your mates and you now all want to kill each other and will distract you even from the

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.480
 slightly more disconcerting global event so as long as you guys continue to listen we am afraid

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.080
 are going to continue to podcast every week starting now okay on with the show

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:12.320
 hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.840
 from the QI offices in cauldron garden my name is Dan Shriver I am sitting here with Andrew

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.520
 Hunter Murray and itch is in ski and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.040
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.320
 starting with my fact this week my fact is computer pioneer Charles Babbage once cooked himself in

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.400
 an oven for four minutes at 265 degrees just to see what would happen what was he trying to make at

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:55.200
 the time cooked Babbage Babbage cabbage confusion so this was as a result of an artistic friend of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.360
 him called Sir Francis Chantry who was a sculptor and he made big bronze statues and he was doing a

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 particularly big one so they had to build this giant oven for him to build it to cook it in and so

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.280
 Babbage heard about this and he was really intrigued and he went to see it and while he was there

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.240
 he was sort of talking to them and they said why don't you go inside be interested right and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.320
 Babbage said yeah that would be interesting so he went along with another guy called Captain

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.040
 Cater and his description which he wrote in his memoirs say the iron folding doors of the small room

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.640
 or oven were opened Captain Cater and myself entered and they were closed upon us then the further

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.360
 corner of the room which was paved with square stones was visibly a dull red heat the thermometer

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.480
 marked if I recollect rightly 265 degrees he talks about his pulse quickening he talks about the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.400
 perspiration and he says it was fine he says it was absolutely fine what yeah it's only there for

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.320
 how long for minutes four or five minutes six minutes he wasn't sure the heat sort of made him

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.440
 bit dosy probably there's one other thing he says someone didn't go in with him he says Thomas

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.480
 Lawrence who was suffering from indisposition did not think it prudent to join our party in fact

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.200
 he died almost second or third day after our experiment wow Thomas Lawrence never got to go it

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.560
 wouldn't have mattered if he had gone in the oven probably well maybe he should have gone in yeah

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.160
 never know perhaps I had some healing properties yeah maybe yeah this is not sound medical advice

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.320
 this amazing he but and he he went in other hot places well this it's thought that this was

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.600
 in preparation for his next big trip which was which was he went down a volcano and

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.560
 and an active volcano he went down the sousvius one of the most famous volcanoes yeah of all celebrity

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:43.360
 volcano did you make who died died from falling into a volcano or it doesn't but I don't think so no

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.720
 but he he was obsessed with he wanted to experience an earthquake and he once found out he was

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.040
 in Italy at the time and he heard a town had been destroyed by an earthquake and he rushed there

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.440
 just in case there were some aftershocks he could feel yeah but he said my passion was disappointed

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.400
 so I consoled myself by a flirtation with a volcano oh he didn't feel the earth mood

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.960
 so did he go and like dip himself in lava all happened in the bottom now he went into the crater

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.640
 you know there are bits in sort of in the lip of the crater of an active volcano so he went in he saw

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.960
 the lava below him and he observed the bubbles of it swelling up and because it was active at the time

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.120
 he made a measurement of the eruptions he said right those every 10 minutes and he said well okay so

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.400
 I can go in for up to eight minutes and he did he went in for six minutes and he was lowered by rope

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.520
 was yeah yeah it's extraordinary and did he eventually throw the ring into the lava

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.240
 one thing he put he put his cane down in a specific spot and it happened to

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.000
 hit I think a bit of lava so it burst into flames

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.840
 he had a flaming cane as he was trying to put it out yeah okay so first of all no second of all

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.640
 because we've already done some stuff but who was Charles Babbage that Charles Babbage computer pioneer

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.480
 he's historically linked with Ada Lovelace and he was the person who dreamt up effectively

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.080
 the original computer he's he's known as the father of computing and it was something he never

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.040
 got to fully make in his lifetime though in the hundreds of years since we've actually finished

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.560
 his plans and shown that his plans did work so he was a genius this guy was a proper genius although

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.920
 it's you say he was a father of computing but I quite like the description that is uncle of computing

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.120
 oh because he didn't spawn anything and I haven't quite realized it's about Charles Babbage so he

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.080
 made this very famous difference engine or he designed this difference engine in the 1820s

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.720
 early 30s and that was essentially going to be a big calculator and then he thought no no I

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.840
 want to do this analytical engine which was going to be a big computer and kind of the difference being

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.240
 I think about memory and storage the ability to you know build on stuff well so for instance the

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.240
 difference engine could only do certain things but the analytical engine you could program to do

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.880
 lots of different things yes and that's where Ada Lovelace came in with her ability to program but

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.560
 he did all this never got made because the government stopped funding him because he kept not

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.280
 completing stuff and essentially he had zero impacts on computing so he's not the he didn't spawn

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.240
 anything because everyone was just like well that was all pointless it got sold for scrap or used

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.640
 up a scrap that was it only one of the computing pioneers in the 40s knew about him really what

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.120
 else did and it was only in the 1970s when they're going through his paperwork that they actually

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.240
 discovered oh yeah this Babbage was sort of on to this yeah it's something similar it's amazing

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.640
 isn't it yeah he got two the equivalent of two million dollars from the government to make

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.960
 this difference engine and then there was a change of government and he insisted on meeting the

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.200
 new prime minister who was Robert Peel and he basically just turned up and yelled at his face

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:52.080
 and then Peel went okay fine I'll talk to Parliament and so Peel went to Parliament and sort of

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.920
 discussed this idea of giving him more money and everyone just decided to make jokes at his expense

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.840
 it's like oh the first thing is going to calculate is when it might finally do something and stuff

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.800
 like that so yeah so I was like it's up there with the banter you see in the house of peels and then

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.880
 he tried to become a politician didn't he yeah but he couldn't get elected because basically I was

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.440
 saying you just took two million dollars for nothing yeah and they just say they would heckle him

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.240
 during his speeches about this whatever project he was doing and why he was losing this money and

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.280
 it infuriated him so much that he would abandon whatever political speech he had just to yell back

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.120
 at them going you don't understand what I'm working all of a genius kind of thing and then to get

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.960
 more money he came up with this brilliant scheme because he couldn't get any more money from the

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.720
 government so you felt what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a computer that can play

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.880
 knots and crosses and I'm going to go around the country and play knots and crosses against people

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.200
 for money and get all their money off them didn't really yeah and then Ada Lovelace said no that's

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.120
 stupid idea yeah he's extraordinary he had so many of these little plans and ideas that took him

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.520
 away from this great big idea that he was trying to work on there was a crazy one I read about where

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.240
 he was at the ballet and he was watching this this show and he got really bored and he thought this

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:10.320
 is just too boring I could do better than this so he dreamt of he dreamt of an idea which was called

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:16.800
 the rainbow dance and he actually had this rehearsed he had 60 female dancers all represented they

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.920
 were dressed in white and they represented fireflies and they were all dancing and in the background

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.680
 there was a huge projected hydrogen blow lamp that had color filters on it so he would put different

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.160
 colors projected onto each of the dancers on the stage so it would look like what he called

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.440
 the rainbow dance that sounds really cool it sounds really cool the problem was is that it was

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.240
 extremely dangerous so when they did their first rehearsal they had two fire engines standing by

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.920
 because they were worried that the theater would burn down and eventually the theater owner said

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.280
 I'm not doing this I'm not putting this live flame in this theater while you try and do this

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.600
 will kill everyone so it was never performed so the difference engine the first the first one he

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.440
 designed that would have been a calculator basically I didn't know why it was necessary to build it

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.320
 but it's so before that you just had to use if you were doing calculations for various reasons

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.520
 you had to think of a ready reckiner which was a table of basically sums that other people had

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.520
 done but they'd done them by hand and they and these were the early computers the computers were

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.800
 the people who were sitting in rooms doing basically boring wage slave work with these primitive

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.720
 devices but they had loads of mistakes in them because it was really badly paid and it wasn't

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.880
 interesting work to do okay I read this in two different bases and I can't quite believe it but

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.640
 allegedly the first computers doing these ready reckiner tables were French hairdressers who had

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.520
 been left out of work by the French Revolution well because everyone had their heads off and didn't

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.680
 need a haircut in the bar or maybe like if you had long hair in the French Revolution you would

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:56.400
 just put your head just at the edge of the guillotine so cut the long bit of your hair off

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.960
 one hope no one noticed it was just that hair that was on that head then wave the hair around to the

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:09.280
 crowd yeah we got it slink off back down the ladder so I have no idea why these French hairdressers

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:15.120
 were left short of work by the Revolution it was definitely the truth of the French were the best

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.520
 at having logarithm tables and trig tables and stuff like that and that was why he wanted to do this

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:26.080
 difference engine because maybe it might help us catch up with the French because it gave them

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:33.040
 an advantage in warfare because it's good for working out which directions to go in your ships and

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.880
 it's good for building bridges and building things yeah is it true I read somewhere actually no

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.480
 this was I remember this was on a QI episode Doro Breen made this point that when he did the plans

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.080
 he left sort of like Mount Weasels in the plans so that no one could build them they would explain

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.520
 what a Mount Weasel is in a map when you want to have copyright over a map you put in a fake

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.360
 town or stop or it's just a little detail that anyone copies it you know that they copied it

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.280
 you can prove it by saying this place doesn't exist we created it for our map and so that's

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.880
 the same thing he put a few Mount Weasels but these Mount Weasels were designed to kill the machine

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.840
 so it's like a virus basically yes is that doesn't excuse for cocking up

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.360
 it's I think it's yeah yeah I must say if we get any facts wrong in today's episode they are

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.040
 Mount Weasels my six years of this podcast have been Mount Weasels I think a friend of mine has just

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.440
 written a book about dictionaries it's not out yet but it's she's called Ellie Williams and it's a

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.160
 book about it's about Mount Weasels basically and apparently I think one of the first ever Mount Weasels

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:43.680
 was someone in an encyclopedia it was an entry about miss somebody Mount Weasel who yeah and she

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.280
 was sort of she was an entrapid pioneering journalist he used to have sex with Weasels that's

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:55.760
 right she did yeah and what was that was the clue that it didn't rip and in the original

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.200
 encyclopedia biography I'm going off memory so it's slightly wrong but it's something like she was

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:06.640
 killed by an explosion when she was working for Shrapnel magazine or something they made up this

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.840
 really fun fake biography for her but talking about viruses and bugs it would really be if we're

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:16.320
 talking about actual computer viruses kind of the Ada Lovelace department that was responsible

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.880
 for those because she joined him essentially didn't she so she was Byron's daughter and she

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.480
 coming out ceremony she when she was 18 or whatever she met coming out had a different meaning in

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.480
 those days different meaning yes what's the meaning I actually took it to be no no so people when

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.120
 they sort of came of age young ladies they could be presented in society posh young ladies

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.000
 okay cool and it was basically saying my ladies my daughters on the market now have your you know

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:51.520
 have a go and so if you think you're hard enough yeah anyway she bumped into Charles Babid it was

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:57.280
 impressed joined him wrote loads of code for his engine so I was reading a blog by a coder and

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.840
 modern day code he wrote this a couple of years ago and he actually ran her code it was a code for

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.280
 working out but newy numbers and he ran her code through his computer and it didn't work

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:14.000
 and he went back through her code and I had a bug in it what's a boony oh god don't know I thought you

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.040
 know I was really good I thought you know what I'll just have a really simple way of explaining

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.880
 for newy numbers and I started looking into it and boy is it complicated yeah cool oh my days

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.800
 it's about number theory and um powers of numbers and adding them all together and them having

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:39.200
 certain relationships between each other okay that's hard yeah it's sexy stuff but yeah so that's

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.000
 the first ever book how come is that a bit for that coder who had the first ever computer that's

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.880
 amazing um I know one of us he might have struggled to get along with oh based on something

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:58.400
 aligned in his biography who Babid yeah okay did he hate men with beards no man what you're

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.280
 looking at me it's not all time you're looking sorry sorry uh glasses it's not glasses did he hate

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:11.360
 northerners he hated puns sorry yeah he wrote that puns are detestable because they just rely on

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:16.720
 one word sounding like another word he would have hated the Babbage Cabbage joke at the top of the show

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:24.160
 the best thing about Babbage which is always comes up with QI research is how much he hated noise

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:33.520
 yeah it's so good like he just he was just so anti any noise in London whatsoever and that he had

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:40.000
 made lists of whenever there was any noise that put him off his work he detailed 165 interruptions

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.560
 that he suffered over 80 days he made a list of encourages of street music which included

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:54.880
 having keepers public houses gin shops children visitors to the city from the country uh and then

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.520
 basically his neighbours hated him so much that they just started playing tin whistles out of his

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.720
 outside of his house and stuff like that yeah I mean it sounds like London sounds horrific back then

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:10.480
 and he had it had it in especially for organ grinders he said there are a thousand of them and he

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.920
 was a bit xenophobic about it he said they're all Italian organ grinders who've come over here to

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.680
 destroy the peace and he spent all this money on lawyers he went to the home secretary and he got

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.360
 the law changed yeah he actually campaigned for and won a change in the law he was the Nigel Farage

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:33.360
 of the early 19th century I don't think we can change that we can't go that far okay Babbage Farage

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:40.400
 it's not a big leap yeah so like and like I said people would like tease him because they hated him

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.600
 about them just him always saying turn it down turn it down and so at one stage there was a brass

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.880
 band that played outside of his house for five hours and children would follow him down the street

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.640
 making loads of noise and he said um he was quoted as saying in one case there was certainly above

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:02.240
 a hundred persons consisting of men women and boys with multitudes of young children who followed

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:08.400
 me through the streets before I could find a policeman so this is followed by a hundred people

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.920
 making a load of noise he's like the opposite of the pie and pi per valentine he's not playing an

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:20.960
 instrument everyone else playing instruments at him as they chase him down the street wow my god he

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.320
 also believed in ghosts so he started a ghost club at university to prove their existence and the

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.880
 other club that he set up with the same sort of group of friends was the extractors club and the

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:43.520
 extractors club was dedicated a lot of fans he wouldn't have like that yeah the idea was that they were

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:50.080
 dedicated to liberating any one of their members from a madhouse should they be committed yeah why is

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.720
 that I guess they were coming up with so many odd ideas trying to summon the devil maybe it wasn't

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.480
 funny yeah so just quickly back on the relationship with Ada Lovelace yeah um so she um

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:06.960
 that was obviously very famous at a time in very high-end society and he was an inventor who was

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:13.200
 obviously a bit of a genius but was not very good at completing his inventions and so she decided

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.960
 to write him a letter saying that I would like to kind of go into partnership with you and I'll

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.800
 make sure that you get everything done but you just have to do it basically and she wrote to one

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.040
 of her friends if he does consent to what I propose I shall probably be enabled to keep him out

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:39.200
 of much hot water and bring his engine to consummation um I shall be I should she said I will be willing

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.800
 to be his whipper in during the next three years if I see fair prospects of success and she gave

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:50.640
 him all these lists of conditions that he would have to do if they were going to go into partnership

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:57.440
 and then um Babbage read her letter and then wrote his own notes on that saying saw AAL this morning

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:10.080
 and refused all the conditions okay it is time for fact number two and that is James okay my fat

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:17.200
 this week is that the Manchineal tree is so toxic that if you park under it and it rains the drips

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:25.520
 from the branches can strip the paint from your car so this is a tree um you get it in the Caribbean

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:31.520
 I have seen it I have to say when I was in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and when you see it there's

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.720
 always um all the ones that I saw there was a big red mark on it saying don't go near this tree and

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.760
 assign saying don't whatever you do don't go near this tree although it was in quite small fun so you

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.560
 have to get quite close to the tree and not just read it um but this is probably the most poisonous

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.760
 tree on earth and it says so in the Guinness Book of Records that it's the most poisonous tree

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.960
 and everything about it is poisonous so if you eat the fruit it's terrible if you burn it and

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.800
 breathe in some of the smoke it's terrible and it has this chemical called forebowl and it's very

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.680
 water soluble so if water goes onto it the chemical can get into there and it will drip on you

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:14.000
 and it can cause terrible um rashes on your skin and it's so strong apparently it can rip the

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.520
 paint from your car it's extraordinary yeah it's so cool although lots of them are in Florida

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:28.160
 painted with a big X which to me looks like the treasure so i would be tempted to go there

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:34.320
 it's bad ages digging around eating the roots from the the obvious thing would be get rid of them

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.960
 right that that sounds like why don't you just chop them down but apparently they choose not to

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.840
 purely out of um they help with erosion from the coast as it's coming in it's very good for

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.360
 protecting other trees um also I don't think we just destroy every bit of nature that's dangerous to us

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:56.800
 yes we do so I mostly got interested in this because I saw this article in the BMJ from a few years ago

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.880
 called eating a manchineal beach apple by Nicolette H. Strickland who is a consultant radiologist

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:09.920
 and she and a friend were holidaying and the Caribbean and they saw a piece of fruit on the floor

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.480
 and thought oh that looks nice and then decided to eat it she sounds like a woman after my own

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:22.720
 heart and so they ate this stuff and got extremely extremely sick but luckily she's a scientist

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.080
 so she could write it up about what happened um she said it was incredibly painful she could hardly

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:35.680
 swallow the pain was exacerbated by most alcoholic beverages or I love the way that she's tried all the

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:41.760
 different alcoholic beverages um although it was mildly appeased by peanut colladas um so if you

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.920
 ever do have one of these then have some peanut colladas and that'll make you feel a bit better huh

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.920
 if you like put that to the song isn't it if you like peanut colladas and getting caught in the rain

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:57.520
 don't park under the mentioning tree it's it's also it's a it could it was used as a useful thing for

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:02.080
 indigenous people who were living it's a infloder at the time where the tree is um there's a story

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.760
 it's a bit of a myth of a story um but it's one of those ones that sits 50/50 on the side of

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:13.200
 we're not quite sure if it's true or not uh there was a guy called one ponte de Leon who was an explorer

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.600
 and he tried to colonize a specific bit of florida he was initially it was said legendary looking for

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.560
 the fountain of youth which was said to be in florida um so he returned there after a few trips and he

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:28.560
 brought 200 people he had priests and farmers and artisans and 50 horses and so on and he wanted to

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:34.880
 properly colonize this place and they were attacked by the local um people who wanted them to go away

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.200
 and what they would do is they would dip the tips of the arrows in the machinial sap and

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.760
 fire at them so even if it sort of pierced them just a bit it would go inside and and give them a

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:50.000
 poisoning and and supposedly that is how this leader um ponte de Leon died um he took a arrow to

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.680
 the thigh and they retreated so they they actually it worked we need some peanut colladas over here now

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:01.360
 i read that that was just a slight attempt later to slander him saying he was looking for the

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.320
 fountain of youth because it was basically saying this guy is an idiot right so yeah so like some

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.960
 lots of sources say it was i mean what he was definitely searching for was an island called

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.000
 bimini and the king of spain had granted it to him but he hadn't said where it was i don't know

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.200
 how i don't know how that came about basically king of spain said you can have it if you can find it

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:29.040
 he was definitely colonizing florida at this point yeah what an easy trick for a king or queen

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:36.720
 just oh you can have biblia bubbly boy and that's my debt paid off it's a it's going excellent mount

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:44.320
 weasel sir but yeah apparently as well it would aid people who sort of were shipwrecked sailors for

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.560
 example if they didn't want to die a gruesome death they would know just eat that and end your

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.840
 life early it was sort of used as a suicide assistance as well again these are reports from from

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.880
 the annals of history can't be sure if they're true you could rub yourself all over with lime juice

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.840
 apparently to stop the toxin corroding your skin this is based on an account i read in 1821

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.040
 and so i maybe check the updated medical advice but that's what the local carrot people used to do so

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.440
 they'd sort of cut the trees down and they wouldn't really be wearing clothes but they would cover

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.200
 themselves head to toe and lime juice i don't think there's a lot of lines that is a lot of

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:23.040
 lines to cover a whole human body yeah that's more aren't they lime does more yes compared to human

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:30.880
 bodies yeah not smaller although he's in fishing because you can drop the poison into a sort of pond

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.800
 or a lake and all the fish just sort of go belly up float the toilet yeah but i'm not so that again

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.520
 this was in this account but it seems very risky to then consume the fish that have consumed this

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:48.320
 hiding that's true because it might be concentrated in a bit of them yeah although fish is often served

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.560
 with a little bit of lemons so if you coat all your fish in the lemon maybe that's why it's made

00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:00.320
 into furniture as well isn't it or what you're kidding yeah so so they use the trick but so they

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:07.040
 they have a special way of removing any poison elements okay but yeah so but yeah if you dry it out

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.360
 so they might fire all around it before cutting it down before harvesting it and that is

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.680
 precisely all out and then you can cut it down relatively safely you have to wear a big mask

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.720
 interesting way of potentially killing someone because it would just look like a normal bit of furniture

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.840
 you know have a seat they have a seat yeah they have to sit down with a bird bottom though wouldn't they

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:32.800
 thank you for coming in trousers off thank you have a seat have you heard of the man eating trees

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:39.760
 of Madagascar so these were written about first in 1874 in the newspaper The New York World

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:45.040
 which was quite an unreliable newspaper probably because it published this account about the man eating

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:51.440
 trees in Madagascar and it describes this human sacrifice done by a tribe called the Encodo tribe

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.720
 who took a woman to this tree and they they leave her by it for a bit they put her on it and then

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:02.960
 it branches all coil round and devour her and this is complete yellow journalism hoax stuff is not

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:08.240
 real at all obviously but a book was written a couple years later called Madagascar land of the

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:15.520
 man eating tree and in it I just really like this author kind of using the story but then disassociating

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.800
 himself from it he said I do not know whether this tiger tree really exists or whether the blood

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.280
 curdling story is about it a pure myth it is enough for my purpose if its story focuses your

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.560
 interest on one of the least known spots of the world it's such baloney he's just saying it's

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:35.920
 not true despite the fact it's the title of his book yeah yeah there's a so meta that you're now

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:42.240
 then repeating the same fascination I get people interested in Madagascar that's all I'm interested

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.600
 well what's the title of his book it's not the man eating tree in Madagascar is it yeah it's Madagascar

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:53.280
 land of the man eating tree well actually I'm on his side I reckon a few more people visited

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:58.160
 boosted the tourist industry back in when was it he was writing the 1870s boosted Madagascar

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:05.680
 tourists in the 1870s yeah because there's so there's like a bottling sound actually can I just

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:10.880
 can I just mention one more dangerous tree yes please so there's one more dangerous tree that's

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:17.200
 probably the most well-known tree for being dangerous and that is dangerous because it knocks

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:24.160
 you on the head the coconut the coconut tree do you know why the coconut tree has quite bad reputation

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.840
 so people say like in in gales people sort of flock inside because they're going to get knocked

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:33.040
 unconscious by it and loads you know there's that fact about yeah but I thought it was like in

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:40.640
 Papua New Guinea like 10% of the people who were in A&E had been hit by a coconut so so this is all

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:49.600
 the fault of sharks because though it's so I think I'm straight dope and snopes looked into this but

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:55.440
 there was the myth that increased like rocketed up 2002 and it was propagated by this shark expert

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.640
 who did that famous comparison that said falling coconuts killed 10 times more people or 15 times more

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.280
 people than sharks do trying to say look sharks aren't that dangerous fair enough but he was

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.880
 basing that on a nonsense made up study by an insurance company holiday insurance company that

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.400
 was saying 150 people a year are killed by coconuts and it was actually based on two anecdotal

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.680
 potential deaths by one traveler and then coconuts have this terrible reputation so you're telling

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:28.000
 me they you're telling me that all that coconut insurance so far it's pointless to take my coconut

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.800
 home it back to the shops tomorrow just saving your bit of hassle well there's I think

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.200
 so Queensland remember in Australia Queensland removed all its coconut trees from beaches in

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:45.920
 2002 because of the danger posed see I told you people do that for dangerous trees they took

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.800
 you're right that's not just me but I am Australian so maybe it's Australians I would genuinely

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:57.840
 just give people helmets which have a massive blade like an axe blade on top that way you just get

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:03.040
 two coconut halves and you're fine does it not maybe make the whole of the earth a little bit more

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:10.240
 dangerous if everyone's walking around with blades on the heads maybe what you take with Lord had

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:18.960
 you get away with the other yeah coconut deaths would drop but I think axe helmet yes

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:28.640
 okay it is time for fact number three and that is Anna my fight this week is that cryonic freezing

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:39.120
 chambers are built to store up to four bodies and five heads wait a minute so that means there's

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.520
 something not quite added up here this is like a future game show right where they battle out five

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:47.040
 heads for the four bodies who's going to be placed on the head that's it yeah oh what you mean

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:55.520
 like musical chairs yeah it's much like that how does that work well it's this I will say at the

00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:01.840
 top is a very morbid fact but basically you can get crayonically frozen a few hundred people have

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:07.920
 done it so far and you've got two options you can go whole body head to toe or you can do just head

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.400
 and it's actually a bit cheaper to do just the head so yeah it's not much cheaper though

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:18.880
 it's not enough cheaper is it you're right I would I mean so full body or one I got full body cost

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.200
 two hundred and fifteen thousand dollars from the source I was on I've actually got a better deal

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.920
 okay okay two hundred thousand but okay okay and then the one and then head is ninety five thousand

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.480
 dollars but that's half as much now the head is the bit I would want to keep but I think you should

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.520
 pay a quarter as much you're storing so much less you're using so much like way more important though

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.840
 it's about demand isn't it Andy it's not about space yeah come on mate what you're using glass

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.480
 dry eyes I just think that should be better deals well I agree I think maybe when demand does go up maybe

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.680
 the price will come down but yeah at the moment you can do either and also another weird thing about

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:58.160
 the storages everyone's upside down which is truly bizarre so you've got all these bodies in a tank

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.840
 and they're still with their heads at the bottom and apparently that's because if there's some sort

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.960
 of an error there's some sort of a leakage and the body starts to thaw it'll come from the top

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.600
 and then the feet will thaw first because you don't want your head thawing first because as Andy said

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.960
 that's for some of us is the bit that we like the most this is only in the russian one isn't it

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:22.080
 no there are lots of down yeah yeah yeah and the russian one is the cheaper one by the way okay

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.320
 maybe the one that you have a good deal at I don't know is that right um what was your prices my

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.160
 price was two hundred grand that was alcohol in America but the russian one does do a bit more budget

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:36.880
 the russian one is thirty six thousand dollars for for full body and eighteen thousand for just the

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:43.600
 head so it's a lot cheaper yeah but the bad thing about it is you don't have your own fridge you have

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:51.680
 to share fridges with other people and sometimes with like pets and things yeah I think it's unbelievable

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:56.480
 and you're not you're not in the separate this is krio rus is the name of the firm isn't it

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:01.840
 like toys or us yeah yeah yeah well and actually because it's russian the are will be backwards

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.520
 but you're not even so you're not only not in a separate chamber you're just in this place in a

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.880
 sleeping bag apparently yeah upside down in a sleeping bag with some dog next to your head that's

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.040
 it's the same in the American ones completely except there are just more people in the russian ones

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.480
 so you do have to share with a few people okay yeah it's more like you know I thought you got your own

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.480
 tube basically in the American ones oh I thought the American ones it was in I think it's in

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.280
 the tube that you have the four bodies and they do even for the heads they put that in

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.720
 its own special sleeping bag just quite like that it's a sleeping bag it's going in so nice

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:44.560
 yeah and it's because they sort of say that to reanimate the body is it gonna be a lot harder like

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.120
 with the theories of you know why just use your head as opposed to the full body that's one of the

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.440
 things they say you know we'll probably grow you a new body is what they say or we'll 3d print

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.960
 you a new body you know who knows what the technology will be but that's not the worrying bit you

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.600
 could be a robot you can say you can say any bollocks to people who've just given you 200 grand

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:07.440
 and are going in your freezer I mean yeah I think that's what we are saying this is pseudoscience right

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:13.600
 is that what we're saying I don't want so I kind of agree with there's one scientist so I was

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.720
 reading an article by one scientist online who I agree with who was saying essentially it's not

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.200
 pseudoscience it's like science is on very unproven at the moment and there is evidence that you can

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.000
 reanimate certain animals but it's extremely unlikely we'll be able to reanimate ourselves but on

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.880
 the other hand even if there's only a 1% chance you know why not take it well one reason you might

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:40.720
 come back to life forever yeah I mean it seems like it's worth doing well never ever just a bit further

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.520
 down the line for a bit more time yeah that's assuming immortality has been cracked I think that's

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:50.400
 two things have been shoved together that are quite quite right that's the 0.5% chance we've got

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.920
 the elixir of life and we're able to reanimate what if they can do it they can just do it again

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:59.200
 aren't they you know if they can reanimate the dead yes I'm with pungently on over that

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:08.640
 the big problem which neurologists say is basically your brain can't survive this kind of thing

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:14.240
 yeah and even if you could somehow bring your body back to life you would be very likely to be

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:21.120
 severely brain-damaged yeah the brain is designed to keep out other liquids and stuff there's

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:26.000
 the blood brain barrier which is meant to keep your brain separate and so you would have to pump the

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.320
 antifreeze basically so vigorously into the brain that it might be it might really damage the

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:38.240
 yes yeah and there is a British outfit devoted to cryonics so there are only a few cryonics

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.720
 chambers in the world there are a couple in America one in Russia but there there is in the UK a

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:49.920
 cryonics ambulance and what the financial times interviewed a guy called Tim Gibson who is a member of

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:56.320
 the British cryonics society basically and they do all the medical procedures to cool you down

00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:03.200
 and stabilize you and then they'll send you to the USA and there are 40 people on the list who

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:09.280
 might ring up at any time and say I'm dying can you come and get me and they give you you know

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.040
 they give you all the drugs and then they replace the blood with antifreeze we should probably say

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.600
 why they replace it with antifreeze because when you because when you're quietly frozen you're not

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.000
 you don't actually have any ice in your body because that'll be really bad your body is huge

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.080
 proportion of it is water and if you actually frozen it into ice then it would expand and all

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.640
 your cells would explode so you have to replace all the blood you have to pump the body full of

00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:34.800
 antifreeze to stop the water actually turning to ice so I think people think that you're becoming

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:40.720
 kind of ice but yes we definitely know we have we have Austin Powers images in our head I think

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:47.120
 for cryonics right yeah it's yeah demolition man so this thing about having this ambulance come

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.840
 they they try to get there quite quick because obviously once you pass away well no no it's

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:57.280
 all to do with preserving the bodies straight away right so part of this Russian company the cryoRS

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:06.320
 company they offer VIP package deals yeah and so at the base level what they do is they give you a

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:11.840
 Fitbit style wristband and that will alert an alert that will alert a nearby team so when they see

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.640
 it sort of flatline they'll go quick let's get to them ASAP well if your battery's just read out

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:22.880
 they I have an Apple watch right and the battery runs out all the time and if every time that happens

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:28.080
 suddenly in a crack squad and ambulance turn up turn up and try to cut your head off

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:33.680
 it is is the only ambulance which turns up hoping that you'll be dead

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.680
 yes if you're fine then they have to go away again yeah that's brilliant they would have to wait

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.600
 outside with the other ambulance crew who are trying to keep you alive and then have an argument

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:53.120
 and so the father of chronics is a guy called Robert Ettinger and he is preserved at the moment

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.640
 in one of these places as are his late mother and also his first and second wives god that's going

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:03.840
 to cause problems just I just read that man what a brilliant sitcom that is in the making right

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:09.280
 I think do you think they're all in the same tube because that's four people that's a four person

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:15.200
 yeah I want to use it some stranger's head oh god how do I end up with these guys

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.120
 no once you learn that that's the dynamic you're like I'm but I'm paid to go in that one

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.120
 I want to see that when I wake up first wife going oh and who's this lovely lady

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:31.200
 um so this this all is quite far fetched obviously this kind of cryonic freezing

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:37.680
 and actually Danny said cryogenic earlier but just to be clear cryogenics is actually the

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.160
 science of getting stuff to really really really low temperatures it's not to do with cryonics

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:47.920
 and this is made very clear on the official cryogenics website of the United States which is basically

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.600
 the website which serves anyone who's interested in that scientist who are interested in that

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.320
 basically on their front page they're like we are not about freezing bodies and hoping to reanimate

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.720
 them after death we do not believe this is a real thing if you want to do that look up cryonics

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:06.400
 please leave our website so that's people always confuse those things but it's quite far fetched

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:13.200
 but what we can do is reanimate people very temporarily now and this is this is really exciting

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:19.200
 so what have you just happened it's so it's basically about if you're in a traumatic accident

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.520
 and it's extremely unlikely that you're going to be able to be saved in the time that you've got

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.320
 then they can sort of put you on hold for a few hours and this is really early days there hasn't

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:34.240
 been the study published but at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in November last year

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.960
 they've placed at least one patient in suspended animation and so what they do is they come in

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.720
 they've had a trauma they've been shot or stabbed they have a big cardiac arrest they've lost loads

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:47.120
 of blood they're not going to survive if you only have you know five minutes to operate on them

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:53.440
 so you cool their body to 10 to 15 degrees Celsius which is obviously much colder than the human

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:59.680
 body is supposed to go by replacing all of their blood with ice cold saline solution and so

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.920
 their brain almost completely stops they've done this for a few hours and then you have two hours

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:09.040
 to actually operate on them and save their lives wow and then you replace their blood and they come back

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.520
 like and they are clinically dead for that period of time for two hours clinically dead wow it's

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.640
 not amazing it is amazing it's not much of an episode of Austin Powers is it when you come back

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:25.600
 after two hours the fashions are going to be kind of similar to what you left so many dated references

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:32.880
 but that's so we've learned how to press pause on life basically it looks like it yeah again

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:36.560
 it hasn't been published yet they're sort of like drip dropping all these hints that it's very

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.800
 exciting but they should be known by the end of the year that's extraordinary um I have another

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:51.120
 freezing thing okay yeah um so readers digest magazine just suggested various methods to deal with

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:56.160
 hemorrhoids there's just a 10 top 10 methods deal with hemorrhoids one of them was putting a warm tea bag

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.320
 against your bottom and one of them was grating a raw potato and making a kind of potato

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:05.520
 poultice okay and then off the back of this there are lots of other websites which recommended putting

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:12.960
 a frozen wedge of potato into your bottom for 30 seconds and then for a minute and then for one

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:19.040
 minute 30 and so on um like a chip a frozen chip no like a potato wedge but that's like a thick chip

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:26.240
 a wedge is sorry I can't believe that this is that away we're having a wedge is different to a chip

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:32.000
 yeah it's different a chip would be a cuboid whereas a wedge would have a curved end at a sharp end

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.680
 yeah a chip like a wedge like chip like a door wedge do you think the shape is important

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.680
 probably isn't it because you never sharpened in first I think if you're going to put anything

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:45.360
 up your bump the shape is in part of it but you will want to put the fit the thin end of the wedge

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:51.440
 that's where we get the phrase from you don't don't start with the big end of the wedge

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:56.080
 no you're right my way to happen anyway doctors recommend not to do this because it does

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.160
 some work and you just end up ruining a perfectly good potato wedge

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:06.000
 that's the second fact you've had today where there's been a very long explanation of an amazing

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.400
 fact with the caveat at the end this but this isn't true what was the first one?

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:16.080
 the Madagascar tree is not really true I've not read Andy's autobiography I should frozen potatoes

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.360
 at my bum page one I don't actually do that

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:30.400
 okay it's time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy okay my fact is that if Hamlet had

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.520
 wanted to buy a lemon it would have cost him 700 euros okay this sounds like another one of your

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:44.240
 facts from this week I've got dance notes here now the hamlet I'm referring to is contemporary with

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.800
 Shakespeare so it's if Hamlet had been alive when Shakespeare wrote the play because Hamlet's

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.720
 based on an older story it's several hundred years before that so I'm talking about the late 16th

00:40:52.720 --> 00:41:00.480
 century yeah if Hamlet had been alive in the late 16th century yes and real yes and he'd been at

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:06.160
 home in Elsin or Castle which is real that's good news that's that's a one part of it it would

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.680
 have cost him 700 euros well did they have euros they they've cost him the local equivalent

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:18.400
 of 700 euros so you've decided when there was a very famous real man available for this fact Shakespeare

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:24.240
 yep you decided to go for a fake man okay if Shakespeare had wanted to buy a lemon when he was on

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:30.080
 his research trip to Elsinol it would have cost him the local equivalent at the time yeah of 700

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.800
 euros except he never went to Elsinol so that's another fact is that lemons used to be expensive

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.120
 that's why he said the word if at the start yes okay sorry so that's all of these things are

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:52.320
 completely sorted by that one word yeah yeah so the fact is lemons are cheap now is basically the

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.800
 fact but they were expensive then they were expensive then and they're both the true the price of

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:03.280
 lemons has changed I think it should have made that my fact shouldn't I that's one thing that

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:08.800
 is definitely true why have you got any sort of further explanation you know why are they so

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:16.720
 expensive were they gold plated back then so obviously lemons are more of a tropical fruit and

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:22.480
 the other thing I didn't know when researching is is that lemons you didn't get to Europe for a

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:30.080
 really long time yeah and in fact the part of the reason was that they are man made humans invented

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:36.400
 lemons wow they're cross-bred between a citron which is a Himalayan fruit which is large

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:42.000
 and not very juicy and then another kind of sour orange and we're not I think sure exactly what the

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.360
 other ingredient is but we know that it is a hybrid is it was it definitely not a natural hybrid

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.680
 it was definitely man made so I thought they were they're very good at hybridizing aren't they

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.840
 a citrus plant yeah I don't think we've got the records of whether it was man made or natural

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.440
 because I think some of them naturally met each other yeah oh right yeah they were okay all the

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:04.480
 hybrids weren't man made okay but all citrus goes back to these three super citrus fruits isn't it

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:10.400
 so weird yeah yeah so anyway they started in northern China or in Dioral Pakistan northeast in

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.920
 Dioral Pakistan I'm not sure where and then by the fourth century BC they were in Rome but they

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:19.680
 were still obviously very expensive and especially in northern Europe by Denmark which is where

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:27.600
 Elsenor Castle is I found out how much they cost in the in Britain around a similar time-ish so

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:33.280
 Henry VIII has his privy purse so you can see everything that he spent his money on and at one

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:39.680
 stage to James Hobart for bringing oranges and lemons to the king at Hartford he paid 20 shillings

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:46.720
 now I don't know how many oranges and all lemons the were but he went to Hartford Castle as

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:51.520
 almost a bit like a holiday home kind of things so he wouldn't have been there for the whole time so

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:55.440
 it would have been for a shortage amount of time he would have been eating these oranges and lemons

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:01.680
 so maybe not so many of them and other things that were worth 20 shillings around the same time so I

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:09.360
 could work out what 20 shillings was to Arthur the looter for a loot for the Duke of Richmond so if

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.160
 you wanted to buy a loot the musical instruments yeah not the magazine for buying used cars

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.880
 then that was 20 shillings what a very useful point of comparison for all of us because my loots

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.840
 I know how much they cost me yeah so that was very helpful yeah wanted to buy a citron in loot

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:33.200
 very good that's that's the joke I think that Charles Babbage would have hated most of all

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:41.440
 in this whole show um he paid Anthony Ansley 20 shillings for playing him three days at tennis

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:49.440
 wow and 20 shillings would but also buy him a brace of greyhounds and a wig for his fool

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:55.920
 so these are all the equivalent of getting a certain amount of oranges and lemons is about the same

00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:01.520
 close quantity yeah sounds like they were cheaper we can broadly say they were cheaper it feels

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.600
 like they were cheaper here than they were seven years ago and that was earlier so I should say

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:11.520
 where the fact is from which is from the guide to Cronborg Castle and Cronborg is the castle that

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:18.560
 was fictionalized as Elsinore in in Hamlet so we went to Copenhagen last year and I bought the guide book

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:27.200
 and then I waited seven months to read it in the middle of the 17th century 51% of Dutch paintings

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:34.080
 contained a lemon really yeah sorry in the middle of which century 17th wow that was a big one for

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.960
 Dutch painting as well wasn't it the biggest yeah it was weird because lemons I would have thought

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:43.360
 a very easy to draw and if I were a Renaissance great I would challenge myself with something more

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:47.360
 like a pineapple well the one of lemons they just contained lemon somewhere in them it wasn't

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.280
 it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't like a paint the fruit contest I don't know how familiar you are

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:56.480
 with Dutch masters but they tend not to just be of one lemon the big lemon and the big apple one

00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:01.440
 next to it and the bananas the crowning glory yeah but I think they were a state they're a big

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:05.360
 status symbol and they were in fact they were ornamental mostly you wouldn't you would need them

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:10.320
 yeah because they were so hard to get and if you did eat them you initially would eat them with the

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:16.720
 skin on apparently and say they're oranges yeah well then actually I was reading a little cooking

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.920
 blog in the garden by the chef Tom Hunt and he actually said that if you eat like he said good lemons

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:27.360
 and nobily a juice filled and should be eaten whole like apples rind flesh the lot so I'm going

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:32.320
 to try that next time cool yeah but I mean most lemons are waxed aren't they yeah so you were

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:36.000
 wondering the waxed ones that's why you've got to go organic yeah you don't want that wax but you

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.040
 could boil off the wax I suppose yeah you could do that yeah culinary tips from fish

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.520
 haven't putate a wedge in a body

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:55.600
 our rest are the citrus fruits have gone mad in the last few hundred years they haven't they

00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:01.040
 they've really multiplied oh okay given that they did start with these three types of citrus so

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:07.360
 citrons pomellos and mandarins were the official grandfather's of all the citrus fruits we have today

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:12.320
 and now I think I was reading that the I don't know why this is the authority but the University of

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:19.360
 California's California Riverside selected list of citrus varieties lists one thousand two hundred

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:25.520
 and that's the edited list and they are they're all hybrids so grapefruit is part lemon

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:32.160
 it's hybrid of lemon and a bitter orange and yeah as you said lime is the citron and a mandarin orange

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:37.760
 but grapefruit is a quite relatively new I think and they were accidentally made from this hybrid

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:42.720
 mandarin's which I think it was quite ubiquitous now didn't reach us until the 19th century

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:49.280
 didn't have any mandarin's yeah what about saints breeze easy pealers are they they were the original

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:59.440
 they're in the garden of Eden learning in the early 20th century there was a phrase in America

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:05.520
 that you would be handed the lemon do you know what that is what it might be is that if someone

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.160
 handed you a lemon that's not like a bad car you know where you say a bad car is a lemon no I see

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:16.480
 what you mean but no not that and that's not a that's not a make lemonade the first just the set up

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:24.080
 okay okay is it testicular no and actually I don't think you could guess this it was it meant that

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:29.040
 you were splitting up with your partner okay so you would say I'm handing you a lemon and that

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:35.920
 means that we're going to go our separate ways and you would used to get like cards or you know

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.000
 where it said I'm handing you a lemon and it would be like a dear John letter that you would give

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.200
 them and it comes from basically it's because they're the opposite of sweet so like you would have

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:50.240
 a sweet fruit and this is a sour fruit and there was a song called a lemon in the garden of love

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:55.600
 by the Broadway composer Richard Carl which had this idea and then it became really popular

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:00.720
 and then in 1907 there was a letter in the Boston herald from a fruit dealer who was complaining

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:06.400
 about this I'm saying I'm trying to sell my lemons and yeah it just means that you're splitting up

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.080
 with someone that's not really fair is it just all his customers going we're not even in a

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:15.600
 relationship I don't know why you think you've got the authority to dump me who said why not an

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:23.680
 overripe cucumber or a frozen tomato instead of having to laugh is this someone an overripe cucumber

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.520
 could be a good way of it's not why we get the phrase I'm standing around like a lemon because

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:33.840
 I say that sometimes no you do it a lot but because there is there is the flood as a phrase isn't

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:37.680
 I haven't made that yes I've been left around here like a lemon for half an hour I think it just

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:42.800
 probably comes to the fact that lemons are the longest lasting thing right no you don't say I'm standing

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.320
 around like a lemon because lemons don't go off quickly no but it might be the lasting in the fruit

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:53.680
 pool so it's sitting there alone I agree I think what Andy's saying is if you've been split up

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:58.080
 with then you're alone yes if you're standing like a lemon then you're lonely exactly so they're

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:02.480
 kind of similar yeah I can see how one word of I really do think that other is right okay well

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:08.640
 whatever whatever guys oh there is a related fact about lemons and personality which is that the

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:14.320
 amount of saliva that you produce after tasting a lemon can tell you whether someone is an introvert

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:20.000
 or an extrovert come on really this is something called the reticular activating system and it's a

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.960
 bit of the brain that responds to some stimuli and food and also to some social stimuli and it

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:31.280
 controls the amount of saliva you produce we haven't judged the cause and effect here have we

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:34.800
 because maybe they're introverted and anti social because every time they meet anyone they start

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:42.320
 tripling that's possible but scientists that's why they say you know when you're stood on your own

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:46.080
 in the middle of the room they say it's like you're 11 and that's because you're tripling on

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:52.160
 yourself and no one will step near you because that is a phrase isn't it yeah yeah yeah it's basically

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.800
 this system reacts to social contact so introverts react very strongly to meeting people it gives

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:04.000
 you know it's kind of more of a reaction and so does lemon so if you think someone might be an

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.240
 introvert just give them a bit of lemon slip them a lemon and then ask how much that's elevating

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:13.840
 yeah yeah yeah do you know that lemon juice kills sperm so is that actually an effective contraceptive

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:20.560
 okay you know that phrase it's where you're like sadly like a lemon in a room do you think that

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:26.480
 comes true the fact that how you get like a load of sperm in a bowl yeah and you put a lemon inside

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.200
 it and only one of them survives yeah because that is a phrase isn't it it's definitely a phrase yeah

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:35.840
 god there's only one flaw with that and I think it's that um I think all the sperm would be killed

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:41.200
 so I think maybe you've got one sperm out of the bowl and 11's missed it and he's on his own yeah

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.280
 but it definitely could be his cat and overused it apparently and the idea is that you put it inside

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:54.400
 the female of our species um it was forget what they're called he knew it was half a lemon he's

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:58.960
 supposedly used as a Dutch cap but that makes more sense yes because if you put the full lemon in

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:05.360
 the juice is not going to get out of that I actually think even half a lemon is quite quite an

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:09.840
 ask me too I couldn't quite work out because then if you put the whole thing in isn't I just

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:14.160
 effectively a condom rather than just using the lemon juice which depends which way up it goes

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:21.360
 yeah no it's a cup I guess yeah over the balance yeah yeah yeah no but so that's inside the

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:31.040
 cup inside the the female of the species yeah yeah so sort of a catching it's a catcher's mitt

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:38.160
 I guess is the yeah by the way sperm in a bowl definitely the worst dish on our

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:53.360
 I think Michelin style is a coming out way okay that's it that is all of our facts thank you so much
